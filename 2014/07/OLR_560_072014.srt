00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, Microsoft has been experiencing ups and downs with the ups of Xbox One sales and the downs of layoffs. What's in store next for the one?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Also, the Playroom is set to be expanded with more tools for indie broadcasters. Could you soon see us on PlayStation 4? Find out on another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live on this July the 20th, 2014 with the 560th episode of our program.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We are back after a week off. We were gone last week, but we're back all again to do another program for you fine folks listening to us on our podcast feed over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're available on iTunes or Stitcher or who knows where. Tune in, all these different programs.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And also, of course, live. We do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, VOG Network.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In studio here, my name is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts. Welcome back, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, yeah. Here we go again, right?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're wearing an adorable shirt tonight, by the way.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I am.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're wearing a Mega Man shirt.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Rock-a-mon.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And I was commenting when you walked in here, I said, oh, Alan owns that same shirt. And yes, he bought it out of the woman's section. It's a t-shirt.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Who cares if it's guys or girls, right?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, but it's very-

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
F your gender norms in t-shirts, especially.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's really hard to see in this light, but this particular color of blue makes my eyes look extra blue because I have weird colored blue hazel eyes. And so my eyes change color with what I wear.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I will point out, though, that Rock Man or Mega Man or whatever you want to call him is kind of doing that pose where he has his fist up like that. And on Alan, it doesn't really have much of an effect. But on you, it kind of looks like he's grabbing your boob.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Would you let Mega Man grab your boob?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All right.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's just the power that he's absorbed into his, you know, his buster.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry. No man is allowed to grab my boob without consent. Be he fictional or real.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fair enough. Fair enough. And I must acknowledge-

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What about Garrus?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What about Garrus? That's a good one. Thank you, Tech Master Loki, by the way, also here in studio. What about Garrus?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I think Dan wouldn't mind.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Garrus may have your consent. All right, that's fair.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You know how everyone has the pass list or something? Then, yeah, maybe.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And going to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com because, again, we do tape live on Sunday nights, Rama says, the difference really is in the cut of the shirt.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, I know. I know. Which sadly probably makes it a little more uncomfortable for a girl to get in a guy's shirt. But not really. You just buy it. Like, you wear dance shirts and stuff, right?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Not really.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Really?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I did when we first got together because I was still in extra baggy everything mode because it was early 2000. And now, like, that Borderlands shirt that I won at GamerX that I got for playing Borderlands, the pre-sequel.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When I get a sewing machine, I'm just going to girl cut it and leave it as a tunic.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh. Well, that works.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I guess I'm just really spoiled being gay because one of the biggest perks is that Alan and I can, like, totally share all our shirts because we're, like, similar sizes and everything.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, I mean, I've before worn some of Dan's old t-shirts and I made my smock for oil painting class out of one of Dan's old shirts.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I had this big dog shirt that had a dog with no butthole on the back of it that I was wearing. And I made a full on smock out of Dan's t-shirt. Now it's covered in oil paint.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I do want to talk about GamerX with you, but I do want to, of course, say a few more words with Techmaster Loki, who sadly could not attend GamerX this last week.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's all right. I was pretty sick on Sunday anyways.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, I still went to San Francisco.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What kind of sick universe is that where we go to the con and you get sick?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, it's because I have children and children get sick. And so apparently I caught my baby's virus and then I got it.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So basically I was running a fever in the day. And so and I was tired because I kept waking up every half an hour because of the baby.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So then I drove three hours to San Francisco. So the combination of having a fever, walking around, driving three hours, no sleep, just not fun.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then it was crowded at Pier 39. And it's just like, I don't want to be I don't even want to fucking be here.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's always crowded at Pier 39.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I know where you get the doughnuts.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
My wife was going to get the doughnuts and she said it looked overrated.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So they are not overrated. They're amazing.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, all I got was because I wasn't even that hungry because I said I felt like shit.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I got ice cream there, of course, you know.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I got ice cream and then we went like my wife's sister's like boyfriend walked us all the way down to like this fish place.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't even know where the hell it was. I was like, I'm like, there's fish here. Why are we walking three blocks everywhere?

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm like, why are we walking way the hell down here for this fucking thing?

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And so we got like some I got fish and chips from there.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And sadly, I couldn't enjoy it as much, you know, because like I said, I felt like crap.

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Did you see where, you know, years and years ago, Orange Ons Radio, we did a live broadcast from Pier 39 of a DDR tournament.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is this is back when OLR was a station, not just a show as in the live five days.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This would have been like probably about the third year of our existence.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Probably would have been like 2004, 2005. We actually did a live broadcast from Pier 39 at a place that is now a sports bar.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Just did you see that an arcade there?

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Some it's one of those like arcades with my quotey fingers, meaning it has a crane game, a deer hunting game, one racing cabinet, a street fighter machine with monitors.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We didn't go that far down there. We probably went just just a little bit.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And we really were just trying to go to the aquarium. We did that.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it was really short. And then afterwards, you were just like, we want to go home because there is a baseball game going on.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We're just like, oh, no, we're not going to fight this traffic. We're just going to get out of here.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Jamie and I actually cut out of GamerX a little early just because we were so exhausted.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And, you know, I think she had to get home. And, you know, we just I slept the entire way back.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You really did. And then went home and slept. Yeah, it was a sleep emergency.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then I woke up and slept some more.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But yeah, so we didn't we weren't even really in town at all. Hardly on Sunday.

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah. Next time, I think we're not going to Pier 39, obviously, because that's overrated.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But I think we'll just go to Central Park or not Central Park.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, I keep thinking our New York listeners to be very happy if you want to say if I went to.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, if I went in here to go to Central Park now that we go to the parks, the park called their Golden Gate Park Gate Park.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, whatever. OK, so Golden Gate Gardens are really cute.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, I don't think so. Golden Gate Park and we probably go to the beach, you know, because Josh has never seen the ocean.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But so that's what we'll do next time. We're not even going to mess with, you know, that part of town.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I wanted to go to the Exploratorium. If I had the energy and I didn't feel like crap, I would have moved it.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's Pier 15. Yeah, it's Pier 15.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, that was the other thing, too, is like we wanted to go home because the baby, you know, Danny was in his car seat like all day.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like he's just miserable because I think it's so hot. Sure. Sure. Just like, you know, he was tired.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let me let me shift gears here a little bit because, you know, it is a video game show.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So when I ask you about something else that has to do with gaming on Twitter this week, you've been blowing it up with codes for Destiny.

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I can't imagine anybody that didn't want to get into that.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
At least it's following you on Twitter that wanted to be in the Destiny beta hasn't gotten in there one way or another.

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean, this beta seems about as open as Gmail when it was in its beta for its fourth or fifth year.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We're like literally. Well, yeah. And every code they give you, they give you three codes. Yeah.

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But yet you had all these codes. But we were talking before the show and you haven't yet to be able to play the beta yourself.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, I didn't get a chance to. I installed it. That's about as far as it went.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And now that you're telling me that it's done today, I guess. Well, it's done on PlayStation today.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And it'll be back on Wednesday for all systems through, I think, Sunday.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And they're doing a huge stress test on the 26th.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And that is the day where if you log in after 2 p.m., you get something.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Because they're like perfectly trying to stress test it. So they're trying to give incentive for people to log in.

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So if you log in after like 2 p.m., you get some item or badge or some special person item that you get to use in the main game.

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But it surprised me because I'm usually not the shooter game fan. You are with the Call of Duty stuff and everything.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I hit max level in Destiny today.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It looked fun. It looked fun. I was pretty tired today and I didn't even get a chance to...

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn't really have a lot of free time to play anything. I thought about it before I came here.

113
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm like, I could play this for like an hour. But I'm like, I don't really have time right now.

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't really want to do that. I gotta get out of the house.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was surprised. You can piecemeal it pretty good. Meaning like if you only have like little 10 and 15 minute bursts to play,

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you can play like one little story chapter in about probably not even 15 minutes.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So at least the early ones you can.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well if it's going to be back next week for also PlayStation, then I may do that.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So I was thinking it was only on 360.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No, no. Everybody.

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Or 360 and Xbox One. But yeah, I'll probably give it a shot next week then.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Excellent. I want a full report next week. Alright.

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll talk about my own experiences in the Destiny Beta a little later when we get into How Was Your Gaming Week,

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
as I'm sure many of you have been trying it out.

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And I want to hear all your opinions in our chat room and on email and all that good stuff.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But first, let me talk to DarkSakura about the trip because I said we would come back to this topic.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's talk a little bit about GamerX. You didn't get to go the first year, unfortunately.

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So what were your thoughts on GamerX going for the first time?

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sadly, if we're hearing is true, there will not be a GamerX in the future.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Not under the same name.

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, I kind of hope that's what they do with it.

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If they want to reinvent it to be a con that has a more general name so that it doesn't feel like it's only for ga-

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I mean, I said this before. There's a lot of people out there that wonder,

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
well, why would I go to GamerX? I'm not gay.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I'm like, you don't get it. It's not about that.

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I think if they have to kind of change the name to get that message across,

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
if they go with like an Everybody Games con or whatever direction it is they're going in, I get that.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I think that would be a good thing for the con.

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But anyway, your thoughts on your first and maybe last year?

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Keep in mind, I've been to a number of different conventions of various size.

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is probably the smallest one I've been to, including Mobicon in Mobile, Alabama.

142
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Including the Sacramento ones?

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The Sacramento ones have gotten really big.

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, SacAnime is like really big now.

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah. Anyway.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But that being said, it was, I'd have to say, pretty well handled for its size.

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think that, you know, it was probably one of the more positive con experiences I've had.

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Although it was, by my esteem, really casual. Really casual.

149
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But I had a really good time.

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And for me, I'm not very good around a whole lot of people.

151
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I usually just sort of migrate on my own and go through places.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But it was nice running into people I hadn't seen in a while.

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Actually, two of my good friends were there on, I ran into both of them after a cosplay contest.

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I spent most of Friday with my friend Brian. Hello, Brian.

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Did you run into Explicit at the con?

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I didn't. I did. He used to come to the show all the time.

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He just had other things to do about five years ago. He hasn't been on in forever.

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I ran into him at the con, and it's probably the first time in like five years.

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He sets up with a little team. Him and his team set up the gaming rooms at conventions.

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like here in Sac, and now in the Bay Area, and all these other places.

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So they're going to come on the show, and he's going to be back in like a month or so.

162
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Right before SacAnime. I told him we were going to get him to come on.

163
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, right?

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I just see him on Facebook all the time.

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, him and his posse are going to come on and talk about like setting up arcade rooms at cons.

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So, it'll be fun. But anyway, sorry, I just thought I'd throw that out there.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Speaking of like people I haven't seen in forever.

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, now, going, I thought that the games rooms were maybe a little small.

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And I'm not meaning that there weren't a lot going on.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There was too much going on for the size of the rooms that the games were in.

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think it probably could have benefited by some bigger meeting rooms.

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
However, they were, after seeing them set up for changing the ballroom in between different panels,

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
going to the full size from having the mini rooms, I thought that their management of it was very well done.

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They were very efficient.

175
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The going in and talking to the convention staff, everybody was friendly, everyone was really helpful.

176
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I really didn't run into, like I said, I didn't run into anybody really negative as far as the con goers either.

177
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think it probably could have benefited from having a little bit more going on.

178
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But other than that, it was really fun, really casual.

179
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Now, you actually did cosplay and you entered the, I don't want to say mannequin, the masquerade, right?

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You were actually in that?

181
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, there's a difference between a cosplay contest and a masquerade.

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, sorry.

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I put a hat on and somebody mistook that for me doing Joker cosplay and that's about the most cosplay I've done.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Besides the time that Rama had me wear his Black Mage outfit, I guess that was the most cosplay I ever did.

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, I was the only Homestuck cosplayer, which surprised the crap out of me.

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because usually it's like if you get a convention, you have a small infestation of Homestucks.

187
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
However, I did run into a guy wearing a car cat t-shirt.

188
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, more like the cancer t-shirt, but only in the right blood color.

189
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And a very, very pink cape.

190
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And he gave me a huge hug and then pulled me aside to watch Homestuck fan animations.

191
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I wish I still had his name. I feel really stupid, but he was a really great guy.

192
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Shout out if you're out there listening.

193
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I totally would have worn my dusty old Sackboy costume if I had went.

194
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh my gosh.

195
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's still in my garage.

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You would have totally won something.

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Although the cosplayers, the Maleficent, so beautiful.

198
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We had a drag Maleficent. So nice.

199
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Honestly, what I really loved about the cosplay contest is that no matter if the cosplay was really intricate,

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
like that Roy in the Mario Kart, in a cart.

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, the Roy Koopa was...

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That was phenomenal. The Drow Queen. She was amazing.

203
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And she's so sweet. We chatted before the thing.

204
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And whether it be something way up on that level or something where it was more conceptual.

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Who was the lady that came out that was like the PMS Avenger or something like that?

206
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, no. Hot Flash.

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay, I was at the Hot Flash.

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
From her own webcomic.

209
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I knew it was some type of...

210
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's a good way to promote your work though.

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Right? Yeah. But no matter where they were at,

212
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I mean, no matter if the cosplay was very intricate or very conceptual, whatever,

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
everybody was really positive.

214
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And it's not to say that other cosplay contests aren't like that.

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's not what I'm saying.

216
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But I didn't even feel like people were snickering or chatting.

217
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
People were just really excited to see all this diversity.

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I'm not just saying that in terms of GLBTQ, YA, all that stuff.

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm talking about diversity in what they were seeing on stage.

220
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah. And on top of that too, I ran into a trio of Dragon Age cosplayers.

221
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
One of which I'm now Tumblr buddies with.

222
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Nice.

223
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And they were all so sweet and positive.

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We sat and talked shop about cosplay for a little bit and talked about Dragon Age.

225
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And they were as nice as they could be. They were great.

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Some of the first people I met at the convention.

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But you saw people who really put a lot of effort into their passion.

228
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And it was really cool.

229
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It was a lot of...

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There was no judgment on anybody.

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And I'll tell you this, I mean, while I was the only Homestuck cosplayer,

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
it was pretty nice having a couple of people actually recognize the character

233
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and get pictures here and there.

234
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because I was like, oh, that's fun.

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And even though if I went around half high from huffing E6000,

236
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it was really cool just sitting down and getting a chance to hang out.

237
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because it was so much more casual.

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I got to really discuss the types of things that I usually only get on forums.

239
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll just say quickly, and Rama in our chat room says,

240
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I assume there's pictures for us to see, right?

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There's a video coming and it's very, very well done by our pal Eddie

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
at Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

243
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't think Dark Soccer's cosplay is in the video, sadly, but...

244
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There's a really awful picture of me that someone took.

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll just post my selfie because my selfie went okay.

246
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There you go.

247
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But it was funny even though my prop wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The sphere turned out epic.

249
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And so I had people wanting me to poke them with my giant Skaia fork.

250
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I said, well, I have to have your consent.

251
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Because one of the rules of peace binding is that you couldn't poke someone

252
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
without their consent.

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So I just walked around, hey, can I poke you?

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Nice.

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Which was really funny.

256
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I was actually really grateful to have Brian around for some of that

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
because I was having to manage my stuff and my costume

258
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and the giant red fork of death.

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Akdeft in our chat room says,

260
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Sky and Dark Soccer, confirm or deny,

261
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
was GamerX the best smelling con you've ever been to?

262
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There was no confunk.

263
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Seriously.

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay, there was an occasional whiff of Axe douchebag spray.

265
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But other than that, you know, not really.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hey, now I have smashed douchebag spray in the back.

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I use it sparingly.

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Well, I bought Dan Axe deodorant because it only smells minorly of douchebag.

269
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I do go around buying my husband's deodorant and smelling it

270
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
to determine what I want my husband to smell like.

271
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's fair. That's fair.

272
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Anyway, I want to say a couple of things about the con too

273
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
because I was really proud.

274
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think I was really proud of GamerX 2

275
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and how it's really grown since the first one.

276
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And, you know, I was asked this on Twitter this week,

277
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and that is, like, what most surprised you about GamerX 2?

278
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And to be honest, although this sounds really weird,

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
my honest answer was that there was more gaming content at GamerX 2.

280
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Weird.

281
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And, like, I know that sounds like a really weird answer,

282
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
but, like, the first year really felt like

283
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
we are like-minded people getting together to throw a party.

284
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And that was still continuing this year.

285
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Like, we are still, like, all these inclusive like-minded people

286
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
trying to get together to throw a party.

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But now it's like, and now some companies are taking notice

288
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and actually wanting to be a part of that too.

289
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The gearbox panel is really awesome.

290
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And props to 2K, you know.

291
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And they did a great job showing Borderlands the pre-sequel,

292
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
which is the first...

293
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's so fun.

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
...which is the first time they've shown that in playable form.

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They had a wrestling game there too.

296
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I totally don't know shit about wrestling.

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
WWE 2K.

298
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Is that it? All right, thank you. Sorry.

299
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Look, I can't follow everything.

300
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And the wrestler guy was there, Darren Young.

301
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Darren Young was there, yeah.

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He was, like, their big guest this year.

303
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And then, you know what, Ubisoft,

304
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
despite all the crap they got for the Assassin's Creed thing,

305
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and, you know, rightfully so, and the cosplayers even,

306
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you've all seen this by now,

307
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
the ladies wearing the boxes that said,

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
too hard to render.

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, that was great.

310
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
They were actually walking past the window

311
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
when Alan and I were waiting for you.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, how funny.

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah.

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They're in the video Eddie took too.

315
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Ubisoft seemed to, you know, take their licks in good stride,

316
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and they actually had, like, a Celebrate Diversity poster

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
with the Rayman Rabbids.

318
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry, not the Rayman Rabbids.

319
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The Raving Rabbids in all the, like, different colors.

320
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And they were, you know, doing giveaways and stuff too.

321
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And indie games.

322
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Can we talk about the indie games?

323
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That rabbit butchering game was great.

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The game, the perfect woman game,

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
did you play the Connect one?

326
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I saw it, and I just watched people play it.

327
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I wasn't going to play it.

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It was really well done.

329
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's one of the, you play, you play, like,

330
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
a woman who's going through these different struggles,

331
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but it's one of those things where it's, like,

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
you're kind of laughing at how absurd it is,

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
but then when you really take a step back and look at it,

334
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
you're like, this kind of is sad.

335
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This isn't funny.

336
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This is sad.

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Because, like, you start and, like,

338
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
you'll do a stage where it's like you're age seven,

339
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and you are doing child labor in a factory

340
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and making Walmart shirts or something like that.

341
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And you have to, you move your arms in different poses

342
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and things, and the better you do,

343
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
you know, the better you go on.

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And then it's like, at one point, I swear to God,

345
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
there's a stage where it's like,

346
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you're 60 years old and you've become a whore.

347
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Like, and you do all these, like, sexual positions

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
as this old grandma.

349
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,

350
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
this is, like, I'm laughing at how absurd it is,

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but then I'm like, this is not funny.

352
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So then you kind of see the, you know,

353
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the progress you make and so forth.

354
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And that was, if there is an outside the box type of game

355
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
or even, like, a best of show, that game was it.

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I love that game.

357
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And then there were other really neat games, too.

358
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The rabbit game, though, was great.

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Where you play, it's sort of like Smash Brothers meets Mappy.

360
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Uh-huh.

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It was the big four player game where you play

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
as little pixelated rabbits.

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I thought you were the one that told me about that,

364
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
or maybe it was Brian that told me about it.

365
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The duck game is the one I played.

366
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Duck, that was what I was thinking.

367
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, yeah, duck game.

368
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay, get this.

369
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Okay, I want the duck game.

370
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Get this.

371
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That was on Ouya.

372
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They had an Ouya room,

373
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and they were showing some different Ouya games,

374
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and I kind of walked out of there going,

375
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
you know, I know Loki really bags on the Ouya,

376
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
but I liked a lot of the stuff I was seeing.

377
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I kind of walked out of there going,

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I might want to get an Ouya.

379
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And don't forget about don't play Jenga on the ice.

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's later.

381
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But, yeah, they had the duck game.

382
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
They had, of course, read-only memories

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
is something that, you know, the company behind GamerX

384
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
is trying to promote because that's their game as well.

385
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They had another like music hybrid game

386
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
that I didn't really get to play a lot of.

387
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I heard more about it in one of the panels.

388
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But that was, you know, neat looking.

389
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So, yeah, it was like kind of the duck game especially.

390
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It was really fun.

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So I was looking forward to getting an Ouya possibly to try that.

392
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And, you know, again, more indie games,

393
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
very well represented, very happy about that.

394
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What was I going to say?

395
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, yeah, so it was great to hang out with the other podcasters, of course.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That part was really cool.

397
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Just it's like being at home and being at family.

398
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's like going to that family reunion every year.

399
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's what GamerX felt like.

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Did you get a better turnout for the cross zone panel this year?

401
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, actually.

402
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, last year.

403
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I missed the full room.

404
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Last year wasn't bad.

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This year was probably like three quarters full of the room.

406
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So it was pretty good because it was a bigger room than last year.

407
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So it was nice.

408
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah, it's all on video.

409
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So that'll be out there at some point.

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And, yeah, it was a great panel.

411
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Had a really good time.

412
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Dark Sakura was on the panel.

413
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Anything you want to summarize about it real quick?

414
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It felt like a really positive experience

415
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
although like the one photo I saw of you is really derpy.

416
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I was in mid-explanation like bleh.

417
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We went to a private celebration party Saturday night

418
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and that is where the Jenga-thon continued.

419
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't know how it started,

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
but all us little podcast sisters were playing Jenga like hardcore.

421
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And I don't mean like just lighthearted fun Jenga.

422
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm talking like this is serious business here with Jenga.

423
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And then also in the board game room somebody had brought Don't Break the Ice.

424
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So somewhere it changed from Jenga to playing Don't Break the Ice.

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Meanwhile the other group of us was playing Cards Against Humanity.

426
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yes, yes.

427
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Which wasn't it, I think it was Eddie's first time playing it.

428
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh yeah.

429
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So that was pretty, I love when you get Cards Against Humanity virgins.

430
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And they did give out new decks at GamerX.

431
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I didn't get anything.

432
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They were hidden.

433
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Do you know how they had the big candy bowls out that had candy in them?

434
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The decks were underneath the candy.

436
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So if you went into the bowl to pick the candy there were decks in there.

437
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh God.

438
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So yeah, somebody like Grandpa or somebody got Reject decks.

439
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But I don't think it's unique to GamerX.

440
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I think they've been at other cons too.

441
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But the Reject decks were there.

442
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That was pretty cool.

443
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I did get some League of Legends skins.

444
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Which, since I'm going to start playing it, it was kind of an incentive to start playing it again.

445
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There you go.

446
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah, the cosplayers actually got some goodies.

447
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
If you were cosplaying you had access to the Cospetality Lounge.

448
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And they were giving out, because League of Legends was also a sponsor of the convention,

449
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
they had two different skin cards.

450
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And then you got a pin that has a mask on it.

451
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You know, the old style Harlequin masks.

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh nice.

453
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That said Cosplay 2014.

454
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
A nice, legit pin.

455
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So it was really, really nice.

456
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That's really cool.

457
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And that's a lot of the craftspeople too.

458
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
We just, you know, basically just hung out shooting the shit about art.

459
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
About, you know, commissions and laws and that type of thing.

460
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And the one lady was like, oh yeah, I totally recycled Disney pins into stopwatches.

461
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So it was actually really cool.

462
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I was really admiring her work.

463
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I was really happy for that gal that won the audience favorite.

464
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Because she said it was her first time ever doing cosplay.

465
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Right?

466
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The loth.

467
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Like, she was legit, like, choking on stage and starting to cry.

468
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And I got a little verklempt sitting in the audience.

469
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Because she was an older lady, right?

470
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
She was like late 40s or something, she said?

471
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
A little older than me, yeah.

472
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But she and I were talking before the costume contest,

473
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and we were actually talking about making teeth.

474
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Because her fangs were fitting her a little bit badly.

475
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And we were just talking about, you know, making your own teeth

476
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
versus ordering acrylic teeth versus having them made.

477
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And so that was the other thing, too.

478
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I love just hanging out when you're in a casual.

479
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And it was a contest, but there was no competition, if you know what I mean.

480
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
There were no real major egos involved.

481
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Everyone was hanging out, having a good time.

482
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I ran into a good Cecil cosplayer for Welcome to the Night Vale.

483
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And he and I hung out after the OLR panel.

484
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
He was in there.

485
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

486
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And we were just hanging out there chatting, and then we chatted before the thing.

487
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And I hung out with a couple of Assassin's Creed cosplayers,

488
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and my friend Caitlin, who I met through school.

489
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
She was cosplaying Link, the one with the good chain mail.

490
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Nice.

491
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And so she's just running into people I hadn't seen in a while.

492
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We could talk on and on and on about the con.

493
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I do want to get to this week in gaming.

494
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But real quick, just one other question.

495
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If they do do something next year, I mean, obviously it won't be Gamer X3.

496
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You said doo-doo.

497
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh, stop.

498
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
If they do decide to do a con next year under another name, will you go?

499
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Sure.

500
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, me too. Absolutely.

501
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm really rooting for those guys.

502
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I hope they broke even, at least if not made a tiny profit.

503
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And I hope they can pull it out for next year.

504
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I just think that it needs to be somewhere other than in the city.

505
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I think they might want to look at to save on expense.

506
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I know they really, really want to keep it in the city, and I know what that means.

507
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But maybe move it out towards SFO?

508
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
See, I honestly, honestly think that maybe in the same place that YowieCon's been a few years,

509
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
because that was a really, really good con site.

510
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's a little hard when you have to travel between multiple floors to get to your panels and your rooms.

511
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That was really the biggest complaint I had.

512
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Don't count San Jose out either. San Jose is a great town.

513
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm not saying San Jose out, but I'm saying be close enough to the city, but not be limited by being in the city.

514
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Because that was one of the hotels outside Barlingame.

515
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Great location, good view of the bay, everything was nice.

516
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But the big thing is that I think it really needs to be opened up to younger people and not be 18 and up.

517
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
While it was fine to have it not be so completely overrun,

518
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I think that having it open to younger people is definitely going to give more encouragement to people who are struggling.

519
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I've been hearing that feedback a lot, so good, good.

520
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Alright, well, let's move on. More on GamerX to come to vognetwork.com.

521
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We have that video, the VOG vlog will be coming soon, and some interviews I did there will be coming soon as well.

522
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So, excited about that.

523
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks. On to the video games and the types of games that we have been playing this week.

524
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with how was your gaming week?

525
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I played Final Fantasy XIV a little bit, finished up more quests that I still had open.

526
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Back into Bravely Default a little bit, I've just been really slacking off on playing.

527
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And I actually downloaded Bejeweled 3 on Steam, just because I have this weird stupid addiction to puzzle games like that.

528
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And I think I played Bejeweled 3 for like two hours one night when my brain was completely non-functional.

529
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It was, I don't even know why I did that.

530
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And then I have the Adventure Time game and finally decided to hook up my controller, so I'm going to be playing a little bit more of that.

531
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Other than that, I've, I don't know, I really haven't been doing much gaming this past week,

532
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
just because I was so tired after the convention. So, I don't know, what are you playing, Loki?

533
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I am playing nothing, because I've been working on my game.

534
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Because of baby plagues?

535
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No, because I'm working on my game and yeah, I'm mostly just not having time.

536
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I did download the Destiny beta, but didn't get a chance to actually play it, so hopefully when it launches back up again next Wednesday,

537
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'll get to actually try that a little bit. Maybe I'll take some time off to actually play some games.

538
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Just not really, I don't know, I didn't really want to get back into my Steam backlog right now, because it's so big.

539
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But I'll have to figure something out. That and Minecraft need to really do some updates on the Minecraft stuff,

540
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
just because it's poor and desolate right now.

541
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We need to weed.

542
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Well, I don't know, hopefully no one's gone in there and destroyed everything, because...

543
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
We had a whitelist server, so I doubt that's happened.

544
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah, so I don't know, I'm just trying to figure out a way to get more people to play.

545
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's almost like I kind of wish we would have joined another server that already had an established base there, but it's just...

546
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll play more this week.

547
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
We'll see, I don't know.

548
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If you set a day, we can try and all be on.

549
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I just have to update it again, and just get all the updates in place, and then kind of go through.

550
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I was going to update the arena, but I was developing weapons and stuff in there, and I just didn't get a chance.

551
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I kind of got distracted, so we'll see.

552
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I forgot, because we weren't here last week as well, to the other games that I played.

553
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Other than the indie games there, there was Borderlands, the pre-sequel.

554
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Isn't that what it was called?

555
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah.

556
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That was fun.

557
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I suck playing it on a controller, because I've been playing it on PC, but it was really, really super fun.

558
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I really wanted to ask them about the fact that most of the characters are robots, so the fact that running out of air wouldn't really affect them...

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It'd only be, I think, if you were playing Claptrap.

560
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, Claptrap... Oh, that's right. The other guy that became a robot, he's actually human, but yeah.

561
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But yeah, the other three playables were human.

562
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I was very happy, because my favorite character in Borderlands 2 is asexual.

563
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Maya.

564
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Oh.

565
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The siren.

566
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Interesting.

567
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I didn't know that they...

568
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That's why they came out on one of the panels, didn't it?

569
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I asked the question. They gave me the answer.

570
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Interesting.

571
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So, yes.

572
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Official.

573
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
There it is. Official.

574
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Alright, my gaming week, then. I will talk a little bit about what I've been playing this week.

575
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So, I mentioned the Destiny beta earlier, and I've played it enough where I've hit max level, which isn't...

576
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah, it's only level 8. It's not like I have to play a lot a lot, but it means I'm playing it enough where I enjoy it.

577
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So, here's what I actually kind of compared Destiny to, and I know a lot of you guys have been playing it, so I'm kind of curious what you guys think of this comparison.

578
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I kind of think Destiny is Halo, obviously, mixed with, you ready for it? Fantasy Star Online, I think is the best way to describe Destiny.

579
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And the reason why I say that is because obviously it has those kind of like MMO components where you pick up quests and things, which I think makes it really easy to compare it to World of Warcraft.

580
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But I actually think the way it's designed feels a little more like Fantasy Star Online, because you have that centralized hub that has all your shops where you get all the upgrades, and then you have the different places that you visit in that hub.

581
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But then you go out into the world, and you're going to the same zone over and over again.

582
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And it's not as repetitive as necessarily as it was in Fantasy Star Online, where it was like Forest, Forest 2, Forest 3.

583
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But you're certainly going to the old Russia map, and okay, this time you land here, and you're going into this building and exploring.

584
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Or this time you're going to go onto the other side of the map beyond this hill, and you're going on your mount, on your rocket over here, because you've got to go find some people over here.

585
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So it's like you're going to different portions of the map, and then eventually you open up an explore mode where it's just, okay, now you're on the map, and you do pretty much whatever you want.

586
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Kill whatever you want for experience, and if you see these beacons, you can pick up these quests and do that too.

587
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So in that way, and not only that, but you can put together your parties of one to three people to take on this content together.

588
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So in that regard, it felt a lot like PSO to me, because PSO, you can do it by yourself, or you can do it with other people, and that whole thing.

589
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I did try to do the PvP a little bit. There's a section of Destiny called the Crucible, which is essentially what you would be looking for in what the makers of Halo are going to do next.

590
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
There was a little capture the flag type game in the beta, where you basically hold three points.

591
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I am awful at it, which I expected, because I'm really bad at first person shooters. So in that regard, it kind of takes the fun out of it when you're playing against really, really good people, and it's like you just die, die, die.

592
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And even though I couldn't hear anybody, that's probably for the best, because I was probably getting called all sorts of names in the book, and it's just, you know.

593
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I did notice though, and to Destiny's credit, it seemed like after I had died for the fifth time, a little thing popped up and said stat boost.

594
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So I think it actually does start to take pity on you if it realizes you really, really suck, and it actually boosts your stats, which I'm thankful for that, because I need some boosted stats.

595
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But the cool thing is, I didn't even really have to touch that. I did that because I wanted to check it out so I could say something about it if I'm going to do a quote, quote review of the beta, although you really shouldn't review betas.

596
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But y'all, everybody's playing it, and y'all making impressions on the game from it anyway. I'm doing the same thing.

597
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And in a positive way, I think with this game, I don't know if I necessarily would have been like totally wanting to buy it day one, but now after this beta, I'm like, yeah, I'll buy it day one.

598
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Because there's enough single player and co-op material to make it really interesting.

599
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I did a dungeon, I'm using my quotey fingers, a dungeon, although they call it a strike team mission. It's all the tropes of a World of Warcraft dungeon where it's like you go in an instance and you get a few mobs and then you have these boss monsters that you kill and so forth.

600
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It doesn't seem like everybody plays a unique role yet, but I bet they will later, where like the warlock can do certain things, the titan can do certain things.

601
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But I ran one of those dungeons with Ian from Koopa Club, who's pretty good at Destiny and was helping me out and reviving me a lot, and that was actually a lot, a lot of fun.

602
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We had a random guy that joined the party too, who had to revive me like all the time, but we got through it without completely dying and having to start from the beginning, so I was really happy with that progress. I got a ton of XP from it too.

603
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetworld.com. Fifth Dream says, I ran around and died in Quake for many hours. I probably got two kills.

604
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Sjo100Matt says, Aren't there buffs in some MMOs that do the same thing? If you fail to raid a few times, you get a special buff?

605
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yes and no, Sjo100Matt. They do that for usually PvE content, but not PvP that I've seen. I'm sure some of the MMOs out there have it, but just not one that I can think of off the top of my head.

606
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Brad from Paw Culture agrees with my assessment. That's exactly what I thought, and that's like peanut butter and chocolate for me. Very good.

607
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:05,000
That sounds like, well, they do that for like, I know Call of Duty does that. They have death streaks where if you die, you know, five times or four times in a row without getting a kill, you get a perk.

608
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
There you go.

609
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's usually something really minor just to help you out a little bit.

610
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Alan Alchemy says, Unreal Tournament is the only competitive arena FPS where I still have a good time even when I got juiced to respawn every two seconds and sucked out loud. I'll probably have more fun with it when I play with friends.

611
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I think if I could do PvP with friends, it would be more fun. And to be fair, my buddy Justin tried to invite me to a game last night, but I wasn't a high enough level yet. So he tried to get me into PvP, but I couldn't do it.

612
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So, there's that. Yeah, I liked Destiny enough where I'm going to for sure buy the full game day one. I'm on board now. Like, I didn't think I'd like it that much because I suck at first person shooters, but I loved the Phantasy Star Online element of it.

613
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Made it so that if I wanted to play an easier level over and over to try and level up a little bit, like, I really like that.

614
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The one thing I am going to razz Destiny on is kind of the same thing a lot of people are picking on, but it really is a problem.

615
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The story and the voice acting are not at the same level as the rest of the game. And I am going to pick on the same thing a lot of people are picking on.

616
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The voice of Ghost in particular and Peter Dinklage's acting is not up to par with the rest of the game.

617
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And I know that sounds like a pretty shitty thing to say about a great actor, but the reality is some lines are laughably bad.

618
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Like when you're fighting a boss and the ghost suddenly pipes up and says,

619
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's coming through the wall! Like, it's just really awkward.

620
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Like, I'm just like, okay, turn him off. Shut him up. Can we change the ghost or whatever?

621
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't necessarily blame Peter Dinklage for that. I worry part of that is in the direction of the game.

622
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And maybe just that the ghost character is very bland.

623
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And if you think about it, we've had some really strong support characters with you in other games of a similar nature.

624
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Borderlands, right? Another which I didn't even invoke Borderlands necessarily with Destiny, but obviously a lot of similarities there too.

625
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But Claptrap, come on, awesome character, awesome support, right?

626
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Look at Portal, GLaDOS always taunting you.

627
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Or Wheatley.

628
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Or Wheatley, right? Great characters.

629
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You know, Ghost is not that, is nowhere near that same level. Ghost is bland.

630
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And that I think is one of the worst possible things you can do.

631
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Or even like, was it the Arbiter or whatever?

632
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
There's this random cutscene too that was just really uninteresting that I wanted to skip.

633
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So, again, it's a beta, so I'm not going to say this is the way the game is, period.

634
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I realize there's parts of the story I probably haven't seen, more layers of the onion to peel back and so forth.

635
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Well, isn't this something that they're talking about stretching out for like ten years or something?

636
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You know, like, Destiny?

637
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah, I don't know if it's through DLC or what that is, but I am a little concerned that Ghost may not be fixable at this point.

638
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The game will survive on its strong gameplay, but that is going to be a detraction from the game, unfortunately.

639
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It would be great if you can switch Ghost with a different Ghost at some point.

640
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It could seem like that's something you could do by looking at the inventory, but we'll see what happens with that later on.

641
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So, let's see.

642
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Fifth Dream says, well, he's a robot drone thing, so I get that maybe it's supposed to be the mood he's supposed to be,

643
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
but if he's a motionless drone, then he shouldn't also be going,

644
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's coming through the wall!

645
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Go for A or B, but not this weird, awkward point in between.

646
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Just make him completely Tyrion Lannister, that's all you need to do.

647
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Fuck this trying to act like a robot, just Lannister all the way.

648
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That would be perfect.

649
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Alan Alchemy says, a motionless robot without empathy isn't a very good mood to set in an action game.

650
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Maybe that's the direction he got.

651
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You're a robot, so you don't actually give a fuck about anything. Talk like that, perhaps.

652
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Brad from PodCulture says, everything is fixable, just a matter of how much work you want to do on it.

653
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And Fifth Dream says, I don't know, I liked Ghost, maybe I'm weird.

654
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I also hate Sailor Moon Crystal, so maybe I'm weird.

655
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Hey, it's the show where every gamer has a voice. Every weird gamer gets a voice in Fifth Dream.

656
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Alright, again, I don't want to harp on that too much, because that's one minor little blip on what otherwise is going to be a fantastic game.

657
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So, yeah, looking forward to that on, what is it, 9-9 that that's out?

658
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I know it's one of those dates that plays the numerology, so very cool.

659
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Otherwise, I've just been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV.

660
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I got my Scholar to level 50, woohoo, and we took down Good King Mooglemawg Extreme this week, so that was neat.

661
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:49,000
We tried to do some pulls on Ramu on Extreme mode, and wow, that was a clusterfuck, but I felt progress, so that was a good place to be.

662
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And also, I want to shout out this, because Alan finally linked his Steam library in mine, so I can play all the games he has that I don't.

663
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And one of those games I spent a little time with the other night was Pac-Man Championship Edition, or Championship Edition Deluxe, excuse me,

664
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
which I've played to death on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but come on, I had to play it on the PC as well,

665
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and it was weird seeing the little arrows by Pac-Man where you could actually see what direction you've punched in to go next.

666
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't remember that being in the other versions, but it actually kind of, especially when you're going slower speeds,

667
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
it enhances things a little bit, because it's like, oh, now I can see what direction I'm going in.

668
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
When you're at speed level 40 or 50, though, things are moving too fast, you can't even look at that arrow.

669
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
But yeah, a strong, fun game as it was before.

670
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Alright, that's it for our gaming weeks. Let's do some quick plugs. Housekeeping.

671
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
We will be here for the next several weeks. The next week we will not be here is Labor Day weekend.

672
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We will not be here Labor Day weekend, as I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.

673
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And being that it is Labor Day weekend, a lot of people here in the States have other plans and go off and do other things,

674
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
which would likely include Loki and Dark Soccer and many of you that are listening.

675
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So we will not be here Labor Day weekend. I think Dark Soccer, you said you're going to SAC Anime, right?

676
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I might.

677
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah, so you got that. So we will not be here Labor Day weekend.

678
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
If you are in the Atlanta area, or really anywhere within a 500 mile radius of Atlanta,

679
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I do hope you come to check out Dragon Con. Lots of VOG personalities will be there.

680
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't have the entire list memorized, but I know at least myself, Travis from Understation Live,

681
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Bobby from Bobby Black Wolf, I'm pretty sure John from Critical Miss is going to be there,

682
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and other guys from Network. I think Brian from British Invaders is there this year.

683
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Lots of people will be there, and we do have a panel on Monday to talk about networking.

684
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And then Bobby and I will be on some other panels throughout the weekend. Very excited about that.

685
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So Dragon Con 2014 is only like six weeks away. But sadly, OLR will not be here that weekend.

686
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That is Labor Day weekend.

687
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
That's that.

688
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Plugs. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR. Follow us on Facebook.

689
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

690
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I am going to start plugging this every week, because Jason worked very hard on this,

691
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and we don't really give it enough credit.

692
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I want to plug our YouTube channels. That's YouTube user Orange Lounge Radio.

693
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Do subscribe to us over there, and check out the videos when they're posted of our episodes.

694
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It's a great way for you to listen to OLR on anything.

695
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If you want to listen on your 3DS, you can do that, thanks to YouTube.

696
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So check that out on YouTube.

697
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That's it for plugs. How about gaming news?

698
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
45 minutes into the show, it's time to get to some gaming news. Let's do it.

699
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yes. So Microsoft, they have put out the word that, hey, guess what?

700
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You know, when you take $100 off of a console, it's going to sell better.

701
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And that's the case with the Connectless Xbox One.

702
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's actually double the monthly sales of the Xbox One console, so not bad.

703
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
They haven't said exactly how many systems were sold during that time, but they have shipped,

704
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I guess in April they said they have shipped 5 million systems, so I don't know where they're at exactly yet.

705
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
We'll have to wait until the MPD numbers come out, I guess, in a few more weeks, I want to say.

706
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So yeah, that's pretty cool.

707
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And see, my question though still is, they don't have the Kinect available separately yet,

708
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
except I know they have the Kinect 2.0 for PC, which is $200, and that makes absolutely no sense to me.

709
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And I think that's mainly for developers, but they don't have the Kinect sold separately.

710
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And on top of that, the games that do require Kinect don't have the labeling on them like they do on the Xbox 360.

711
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So for example, when Fantasia comes out, if you're a consumer and you don't know what you're doing,

712
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and you buy an Xbox One without Kinect, and you buy that game, you're fucked.

713
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Because you didn't know that it required Kinect, because it doesn't say on it.

714
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So I'm surprised they haven't figured that out yet.

715
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So yeah. If I were to buy an Xbox One, I probably would get the Kinect version.

716
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Just because you never know what they're going to use that for later on.

717
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Like if that's going to tie in with their VR stuff or who knows.

718
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But I'd still want it for $399.

719
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Do you think this is the beginning of a trend for Microsoft that's in some ways badly needed?

720
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The backpedaling? No, they've done that for a long time.

721
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm talking about the actual sales and all this.

722
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah, I mean that definitely helps. I think more of the strong lineup that they've got coming third party and first party is more going to help them.

723
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Sorry, let me rephrase. Are more sales a good thing? Yes, stupid. Of course they are.

724
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,000
What I really mean by that is, is this a good sign that this could continue this inertia through the very important holiday season?

725
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think so. I think both systems are going to see a pretty decent boost in sales because there's a lot of good games coming out.

726
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
That being said though, there's still on PlayStation 4, there's not a lot of first party games that I really want to sell me that system.

727
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That's kind of the thing. I really want a PlayStation 4 more than I want an Xbox One.

728
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Just because I like the PlayStation Plus stuff and all that.

729
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But I can't see myself getting a PlayStation 4 right now because there's actually more Xbox One games I want to play.

730
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Well, really only one Xbox One game I want to play right now. Forza Horizon 2.

731
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:37,000
There's just not enough exclusives right now. I wish half those 2015 games were coming out fourth quarter because that would really sell me a system.

732
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And that's the other thing too, is by 2015 fourth quarter, I need to have both systems. All three systems because there's so many great games.

733
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm pretty sure the Halo collection and the fact that I can play Halo 2 with my friends all over again is going to be the thing that pushes me over the edge on Xbox.

734
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't know. I like Halo, but I don't know if I'd want to buy that.

735
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, I mean, that's the thing that's pushing me over the edge. I still want also Sunset Overdrive. I'd like to try it.

736
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh yeah, Sunset Overdrive definitely is going to be awesome.

737
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
There's other things that are sweetening the pot too, but that's the thing where it's like, alright, you broke me, that's the one.

738
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But that's the thing, they don't really have a whole lot, like first party stuff for Playstation 4, they don't really have a ton. They have LittleBigPlanet 3.

739
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And that's not even really, I mean, I don't think that's going to sell anyone's systems. Especially since it's on Playstation 3 as well.

740
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And that's Drive Club, but that was supposed to have been out last year anyways. That's not really, it's really third party stuff that's kind of pushing, but that's both systems.

741
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I mean, you can, I don't need the buy, but that's the other thing too. A lot of games do play slightly better on the Playstation 4 versus the Xbox ones.

742
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I'm pretty sure come holiday, Sony's going to sweeten the pot on the Playstation 4 by keeping the same price for the system.

743
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So $3.99, but they're going to start to include games with it, or download codes for games, or free Playstation Plus or something with it.

744
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Like some of their, at this point, aging games like Knack, these things can just be thrown in.

745
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I mean, those copies aren't flying off the shelves anymore.

746
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yeah, they're not worth anything though.

747
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,000
To somebody who might be sitting there going, Xbox One looks cool, but Playstation 4 also cool and comes with two games.

748
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But see, yeah, and I understand that they can do that, but they're even kind of doing that already with the Xbox One.

749
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I mean, they had, was it for a while there, they were giving out Titanfall with stuff, and they were also doing Forza 5, and it was still the same price.

750
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I want to say, I have to look it up though, because I can't remember, but I want to say that the Destiny bundle that they have coming out in September

751
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
is not the same price as just the standalone system.

752
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I want to say it's actually more, so I don't know if you're really saving any money there.

753
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Let's see here, if you know it's for Destiny.

754
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But, I don't know, I wouldn't necessarily want to buy the system for Destiny.

755
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah, $4.49, so it's $50 more, so you're saving a little bit of money, and I mean, what are you really getting?

756
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The system looks a little bit different, and you get, you know, a trial to, you know, a 30-day trial to PlayStation Plus, which is woohoo, I mean.

757
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But, that doesn't seem like much of a deal, you're really only saving about like $10 there.

758
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

759
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Sky, Sony should keep the price and include the cameras, kind of an FU to Xbox.

760
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You know, during E3 this year, there was a point where Bobby and I looked at each other, and if he's in chat right now and listening, he'll tell you this is true.

761
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
We looked at each other going, they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it.

762
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Because it was the way they were talking or whatever, we're like, they're gonna fucking do it, they're gonna include the camera, this is gonna be the kick em in the balls moment.

763
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
You know, like, oh my god, oh my god.

764
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And then it ended up being something else, and we were like, oh.

765
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That could've been such a moment.

766
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But like, I know we're gonna be talking about it a little bit later, but they're still not utilizing that camera for anything.

767
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Like, they're not.

768
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
There's not, outside of Just Dance and so forth, there's not.

769
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,000
The fair thing is, to be fair, at least Sony was never trying to kind of go out there and going, this is an essential part of the system.

770
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You need, you know, it was always like, okay, yeah, it's there if you want it.

771
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And you can stream with it, and you can play Just Dance, we have the playroom and all that.

772
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You know, it's a fun little thing, but, you know, it's not required.

773
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And yet that thing was still flying off of shelves because of the streaming component alone.

774
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
People really wanted that camera for the live streaming.

775
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So, I don't know. I still, I want these systems.

776
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I mean, ironically, you know, the Wii U has more games for it right now.

777
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
They're coming out fourth quarter.

778
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I mean, Smash Brothers and Mario Kart, I could see myself playing that stuff, but it's just, you know, I don't know.

779
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's hard to decide what system I'd want to get.

780
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I guess I'd have to wait until the fourth quarter, see if there's gonna be any more price drops or anything like that.

781
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I don't think there's gonna be any price drops, but bundles or something.

782
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's always good to wait.

783
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I forgot about this. Bobby just linked to a picture from the E3 wrap-up this year in one of the galleries.

784
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And he linked to a picture, and that was me.

785
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
He had his camera out ready to take a picture of me at the moment that they announced that the camera was gonna be included.

786
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Like, to get my big, like, ah face, you know.

787
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But then it ended up being something else, so my picture's a little more reserved, where I'm like, hmm.

788
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But he had his camera out ready to go. That was funny.

789
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Alright, let's move on.

790
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Something that you can play probably on your One and your PlayStation 4.

791
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Tekken 7. Tekken 7, it's happening.

792
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
IGN, I guess, kind of spoiled things a little bit, talking that Tekken 7 was coming.

793
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And this was before the developer actually announced it.

794
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Of course, the EVO was going on last week while we weren't here, and this is where Tekken 7 was finally unveiled.

795
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Tekken 7 will be running on Unreal Engine 4.

796
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It's in development for the PS4 and the Xbox One.

797
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
No word about the Wii U, but don't count on it.

798
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
If it's Unreal Engine 4, it's definitely not coming to the Wii U.

799
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yep. Unless they get some type of downgraded version.

800
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Coming on the GameCube!

801
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Now, this is what's also interesting.

802
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Producer Katsuhiro Harada announced this at EVO 2014 to officially announce the game.

803
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
However, this was not the game they were originally planning to announce.

804
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
There was no trailer prepared for Tekken 7 because of this.

805
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
They had to do one very quickly in his hotel room.

806
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They put the Tekken trailer together quickly.

807
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And they asked fans to show excitement for the video to overcome the difficulties of having to explain to his boss at Namco Bandai when he gets back to Japan.

808
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Because, again, that was not the game that they were supposed to reveal.

809
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
What was the game they were supposed to reveal?

810
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Don't know.

811
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Now, more information to come at San Diego Comic-Con on this game.

812
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Apparently, that was the place where they were going to reveal this.

813
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Interesting that a lot of gaming news is going to come out of San Diego Comic-Con this year.

814
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Well, gee. What other game could they possibly be talking about?

815
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Probably either, I'm guessing, Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

816
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Maybe. I mean, what the hell ever happened to that, right?

817
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Because, I mean, obviously if they have an engine now built for Tekken 7, that's going to be the engine that that's running on.

818
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Right.

819
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So, I'd be willing to, but that's probably what it is.

820
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Or who knows? It could also be a new Soul Calibur game.

821
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Or something, you know, one of their other franchises.

822
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Because it's been Soul Calibur 5.

823
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
That was a while ago.

824
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It was a while ago now, so it could be due for that too.

825
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So, we'll see. We'll see.

826
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But, yeah, Tekken Cross Street Fighter is more likely.

827
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But, I'm sure there will be plenty more news to come out of San Diego Comic-Con.

828
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Among other things is what Nintendo is going to be there.

829
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I just didn't mean to interrupt you.

830
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Oh, that's okay.

831
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It's Evo.

832
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Evo. Sorry.

833
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Evolution.

834
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Oh, okay.

835
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Did you hear about the guy who wasn't...

836
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Sorry, before you all make fun of me, ask me how good I am at fighting games.

837
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm not. Sorry.

838
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
By the way, did you hear about the guy who just...

839
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Street Fighter wasn't even his game and he went in and just won the whole thing.

840
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Oh, really? Was that the guy who won on the PlayStation 1 controller?

841
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah, it was the PlayStation controller.

842
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It was awesome.

843
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
We were watching him play as Rose.

844
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You know why I call it Evo?

845
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Because I think of that song from 2DX Red.

846
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
E-V-O-66.

847
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You remember that song?

848
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Anybody?

849
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Hello? Dark Tetsuya has to know what I'm talking about. Somebody.

850
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Alright, anyway.

851
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Fine then, Dark Soccer. Why don't you take the floor with another story?

852
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Well, maybe I will then. Geez, Rob.

853
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Well, how about some crappy news?

854
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Everyone likes crap, don't they?

855
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Microsoft is laying off 18,000 employees and closing Xbox Entertainment Studios.

856
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Basically coming from Phil Spencer is saying that...

857
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Well, he says he expects to close Xbox Entertainment Studios.

858
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And then says, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of the entire team.

859
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Even though we're laying you off.

860
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But yeah.

861
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It's basically, they're going to be letting a lot of people go.

862
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Which of course means that a whole lot of people are going to be jobless.

863
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Which, again, I could say certain things about that, but I'm not going to get political.

864
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah, that sucks. Bad news.

865
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So that means, hey, there's a bunch of Microsoft people who are going to be looking for jobs.

866
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Good video game companies.

867
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
We should probably throw out some job fairs.

868
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
That's a bummer. It's never easy to talk about layoffs.

869
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I mean, I heard it was mostly the Nokia side of things, but it's definitely impacting the entertainment and Xbox side too.

870
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Actually, it says that the total is $12,500 for them at Nokia.

871
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Which was from an April acquisition.

872
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But they're talking about doing other layoffs.

873
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And they're not saying specifically what divisions, but the biggest one is Xbox Entertainment Studios.

874
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And now, Loki, I think you have a little more on this layoff stuff, right?

875
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, so basically one of the things that they were talking about, of course, that the Xbox Entertainment Studios would be affected.

876
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
But this does not affect Quantum Break.

877
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Remember, Quantum Break also had kind of the live TV show portion of the game.

878
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But that apparently is still on track, according to Microsoft.

879
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And also, they're still committed to Halo Nightfall and the Halo TV series.

880
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So I guess we'll see what other stuff comes out of that.

881
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And then also, it's apparently affecting some of the other country teams, including Europe, Middle Eastern, and Asian Territory Xbox teams.

882
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And they're saying that, I guess, 75% of the full-time positions available on Xbox EMEA would be axed.

883
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And your employees would have to reapply for the remaining open roles.

884
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
That kind of sucks. That's a lot of cuts.

885
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:21,000
A lot of this is really surprising how fast that Xbox Entertainment thing just fizzled.

886
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I'm really kind of, I mean, it's not like we haven't teased Microsoft before about pulling the plug on things way before they should have.

887
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I.e. Game Room, I.e. 1 vs. 100, I.e. the Xbox Vision Camera, I.e.

888
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Yeah, the Entertainment Division was gone before it really started. That's kind of weird.

889
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
This is Murica.

890
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's still weird.

891
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
If we don't get instant results, we can't.

892
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Well, it's more of they're playing it safe, because this is a lot of a big gamble on whether it's going to take off for them.

893
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And I think that they're figuring it's just not, that they're not able to do this exclusive TV service that they're playing on.

894
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Maybe they're going to go to a different route.

895
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Well, could a lot of that, though, I mean, the fact that they pulled the plug this quick,

896
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Dark Soccer, come from the fact that they got such negative feedback when they did that very first unveiling of the Xbox One.

897
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And the internet blew up with movies, movies, movies, sports, sports, sports, no one cur.

898
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Like, do you think that Microsoft kind of went, oh, crap, nobody cares about this.

899
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So I guess that's pretty knee jerk.

900
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yeah. It was weird that like just last month they were hyping up this whole that they dug up the eat is they dug up the garbage in the desert.

901
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Right. They're going to do this movie about digging up people's garbage in the desert.

902
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And by garbage, I mean, copies of E.T., the extraterrestrial. Right.

903
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
They're they're going to do this whole movie about digging up garbage in the desert.

904
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And like it was this big thing. And now it's just I mean, I can't imagine that movie isn't still happening or is it.

905
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
No, I would imagine that's being finished.

906
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But still, I mean, that wasn't even had a chance to see how many viewers that would get.

907
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But to be fair, though, what have they really announced that they're canceling?

908
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Because the only shows they even talked about that they were going to have were the Halo one and break and quantum break.

909
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And those are still happening. So, well, I mean, I don't even know what's canceled.

910
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Other than who there might have been a show on Fable, which I totally wouldn't have given a shit about.

911
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They have a deal with Sarah Silverman comedy, something with her.

912
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Oh, God, I thought I read. Oh, she's funny. I think I know she's funny, but it's like, I don't know.

913
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Don't get me wrong. I love the Sarah Silverman program.

914
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah. And I'm sad that that is off the air, but she'll find another place.

915
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I just I don't know. I think I think you'll even need like these kind of outlets anymore because you can just do your own thing on YouTube or make your own website and have your own streaming thing.

916
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And people don't really need that. They're not going to be like, oh, I'm not going to watch it because it's on the Internet.

917
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Right. There's tons of shows that the Web series and stuff that they have that are quite successful on YouTube and other streaming sites.

918
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So maybe that's the problem is there's so much competition out there with that kind of stuff that no one really does care about.

919
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Microsoft put now, hey, look, we've got TV show. Cool. So is everybody else?

920
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, I think that's a big part of the problem, too, is how fragmented the distribution, digital distribution of TV is getting like it's it's getting really bad, you know.

921
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And when Netflix got really big and everybody wanted a piece of that, I was just talking Hulu, but I'm talking HBO has their own thing.

922
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Comcast has their own thing is like everybody wants their own digital TV thing. It's like there may not be room for for Microsoft in that picture.

923
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You know, and unless Microsoft is going to get the next orange is the new black, you know, they're not necessarily going to sign up all these people interested in the in the TV thing.

924
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So I guess they never took the took the financial chance to find out. I guess Microsoft is not in a place where they can take that risk.

925
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I do remember now they had was it that there is one show that I read or one thing that I know that they announced that they are probably not going to do, which was was it Powers or something like that?

926
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh, yeah. That was that was Sony. Oh, that was Sony. Yes. Oh, OK. I still don't care about that.

927
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, it was Sony. You know, it was Sony. OK, well, whatever. I thought that was another show.

928
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But I guess Sony already has an entertainment division. Sony has a music division. Sony is a big company besides just PlayStation.

929
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:33,000
They're making movies. Also, keep in mind, you know, the difference between laws versus a U.S. based companies and Japanese based companies.

930
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They can get into much broader ventures over there a lot more easily than we can because of trust.

931
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And I think Microsoft would be in a good position to maybe team up with somebody else for that.

932
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And maybe that's ultimately what's going to happen. Maybe Xbox Entertainment's being closed because there's going to be a deal coming with.

933
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I don't know. Like, what what what TV network is is Halo supposed to end up on?

934
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Wasn't it the thing with CBS, like maybe Showtime or something? I don't know where I'm getting that.

935
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
They still have a. No, I'm thinking that because the lady that was the head of she came from CBS.

936
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Do they still have like a share like NBC or something? You know, because I know they have MSNBC.

937
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I don't believe Microsoft actually has a stake in MSNBC anymore. I don't think. Don't quote me on that.

938
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
But I remember they were trying to get rid of it. So. But anyway, it'll be a.

939
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Why wouldn't they just like I mean, so what? Just like. Oh, why wouldn't they just partner up?

940
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I guess because they want people to be drawn to the Xbox platform, but I don't know.

941
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Put in Netflix or something. So what? So you can watch a Halo show on a Sony platform.

942
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Oh, you're making more money. Who gives a shit? You know, I don't understand what the problem is.

943
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
People aren't going up. OK, let's be real. Here's Microsoft. Nobody.

944
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Let's say that you have a new orange is the new black, whatever. Nobody is buying a fucking console for a show.

945
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Nobody. I'm sorry. Even if it was like Game of Thrones, I don't think anyone would fucking buy a console.

946
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
No, I would agree with a show. I would agree with that. And so who cares?

947
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Just put it on Hulu, put it on whatever. It's it's although I will say this.

948
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,000
It's not necessarily about making it, you know, that you have to buy the console for the one show.

949
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But it's about enhancing the value of the console when it sits next to this self next to Nintendo's console and Sony's console for the whole family.

950
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And maybe mom is making the purchase or mom and dad together or mom and mom, whatever the family is, are making the decision together that day to get the console.

951
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
If it says, oh, my kids will enjoy it because it has sunset overdrive.

952
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Oh, but I'm going to enjoy it because it has orange is the new blacks creators next project or whatever.

953
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I keep you reference. Red is the new blue. Red is the new blue. Yes.

954
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Red versus the new blue is available here on I would watch that.

955
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Yeah, I think I would do as long as it has donut and text.

956
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It's available here on the Xbox one. And so I'm going to buy this because Sony doesn't have that and Nintendo doesn't have that.

957
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I would totally watch a red versus blue movie. That would be fantastic.

958
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Like in theaters. But no, seriously, though, I think it's even less of just looking at the console thing.

959
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It's even more of like they're just they're online services justifying the cost of paying for Xbox Live.

960
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Because, I mean, they're trying with the free games and stuff, but it's just not quite what Sony is offering.

961
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Real quick comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

962
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Rama says Sony has many divisions, but on the computing entertainment one is profitable.

963
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Lol. Samsung is the new Sony when it comes to TVs. That's true.

964
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I have heard Sony has not been the PlayStation has been something that's been keeping them afloat, which is interesting.

965
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I wonder if just before the NFL season there will be a rise in Xbox one sales.

966
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Madden usually offers an NFL Sunday ticket subscription if you buy the game. Word is they're offering it on the Xbox one.

967
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:09,000
BSingle40 in chat says didn't NPD report come out Friday saying PlayStation 4 won June despite the Microsoft price cut?

968
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Loki, you're the expert on the sales stuff.

969
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I didn't remember looking at the numbers. I don't know.

970
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
That wouldn't surprise me.

971
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I think they were both up. I'm not sure. And I think I remember seeing that. I just don't remember.

972
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Because, I don't know. Because they would have, let's put it this way.

973
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
They would have said we outsold the PlayStation if they outsold the PlayStation because that's something they're rubbing.

974
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
They're going to try to bend it however, you know, sounds the best for them.

975
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Tigerclaw in chat says you think Nintendo will ever join with an entertainment network?

976
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
No. Very much no. It's not the business they're in and I don't think it's something they want to do.

977
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It's about how they do things.

978
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Nintendo wants to keep their hands on the reins.

979
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Keep in mind, and nobody talks about this on the Wii U, nobody talks about it, but it's there and it is kind of neat.

980
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
They have a TV experience that enhances the TV you already have.

981
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
That just proves that Nintendo is not interested.

982
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
They have built something that enhances the TV you already have.

983
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Where you can watch American Idol or big sports games and actually chat along with other viewers in a Miiverse style environment.

984
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
If you own a Wii U, check it out because you probably didn't even know it was there.

985
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And they've actually been adding to it and enhancing it.

986
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I bet Drag Race is fun to watch with that.

987
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I don't think they have it for Drag Race but they ought to.

988
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That would be funny.

989
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
They ought to. I'm going to petition Nintendo.

990
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Wait a minute. I have a business card from Nintendo PR. I'm going to email him tomorrow.

991
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You know what's funny?

992
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Tiara and I used to do that for books.

993
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
When the Harry Potter books would come out, we'd just sit online and comment back and forth about where we were.

994
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
OMG. OMG. OMG.

995
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
What the fuck is he thinking?

996
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It was pretty funny.

997
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Book chat.

998
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
That's what we need. We need ebook chat.

999
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Ebook chat.

1000
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'm going to patent that.

1001
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
You have ebook chat on the iBook store or on Kindle or whatever.

1002
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Better check and see if that's been reserved.

1003
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
You can leave comments and books so that people in your book community can read the comments they left on sections of books.

1004
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
That'd be great.

1005
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You could be a millionaire.

1006
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Alright, well here's something that now let's hope.

1007
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I know this game isn't coming to Wii U but let's hope that there's a way that my mother can participate in the chat for this next game we're going to talk about.

1008
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Mortal Kombat X.

1009
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Because you know my mom's a big Mortal Kombat fan.

1010
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Rab.

1011
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Rab.

1012
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
That's so gross.

1013
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I haven't shown her the new trailer.

1014
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I really need to get a reaction video.

1015
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You know how people film reaction videos on YouTube to Two Girls One Cup?

1016
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I need to get a reaction video to my mother watching the new Mortal Kombat trailer.

1017
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And especially the announcement for Raiden is going to be in the game.

1018
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Classic Mortal Kombat character.

1019
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
How could they do that?

1020
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Has Raiden ever not been in a Mortal Kombat game?

1021
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
He wasn't in IV, was he?

1022
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It would be so weird to have a Mortal Kombat game without Raiden.

1023
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So of course he is in the game.

1024
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Of course the Thunder.

1025
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Or Christopher Lambert, if you remember the movie.

1026
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So that is that.

1027
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Now also interesting about Mortal Kombat X.

1028
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And yes that's X not X. That's how they're marketing it.

1029
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Mortal Kombat X is going to have at least one guest character from an outside franchise because Freddy Krueger did so well.

1030
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
They're not confirming that Freddy Krueger will be said character.

1031
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But they're going to add some type of guest character into the game.

1032
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Which of course begs the question.

1033
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Who do you think that character should be?

1034
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Did you know we actually did a list list on this a long time ago?

1035
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
What character should be in Mortal Kombat as a franchise character?

1036
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
We did this some time ago.

1037
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Who won? I can't remember.

1038
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I'm actually pulling it up right now because Dark Tetsuya compiled it.

1039
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I do remember on the list was the Bride from Kill Bill.

1040
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Was one of the characters.

1041
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Which is still an answer I really like.

1042
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
That's for sure.

1043
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I believe the winner was Ash from Evil Dead.

1044
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Which actually seems plausible.

1045
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Why not? Why not?

1046
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I guess getting the Bruce Campbell likeness would be the trickiest part unless they did like a...

1047
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
The chin.

1048
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah I don't know.

1049
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I would think...

1050
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
He'd probably do it.

1051
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I would think Jason and Michael Myers.

1052
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I mean if Freddy Krueger is going to be in it.

1053
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Jason seems like a really logical step.

1054
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I know they do like...

1055
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Because there's also Jason X right?

1056
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Or Friday the 13th X with Jason in space.

1057
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I mean come on.

1058
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Anyway.

1059
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Number 3 by the way.

1060
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So in that list list.

1061
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Number 1 was Ash from Evil Dead.

1062
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Number 2 was the Bride from Kill Bill.

1063
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Number 3 was Mr. Rogers.

1064
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't know how that happened but it's really funny.

1065
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
So that was from an old list list we did some time ago.

1066
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Awesome.

1067
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
That's so like insensitive now.

1068
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You know what?

1069
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Just the Mortal Kombat people should just license the engine and do nothing but horror

1070
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
film bad guys the fighting game.

1071
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
You know they do have that.

1072
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Why not?

1073
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
There's a fan made game that's like that.

1074
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And Ash is actually in that.

1075
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I just don't remember what it's called.

1076
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Alright.

1077
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
But like they should also have like the people who like the sole survivor out of horror flicks.

1078
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Like Alice from the two Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

1079
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Sydney from Scream and Gale Weathers.

1080
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And the psychic kid from Friday the 13th.

1081
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Was it 3 or 4?

1082
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Yes.

1083
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
The title of the game.

1084
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Wasn't that Corey Feldman?

1085
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
How about as a playable character in Mortal Kombat X, Carrie's mom.

1086
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
She could use like psychic powers.

1087
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
You can see your dirty pillows.

1088
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
When she does a fatality on Sonya she can be like, I can see your dirty pillows.

1089
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
They're all gonna laugh at you.

1090
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And smothers her with a pillow.

1091
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I like that.

1092
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
That wasn't even on the original list list.

1093
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Can we go back and amend it with Carrie's mom?

1094
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Part B, Rob.

1095
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Part B.

1096
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Part B. List list the sequel.

1097
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Have we ever done that?

1098
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
No.

1099
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Let's make that a thing.

1100
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
An unprecedented moment in all our history.

1101
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Was it the aunt or whatever from Sleep Boy Camp?

1102
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
How about, what was, oh my God, Angela.

1103
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
How about just straight up Angela from Sleep Boy Camp?

1104
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Anyway, did you know, I'm sorry, I have to just do a tangent while we're talking about bad horror movies.

1105
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Because if my buddy Rene from Killer Queens from Outer Space is out there listening, he'll appreciate this.

1106
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And I learned this on the show I was on.

1107
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Did you know that the little boy who played Angela's brother who dies in the opening moments of Sleep Boy Camp,

1108
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and I won't spoil anything, the little kid who plays her brother is actually the situation's brother.

1109
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
No fucking joke.

1110
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Like the situation from Jersey Shore, that's his brother in that movie, Sleep Boy Camp.

1111
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Only douchebags call themselves the situation.

1112
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I learned that when I guessed it on that show.

1113
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And I was like, get the hell out of here.

1114
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
What a small world.

1115
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Anyways, the game I was telling you about-

1116
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
You've never seen Sleep Boy Camp, right?

1117
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Is, uh, was it-

1118
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Okay, mandatory this has to happen.

1119
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
We have to watch Sleep Boy Camp.

1120
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Well, I also didn't see Mean Girls, so-

1121
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Oh my God, Jamie, you're killing me.

1122
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Alright.

1123
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah, even though I know lines from the movie, go thig.

1124
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
You can't sit here!

1125
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
You just can't ask people why they're white.

1126
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You know enough about Mean Girls, you just need to watch the damn movie.

1127
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah, I know.

1128
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Terrordrome, the game Rise of the Boogeyman is actually the horror game, fighting game that's actually free to play.

1129
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:27,000
If you want to check it out, it's free to download at www.terrordrome-thegame.com.

1130
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Ooh, I like the suggestion from Fifth Dream in chat.

1131
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
American McGee's Alice in Mortal Kombat.

1132
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Well, might be too young, though. I don't want to see all that yucky violence on kids.

1133
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Is Alice an adult?

1134
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yes.

1135
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Well, then I guess maybe it will work, but I don't know, it's a little weird.

1136
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Little weird.

1137
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
In theory, it sounds good, but I don't know.

1138
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
What about, like, um, wasn't...

1139
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I think Lollipop Chainsaw was, um, Warner.

1140
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Oh!

1141
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
That game was almost embarrassingly bad and hilarious.

1142
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
We keep thinking movies, but maybe another character from another big gaming franchise.

1143
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Because they were trying to get something exclusive to...

1144
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Because Kratos was in Mortal Kombat 8, or whatever it was, on PlayStation,

1145
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
there was talk that they were trying to get a similar character.

1146
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Everybody assumed he was Master Chief.

1147
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
But something like that on Xbox, it never happened.

1148
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It needs to be Coco Tapioca from Space Channel 5 Part 2.

1149
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
No.

1150
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
What?

1151
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
If they really want to go crazy, you know, maybe a little bit bonkers, or conquerors...

1152
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Stop. Stop right there. I'm not even going to let you finish that.

1153
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
We're going to move on. More news. Dark Saga.

1154
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Okay, well, we've heard of it happening before, where the news will just say,

1155
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Oh, look! We'll use whatever picture this is to describe whatever,

1156
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
and no one can get on us because we have money.

1157
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Ha ha ha ha. Copyright, blah blah.

1158
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Except that, um, they really kind of fucked up here.

1159
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,000
So, basically, it was, um, a news station that was doing a discussion about, um,

1160
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
children, you know, being used as soldiers.

1161
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And, um, and this was on ITV, um, uh, well, actually, one of them,

1162
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,000
the first time it happened was, um, on ITV, where, uh, they used clips from Arma 2.

1163
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Well, now we have another, uh, company that's, uh,

1164
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and I believe it's Fox and Friends, that, you know, had their Bioshock Infinite logo thing.

1165
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Now we have, uh, screen caps from Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain,

1166
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
to talk about child warriors.

1167
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
And this was, uh, on, uh, news channel Russia Today.

1168
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah, I saw the clip. It was really awkward kind of seeing that.

1169
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It's like, you know, stock footage amongst all this other, you know,

1170
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
which is, which is really the horrific topic, if you think about it.

1171
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
To, to see this just really made the whole thing even more awkward.

1172
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
This is stupid.

1173
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Yeah, I mean, do your research interns.

1174
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Either that or, you know, wouldn't it be funny if, like,

1175
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
there were stealth interns placed to get major companies in trouble by exposing?

1176
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Don't you feel like, though, how this happens is that some intern just went to Google image search

1177
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
and put child soldier and thought that picture and didn't even, like, fact check it

1178
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
or do a backwards image search to see where it came from or any of that stuff?

1179
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Exactly that. I mean, the big thing is that, and I've learned this, my teachers taught me well.

1180
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
If you are going to find an image, there are certain things that you're going to have to put in your search

1181
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
when you're looking for it, including stock image, royalty free, or public domain, you know.

1182
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
If you're trying to use something you're not going to have to freaking pay for.

1183
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Then again, I've seen quite a bit of, and I'm not going to say that it's Russian media in particular,

1184
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
but I've seen it mostly out of Russian media where it's like, well, like my friend in Australia,

1185
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:09,000
her Homestuck fan art being used on the cover of a Russian publication about a story about the American justice system

1186
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
and it's a troll holding, you know, it's Terezi.

1187
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That's one thing, but specifically the news. I think the news is exempt from some of that stuff because it's the news.

1188
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:26,000
This is supposed to be an unused publication, you know, and then we're seeing it,

1189
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:35,000
but it's just really more or less a matter of either lazy searching or disregard for copyright or a combination of all of the above.

1190
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming out soon

1191
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:47,000
in a game store near you that perhaps will have artwork that will soon be on the local news. Loki.

1192
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,000
This might be on the local news just because it was, you know, a popular game a long time ago.

1193
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Well, it's still pretty popular, I guess, but for the Wii U, the disc version of Wii Sports Club will be coming out on Friday on the Wii U.

1194
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And that's literally it.

1195
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
That's it?

1196
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
That's it. That's it.

1197
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Alright, I guess this is a slow week.

1198
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Let's see, going to Japan and checking out some of the releases over there.

1199
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I don't see anything on the PlayStation 4 this week. I'm wondering if it's a slow week over there, too.

1200
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:24,000
On the PlayStation 3, Dead Island and Sengoku Basara 4 are getting, like, remastered.

1201
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
They're not new, they're just re-price reductions, re-bundlings of the game, essentially.

1202
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:36,000
There is another new game, though, called Under Night in Birth Exe Late, which is an Arc System Works game that's out on PlayStation 3.

1203
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You can also check out a Monster Hunter Frontier G5 premium package, also out on PlayStation 3 this week.

1204
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
So lots of redos in Japan this week.

1205
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Same thing on the Xbox 360, that same Monster Hunter Frontier package is on the 360 as well.

1206
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
A 10,000 point Xbox gift card, branded for Monster Hunter.

1207
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
10,000 points? And they still have point cards?

1208
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I guess.

1209
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I guess maybe in Japan they do. There must be some type of difference going on there.

1210
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
On the Wii U, that same Monster Hunter Frontier package is out as well.

1211
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
That might explain the slow release dates in Japan this week, because you know it's Monster Hunter.

1212
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But hey, on the Vita, things are a little more hopping with Corpse Party Blood Drive, and Re-Vice-D comes out there as well.

1213
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And Tokyo Shin Seiroku Operation Abyss is out on the PlayStation Vita as well.

1214
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
That's your Japanese release dates? Oh, wait, 3DS. Sorry.

1215
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
3DS Yoshi's New Island is out in Japan this week. That's a pretty big one.

1216
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Dark Sakura?

1217
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Jack shit?

1218
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
In the UK?

1219
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yep, nothing.

1220
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Alright, matches what's going on over here. I guess it's that part of summer where you need to catch up on your Steam backlog.

1221
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
It's when they say, go outside.

1222
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Or that.

1223
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Play.

1224
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Or that.

1225
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, which you could also play this week if you wanted. Loki.

1226
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Alright. Let's see.

1227
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:10,000
There's always these Kickstarter stories about how things kind of go awry, and a game that's promised never comes out.

1228
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Well, this one is kind of the case. This was a game based off of the web series Yoggcast, or I think it starts actually a podcast.

1229
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
But Yoggcast's Yoggventure game.

1230
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I believe, and I know this is going to take people by surprise, I'm not super familiar with that group, but I believe they're big on YouTube.

1231
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Well yeah, I know they do Minecraft videos and stuff like that, but I know it's a YouTube channel, but I thought they had a podcast too, but whatever.

1232
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:49,000
But anyways, Yoggventures. They actually Kickstarted this. It had made, or went way above what they had originally asked for.

1233
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I want to say that they were originally asking for $250,000 and ended up with $560,000 in pledges.

1234
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:05,000
However, now development has ceased on the game. Apparently, they just ran out of money.

1235
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And, you know, it's kind of surprising. They're basically saying that they worked on the game, it was an amazing experience, blah blah blah.

1236
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They really wanted to achieve some lofty goals set out, but they didn't have enough experience in planning and management and that kind of thing.

1237
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And I guess he had put some of his own money into it and just couldn't quite get the game finished.

1238
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And so, because of that, I think they're giving people copies of a game called TUG instead.

1239
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:53,000
But, you know, there's a little bit, some more details on that, talking about the mismanagement and stuff and just kind of maybe inexperience.

1240
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:08,000
For example, there was an artist they had paid to do some in-game artwork for them and I guess they paid him, or paid them $35,000 for two weeks of work that produced, or two weeks that produced no work.

1241
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Apparently, the artist signed the contract, got the $35,000 payment, put two weeks worth of time in, and then accepted full-time employment with LucasArts.

1242
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But because of the way the contract was poorly written, he had no obligation to do anything, so he got the money and just kind of left.

1243
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:38,000
So, and just like there's a lot of drama with just, you know, being uncomfortable with how it was being managed and stuff like that.

1244
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It just goes to show you, but like, I remember one of the comments, you know, when he's, they're explaining to...

1245
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Sorry, I'm laughing because Rama in chat says, Rama brings in the ball pit.

1246
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Sorry.

1247
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
That's a good zinger, Rama. I like that. Sorry. I don't mean to kick this while it's down.

1248
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:02,000
You guys know I've had my own concerns about Kickstarter and obviously this news story exacerbates a lot of those issues.

1249
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:11,000
However, I mean, for the people that backed this and supported it, especially coming from, you know, a production that is indie like we are and has really kind of worked from the ground up.

1250
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:17,000
It is, it's not an easy thing to see. I think it's just one of those, it's a caution for everybody.

1251
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Well, I think also it was, it was, when they...

1252
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
It needed an adult, I hate to say it.

1253
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
It really sounds like a lot of the way contracts were written and this guy could get no money.

1254
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,000
They even broke it down though, like, and they spent money on legal, you know, legal fees and stuff.

1255
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Why didn't they have someone write up a good contract?

1256
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I mean, you would think that you would write up a contract that doesn't have a fucking out where I could just take the money, come up with nothing and then fucking leave.

1257
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Damn, I want to sign one of those contracts.

1258
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You know, I mean, it's just, it sounds ridiculous.

1259
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And also I haven't really, you know, not too familiar, I kind of looked at the Kickstarter thing.

1260
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:04,000
They didn't really have any playable or I want to say that they didn't really have a lot of footage from the game right away.

1261
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I think they showed a little bit, not too, you know, they had some footage, but I think it was after the Kickstarter thing was done.

1262
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So it was all off of concept art and that's always really wary to me.

1263
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:21,000
If you don't have anything to show of your game and you're trying to sell your game, that just seems like a stretch.

1264
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And I mean, granted, yeah, it's probably based off good faith, you know, because it's a channel you might like and stuff.

1265
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:35,000
But I don't know, especially I'd be kind of leery, but I guess I wouldn't.

1266
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Once again, you know, I want to say this should sour everybody for, you know, any Kickstarter project because there's been plenty of projects that have gone through Kickstarter and been just fine.

1267
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I mean, look at the John's sister's twisted dreams. Look at, you know, Shovel Knight.

1268
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:58,000
There's Among the Sleep and, you know, a lot of other successful campaigns that you don't really hear a lot about because there's no drama in there.

1269
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
No one wants to report on like, oh, this campaign was successful. The game came out OK.

1270
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Yay. Hoping Kickstarter is, you know, come back.

1271
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It's just, I don't know, everyone seems to focus on the negative.

1272
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But yes, there are a lot of projects out there. You just have to really be careful with what you're you're backing.

1273
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And remember that, you know, if you're backing like 15 bucks, you're probably not going to be able to have any sort of recourse if they don't come back and do anything.

1274
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Because obviously, if you want to file legal fees and stuff, it'd be more than your fifteen dollars.

1275
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
So it's not worth it. Just be careful, I guess. And do your research.

1276
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And also only back projects, I would say that actually show something, you know.

1277
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Going to a chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, sadly, it's not the only project to suffer this kind of problem.

1278
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Too many high level goals, not enough experience and planning to ground it in reality.

1279
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Some guy recently wanted to make a Naruto MMO without actually having the license, experience or technical planning.

1280
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Just a page of text professing his awe at starting something like it.

1281
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Shadowrun returns divinity, Original Sin, Wasteland 2, etc.

1282
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Yeah, some good points.

1283
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And as Joe and Hunter Matt says, this is what happens when you use Kickstarter to avoid going through a publisher or someone who could oversee your project to make sure stuff gets done.

1284
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Same person can deal with all the legal stuff. Some people can pull it off, others can't.

1285
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
But, I mean, that's not saying that you can't go through Kickstarter and do all that stuff.

1286
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:25,000
You can just, you know, the problem with inner experience is you don't know how much money you're going to need for, like, legal and stuff.

1287
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And that's kind of the problem I think they ran into is, like, they tried to cut corners, I want to say, with how much they spent on that.

1288
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And if you spend a lot of money on legal, you can actually get somebody, like, for example, on Reddit a lot, there's the video game lawyer.

1289
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
They have services where he'll write up contracts for you and do that kind of thing.

1290
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And he has experience with indie game developers.

1291
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:57,000
You know, it's not that expensive and you just have to know what, you're going to have to spend some of your own money on that stuff.

1292
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And even just starting your own company, you're going to have to spend some money, you know, trademarking your product and all that stuff.

1293
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So it just, you have to know that you're doing that and you also have to be smart about it because, yeah, I mean, there's, you know, you could get sued by somebody else for, you know,

1294
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
if you're, you know, copyright infringement or if it's too close to some other thing, like in the Naruto case.

1295
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
You can't fucking kickstart something you don't have the rights to.

1296
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I mean, maybe they're naive and think that.

1297
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Like, for example, there was one I saw that was a really shitty looking game, but they called it, was it Grand Theft Pizza delivery or something like that.

1298
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I'm like, that's going to fucking get sued if it didn't look like complete shit.

1299
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I'm sure that they don't give a shit about it. But, you know, the fact that it, they raised like a few thousand dollars for a really shitty game.

1300
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
But the name Grand Theft, whatever, and it looks like a Grand Theft Auto type, you know, over a head game, except just drawn at them as paint.

1301
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
But still, it's, you know, you got to be careful.

1302
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, just stick to potato salad.

1303
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Don't get me started on that. Do not get me started on that.

1304
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
That's one of those things where everyone thinks that they're, you know, oh, I'm going to back money this because that's silly.

1305
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
He, you know, the only one that's laughing is the person.

1306
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
You're the problem.

1307
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Fifty thousand dollars.

1308
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
You're the problem.

1309
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Right. Moving on. You spend your money on what you want, but I'm just saying.

1310
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
All right. Moving on to one more story here about money.

1311
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Would you be surprised if I told you that some of your favorite YouTubers are getting paid to cover games by publishers?

1312
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Publishers are paying them to cover certain games.

1313
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Well, if you're shocked to hear that news, welcome to the internet. Enjoy your stay.

1314
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Gamasutra actually did a survey of YouTubers and Let's Players with over five thousand subscribers.

1315
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And according to the numbers, twenty-one percent of them participated in Paola.

1316
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Five percent of them, when a dev offers money, sixty-nine percent saying no.

1317
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
The other five percent prefers not to say, so you can assume that that's a yes.

1318
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Very, very interesting.

1319
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Do you believe that this stuff should be disclosed whenever it happens?

1320
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
What do you guys think about this?

1321
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I mean, is this news like, oh my God, this needs to stop?

1322
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Or is this like, oh, I'm surprised there's not more of them?

1323
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Pay me.

1324
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Pay me.

1325
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Well, we kind of knew that this kind of stuff was going on.

1326
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Because remember a while back, that whole thing leaked out back when the Xbox One was launching.

1327
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And there was like, oh, these incentive programs.

1328
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:33,000
If you're on certain networks and stuff that you would get, you know, more ad revenue if you covered a certain game during a certain time period and that kind of thing.

1329
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
So I'm not surprised that this is happening.

1330
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I do think that they should disclose it because I think if you're not disclosing that it's like an advertisement or, you know, an advertorial, I guess they call it.

1331
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
That it's kind of disingenuous.

1332
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I don't know. I just I think that they need to disclose that kind of stuff.

1333
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Because, I mean, really, I wouldn't think any I wouldn't think poorly of somebody that does that as long as they're disclosing it.

1334
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Because let's be honest, you're not making a ton of money on a lot of people aren't making a ton of money on YouTube.

1335
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And if you're going to do that as a full time thing, then you need to be open to any opportunities that may come your way.

1336
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Not necessarily, you know, you know, hurting your own, I guess, honesty, but just, you know, taking an opportunity to say, hey, you know what?

1337
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
You know, it's like Deep Silver or whatever paid us to show off some footage of Saints Row.

1338
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
So here's some, you know, check it out or I don't know.

1339
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I think you'd want to be a little clever in how you say that. You just want to say, hey, I got paid, y'all. I got paid to do this.

1340
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:58,000
You know, maybe Deep Silver, who has sponsored some brand new microphones and soundboards for our show, has asked us to talk about this particular game.

1341
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
You know, that might be another way to do it. I don't know.

1342
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Maybe that just kind of look at it going, how would I do it? Because I would think any money, you know, I'm not just going to take it to the bank because I've never made, I don't, if you, if y'all think we make money off of OLR or VoG network, you're high because we don't.

1343
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:22,000
But if we did, if somebody wanted to pay us to cover a certain thing, I think I would feel like, okay, it's not going to be a lot of money.

1344
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It's probably something that would just get put right back into the show. So it would also buy us new webcam.

1345
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It'd also have to depend on what it is because I remember like back in the day, you know, even with like some of the all game stuff, you know, we had opportunities to, you know, look at like certain accessories and stuff.

1346
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And it was just kind of like, nah.

1347
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I think it happened one time.

1348
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Yeah, one time, whatever. But, you know, I was like kind of like, nah, we're not going to do that.

1349
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
All right. Anyhow, let's, let's go to a time when things were simpler.

1350
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Things were a lot simpler and you didn't have to worry about it.

1351
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
People couldn't even stream this game online. You know that? But they do now. I think they do.

1352
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
It is the classic game of the week.

1353
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game.

1354
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Although many of you have probably already played this game.

1355
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
But if you haven't played this game, then play it again.

1356
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Play it for the first time.

1357
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Do it. Do the thing.

1358
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Do the thing. Here it is, your classic game of the week.

1359
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Final Fantasy.

1360
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So, yes, I picked Final Fantasy, which I've done a bunch of other Final Fantasy games, but I have not yet done Final Fantasy.

1361
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So it is a role playing game that was created by Sakaguchi Hironobu, done by Square, which is now, of course, Squeenix.

1362
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
It came out in 1987 and, of course, it was the first.

1363
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It came out on the Famicom slash Nintendo Entertainment System and has been remade for other consoles since then.

1364
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
More recently, it was packaged with Final Fantasy II, the original II, and not Final Fantasy IV.

1365
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Basically, you play as the Light Warriors, who each have an elemental orb that have been darkened by various Fiends.

1366
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
And so you have to go defeat the evil forces, restore lights of the orbs, and save the world.

1367
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It is one of the early games to do random battle encounters for experience.

1368
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:32,000
At least do it in, I would probably say, a way that's become an accepted method of doing it.

1369
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:39,000
It's turned into a norm because it really set a precedent for how encounters are going to work in a game.

1370
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So basically, it's an overworld map, a town and dungeon map, a battle screen, and a menu screen.

1371
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:53,000
The overworld is, of course, scaled down so you can walk all over it, your little guy being the avatar that you're following through.

1372
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And you get, of course, different classes. You start off with a fighter, thief, black belt, red mage, white mage, and black mage.

1373
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Of course, we know the way they look because we know them very well. We also probably have all read 8-bit theater.

1374
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And then you get class upgrades, so you can go up to, of course, stronger character classes.

1375
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:29,000
You have some magical weapons and armor that when you use them in combat, they'll cast spells.

1376
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:38,000
You have artifacts for protection from spells. You can buy items. You can get tents and cabins to regenerate while you save.

1377
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Aethers are always fucking expensive. And you do different quests to gain special items.

1378
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:52,000
You do have your magic, white magic, which is your defensive inhaling, and black, which is destructive magic.

1379
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And red mages use a combination of the two. But you can only carry, the spells are actually classified by level 1-8 with 4 white and 4 black spells per level.

1380
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And you only learn 3 spells per level. And the other ones that can cast, besides the red mages, would be the ninja and the knight. Of course, depending on their class.

1381
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:27,000
So, basically, the game was... Sakaguchi wanted to make the game for a long time, but Square refused.

1382
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:37,000
And then when Dragon Quest came out and became such a hit, they're like, okay, here, make a game! Get us Dragon Quest money.

1383
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So, basically, it was done by a group that Square called the A-Team, which was Koichi Ishii Akitoshi Kawazu.

1384
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And, of course, he was the one responsible for the battle systems and the sequences that he based off of D&D.

1385
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And the game Wizardry. Do you remember Wizardry?

1386
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Oh god, yes. That's old school.

1387
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
But the basic heart of it was, it's an RPG that begins when you create the character.

1388
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So, it really is strong for the storyline. Of course, we have Uematsu doing the music.

1389
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And they got an Iranian-American programmer named Nasir Gebelli to code the game.

1390
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And so, as far as the graphics, they were designed by Shibuya Kazuko, and then also Ito Hiryoku as the debugger.

1391
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:50,000
So, basically, it just started with, they had the development ROM, they took it to the Famicom magazine,

1392
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
and they wouldn't review it, but Famitsu did it and gave it exclusive coverage.

1393
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And they originally were only going to make 200,000 copies to ship.

1394
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,000
And he begged them to do 400,000, which they agreed to.

1395
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And once it was localized in North America, it really, really took on.

1396
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:18,000
There is no version of the game that was marketed for the PAL region until Final Fantasy Origins in 2003.

1397
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Oh wow, I didn't realize that.

1398
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So, in 1987 and 1990, there was the original Final Fantasy.

1399
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:35,000
In 1989, they did an MSX2 version that had some graphic upgrades, expanded music and sound effects, and it had loading times.

1400
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:41,000
There's the Final Fantasy I-II version that was in 1994 for the Famicom.

1401
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Final Fantasy came out in 2000 for Wonderswan Color, which is the one I have.

1402
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
That was actually what led me to get my first Wonderswan, was that version.

1403
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:58,000
There was Final Fantasy I and II, Dawn of Souls, which was for Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Origins for PlayStation,

1404
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Final Fantasy for Mobile Phone, which was better than the 8-bit version, but less advanced than more recent versions.

1405
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
There was the PSP, sorry, PSP version.

1406
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
There was the full motion video sequences, remixed soundtrack, extra dungeons, script from Dawn of Souls,

1407
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
virtual console release, which was the NES version.

1408
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,000
There was an iOS version based off the PSP version, one for Windows Phone, and one for Android.

1409
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:31,000
That last one, the Android one, was based off the PSP version, but did not have the bonus dungeons.

1410
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And the very first re-release was the one done for the MSX2 that was published by Microcabin in Japan in June 1989.

1411
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Switching to some of the music from one of the remakes since you're talking about them.

1412
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:54,000
But it also had almost three times as much storage space as the Famicom, but the big problem it had, loading time.

1413
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
But it did look and sound a lot better.

1414
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
So, and of course we've got, like I said, all those other various versions that were released for various different reasons.

1415
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:09,000
So if you haven't played it, why the hell not? And go ahead and get it.

1416
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
There are also, keep in mind, nods to the original ones we had.

1417
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
The soundtrack was released with the score for Final Fantasy II in 1989.

1418
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:30,000
And there was a track that became the big one that has been in every Final Fantasy game ever called the Prelude, which you played right at the start.

1419
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And I mean, even in Final Fantasy XIV, the game starts off with that.

1420
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:40,000
So, of course there have been other adaptations.

1421
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
There was, in Captain N, the Game Master, there was the Fractured Fantasy of Captain N.

1422
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Of course we had 8-bit theater, like I mentioned before.

1423
01:39:49,000 --> 01:40:00,000
And don't forget the Dead Ale Wives parody that they would play on Dr. Demento has been done in 8-bit theater style as well.

1424
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I said I wanted blue eyes, but I decided gray. Okay, whatever. Cast Magic Missile.

1425
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
So basically, that's it for Final Fantasy.

1426
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:17,000
There's a whole lot more we could go into on this one, but I'd say at this point, look for it yourselves.

1427
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
If you haven't already played it at this point, my gosh.

1428
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:26,000
The remakes are out there everywhere on the mobile phone and everything. You can find this somewhere. For sure.

1429
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
So yeah, check that out.

1430
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week. Final Fantasy, as in the original Final Fantasy.

1431
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Again, one of those games when she says it's the game of the week, I go,

1432
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,000
you mean it hasn't been the game of the week before? In the past 250 plus times we've done this segment.

1433
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
It's never been the classic game. Nope, it hasn't. So there it is.

1434
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
A classic classic game without which we wouldn't have had a lot of games.

1435
01:40:51,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Well, and honestly, it's a really deep story for something that came out when I was a preteen.

1436
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I remember playing this on Nintendo Entertainment System, like staying up all night with my friend to play Final Fantasy.

1437
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,000
You know what's funny though? I never beat it. We got all the way to Tiamat and couldn't beat him.

1438
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Dan and I were doing a playthrough together and we actually had the airship and then decided we got bored.

1439
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Bored now.

1440
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, history.

1441
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Alright, let's take a break. We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come here on this week back after a week off.

1442
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
We have your food question of the week. We're going to talk about more playroom news.

1443
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,000
There's things coming to that that sound exciting. Net neutrality talk and maybe some Power Rangers chat.

1444
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I wonder if Shane's going to run into the room when he hears that. We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1445
01:41:50,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live on this Sunday evening, July the 20th of 2014 with episode number 560 already in progress.

1446
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I hope you guys had a good week last week even though we weren't here. I know some of you guys rely on us to help you get through your Monday at work.

1447
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But we're back and I hope you guys found another great indie show to maybe add to your rotation in the time we were away.

1448
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Because you know we always say here at Orange Lounge Radio, support independent podcasting. There's so many great shows out there, hardworking.

1449
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Obviously we're always going to pimp our pals at vognetwork.com. I always like to promote with the guys I was doing stuff with at GamerX like Koopa Club and Video Game Realness even though they weren't there.

1450
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But in spirit they were Game Bar, Game Buoy.org and so on and so on. So many great shows.

1451
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:55,000
But even if none of those, none of the above appeals to you, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there hardworking doing shows for guys like you to discover.

1452
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So go and seek them out, the independent podcast of the world. In the meantime we will resume with our independent podcast and some rapid fire news. Loki.

1453
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yes, I'm kind of happy to see that there's actually one of the D3 games I like. Onichambara Z2 Chaos is coming to Japan.

1454
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Now if you may not be familiar with the Onichambara series, it's basically like a bikini samurai game.

1455
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:29,000
A very scantily clad woman with samurai swords and a cowboy hat fighting zombies.

1456
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's been around since PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 4 version is going to feature 1080p and 60 frames per second.

1457
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Also I guess they're saying it's going to have new features like a cross-merge combination element, multi-character combo attacks and a quick time kill mode.

1458
01:43:51,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And I guess players will be able to trace lines on the DualShock 4 touchpad to deliver critical blows to enemies and stuff.

1459
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It's supposed to be out in Japan in October. Hopefully that means it's also going to be out in North America, which is very likely.

1460
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
And the fact that it's also region free, also a good hope.

1461
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And I'm very excited because if a game like this is on the PlayStation 4, then that means that eventually Earth Defense Force will be on PlayStation 4 as well.

1462
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Speaking of which, man, that is a game I need to go back and finish playing because I started that back in February and I just kind of gave up on it.

1463
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Some positive notes in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com. Brad from PodCulture says,

1464
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Boy, talk about a guilty pleasure game. Fifth Dream says, finally, on a system I have. I'm going to totally get this.

1465
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I wish it would bring more of the simple series stuff over there like, we need an HD remake of Ambulance vs. Zombies.

1466
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Or they had one that was also with like little maids vs. zombies. They had a lot of things versus zombie games. I'd love to see that.

1467
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Alright, people love zombies it seems.

1468
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Yes. So, on top of that, there is a brand new rhythm game that's coming out on I believe IOS as well.

1469
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:23,000
It's a game called Alpha Beats. And what makes Alpha Beats a little different than your standard kind of tap to the music type game is it's also kind of mixing in like Scrabble in there.

1470
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,000
So you have to tap on the letters to the beat and you create words with them and you score points that way.

1471
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
That sounds kind of fun.

1472
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yeah, and apparently the game does have some pretty good music in it. It's only $1.99 so you can check that out on the IOS.

1473
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Are we talking licensed music when you say pretty good music or just originals?

1474
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,000
It's like indie stuff. Like they've got a disaster piece. It's the composer that did Fez.

1475
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Oh, okay.

1476
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
They've got some music from...

1477
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Kind of like the direction the new amplitude is going in a little bit.

1478
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

1479
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:04,000
And also if you want additional music they have in-app purchases for that. So you can get some additional music that way.

1480
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And then last but not least, a really strange looking game that kind of reminded me a whole ton of Noby Noby Boy or seriously like something that you would see from like the developers of Katamari.

1481
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:25,000
But it's a game called Push Me, Pull You. And it's basically a two versus two local multiplayer game.

1482
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And it's coming out I guess sometime in 2014 on PC, Mac, and Linux.

1483
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:42,000
But it involves almost like, not like a human centipede, but like you know, I don't know if you remember the cartoon Catdog where you know you have a cat on one end and a dog on the other end.

1484
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Well it's two torsos of humans attached to...

1485
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I remember that show. That's How Does It Take a Crap?

1486
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Yes. It's two torsos that are kind of attached to each other in the middle.

1487
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:59,000
And it makes like those Noby Noby Boy type thing. And you have to move a ball around with that.

1488
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:08,000
And so you're fighting against other, you know, other players that way. And so you kind of have to like, you know, ride around each other and get the ball around.

1489
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I don't know. It looks silly. And should be coming out later this year.

1490
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
But yeah, totally getting the Noby Noby vibe from that.

1491
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Very cool. How'd you check that out? Lots of neat sounding games there. Guilty pleasure to music puzzle to genres I like to okay whatever. I'll try it.

1492
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Alright, moving on. Let's talk Virtual Console for a minute. We haven't seen a lot a lot of activity on Wii U Virtual Console lately.

1493
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
And Sega was a big big supporter of Virtual Console. Like all the Sega classics out there and all sorts of forums.

1494
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:46,000
But apparently no current plans for Wii U Virtual Console games from Sega. And this was in response to a Twitter.

1495
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Now Sega did clarify these comments a little bit in a statement saying quote Sega would like to clarify a statement that was issued over Twitter.

1496
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:03,000
All options are currently on the table concerning development for the Wii U Virtual Console. Although there are no immediate plans, this does not negate the possibility and exploration of creating for this platform.

1497
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:11,000
So in other words, nothing now and nothing on the table for the near future but they're not pulling like an EA or something where they're like we're done with you, bye.

1498
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Sega loves the Wii U. I mean they have their own, the Sonic games are coming exclusive to the Wii U and 3DS.

1499
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:25,000
So I would think that they're in a pretty good, you know, standing. And I don't even think, they probably just maybe they're just not making a lot of money off of those.

1500
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And the fact that they'd be reissuing probably games that have been on there before that it's just almost not worth it to put the effort in.

1501
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:37,000
And let's be real, if you're trying to play a classic Sega game, there's an abundance of places available to play said games.

1502
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Including what the Sonic collection, Mega Sonic Genesis, I don't know.

1503
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Yeah, I want to say that they're probably making a ton of money off of that stuff on Steam because that's where it's at.

1504
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:58,000
You can get like 40 games for like 5 bucks. So Virtual Console is kind of hard to justify paying $6 a game when they're so readily available at other places.

1505
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It really is, it really is. Maybe the portability of the 3DS. And the 3D remakes are something. That's, you know, a little different.

1506
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:16,000
But, yeah. Alright, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, a little bit of rabble rabble going on right now over the Club Nintendo Elite rewards which were unveiled this week.

1507
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:27,000
The North America rewards were unveiled and, you know, in years past they've given away like, you know, they'll send you things in the mail like calendars and sometimes even like little collectibles and really cool little things.

1508
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Well, this year, none of that. All the rewards are downloadable games.

1509
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:48,000
If you are Platinum, you can get, you can choose from Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Dylan's Rolling Western, Dr. Luigi, Earthbound, Fluidity Spin Cycle, Game & Wario, Mario & Donkey Kong Minis on the Move, and NES Remix.

1510
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Some of those games, by the way, are 3DS games, not just Wii U games in there.

1511
01:49:51,000 --> 01:50:03,000
If you are a Gold status, you can get Donkey Kong 3, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Metroid, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Land 2, 6 Golden Coins, Wario Land 2, and Zelda 2 The Adventures of Link.

1512
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
So, some people not happy that they went all DLC.

1513
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
So you only get to pick one of those?

1514
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Yeah, you get to pick one of those.

1515
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
That's like 5 bucks for the Gold set.

1516
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
For the Gold level, yeah.

1517
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
And so, some people not happy about that.

1518
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I understand why people are a little irritated because they went and did those surveys.

1519
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Because, you know, in the past, the rewards have been very lucrative, and I get that.

1520
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
But at the same time, reality check, you guys.

1521
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Nintendo hasn't exactly been bringing in the cash this year.

1522
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
So they have to make some cutbacks some places, and this is one of them.

1523
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
You know, so at least there's something being given away here.

1524
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And probably next year's going to be a lot better because they're going to have the Amiibo figures.

1525
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Yeah.

1526
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
So you'll see something like that.

1527
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Yeah, perhaps.

1528
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
But, yeah, I just, you know, take it with a grain of salt, you guys.

1529
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Nintendo hasn't had the best year.

1530
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
This is where they had to make some cutbacks.

1531
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
They can't exactly afford to buy everybody these little minifigures and, you know, send them all to people's houses this year.

1532
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I'm a little, like, you know, I'm like, well, I'm Gold status on Club Nintendo.

1533
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
And I pretty much have every single one of those games that I wanted.

1534
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I guess I'm going to end up getting Donkey Kong 3 on 3DS because it's like the one thing I don't have.

1535
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
You know, so all right, I guess I'll get that.

1536
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
But I'm not, like, mad.

1537
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I'm a little bit like, oh, man, I was hoping for something a little better.

1538
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:28,000
But I also kind of think, like, I've gotten way more bang for my buck out of the whole 10% back on the Wii U when you buy the games digitally.

1539
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I've gotten way better perks from that than this.

1540
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
So you win some, you lose some.

1541
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I'm just still thinking about the statue we got from Club Nintendo.

1542
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Right.

1543
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
And it was just a really nice, you know, Super Mario Brothers cast.

1544
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Well, that was when Nintendo was making buku bucks.

1545
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
They're not now.

1546
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So this is what happens.

1547
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
You want the perks, buy more Nintendo.

1548
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Exactly.

1549
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Maybe, I mean, if Mario Kart 8 keeps selling, maybe there'll be more of that next year.

1550
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Who knows? Who knows?

1551
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
All right.

1552
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Let's see.

1553
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
One more story for you guys.

1554
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
This is a game that was actually unveiled at GamerX.

1555
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I believe I was at the panel where they talked about this game for the first time.

1556
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:11,000
It is a game from Atari, of all folks, called Pride Fest.

1557
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Pride Fest is a game coming from Atari where you will be creating and launching your first gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender pride parade.

1558
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:27,000
The game will allow players to design and customize floats, solve challenges to unlock new festival and parade supplies,

1559
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:33,000
and each building has a fun capacity, and once it's filled, the building upgrades and draws even more city folk to the party.

1560
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
No further details at this time, no images or anything like that.

1561
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
But I need to know if they have t-shirt cannons, because that's really the most important thing.

1562
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Yeah.

1563
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
As long as I get to make my asexual float, I'm happy.

1564
01:52:47,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I think it's, you know, on one hand, I'm kind of like, all right, this is just going to be another one of those dippy management, tiny tower-esque iPhone games, you know, whatever, whatever.

1565
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:10,000
But at the same time, it is really cool that Atari, which has a lot of history behind it, is doing a, like, pride game.

1566
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Let's just hope, and I'm glad that they're doing that, let's just hope that it's done tastefully as well.

1567
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Yeah, there's a lot of room for error with that in there.

1568
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Fifth Dream says gay pride tycoon, and then gay pride simulator 2015.

1569
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Yeah, and sometimes these pride events can be pretty commercial, so I'm curious to see how they pull it off. We'll see.

1570
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I'm trying not to be a cynic about it. I'm really not. I think it's really cool that Atari went to GamerX. I think it's really cool that they were kind of feeling out the con.

1571
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I think it's really cool that Atari has a game coming out.

1572
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:46,000
There's that too. And it's great. What are you laughing about?

1573
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
SSG100 Matt.

1574
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:53,000
SSG100 Matt in chat says, is there a Mama Tits expansion where you can beat down protesters?

1575
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I love Mama Tits.

1576
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Oh my god. You know what's funny? A friend of mine I've known online for years. A friend of mine online dates back to Life Journal, is now a drag queen in Seattle, and like knows Mama Tits, and actually wrote the article about that that went viral.

1577
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So it was really funny to kind of watch it from his perspective on Facebook.

1578
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
That's cool.

1579
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Yeah, all these people are like seeing that video. So, anyway, um, yeah, that would actually be really awesome. You know, but the game that's not talked about in this story is that they also confirmed that RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis 2 is in the making for iPhone.

1580
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Work! Yes!

1581
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
And they go, woooo!

1582
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Have you ever played, I'm sure, Loki, have you ever played RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis?

1583
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
No, I have not.

1584
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I haven't either.

1585
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
It's, you know, it's one of those things where it's like you have to try it if you're a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race.

1586
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Is that like the Kim Kardashian game?

1587
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:52,000
No, it's a little better than that, but like, it's all these quotes, because RuPaul actually recorded dialogue, and they got like Pandora Box, a bunch of people to do dialogue.

1588
01:54:52,000 --> 01:55:02,000
So it's like as you're running through it, you know, you hear a character, yes! Woo! You better work! Amen! You know, it's just like all the little catchphrases from the show.

1589
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
It's fun for five minutes, and then you're like, turn the volume down.

1590
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Okay, I have to ask, is Drag U still running?

1591
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
No, Drag U was cancelled a year or two ago.

1592
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I'd never watched Drag Race, but I watched Drag U.

1593
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Yeah, RuPaul cancelled it. Well, he didn't cancel it, but confirmed it was cancelled a couple years ago.

1594
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:25,000
That was just such a cool show, because I know that's not what we're talking about.

1595
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:31,000
It's fine. You know what, if we want to have a Drag Race side conversation, we will. God damn it.

1596
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Just because I thought that it was good that it was, you know, sort of in the theme of the whole glamour of drag, but something that was for women who were feeling drab.

1597
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Yeah, it was great.

1598
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I thought that, because there's a lot that women can learn about just glamour and letting loose from drag queens.

1599
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:55,000
It was a very new version of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. You remember that show? It was very, you know...

1600
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Love that show.

1601
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
But on top of that, it was...

1602
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I don't know why I love that show.

1603
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Loki loved that show more than I did, like seriously.

1604
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Except the first, was it the pilot episode or the pilot season or whatever, what the fuck was going on there?

1605
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Because the cast was like, eh.

1606
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
It was different.

1607
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Yeah, I didn't like different. I don't like different.

1608
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
You bought the soundtrack, even. I remember that.

1609
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I downloaded the soundtrack.

1610
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
No, Rob, I bought the soundtrack. At least three tracks out of it made it into my spin class that I was in.

1611
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
It had like, was it the...

1612
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
It had Basement Jackson in it.

1613
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Oh god. Where's Basement Jackson? Have they released a new album?

1614
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
That's something you need to look into, because I fucking love Basement Jax.

1615
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
In the basement. At the Alamo.

1616
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
At any rate...

1617
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I gotta look that up right now.

1618
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
It's not, you know, dressing up in things that someone would wear every day.

1619
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,000
But it was a really, you know, just interesting, fun thing to do.

1620
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And I don't know if you've also heard of the women who dress quote in drag.

1621
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Who basically go from...

1622
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Both queens.

1623
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Yeah. But I think...

1624
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Which is, and I mean no disrespect with this comment. Absolutely none.

1625
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:12,000
But when Victoria shows me all this burlesque stuff she's doing, I'm like, so that's basically being a drag queen.

1626
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
But like taking your clothes off.

1627
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Oh my god, there's so many albums I've missed!

1628
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
What the hell?

1629
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I didn't...

1630
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Alright, anyway, anyway.

1631
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Yeah.

1632
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Alright, we can talk about...

1633
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
So how about this, how about I start watching Drag Race next season?

1634
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Fantastic, we should have a viewing party or something, it would be fun.

1635
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Alright, anyway, from drag queens to a very similar subject, Star Wars, right?

1636
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Dark Saga?

1637
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Oh yeah.

1638
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I mean...

1639
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Because there were lots of queens in the Old Republic.

1640
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Did you see what Queen Amidala's wearing?

1641
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Have you ever seen Travis doing his Queen Amidala?

1642
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
With the bra on his head.

1643
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Yes.

1644
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Which actually is funny, I miss taking a picture of my cat with my bra on her head.

1645
01:57:54,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Because I just left it on the bed and next thing I know I see the cat's head peeking out from under the middle bit.

1646
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I'm like...

1647
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,000
And the first thing I thought is, my cat is Queen Amidala, thanks Travis.

1648
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So anyway.

1649
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Star Wars The Old Republic generated 165 million last year.

1650
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
But guess what's still on top?

1651
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Wow.

1652
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Wow.

1653
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Wow.

1654
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,000
And I actually went and looked at the list and worldwide MMO titles in 2013.

1655
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Top was World of Warcraft, followed by Lineage.

1656
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:31,000
And then Terra Online, followed by Star Wars The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, which I played for a little bit.

1657
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It was pretty.

1658
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Eve Online, Ion, Blade and Soul, Lineage 2, and Rift.

1659
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I'm kind of surprised that Terra's as high up on that list.

1660
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I guess it's bigger in Korea and stuff though, isn't it?

1661
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Yeah, and this is a worldwide list.

1662
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Yeah, okay.

1663
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Well, yeah, Lineage wouldn't even be in the top 10 if it was just America.

1664
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I mean, no offense, Lineage is fine.

1665
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
It's just that that game has its huge following in Asia.

1666
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I still have my Lineage Coke can.

1667
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Oh, right.

1668
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Yeah, not a bad game.

1669
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Not shading the game, I'm just saying.

1670
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I'm still incredibly jealous that China has Call of Duty Online.

1671
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I would be very curious what would happen to that list if you threw the MOBAs into the mix.

1672
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Because, you know, something we're not talking a lot about tonight, but is very much going on, is like, you know, the International for Dota 2, and it's on frickin' ESPN3.

1673
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I've still not tried a MOBA at all.

1674
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
You really? Just try it for fun.

1675
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:33,000
The problem is, I think the easiest one to pick up and learn is Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm, but it's still in its super special secret club invite phase.

1676
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
So you have to, you know, get an invite in order to play it.

1677
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
But League of Legends has a decent tutorial.

1678
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Dota has a really good tutorial, too. I just think, or Dota 2.

1679
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I just think the problem with Dota 2 is that there's a lot more micromanagement in that game.

1680
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Like, when you look at the management in that game versus Heroes of the Storm, it's a lot.

1681
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
And that doesn't make it bad, people. I'm not saying that makes Dota 2 bad.

1682
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I enjoyed my time with Dota 2.

1683
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
What about the DC one that they have? Don't they have, like, a DC or Marvel one or something?

1684
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Oh, I'm sure everybody's going for that now.

1685
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
By the way, Alan's made quite a bit of commentary about Queer Eye.

1686
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Oh, please.

1687
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
In the chat.

1688
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Oh, I'll read it here.

1689
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Yeah, you read it.

1690
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Okay, so fine. If the chatters want to talk about Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, I don't have a problem with that.

1691
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Alan Huckabee says,

1692
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy sucked after the third season because the guys they made over just got hotter and hotter and hotter.

1693
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
The dudes in Season 1 and Season 2 were real trolls, so the turnaround was incredibly impressive.

1694
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
In later seasons, it was like, okay, this dude is not having trouble getting laid.

1695
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
We're just giving him some hot bro 25k of new shit for his apartment and a haircut.

1696
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
This isn't interesting anymore.

1697
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
True that.

1698
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:40,000
It kind of just jumped the shark at some point, especially when they started having the Queer Eye for the Straight Girl and all that.

1699
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
It wasn't the same thing.

1700
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:48,000
So, anyway, more news. We have Pinball FX2 coming out for Xbox One on July 31st.

1701
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
The circle is complete.

1702
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:56,000
And it will include, basically, the entire Pinball FX2 library, or nearly all.

1703
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Including the Star Wars packs, the Marvel Pinball Tables, Plants vs. Zombies, and the original Zen Tables.

1704
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:13,000
And it is going to be, the tables will be 1080p, 60 frames per second, and they will range between $249 and $299 with packs at $999.

1705
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
So, and that's in American dollars.

1706
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:24,000
And then last, but not least, we have a game that's now called Game Journal Simulator.

1707
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Basically, you are playing as a journalist for a video game company.

1708
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:40,000
And so, basically, it's just, it's something more inspired by Goat Simulator and Rock Simulator 2014.

1709
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:45,000
A collaborative project between, I guess, Evangelho.

1710
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:50,000
So, are there two buttons in the simulator? One for copy and one for paste?

1711
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
It's a fair question. He's laughing.

1712
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Oh, no, because you have to have the action menu button for find inappropriately copyrighted material to use as your source.

1713
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Repost, repost, repost, repost.

1714
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Let's make Podcast Simulator.

1715
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Podcast Simulator.

1716
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Clickbait headline, clickbait headline.

1717
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
That's right.

1718
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,000
You won't believe the things that they're doing in this generation of gaming.

1719
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Here's ten reasons.

1720
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Let's talk all about Kickstarter, picture of giant breasts.

1721
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
You know, it's like, what?

1722
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I got to see this picture.

1723
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Oh, that's not even, doesn't have anything to do with it.

1724
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Alright, that was some rapid fire news.

1725
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1726
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Because every week on this show, we go to our Facebook community and we go to our Google Plus community.

1727
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
And when you put those words together, you get foogle.

1728
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:51,000
And because of my playlist reset during the show earlier, I don't have my music for this.

1729
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y.

1730
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I kind of want a new theme song.

1731
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
We have foogle-y, we have foogle-y, I don't know.

1732
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Oh, my God. Can somebody put that through auto-tune?

1733
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
No, it wasn't out of tune, was it?

1734
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
No, no, put it in auto-tune.

1735
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Alright, forget it. I found it.

1736
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
It's not here, foogle.

1737
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Alright, here it is, the foogle question of the week.

1738
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
As technology improves, the graphics in games gets more and more real.

1739
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:34,000
In fact, a news station used a screenshot from Metal Gear Solid 5 in a report on Child Soldiers.

1740
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
So we talked about this earlier in the show.

1741
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Womp, womp.

1742
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:41,000
When was a point from you in video game graphics history where you said,

1743
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
wow, these graphics look so real.

1744
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Come on, we've all done it, right?

1745
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Like, they can't get more real than they are now, right?

1746
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I could actually tell you an example.

1747
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
You've got to get away till the end.

1748
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Admit it, was it Mode 7, or was it the PlayStation 2 or even 3 era

1749
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
for you to believe a Final Fantasy cut scene looked way too good?

1750
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
What is it?

1751
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
So let's go to some of the comments.

1752
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
We're going to start over on Facebook.

1753
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
From AZHP who said, when the PlayStation 2 was being revealed to E3

1754
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
and they showed that it could render Final Fantasy VIII's ballroom scene in real time,

1755
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I was blown away, I wanted the PlayStation 2 right then and there.

1756
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And they never did do that, of course.

1757
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
That was like the PlayStation 3 and the Final Fantasy VII pages.

1758
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
It's just concept only.

1759
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
They like to do that a lot.

1760
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Robert K says, it wasn't until the Dreamcast and Shenmue that I was left absolutely gobsmacked.

1761
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:35,000
For the time, the realism was nothing short of astounding to me.

1762
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Characters that didn't look like you'd lose an eye if you bumped into them

1763
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
in a true living lifelike world and a kitten.

1764
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Tech 2030 says, Grand Theft Auto 3 was the first game that blew me away with its graphics.

1765
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I was a Nintendo kid up until that point, but after playing it at a friend's house,

1766
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I went out and bought a PlayStation 2 for it.

1767
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
SHJ100Matt says, I don't remember the specific game,

1768
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
but I do remember family members being blown away at times.

1769
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,000
My father was blown away by Star Wars Shadows of the Empire on the N64,

1770
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
and my older brother thought I was watching a live NBA game

1771
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
when he caught me playing NBA 2K1 on Dreamcast.

1772
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Rod L replies and says, I'm going to show my age now.

1773
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
The 1990 hit on Commodore 64, Creatures.

1774
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I love this answer, and I must be showing my age too.

1775
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,000
The art style was very much in the vein of the kids' TV show Trap Door,

1776
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
but with a bloody-minded sense of humor.

1777
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
It was the quality of the animation that blew me away.

1778
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I remember thinking, this is like watching a TV show.

1779
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
That's an awesome answer.

1780
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And Rod is over in the UK where the Commodore 64 was even bigger than it was here,

1781
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
so I'm sure that's where that kind of comes from a little bit.

1782
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Because I don't remember that game over here,

1783
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
but by 1990, we had a Nintendo in the house,

1784
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
and I wasn't playing as many games on Commodore 64 at that point.

1785
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I miss Commodore.

1786
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Sniff. All right.

1787
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I'll find you one.

1788
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Huh?

1789
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I'll find you one.

1790
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
My parents have one to give me if it still works.

1791
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
It's in their garage.

1792
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Get it.

1793
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I know. I don't even know what to play on it.

1794
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I don't have discs.

1795
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Where am I going to find five and a quarter floppies to put Commodore games on?

1796
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I'll get back to you on that.

1797
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Okay. Good.

1798
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Renee, if you guys want to donate something to push the show forward,

1799
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
you want to say a nice thank you or something for the past few years,

1800
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
get me a Commodore 64.

1801
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Not that I'm not above begging when it comes to a Commodore 64.

1802
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Don't they have those newer ones?

1803
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Yeah, I really thought about getting one of those.

1804
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
They were kind of overpriced.

1805
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
They did an MSX too, so if somebody wants to.

1806
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
No, actually, if anyone wants to donate anything to the show,

1807
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
it'll be a Duo RX for Jamie.

1808
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Just send us classic games.

1809
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
That's it.

1810
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Send Jamie a Duo RX.

1811
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
And some chicken.

1812
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
And some chicken.

1813
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
All right.

1814
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Renee replies and says,

1815
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
It took me a little while to think of when exactly this happened,

1816
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
but I pinpointed to when Virtua Fighter came out in the arcades

1817
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
and then onto the Sega Saturn.

1818
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
That game and that console really opened my eyes

1819
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
and made me realize that this was what was to come in the future of video games.

1820
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Alan Alchemy says,

1821
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Here are my biggest three.

1822
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
The Mode 7 used in the opening minutes of Secret of Mana.

1823
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
The pre-rendered opening cinematics of Resident Evil 2.

1824
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Ooh, that's a good one.

1825
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:09,000
And the graphics of the launch title Soul Calibur HD remake for the Dreamcast.

1826
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Joe G says,

1827
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I'd have to say the opening cut scene from Final Fantasy VII.

1828
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
It was so gorgeous.

1829
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I'd say Final Fantasy X, but I played.

1830
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Oh, sorry.

1831
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
It was XII, not VII.

1832
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Sorry, guys.

1833
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,000
And that was Haseo Sumeruogawa who said that.

1834
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Final Fantasy XII.

1835
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I misread.

1836
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I just saw the II.

1837
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,000
But, yeah, the opening scene to XII was pretty kick butt.

1838
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Pretty kick butt.

1839
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
All right.

1840
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Let's go over to our Google Plus page

1841
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
because I know we got a couple answers over there.

1842
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I don't want to make sure we read those too.

1843
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Let's see.

1844
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I think there's just a couple.

1845
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Three.

1846
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Act Def says,

1847
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I think it was during the PlayStation 2, Xbox GameCube generations

1848
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
that actually got me to say this almost looks real.

1849
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Granted, in comparison to what we have now, they kind of suck.

1850
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
But it was pretty cool to see some realistic graphics back in the day

1851
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,000
and just be amazed at how much video games have improved in that sense.

1852
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Ronnie B says,

1853
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
When I played Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

1854
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
That's a really good answer.

1855
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Redertainment says,

1856
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I was playing NBA 2K13 and my mom saw me playing it,

1857
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
thinking it was an actual live game.

1858
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
My mom asked me why I was watching a basketball game from earlier in the year.

1859
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I simply told her that it was a video game and not a real one.

1860
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I've never had a problem telling the difference between video games and reality

1861
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
because reality bites.

1862
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
There you go.

1863
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Thank you for those answers from our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1864
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Dark Soccer, I know you were waiting to answer this yourself.

1865
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
When did video games, when did it get too real?

1866
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
It wasn't necessarily a thing for me.

1867
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Just because, I mean, if you put a CG thing next to you,

1868
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I can almost always pick it out.

1869
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
But then again, I know things to look for.

1870
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I can't turn that off.

1871
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
My boss, when I worked at Aladdin's Castle, his name was Anthony.

1872
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I would love to find him again.

1873
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
He was a great guy.

1874
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
But we had Tekken 3 there.

1875
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
And this was before any other place had Tekken 3.

1876
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
They were only at Namco Arcades.

1877
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,000
And he was looking at the intro to Tekken 3 and he's like,

1878
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
he's like, I promise you 10 years from now,

1879
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,000
no one's going to be able to tell the difference.

1880
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And it was just like,

1881
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
and in that case, yeah,

1882
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
there were some games you really could not tell the difference.

1883
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Yeah.

1884
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
So, and I think my response was,

1885
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
no, they're always going to be too pretty to be real.

1886
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Strangely accurate.

1887
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,000
That was during my Jinx obsession,

1888
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
because I was vaguely obsessed with Jinx Kazama.

1889
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Loki, do you have an answer for this?

1890
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
There's never really been a thing where I've said,

1891
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
oh, this is going to be like the best it's ever going to be,

1892
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
but the graphics and graphics of the five are pretty damn impressive.

1893
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Yeah.

1894
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Even just the current gen, or last gen stuff, I guess, is pretty nice.

1895
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I mean, as a game, I guess you got to get it on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

1896
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Whatever, right?

1897
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Add that to the list.

1898
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
But yeah, I mean, I think that's really impressive.

1899
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I want to say there was probably a time like PlayStation 2 or something,

1900
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,000
probably one of the intro videos or something that looked really good.

1901
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I don't know.

1902
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I remember being really impressed with Twisted Metal Black

1903
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
when that first came out, and that's even pretty basic.

1904
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I really wish they'd do another.

1905
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I know they did Twisted Metal, but that was all fucked up.

1906
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I really wish they'd do more of a Twisted Metal Black type game.

1907
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
It'd be amazing.

1908
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
All right.

1909
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I would say my answer would be, honestly,

1910
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I would go way back to the Nintendo Entertainment System

1911
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,000
and a game that, when it came out, I was like, this is like a cartoon.

1912
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I'm playing a cartoon, and it looks just like a TV cartoon.

1913
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Mega Man 2 was the game, and I was like, the graphics are so freaking good.

1914
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
It's like I'm playing a cartoon.

1915
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
It really is.

1916
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:51,000
And then probably, honestly, I remember playing on the Super Nintendo Pilot Wings

1917
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
and just being blown away by the Mode 7 stuff.

1918
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Like, how cool was that the first time you saw that?

1919
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I mean, you go back at it and look at it now, and you're like,

1920
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
God, it's so pixely and blocky.

1921
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,000
But at the time, being a kid, especially,

1922
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
and taking that big step up from the Nintendo Entertainment System

1923
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
just blew my mind.

1924
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
The Rocket Belt stuff was so much fun.

1925
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I remember, like, arcade game-wise, I mean,

1926
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I used to love some of the driving cabinets and stuff,

1927
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:19,000
but one of the most fun driving cabinets I had would probably have been

1928
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
the F-Zero GX cabinet.

1929
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Oh, yes.

1930
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
That was just awesome.

1931
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
It's awesome.

1932
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
It's really just kind of the sense of speed,

1933
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,000
especially when you get those fancy cabinets that tilt and everything.

1934
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Oh, that was awesome.

1935
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Good times. Good times.

1936
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
All right, great answers.

1937
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Thanks, you guys, for another successful FUGO Question of the Week.

1938
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Let's get back onto some other gaming news.

1939
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
We'll run through this pretty quick because I know we have a few emails

1940
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
because we weren't here last week.

1941
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,000
We've got to catch up on some emails.

1942
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
So, Loki.

1943
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
So this is kind of neat.

1944
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Sony kind of picking up the, hey, you know what?

1945
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
People are actually using Playroom to do things other than just play Playroom.

1946
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,000
They're actually doing shows and all sorts of stuff.

1947
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Of course, not necessarily bringing light to the porn stuff,

1948
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
but, yeah, they're doing shows.

1949
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So guess what?

1950
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
There's going to be a brand new update that's coming called Set Maker,

1951
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
and it adds a bunch of new functionality to it to aid in production of hosted shows.

1952
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
You can use a tablet as a production suite.

1953
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,000
You'd be able to add all sorts of different virtual objects and effects,

1954
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
studio lights, digital banners.

1955
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
This is really cool.

1956
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
They can even interact with Twitch and put polls up where they can,

1957
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
you know, who's your favorite character?

1958
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,000
And they list some stuff, and you're able to vote in real time on there

1959
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
and that kind of thing.

1960
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,000
So really cool stuff.

1961
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I'm glad to see they're kind of embracing what people are doing in game room,

1962
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:45,000
and maybe we'll actually see some more shows out of this.

1963
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It'd be pretty cool.

1964
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Yeah, you know, I'm all for indie broadcasting,

1965
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
and I think it's really cool.

1966
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Do you think this is something we should – I'm going to pose this to the chatters.

1967
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I know that Dark Soccer is not interested in doing video,

1968
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,000
and she doesn't have to because, you know, even when we were doing the Justin TV thing,

1969
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
we found a way around it.

1970
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
But is video something you guys are seriously interested in?

1971
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Because if so, we have a space for it.

1972
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I can plop a PlayStation 4 over there.

1973
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
We can maneuver Jamie so that maybe just her shoes are on camera or something

1974
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
and do the show that way again.

1975
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I'll make sure to wear funny socks.

1976
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I think you should do that.

1977
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I'll be Nanny.

1978
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Yes, you're like Nanny from Muppet Babies.

1979
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
I'll speak with a trombone or I'll wear a mask.

1980
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Although I just want to say I think you're a very pretty gal,

1981
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
and you should have nothing to worry about with a camera.

1982
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I respect that it is your right to choose who you'd like to do it or not.

1983
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I don't want it to steal my soul.

1984
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

1985
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
But yeah, maybe that's something we're going to have to look into.

1986
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
I don't know. Would you guys be interested in that?

1987
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Rob, I'm like Daft Punk.

1988
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Huh?

1989
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I'm like Daft Punk.

1990
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Are you?

1991
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I'll have an Android outfit for –

1992
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I would have to see how it affects, stream wise,

1993
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:58,000
if you can stream that to Twitch and it might be hard watching the chat room for Twitch.

1994
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I don't know how it even displays on TV as far as showing what's on there.

1995
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I don't know if it's –

1996
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
That's a very good point, especially on nights when we have a lot of people here

1997
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:11,000
and we have guests, especially when Jason's here as well,

1998
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
and then we have another guest on top of that.

1999
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Everybody's got their computers.

2000
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
We've got to be very careful with the bandwidth.

2001
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,000
That's a very good point and something we have to take into consideration is that audio gets priority.

2002
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
The show is called Orange Lawns Radio and that is always going to be the priority.

2003
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I never got the thrill of watching it because I kind of –

2004
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,000
but at the same time, I realize some of our listeners want to see that

2005
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,000
and we do have these things that happen occasionally where it's like it is a visual reference.

2006
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Like something falls over or something funny happens or I'm saying look at that

2007
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
and it just inevitably happens even though it's a radio show.

2008
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
So I can respect that.

2009
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,000
But I love the idea, so we'll see. We will see.

2010
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,000
All right. Yeah, sg100matt says, I don't see why not.

2011
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Sounds like something that could be cool, but I would block the chat room on there.

2012
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Too much venom.

2013
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Oh, I would too.

2014
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I wouldn't even have it on the screen and I would have some type of sign that said to join chat,

2015
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
go to live that – or we could actually moderate it.

2016
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
And then if you don't even pay attention to the comments in there, it won't even be an issue

2017
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
because yeah, I'm not going to have people trolling for the sake of trolling.

2018
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Anybody who has something intelligent to say is intelligent enough to go to another website to do it, right?

2019
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
There you go.

2020
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:25,000
All right, let's talk about Super Smash Brothers Wii U, which is – is that its real name?

2021
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,000
That's the name they're going to release it as?

2022
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:31,000
It's actually – the box art says Super Smash Brothers for Wii U.

2023
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
That's so weird that –

2024
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
It's so stupid is what it is.

2025
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I'm not a fan of the name. I'm really not. I mean, I understand –

2026
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Yeah, the other one's Super Smash Brothers for 3DS.

2027
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I don't like that. I don't know what they were thinking with that, but whatever. So it is what it is.

2028
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
It's worth their thinking that we don't want to come up with a name.

2029
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
This is the company that thought Wii was a good name?

2030
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:53,000
But it ended up working. But anyway, anyway.

2031
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:59,000
So apparently there is a rumor out there, thanks to a GameStop manager, so to tell you with a big grain of salt,

2032
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:06,000
that every copy of Smash Brothers that comes out for the Wii U is going to come with a free amiibo figure

2033
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
and that the street date for this will be November 21st when this comes out.

2034
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I wouldn't doubt this at all, actually. This makes a lot of sense.

2035
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:21,000
The date makes sense. The amiibo figure being thrown in there makes a lot of sense to kind of get people started with that.

2036
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I wouldn't doubt that there might be two SKUs, one with a figure and one without, or that, you know, this being GameStop,

2037
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:35,000
the figure is a pre-order exclusive at GameStop. Maybe they get one figure. Amazon gets another figure.

2038
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Target gets another. Who knows? Something along those lines. I really hope it doesn't go that way.

2039
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:49,000
But Nintendo has done something that I really hated. The Xenoblade thing when they released that only at GameStop

2040
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:53,000
and online on Nintendo's website. That was like the worst thing they ever did.

2041
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:59,000
So it could be a possibility. But yeah, we'll see.

2042
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Also, in the Smash Brothers universe, there were some new characters confirmed this week.

2043
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:09,000
A couple of folks from Fire Emblem, Lucina and Robin, and Captain Falcon officially added to the Smash Brothers roster.

2044
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
And Lady Robin.

2045
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
That is right.

2046
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Because Nintendo has no problem rendering a woman.

2047
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Rendering female characters is very easy for Nintendo.

2048
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
It is a little weird to see.

2049
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,000
The Wii U is simpler hardware, Dark Soccer. Is that the issue?

2050
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
It's a little strange that they're gender swapping just that one character.

2051
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
I mean, are they gonna...

2052
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Oh yeah, Wii Fit Trainer can gender swap male and female.

2053
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Yeah, but that's two different characters though. I don't think there's a female Robin in Fire Emblem.

2054
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I think it's just that they created this new character. Does that increase the roster?

2055
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Although, maybe Lucinda will have a swap with...

2056
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Can we get a male Samus, but just call it Justin Bailey?

2057
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
That'd just be Sam.

2058
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
And he is Justin Bailey.

2059
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Alright.

2060
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Yeah, so that's pretty cool that that's out there.

2061
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
However, the only downside to that is that I still have not had Nests confirmed for me.

2062
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Look, I've given up hope that Luc... I don't care that Lucas doesn't come back.

2063
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
I've given up on that a long time ago.

2064
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
PK Fire!

2065
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Where the fuck is Ness? Where is he?

2066
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Do not piss me off, Nintendo.

2067
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Do not piss me off.

2068
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Well, they have Gamescom, they have Comic-Con.

2069
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
They've gotta save their announcements.

2070
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
They're gonna slowly... they're slow burning this.

2071
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
True.

2072
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Shane's texting me from the other room saying that in Fire Emblem, when you pick your gender, you can be female Robin.

2073
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,000
So it is...

2074
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Okay, so it's a legit character thing.

2075
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Thanks, Shane. Who's too lazy.

2076
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Thank you, Shane.

2077
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
She's screaming from the bedroom. Welcome!

2078
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
He's in the living room.

2079
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Where's your living room?

2080
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I saw him just in there.

2081
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
You texted me from the living room?

2082
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
He said he was lazy.

2083
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Do I need to go put a condenser mic in there?

2084
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
He said, no, what's that?

2085
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
What's a condenser mic?

2086
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Alright. Moving on.

2087
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
That kind of makes me think of the weird conversation I had with Dan the other day.

2088
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,000
What's that?

2089
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Mopar. Mostly old parts and rust.

2090
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And then he had to go look it up.

2091
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I know mocap. Alright.

2092
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
No, it's Dan got filters for my car.

2093
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Dark Sakura. Let's move on. Another story.

2094
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Well, people don't like this bullshit about the net neutrality changes.

2095
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
They really don't like it.

2096
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Like, you heard about the guy who went in and tested the throttling.

2097
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,000
And then posted that up for everyone to get pissed off about.

2098
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Well, there's also now over 1 million comments to the FCC about the net neutrality changes.

2099
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:39,000
In fact, according to Gigi Sohn with the FCC, as of noon, and this was on the 17th of July,

2100
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:46,000
1,300,000 net neutrality comments had been filed with the FCC.

2101
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:55,000
And we had a lot of this put out, a comment put out by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee

2102
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:01,000
that runs a site called No Slow Lane saying, and I'll just read the quote on here.

2103
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:08,000
This is an extraordinary outcry from over 1 million Americans, forcing the FCC to extend its deadline to handle the deluge, make it clear.

2104
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
The American public demands that the FCC side with them on net neutrality.

2105
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Not big telecom companies like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Time Warner.

2106
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,000
And that's a quote coming from Keith Rota, the PCCC organizer.

2107
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Whoo! Keep making your voices heard. They're listening.

2108
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:32,000
That's great. Yeah, definitely. If you don't let your voice be heard in this government stuff,

2109
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:36,000
then they're just going to do what the companies are paying them to do.

2110
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:41,000
And your politicians will keep voting the way that their lobbyists pay them to.

2111
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Until they know that they won't get reelected if they continue to do so. So, very important.

2112
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:49,000
All right, just a few more stories and then the mailbag. Loki.

2113
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:55,000
So, in Europe, there was this whole thing about the free-to-play games and, you know,

2114
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:05,000
they basically forcing some, or they wanted some better restrictions regarding in-app, accidental in-app purchases made on different devices.

2115
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And they're actually pretty happy with how Google's handled everything.

2116
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Apple, on the other hand, hasn't really stepped up yet.

2117
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
And now, what exactly has Google done?

2118
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Well, they have decided in the European regions to actually not mark games that are free-to-play, if you will,

2119
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:29,000
that have in-app purchases as actually free.

2120
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
You can download them.

2121
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:38,000
You know, the advertising, I guess, might be, I'm not sure how they actually have them listed right now.

2122
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:44,000
They don't really have them listed as free, but you can just download the games even though they are free-to-play, but you have in-app purchases or something.

2123
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,000
They should have, like, a thing that says in-app purchases or something. I think it would be pretty good.

2124
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:54,000
If maybe not free or something. Or free with in-app purchases.

2125
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Why can't they do that? That doesn't seem that hard to say.

2126
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
And this, I think...

2127
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Well, on the app store on the iPhone, it does say right under the album art, it says,

2128
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,000
this app may contain in-app purchases or it says this app contains in-app purchases.

2129
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
And you can even see what the top in-app purchases are to get a sense of what's in the app.

2130
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I know. I think, once again, it's just people not taking responsibility.

2131
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:25,000
And a lot of this comes from, you know, the complaints filed against EA for Dungeon Keeper, which, you know, they advertise that as free,

2132
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:29,000
but it's definitely, you know, forcing...

2133
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:36,000
They're doing whatever they can to persuade you to buy in-app purchases by crippling the game so badly.

2134
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:44,000
I don't know. I think that they should maybe have a few more, you know, safeguards in place,

2135
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,000
but I think they're almost getting to the point where it's all they can really do,

2136
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
and it's time for the users to be responsible for what they're purchasing.

2137
02:22:53,000 --> 02:23:01,000
And if they're giving their kid their tablet and their kid is running in-app purchases because they forgot to put...

2138
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:07,000
They didn't put on parental settings or something like that, then I think it's really their own fault

2139
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
and they should be responsible for those purchases and can't say,

2140
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:16,000
oh, I didn't know that my child ran up $2,000 in purchases or something.

2141
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I don't know. Or maybe, well, they're not going to limit them to how much they can purchase per day,

2142
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
but, you know, maybe that might be a good option or something.

2143
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
By default or something, no.

2144
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Oh, they'll never do that because they don't want to inhibit you from spending money on their storefronts.

2145
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Alright, well, going to another story, and I bet this is one that Shane might actually get up and come into the room for.

2146
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
We'll see because it has to do with Power Rangers.

2147
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
What's that?

2148
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Yes, it's about the Power Rangers.

2149
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I'm going to screw something up. Just wait.

2150
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Alright, here's the deal.

2151
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,000
And this even came up earlier when we were talking about Kickstarter stuff.

2152
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:55,000
So Chroma Squad is this game that was on Kickstarter some time ago,

2153
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:59,000
and the developer, Behold Games, has put an update on their Kickstarter page

2154
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:07,000
saying that there is a royalty share deal being negotiated right now with the Power Rangers owner, Saban,

2155
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
who actually owns the rights to the Power Rangers right now.

2156
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,000
But here's the thing is that Chroma Squad isn't supposed to be about the Power Rangers.

2157
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
It's about the Sentai.

2158
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:25,000
And they actually say in the response that Behold Games wrote it to Joystiq, who is doing an article on this,

2159
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:30,000
said, quote, Sentai is a genre that is not a creation of Saban.

2160
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
So if we're negotiating a win-win partnership, we won't change anything in the game,

2161
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:39,000
and we'll make it in a way that we can get some advertisement from them and use some direct references of their show.

2162
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I know some of the players will like it.

2163
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:45,000
But it's not a genre. It's actually, it's a franchise.

2164
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,000
It's owned by Toei.

2165
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Yeah.

2166
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
So they're wrong again.

2167
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Well, they still earned $97,000 plus on Kickstarter back in 2013.

2168
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,000
The early access beta version of the game was up in April for their backers.

2169
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
And, yep, there's still some updates going on on Kickstarter about all that thing.

2170
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:09,000
And, by the way, Behold Games has agreed to discuss terms with Saban.

2171
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
They have not actually partnered with them yet.

2172
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,000
That is not something, like, they're not actually...

2173
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
But Saban doesn't, whatever.

2174
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
It's complicated, right?

2175
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Stupid.

2176
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
So, did I get everything, Shane?

2177
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Yeah.

2178
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Yeah, he said, eh.

2179
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Are you playing...

2180
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
For the record...

2181
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Are you playing Chroma Squad?

2182
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,000
For the record...

2183
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I can't even hear him.

2184
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Sentai is a genre.

2185
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Super Sentai is a copyright owned by...

2186
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I think it is Toei.

2187
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Yes.

2188
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
And, for the record, the first Sentai series was Gachamon.

2189
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Wait, Shane, are you playing Chroma Squad?

2190
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
No, I'm playing Pokemon.

2191
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
He said, no, I'm playing Pokemon.

2192
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Let's be honest.

2193
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Okay, Ramus' little thing is tokusatsu, but the Super Sentai is a copyrighted title.

2194
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,000
But, looking at, seriously, the looking at the pictures, you're like,

2195
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
okay, that's, you know, Power Rangers.

2196
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:13,000
I understand that, you know, Sentai is a genre, but it looks like Power Rangers.

2197
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:17,000
The other issue is there's a lot of people in this country who don't know better,

2198
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,000
who look at it and go, oh, it's a Power Rangers game.

2199
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,000
And, sometimes, that can be very tricky with the law.

2200
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Uh-oh, Shane came in to talk.

2201
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
He's got something very important to add to this.

2202
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
No, I was just going to say that I don't think Saban had a problem

2203
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,000
when Mario RPG had to ax some Rangers.

2204
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
That was a rip-off of Sentai stuff.

2205
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
That can be parody at that point.

2206
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Yeah, and this is parody, too, isn't it?

2207
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I mean, there's nothing on here that Saban needs to touch and ruin, so.

2208
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Does Saban like to touch and ruin things?

2209
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Yes, the last four seasons of Power Rangers have been god-awful.

2210
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Allegedly, just because I don't want to get sued by him, too.

2211
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
It's true.

2212
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
All right.

2213
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
All right, there you go.

2214
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
The word from Shane himself there.

2215
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Well, the thing is, though, is they're not going to be able to,

2216
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I mean, they don't have the money to fight that,

2217
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:16,000
so they kind of have to take whatever deal they're going to get.

2218
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
But, yes, they should have really made them not look like Power Rangers,

2219
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:26,000
because it seriously looks very close, and it gets down to that,

2220
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
oh, well, it's parody or something like that.

2221
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:33,000
But if it fits to the point where just Joe Blow on the street or whatever

2222
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
looks at your product and they think that it's this,

2223
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
even if it's not Power Rangers, but they think it is,

2224
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:46,000
then you have a copyright case or, I guess, a trademark case.

2225
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I don't know what you'd call it.

2226
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
It looks too close to Pokemon.

2227
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
It looks too close to Power Rangers.

2228
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
And nothing like Pokemon.

2229
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
What about NB Rangers and DJ?

2230
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
We can't hear you. We can't hear you at all.

2231
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
What about NB Rangers and DJ Max?

2232
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
They look more like Power Rangers.

2233
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,000
I feel like that boyshoe here over the guy in Japanese talking,

2234
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
yet it's just the same thing.

2235
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I'm just repeating it in the mic because Shane is too lazy to get his own translator.

2236
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Anyway, look, we're moving on to the mailbag,

2237
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
but I want to say some things in the chat room,

2238
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
although I don't know because I don't want to inflate Shane's ego either.

2239
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,000
But Act F says, see, Shane knows. Shane is the man.

2240
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,000
And Rama says, thank you, base Shane.

2241
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
And Pop Coffee says, Shane with the real talk.

2242
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Well, there you go. All right.

2243
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Well, here's our Power Rangers liaison.

2244
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Power Rangers and Pokemon liaison here at OLR.

2245
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
And maybe Destiny.

2246
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Hey, who hit max level in Destiny, Shane?

2247
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Not me.

2248
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Not you.

2249
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I had to go to sleep.

2250
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Excuses, excuses.

2251
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Hey, hey, nobody can hear you, so what you're saying doesn't matter.

2252
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Let's move on to the mailbag.

2253
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
And what does matter are emailers.

2254
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,000
When you guys email us every week at participate at orangelawnsradio.com.

2255
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Again, that's participate at orangelawnsradio.com.

2256
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:06,000
You guys participate with our program and send us emails.

2257
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Witch Dark Sakura dives into this participate mailbag

2258
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,000
and reads her favorites here on air.

2259
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Hold on real quick before I got to totally derail everything.

2260
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
God damn it.

2261
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Because I just had a wonderful thought.

2262
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Stop the music. Stop the music.

2263
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,000
No, I was just thinking, you know, because...

2264
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I don't know why the word genocide made me think of Betty White,

2265
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,000
but wouldn't it be hilarious if they couldn't get Peter Dinklage

2266
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:30,000
to do his lines in Destiny, you know, well enough

2267
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,000
that they should just get Betty White to do the voice of Ghost?

2268
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:36,000
It would probably be better than Peter Dinklage.

2269
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Shane also said that.

2270
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Show of hands, who would prefer Betty White to Peter Dinklage?

2271
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Show of hands.

2272
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I have no point of comparison.

2273
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Alright, show of hands.

2274
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Well, Betty White is always better than anything,

2275
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
so that's the only comparison you need.

2276
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Back to the mailbag.

2277
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2278
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Betty White, if you're out there, email us.

2279
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
First email.

2280
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
And of course we've got two weeks worth of them to go through.

2281
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
So, um...

2282
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Excuse me.

2283
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I agree with that depth in our chat room.

2284
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
What the fuck, Loki?

2285
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I don't know.

2286
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Alright.

2287
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Happy Sunday, Orange Lounge.

2288
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
In today's gaming scene, stuff like YouTube and Twitch are thriving.

2289
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:21,000
With so many gamers and media nuts upping their video and audio editing skills,

2290
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,000
what do you think it takes to stand out amongst the crowd

2291
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
and turn this into a career one day?

2292
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Along with the music I'm making, I do fishing, hunting, and gaming videos,

2293
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,000
and I could use the advice.

2294
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Much love, Orange Lounge.

2295
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
EA skeezy.

2296
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Be entertaining.

2297
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Passion.

2298
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Proper spelling.

2299
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Drive.

2300
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I think enthusiasm goes a long way.

2301
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Grammar.

2302
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,000
And I realize there's a lot of cynicism out there in the gaming community

2303
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:53,000
that does very, very well, but I also think that's kind of like a landmine.

2304
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,000
I think there's a far greater audience that want to listen to people

2305
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
that genuinely love what it is that they're talking about.

2306
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:03,000
And I think if you love what you're doing,

2307
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
then that ends up being infectious,

2308
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
and people want to be a part of what it is you're doing.

2309
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Then again, we might be the wrong people to be asking

2310
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
because we don't make money off of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network,

2311
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,000
but I can tell you these are the things I like to see in other productions.

2312
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:22,000
It does help to have very clean presentation.

2313
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Because coming from a design standpoint,

2314
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
if you're going to be putting out a visual product,

2315
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,000
the first thing people are going to see is whatever introduction you have

2316
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
to said product.

2317
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:37,000
That's going to be the cover to your book, pretty much.

2318
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:40,000
And people do judge a book by its cover.

2319
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
I'm not saying content isn't important.

2320
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I'm saying you want to have something that well represents the content

2321
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:49,000
and gives a person an idea to what they can expect.

2322
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Don't burn your fucking bridges.

2323
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Networking is so, so important in this industry.

2324
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Never burn your bridges and piss somebody off

2325
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
because you never know when that's going to come back to haunt you.

2326
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I think that is very, very, very important because,

2327
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
and I say this all the time in any podcasting,

2328
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I have zero tolerance for when a podcast decides to shade another,

2329
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:17,000
hardworking any podcast, talk shit about each other on air,

2330
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
just for ratings or whatever it is.

2331
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I think that's trashy.

2332
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
And nobody wants to hear that.

2333
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
And it just makes everybody involved look stupid.

2334
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
And I want to be known.

2335
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I don't know if anybody out there talks natively about OLR.

2336
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
I don't think so anymore.

2337
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
But if that's happening, I don't want to be.

2338
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
We've had them all eliminated.

2339
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Well, we've outlived them all.

2340
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Longest running. Hey.

2341
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:42,000
What if I piss the bridge and burn somebody?

2342
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
But I'm just saying, don't ever burn the bridges

2343
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
because that will come back to get you.

2344
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Like I'm telling you.

2345
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
You're going to have to learn to swim.

2346
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
From what I just told you, the whole don't shade other people,

2347
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,000
there's people on my little black list I've got.

2348
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
And yes, I have one.

2349
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:00,000
And I've never told you who's on it because, again, I'm not in that business.

2350
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,000
But these are people who were talking negatively about our show

2351
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
or on a forum or something else.

2352
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,000
We're saying things that I don't think were very cool.

2353
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
And I will never work with those people.

2354
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
They're all gone by now because they couldn't make it.

2355
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I wonder why.

2356
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,000
But these shows I would never work with ever.

2357
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Yeah, I wonder where those guys on Digg are now.

2358
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,000
The ones that were trolling you some time ago?

2359
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Whatever.

2360
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
On Reddit, I guess.

2361
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
No, it was Digg.

2362
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
No, no. That's the joke. Where are they now?

2363
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,000
On Reddit.

2364
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
And they're probably on Fortran.

2365
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Maybe.

2366
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
They're on slash B.

2367
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
So, anyway.

2368
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
There you go. That was my long-winded answer to the question

2369
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
that I hope was what you were looking for.

2370
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,000
I do think that good design goes a long way.

2371
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,000
This one, this is kind of a long one. This is from the 10th.

2372
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
So, it was before.

2373
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Okay.

2374
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
All right.

2375
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Hey, OLR Crew, AZHP here.

2376
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
I've been behind on the podcast lately.

2377
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
That's okay because we've been behind doing them.

2378
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,000
But you guys talked about a topic a few weeks ago that's been on my mind.

2379
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Universities offering scholarships for people who are talented at League of Legends.

2380
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:12,000
You guys mainly talked about it from the standpoint of our video games support.

2381
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I wanted to cover it from a different angle.

2382
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
The school's angle.

2383
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
If you're a school trying to recruit talent,

2384
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
you want to provide scholarships that attract talented people.

2385
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:24,000
High school kids nowadays are playing League because it costs nothing

2386
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
and they're super invested in it.

2387
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:30,000
You're going to attract more attention if you're catering to their interests.

2388
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,000
The school gets eyes on its people who are the right age to be applying for their gaming.

2389
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Hold on. I lost my place.

2390
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Who are the right age to be applying to their schools.

2391
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:48,000
If you're offering a scholarship to something as ubiquitous in the gaming world as League,

2392
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
it's going to get competitive.

2393
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,000
You're going to get applicants who are prodigies at the game.

2394
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,000
People who are extremely talented and not just from a pure Twitch gaming perspective,

2395
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:02,000
but also are proven to have great tactical thinking and work well with others.

2396
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,000
These are great qualities that schools look for.

2397
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
And if the programs become very successful,

2398
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:10,000
the school's League ends up competing in international and big tournaments.

2399
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,000
And that's promotion for the school every single time.

2400
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I can think of tons of people who would love to go to a school that has a talented team,

2401
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
a League team playing at it.

2402
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:21,000
In short, from the school's perspective,

2403
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:25,000
getting with the times and offering scholarships to people who play a majorly popular game

2404
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:28,000
is extremely forward-thinking and proactive.

2405
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I think that if they play their cards right,

2406
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:34,000
it will end up making their school much more palatable to the next generation of kids

2407
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
applying to college and in the next few years.

2408
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Of course, this hinges on Riot maintaining the popularity of League,

2409
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,000
but if all things remain on the same trajectory over the next few years,

2410
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
League is just going to get bigger and bigger.

2411
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Sorry for the long email, but I wanted to provide another perspective

2412
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
that seems to have gone unaddressed in your guys' discussion.

2413
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Keep up the great work, AZHP.

2414
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I think that was a very well-thought-out email with some very good points.

2415
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
And it was well-written. It was spelled right.

2416
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
As AZHP tends to do.

2417
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:04,000
So, another one for his gold file.

2418
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I really have nothing to say in response to that.

2419
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I think those are all very good points.

2420
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Again, it's been a couple weeks, so I can't remember exactly what we were saying about it on the show.

2421
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
It was about the...

2422
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
I know we were talking about the whole sport and all that.

2423
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,000
You know, is it really sport? And that's kind of the direction we went in with it.

2424
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,000
But I think he does make a good point.

2425
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
I get sweaty playing League.

2426
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I think he does make a good point that it's just like, you know, kids today think League is cool

2427
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
and might want to go to a school with that.

2428
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:36,000
And, you know, people that are good at League are probably going to, you know,

2429
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,000
again, making some generalizations, but probably going to excel in these particular areas.

2430
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Actually, SSJ100, Matt has a good comment.

2431
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Sure.

2432
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
My problem with this is my problem with college sports in general.

2433
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:52,000
These kids will bring in a lot of money for their school, but none of that will trickle down to the students

2434
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
who have to pay for a lot in terms of room, board, and living expenses.

2435
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
So, basically, they're bringing them in as revenue generators.

2436
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Right.

2437
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
All right.

2438
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Well, very good response email.

2439
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
All right. Last email.

2440
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Yep.

2441
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,000
It says Jell-O, and then this subject was a typo on my iPhone. I refuse to correct it.

2442
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Okay.

2443
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Fair enough.

2444
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
I thought it was about Jell-O, and Jell-O is pretty fucking good.

2445
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
There's always room for Jell-O.

2446
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Especially with whipped cream.

2447
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Hey, OLR crew. Just listened to episode 559 and super excited that you guys are making it out to DragonCon.

2448
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
I'm going to be traveling down from New York City.

2449
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I grew up in Alabama. Shout out to DS. Woohoo!

2450
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
So, it's just like going back home.

2451
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Sadly, it is just, unless DarkSakuraLoki pulls something out last minute, it is just me going.

2452
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:42,000
It's not the whole OLR's crew, but a lot of diverse-

2453
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I'm probably going to Disneyland instead.

2454
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:48,000
A lot of diverse people at VoG are going to be there, so excited to meet you.

2455
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Two questions first.

2456
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:57,000
When you guys go to conventions, especially multi-fandom, multi-genre conventions, what do you make and aim to spend the most time on?

2457
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Panels, game room, dealer's room, parties, or exploring something unfamiliar.

2458
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I haven't been to a real convention in several years, and now that I'm an adult and I'm needing to take time before I can interrupt my life for a week to do this,

2459
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:15,000
it makes me think cons are vacations for nerds, so I'm looking forward to the party fun and mostly stress-free weekend.

2460
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I will tell you one thing. Any con you go to is scheduled an entire day after your travel to sleep.

2461
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Yes. I do that with DragonCon.

2462
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:30,000
And so, I say look at the schedule, plot your time wisely.

2463
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:41,000
I'd say that if you plan on going to the same convention for multiple years, do like some of the big events over different years.

2464
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I don't go to masquerades anymore. While I want to support the cosplay community, after Anime Expo, I don't go to masquerades at big cons anymore. I just don't do it.

2465
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I like the way that Bobby and his friends did it at DragonCon, where they watched the masquerade on the TV, because DragonCon's big enough.

2466
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Yeah, AX started doing that.

2467
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:04,000
And then everybody just orders the pizza and just watches it on the TV. I thought that was a really cool way of doing it.

2468
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:12,000
So you kind of have that private viewing with the convention people, but you don't have to fight the crowds to get in the real room and all that stuff.

2469
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:19,000
As far as what I like to do most at the convention, I like to do the parties honestly. I'm not going to lie, that's my favorite thing. I like the parties.

2470
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:23,000
I almost hate the parties.

2471
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Well, you and I are different in that regard though.

2472
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I like ghosting parties.

2473
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,000
What's that?

2474
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Meaning you find out what parties all of your friends are having, and then you go get free drinks at each party, hang out with your friends until you get completely sick of how loud it is.

2475
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Then you have quiet time in the elevator going to the next floor to the next party, and then you ghost that one too.

2476
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:51,000
And not really bringing free drinks. What I like to do is I would have the medium-sized bottles of liquor and make my contribution to little parties.

2477
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
That works.

2478
02:39:52,000 --> 02:40:02,000
But for the most time, the biggest thing that we did, our parties just consisted of finding some way to hook up a Super Nintendo to the TV and playing Super Mario World all night.

2479
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:08,000
That was the one stupid thing I didn't do at GamerX was bring my own gaming console to hook up to the TV to invite people to the room.

2480
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:14,000
You guys were hardly in there at all. Every time I went back up there to get my quiet time, you guys just weren't there.

2481
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Well, that's good because you want a quiet time. And you know me, I would have been like, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

2482
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Basically all of my times up there were take off the shoes, let the feet rest, switch into costume.

2483
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I would say to this emailer, not to drag this out too much longer, but just plan on the panels you want to do and decide is this a must-see or a would-like-to-see.

2484
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:42,000
So for example, you're going to put the VOG Network panel on Monday on your must-see list.

2485
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:45,000
That way you make sure and come to the thing at all costs.

2486
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:51,000
But then on your kind of want-to-see list is that, okay, if I miss these, I'm not going to be upset about it.

2487
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,000
But at the same time, if I'm not really doing anything, I'm going to try to make these panels.

2488
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:58,000
But with DragonCon, you have to line up for a lot of them like way in advance.

2489
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Not ours, certainly, but a lot of the big ones with stars, you're going to have to line up way in advance.

2490
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Also, if there are any particular movie showings or anything going on, big events, if they don't interest you, use that as your dealer's time room.

2491
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Have fun, and if you're not having fun, change what you're doing.

2492
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Also, if you're cosplaying things with big wings, don't wear them into the dealer's room.

2493
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
I learned that the hard way.

2494
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Fair enough.

2495
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,000
I thought, I'll go in the dealer's room. Good photo ops. No.

2496
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Because they actually had a photo section on the corner of the dealer's room that year at AX.

2497
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
And I was like, I'll just go in there and do that. No.

2498
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Because you still have to navigate through the crowd together.

2499
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Okay, oh, there's one more. Okay.

2500
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:42,000
And lastly, dark soccer, this is for me. I have one cosplay already, but I feel like I need another.

2501
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Who should I cosplay? I can't decide. No homestuck, please. I'd only want to do a troll and a thank you to body paint.

2502
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Well, I was going to say, if you were going to do homestuck, I think that, and this is from Duchok.

2503
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I would say anyone who cosplays Dave Strider with the turntables gets cool points in my book.

2504
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:05,000
I'm just saying, that would be the homestuck I'd like to see.

2505
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:09,000
I don't really know what you're into.

2506
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Yeah, I have no idea what you look like. Not that, I mean, you can certainly cosplay anything you want.

2507
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Different gender, different whatever. But sometimes that's a good place to start.

2508
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Like, I probably am going to do Joker for Dragon Con because you know what, with a red beard I kind of look like him.

2509
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:29,000
So that's a good place for me to start. So that might be a good place for you to start.

2510
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:33,000
But yeah, I think it really depends on what you're into. What are you into? What do you love?

2511
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Yeah, I mean, the whole reason I picked a homestuck cosplay is because I needed something quick and easy.

2512
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:44,000
I didn't have time to plan. And so, the Jane costume was quick and easy.

2513
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,000
I mean, the prop took me weeks to make, but other than that, you know.

2514
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:58,000
And I just want to make crystal clear that I'm saying that do what you love and it doesn't matter if you do or don't look like them.

2515
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:04,000
I'm only saying if you have no idea where to begin, that could be a starting place for you.

2516
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:11,000
But I will tell you what I do. The first thing that I do is I decide if this is something I'm going to make from scratch or if it's something I'm going to thrift.

2517
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Because most of the time my thrift costumes are my, you know, wear throughout the day and then I save my better ones for, you know, actual gatherings and photo op times.

2518
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:30,000
But, like, my King of Fighters Leona costume was part from a thrift store and part from an Army-Navy store.

2519
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Where we just modified an already existing double-breasted jacket into the top for my Leona costume.

2520
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:41,000
And then used all the leftover straps for the rest of the material.

2521
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:52,000
If you are going to wear an outfit that requires combat boots, make sure they fit you before you wear them.

2522
02:43:52,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Make sure they're not molded to somebody else's freakin' feet. Mold them to your damn feet. It takes a month.

2523
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I made that mistake and I played DDR in my Jill costume. I had, you wouldn't believe, oh my God, my feet were a nightmare.

2524
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:15,000
And by the way, that comes from, I think I said it came from Duchac.

2525
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:30,000
But the other thing, too, that I would like to say is that if you're going to, the other thing that I do with my costumes is that I find, first of all, as many references from whatever it is I'm doing it from.

2526
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:37,000
And easy if you're doing it from a 3D video game that you have fly cam controls in, like in Mass Effect, easy.

2527
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:45,000
If it's a game you can also rip the textures from, do that, because then you can get a really good idea for the patterns of the material.

2528
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:51,000
And then find other cosplayers. Learn from other people. See what they've done. Look for patterns.

2529
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Tumblr will almost always have cosplay tutorials up. And then plot your time wisely. That's the big thing.

2530
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Alright.

2531
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,000
And if Ron has got anything else to add, let me know.

2532
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Big response to that email. Any other emails? I thought you said one more.

2533
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:09,000
No, I said the one more was that lost a little bit to the email.

2534
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Well, then there you go. Well, you should send us more emails. Participate at orangelandrada.com is the place to send us emails.

2535
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Learn to sew.

2536
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:19,000
And I'll meet you, like any good drag queen would do.

2537
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:22,000
I need to, I need to, I would need a sewing machine.

2538
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Alright. I believe now we are going to get into the FUs of the week. In fact, I don't believe it. I know it. We're going to get into the FUs of the week right now.

2539
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:52,000
I have to actually add what Rama just posted in chat. Cosplayblogwiththebrain.wordpress.com.

2540
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Okay. So, um, FU to just how intensely tired I've been and how hard it's been to go back to, um, my, uh, uh, sort of paleo-y regimen.

2541
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Because work has metallopurkeys. I love metallopurkeys.

2542
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Um, so I'm really, this week I got to buckle down and I'm going to go through, uh, what's called the carb flu.

2543
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:29,000
The first thing that happens after cheating at all is that when you go back to just eating regularly, you just start getting tired and tired and tired.

2544
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:35,000
And I know that's part of what's happening to me. So, just, ugh.

2545
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I accidentally whipped the mic.

2546
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Yuck.

2547
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Yucko.

2548
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Uh, Loki.

2549
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Um, all I can say is also FU to being tired and then, um, FU to texturing because god dammit it's fucking hard.

2550
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Trying to make like texture map that, or texture atlas that works with a bunch of stuff and just trying to lay out how the hell that's going to be done.

2551
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:08,000
And, I mean, I designed my primitive models in a certain way that I didn't want to texture anything.

2552
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:15,000
And then here I am now with texturing stuff. So it's just because I changed everything and it's taking so long.

2553
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:22,000
But I just have to figure out a way to texture stuff. It's just difficult.

2554
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:27,000
I may just put something together temporarily and just keep moving on. I really think that's probably what I should do.

2555
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:30,000
That's it.

2556
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Alright, um, my FU of the week goes to the fact, speaking of drag queens and all that, my FU of the week goes to the fact that Bianca Del Rio is here in Sacramento tonight.

2557
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:47,000
And I'm here with you lovely people. Don't get me wrong. I love you guys and doing the show and everything.

2558
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:50,000
But god dammit I'm missing drag queens to be here.

2559
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Not just any drag queens. Bianca Del Rio people. Winner of Rudolph's Drag Race Season 6.

2560
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Alright, anyhow.

2561
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Let's move on. Because I do love you guys. We've got some more gaming news for you.

2562
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:06,000
And then your turn to call into the show. 1877 Game O.L.R.

2563
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. But first, a couple more stories.

2564
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:21,000
In a world where PC games are not the only things to receive day one patches. In fact, more often than not, console games receive day one patches.

2565
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:28,000
And all sorts of bug fixes from launch. And even sometimes it's still broken way after launch.

2566
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:34,000
But you know what they want to bring to consoles instead that is on PC? Early access.

2567
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:41,000
That's right. Games that are not yet done that are in a beta or alpha state that you would purchase.

2568
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:46,000
And you would receive updates as they finish the game to help the development of said titles.

2569
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Now yes, I understand that they do this on Steam with indie games. And you know what? I'm kind of cool with that for most cases.

2570
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Some people kind of abuse that and now of course there's the stuff in place where gaming may never be finished.

2571
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:12,000
So they're trying to do that both on the Playstation 4 according to Adam Boyz.

2572
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:26,000
And basically saying, you know, we're figuring... That's one massive conversation we're having internally at what point does a game meet standards of release?

2573
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:33,000
We're still at some point... We still at some point ensure that we're being mindful to the consumer.

2574
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:39,000
We don't want somebody to stumble across a title and expect a full product that have a negative effect.

2575
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:45,000
We're figuring out what's okay. We obviously have tech requirements, checklists that people have to adhere to.

2576
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:51,000
So we're internally discussing what does that list look like and where the caveat is stuff like this.

2577
02:49:51,000 --> 02:50:02,000
So it's still a project with lots of minds are considering. No details yet, but perhaps something in the future.

2578
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:09,000
And then of course, you know, Microsoft are thinking the same thing.

2579
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Of course, I guess the director of the ID at Xbox program, Chris Charla, is basically saying,

2580
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:22,000
you know, it's something developers have been asking for and we are listening really closely to developers.

2581
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:27,000
There's lots of heavy deep thinkers, experts, PhDs working on whatever.

2582
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:35,000
Basically, they know it's a way that they can make some money. So they're going to be possibly thinking about having these available.

2583
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:41,000
I worry because especially when companies like EA said, hey, you know what, we should put out games in early access.

2584
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:48,000
OK, your games are already fucking early access based on some of the problems that people have been having with networking.

2585
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:58,000
And just I don't know, I I'm worried that it's going to be abused because as it is, yes, it's already kind of abused.

2586
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:06,000
And now it's just kind of giving, you know, like EA and out or something like, oh, it's beta or like, hey, you want to get in that beta for destiny?

2587
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:15,000
I mean, guess what? You can pay for the beta access, you know, the early access. It's going to cost you $60 and it gets upgraded later on or something like that.

2588
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:22,000
What's next? Are you going to kickstart that shit? Are you going to fucking have crowdfunding to get, you know, pre-orders in the game?

2589
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,000
You pay, you know, $10 and you get this and whatever.

2590
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Well, didn't they have that with Ni No Kuni? I remember something like that. They had done a little, I mean, I didn't take it too seriously, but they had something like that.

2591
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Yeah.

2592
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:39,000
But then Nintendo had the Wario or game and Wario fart starter, whatever it was.

2593
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:45,000
That was social media sharing. Like that wasn't really it, but it was, it was funny to see that whole like tongue in cheekiness of it.

2594
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Butt in cheek.

2595
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:51,000
All right.

2596
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vogniteware.com says, I won't support this. It's already being abused on Steam.

2597
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:02,000
It is a very slippery slope. Like indie developers who need a little extra push on their first game. Yes.

2598
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
EA, not so much.

2599
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:13,000
I think there's a lot of indie developers out there that are just like, let's see what kind of, what I can scramble together real quick and then put it on there and get some money.

2600
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:24,000
And maybe they legitimately want to make a good game, but I think there's a lot of people out there that are legitimately just doing it very quickly so that they can get some money and they're never going to touch it again.

2601
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Well, what an interesting little tie in as we move into our last story tonight about EA and Maxis and The Sims 4, which I'm sure you can just imagine the money that is set to be made by EA with this game.

2602
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:43,000
The Sims 4 in a new trailer, it was a 20 minute gameplay walkthrough that they had posted.

2603
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:53,000
There was an image, one little frame got caught that said in the screen cap, quote, The Sims 4 Premium, save on new packs with early access and exclusive items.

2604
02:52:53,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Become a premium member to get early access to three new packs with exclusive items. Your Sims can throw a spooky costume party, camp in the great outdoors, and toast to the new year in style.

2605
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:08,000
I'm surprised they didn't know about this. They have a premium edition of Sims. I mean, what do you think that is?

2606
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
All the sale information is on site anyway.

2607
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:21,000
And it's not new for EA either because Battlefield had premium memberships and so on. Is anyone really surprised by this information? Anyone?

2608
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:29,000
I'll be more surprised if the game works day one. Sorry about it, but that's where I'm at with, you know, after the whole SimCity debacle and that whole mess.

2609
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Well, at least this one is offline.

2610
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:34,000
So that's good.

2611
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:40,000
But I do like how the premium edition is not a season pass. You don't get free content. I mean, you get some content, but it's discounts.

2612
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Because as someone pointed out, you know, regarding The Sims 3, hey, if you pay $19.99 for the base Sims 3, it's going to cost you almost the same price as an Xbox One to get all the content in the game.

2613
02:53:53,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Dar Sakura, any interest for Sims 4 over there? Because I know you used to play The Sims like pretty hardcore, at least more than anyone else I knew.

2614
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Yeah. I mean, I've been thinking about buying the premium, honestly. Just because I...

2615
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
So this news doesn't phase you. You're like, alright, par for the course.

2616
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:14,000
But even like with the stuff that they took out, like there's no swimming pools or babies anymore. I mean...

2617
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:20,000
I'm thinking about it. Either that or I'm just going to go just reinstall all The Sims 2 stuff and put a high res mod on it.

2618
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Well, funny that you should mention Sims 2, because there is an expansion, a new little upgrade that they just did to Sims 2 to basically say goodbye.

2619
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Origin registered owners of Sims 2 will get a free copy of the most up-to-date version, The Ultimate Collection, before the support ends on July 22nd.

2620
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:48,000
It includes all the expansions. I guess players are able to transfer their save files from whatever it is they have into this game.

2621
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:56,000
So anyone who purchased or registered a digital copy of The Sims 2 on Origin will automatically receive The Ultimate Collection. So that's kind of neat.

2622
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:02,000
So then I could actually just go buy it on Origin and get every damn thing.

2623
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
They don't sell it on Origin.

2624
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Or I could just buy... find one of my old copies.

2625
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:12,000
You have to find your old copy and you have to actually call it in to register, because there's no way to register it through Origin.

2626
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:13,000
There's no keys or anything?

2627
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:14,000
No.

2628
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:17,000
I'll just get it for free later. I mean, I'll just get it eventually.

2629
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,000
So now...

2630
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,000
I know, I know. I don't really care.

2631
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
Just wait for another Humble Bundle that EA puts out.

2632
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:25,000
I don't want to have to run it through fucking Origin anyway, so whatever.

2633
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Origin isn't as awful as it was a couple years ago.

2634
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:33,000
I still don't want to run it through Origin anyway, because I run like a...

2635
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Sims 3, thankfully, didn't have to go through Origin for a lot of its stuff.

2636
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:40,000
And I could run my mods, except Sims 3 kind of ran like crap.

2637
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:43,000
See, that's what's holding me back, actually, about Sims 4.

2638
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:49,000
The fact that Sims 3 ran so unbelievably horribly, that...

2639
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Sims 4 is probably not... and Sims 4 is going to require Origin, I'm sure.

2640
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:54,000
So...

2641
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Which is interesting, because it's offline, but not really.

2642
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:58,000
So...

2643
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Alright.

2644
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:03,000
We've got to connect online to purchase all those fucking packs now, don't you?

2645
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line.

2646
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:10,000
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, the Skype...

2647
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:11,000
L1 word.

2648
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
The Skype line is now open for your calls.

2649
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:18,000
You can talk to us on any topic that we've covered tonight, or maybe something that we missed.

2650
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Anything from last week, even, would be fine as well.

2651
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Which I totally realize that I neglected to in the opening, because we went so long,

2652
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I never did a last week's music set to Holic...

2653
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Or, excuse me, last week's news set to Holic, so I apologize for the oversight.

2654
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:34,000
But, yeah, we're running too long, so sorry about that.

2655
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Sorry to the fans that were waiting for that segment.

2656
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:40,000
But, you know, we have to talk more about GamerX and other stuff anyway.

2657
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
We do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

2658
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2659
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:47,000
The one and only Rama. You know what to do with the fastest internet in the chat room.

2660
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Hey, Rama, you're coming through really quiet for some reason.

2661
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Is your mic in its usual place?

2662
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
Hold on one second...

2663
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
There you go. You're already better.

2664
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:01,000
I had to turn up the mixer for a little bit.

2665
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
You're much better. What's on your mind, buddy?

2666
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:06,000
I just want to kind of break down the whole Tokusai thing real quick,

2667
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:09,000
so everyone have a brief explanation of what it is.

2668
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Please.

2669
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Sure. I mean, Tokusai is a genre. It's live-action special effects.

2670
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Under that is the Super Sentai series, Ultraman, Godzilla, all that type of stuff.

2671
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Gotcha?

2672
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Yeah. And, you know, from that article, I think those guys at Crozna,

2673
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:37,000
they could get away with it, provided that they say this is the series

2674
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:41,000
and it has no direct correlation to what Saban is doing.

2675
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:44,000
I mean, it'll be similar, but there's no direct correlation,

2676
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:47,000
as in the American changes and stuff like that,

2677
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:52,000
because they have gotten away with stuff like this in the comic books and, you know.

2678
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Do you think that Saban, should they go down this path of taking legal action against the game?

2679
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
You know, that's a big if, but should they?

2680
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Do you think they might try to attack, though, saying that the average user,

2681
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:09,000
let's be real, the average computer game player probably doesn't follow this stuff as closely as you do,

2682
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:14,000
but the average user would think it's Power Rangers?

2683
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Pretty much, because to be perfectly honest,

2684
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:22,000
if you were to get about ten Power Ranger fans in a room,

2685
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:26,000
maybe one or two of them would know what the original Japanese series is.

2686
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Good point.

2687
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:32,000
You know, there's like a Power Morphicon or something's happening here in, what, August?

2688
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Because Shane kept telling me he wanted to go,

2689
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
but that's something that's happening in SoCal in August,

2690
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:39,000
and I wonder if this is going to be a part of the conversation there a little bit,

2691
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
show up in a panel or something.

2692
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:47,000
Possibly because Power Morphicon, it's a celebration of the original Japanese Super Sentai series

2693
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:53,000
and other series like Masked Rider, Ultraman, and the American series just Power Rangers,

2694
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:57,000
Masked Rider, Kamen Rider, Beetleborgs, all that cool stuff.

2695
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Yeah, like the actors from different series and stuff.

2696
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:04,000
You know, I don't really watch the Power Rangers especially as much as Shane does,

2697
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:08,000
but he forced me pretty much at gunpoint to watch one of the episodes from Japan

2698
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:12,000
with the Train Rangers or whatever they are, and that was actually pretty cute.

2699
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Yeah, I mean, honestly, if you watch the American series,

2700
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:21,000
you'll eventually will find your way to the original Japanese.

2701
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Just watch Mega Ranger, that's all you need.

2702
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Yeah, Jamie makes a valid point, because not for nothing,

2703
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:33,000
and I'll swear on a stack of Holy Bibles before you go up in flames,

2704
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:40,000
99% of the Sailor Moon fandom started out on the dubbed series,

2705
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
before they found the original Japanese.

2706
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:50,000
Or there was a magazine called An America that had a full spread about Sailor Moon

2707
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:55,000
while they were still in negotiations, and some of us found our way to fan subs. Just saying.

2708
02:59:55,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Yeah, but when Rama talks about the 99%, you are probably in the 1%, just saying.

2709
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,000
You are the 1% Dark Sakura of anime fandom.

2710
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Whatever.

2711
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,000
I just wanted a chance to say that to Dark Sakura and call her the 1%.

2712
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Alright, anyway, Rama, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

2713
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Can I just quickly plug the GoFundMe with the banner that's rotating on the vlog network real quick?

2714
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Yes, of course you may.

2715
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:28,000
Okay, in case you haven't heard, one of our staff members, Avalon Cosplay,

2716
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:32,000
when she was coming back from a convention, she found out her house burnt down.

2717
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Fortunately, insurance is covering everything, but as of right now, they're just trying to make ends meet

2718
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:43,000
with a new place to stay, food, work, all that stuff, until the house is built.

2719
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:48,000
If you go to animejamsession.com, there is a banner, there's a button on the site

2720
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:53,000
with information and where you can go to donate, and there is also a rotating banner on vlognetwork.com.

2721
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Excellent, and yes, if you are listening live right now, you can see that banner right at the top of the screen,

2722
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:01,000
live.vognetwork.com, a great thing you guys are doing.

2723
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Those are the types of ads I like, ads to help people out during times of crisis, so best of luck to that.

2724
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Before I let you go, on a lighter note, Rama, while I have you on the line, I have to ask you this,

2725
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:18,000
and I know I could go listen to Anime Jam Session for even more in-depth discussion,

2726
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Rama, I just need to, in like one sentence here, I'm just going to put this word out there,

2727
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:28,000
and I just want to hear your thoughts, I'm going to put that word on the table and walk away.

2728
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Dashcon.

2729
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:38,000
I need a moment.

2730
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:41,000
Okay.

2731
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Did you just take a hit? Was that what that was?

2732
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
No, well, that too.

2733
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Or were you inflating a ball pit?

2734
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:54,000
Do I have to bring another ball pit to the chat room?

2735
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
Perhaps.

2736
03:01:56,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Now, I feel like it's mandatory that every convention from here on out has a ball pit.

2737
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:09,000
The con I'm staffing, we already said it, ball pit confirmed for DerpyCon.

2738
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:13,000
There you go, there you go. Alright, but seriously though, Dashcon.

2739
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:22,000
There isn't a word that can describe this because it went mainstream.

2740
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:28,000
This was in papers, it went beyond mainstream.

2741
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:31,000
It got very real. It got real. Balls got real, yo.

2742
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:32,000
Denny's.

2743
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:38,000
Yeah, with Denny's is fucking making a reference to like, what did they say on their Twitter?

2744
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Oh, well, yeah.

2745
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:44,000
Sorry your food took so long, you can have an extra hour in the ball pit.

2746
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:45,000
One of my favorite-

2747
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:48,000
I swear to God, Denny's is so fucking funny on social media.

2748
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:55,000
One of my favorite actors, Ostrick Chow, he even took a picture of himself in a ball pit and said that he got an extra hour.

2749
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Amazing. Amazing.

2750
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:03,000
Alright, Fifth Dream says, Sky, Sky, Sky, let's have a ball pit at Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival.

2751
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Okay, look, gay orgy is not the ball pit you're thinking of that we're talking about here.

2752
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:09,000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2753
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Alright.

2754
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
Okay, this was on Denny's Twitter.

2755
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Welcome to DenCon. On your birthday, you get an extra hour in the pit.

2756
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Once again, horrific food, but hilarious sentiment.

2757
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:27,000
I almost want to eat at Denny's just to support their social media team.

2758
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Alright, Rahm, I gotta let you go to try and get another call, but take care.

2759
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
No problem, you take care, bro.

2760
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Alright, bye.

2761
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Sorry to let Rahm go early, but he will get an extra hour in the ball pit for his troubles.

2762
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

2763
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Give us a call.

2764
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:47,000
Did they also have a bouncy house?

2765
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Yes, there was a bouncy house.

2766
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:53,000
There's like a deflated bouncy house in there for adults.

2767
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:54,000
It's pretty amazing.

2768
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Well, what would have been the average age at DashCon?

2769
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
I think 17, probably.

2770
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:00,000
I don't know.

2771
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
I don't know why I'm looking at you, Loki.

2772
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Like, you'd know the answer of all things DashCon.

2773
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Well, I just saw the picture of the ball pit, that's about it.

2774
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:13,000
I saw, being that I am a Tumblr user, I mean, I see a lot of dumb shit on Tumblr.

2775
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:17,000
But I see a lot of really funny GIFs sometimes, and I see a lot of really hot things, too.

2776
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:23,000
But I also see lots of reports on DashCon and that sort of thing, and it's just been...

2777
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:28,000
It made me appreciate GamerX, too, that much more.

2778
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Because GamerX, especially for the first year they ran, they were a very well-run con for the first year.

2779
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
And a very well-run con in their second year.

2780
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:38,000
And so it just kind of goes to show you that, wow, it could have been a lot worse.

2781
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Wow.

2782
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,000
All right.

2783
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:46,000
I'm going to go to Twitter real quick, because I did see some tweets come in.

2784
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:49,000
Dartatouille had sent us a tweet saying, just two quick things.

2785
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:53,000
One, will there be more Mortal Kombat 8 tournaments a la Cross Zones in the future?

2786
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Yes, that is something we have wanted to do.

2787
03:04:56,000 --> 03:05:02,000
I would think that the time that Nintendo inevitably puts out DLC, we'll want to get on that pretty fast.

2788
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:05,000
But I can't see why there wouldn't be a tournament before then.

2789
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:08,000
I'm sure in the next month or two we'll do another tournament.

2790
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Just, we were all busy with the whole going to the con and preparing for our panel and all that stuff,

2791
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
which hopefully you guys will get to see the panel, too.

2792
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:20,000
Tigerclaw tweets us saying that Akiva Goldsman is producing the Space Invaders movie.

2793
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
I forgot that that was a thing.

2794
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:25,000
They are making a Space Invaders movie.

2795
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:26,000
Why?

2796
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Because they made a Battleship movie.

2797
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:29,000
Why not?

2798
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,000
Yeah, that was so...

2799
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
One last call for calls.

2800
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:36,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2801
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Akdeft tweets us saying, here's a really great video game music bundle and you can pay what you want

2802
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
and for a good cause, too.

2803
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:49,000
And it's groupies.com, G-R-O-U-P-E-E-S dot com slash GMG.

2804
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:53,000
And I'm trying to look at this link real quick here, but I'm trying to do it on my phone

2805
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
to see of what it is you get.

2806
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Oh, you get the Rogue Legacy soundtrack and Kernel 2

2807
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:03,000
and the Banner Saga by Austin Wintory, Hotline Miami.

2808
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
Oh, that's a really good soundtrack.

2809
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
That's very cool. I like that.

2810
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:10,000
So for a minimum of a dollar, you get all those soundtracks

2811
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:15,000
and once they reach $2500 in sales, they're going to do another...

2812
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:19,000
VidBoy and Lifeform do a collaboration for the bundle.

2813
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,000
That's kind of neat, actually.

2814
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:23,000
I like that idea that they get all the...

2815
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:27,000
It's like a Kickstarter, but with actual product you're just getting right out the gate.

2816
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:30,000
Groupies is kind of neat because sometimes they'll do different things.

2817
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:33,000
There's one I did that had...

2818
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:38,000
There was games in there and soundtracks and all sorts of random stuff.

2819
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:41,000
It's usually a mix of things.

2820
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:44,000
That's really neat. I like that.

2821
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Thank you for the FYI on that.

2822
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:49,000
Tigerclaw says there's a Ouija board movie coming out, but they already did one.

2823
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:50,000
It was called The Exorcist.

2824
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
Wasn't there a Witch Board?

2825
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
Yeah, there was a Witch Board.

2826
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:58,000
I saw the trailer for the Ouija board movie and it looks very generic.

2827
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:06,000
Yeah, I guess just to cash in on all the board game movie craze and scary movies and all that.

2828
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:10,000
Alright, well, our phone isn't lighting up.

2829
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:14,000
I guess that means no one else wants to call in, but that's okay because we're 20 past 9 o'clock.

2830
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:17,000
I knew the show would run a little long tonight since we had to catch up for a week.

2831
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:20,000
If you have more things you want to say after the fact, Twitter.

2832
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
You can also send us an email at any time.

2833
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to do that.

2834
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:30,000
Thank you guys for showing up tonight.

2835
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Thank you guys for listening to us on the podcast feed.

2836
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
Thanks for your support of the show.

2837
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:37,000
We always say here at Orange Lawns Radio, if you like what you heard here at the show,

2838
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
tell one or two friends about the show.

2839
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Help spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

2840
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:44,000
We really appreciate it.

2841
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:47,000
We don't ask for your money and we don't have a ball pit, I'm sorry to say.

2842
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:54,000
But when we do get money someday from selling shirts or something, we'll have a ball pit for you.

2843
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:57,000
I never checked in with Loki for last minute stories, so I'll do that real quick.

2844
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:58,000
There's not a ton.

2845
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:03,000
There was this really cool mod that they have for Grand Theft Auto 3 called Liberty City Nights.

2846
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:09,000
It's actually on ModDB and it adds some enhanced graphics to Grand Theft Auto 3

2847
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:16,000
as well as improved car models and lighting to make it all very glowy and looks like midnight club almost.

2848
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:23,000
So you can check that out on moddb.com slash mod slash GTA LCN.

2849
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
Alright.

2850
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:28,000
And then I also wanted to say, I actually posted about this.

2851
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:34,000
I'm kind of looking forward to see what kind of games we get out of it, but apparently this month,

2852
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:42,000
there is a game jam going on called Katamari Jam, which looks pretty awesome.

2853
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
Yeah, I heard about that. That sounds awesome.

2854
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
So I want to check that out.

2855
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:47,000
Very cool.

2856
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Alright, well thanks again everybody for listening.

2857
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:50,000
It's time to wrap up the show.

2858
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Before we do that, we're going to get around, go around and get everybody's final thought.

2859
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
Um, Darcy, I'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.

2860
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
I want poutine.

2861
03:08:58,000 --> 03:08:59,000
That sounds good.

2862
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:08,000
I think I'm just going to go to the KFC A&W place and get fries and curds and then order a side of gravy.

2863
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:09,000
There you go.

2864
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:10,000
I'm going to have poutine tonight.

2865
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Make your own little like hack, A&W hack poutine.

2866
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:20,000
My final thought tonight is now that you've talked about poutine, I want to take a trip to Canada.

2867
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,000
I seriously do.

2868
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:24,000
It's not like just now I want to go to Canada, but I've wanted to go back for some time.

2869
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,000
I miss it.

2870
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
I have friends in Toronto now, thanks to the podcast sister.

2871
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:30,000
I have friends there, but I also really love Vancouver.

2872
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,000
I got to go back there too.

2873
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
Shout out to all our Canadian listeners.

2874
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
I miss you.

2875
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Low key, your final thought.

2876
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
They already have one game for Katamari Jam.

2877
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:43,000
It's called Dama Cube and it looks pretty cool.

2878
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
It's a puzzle game.

2879
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:48,000
We roll stuff up as a cube.

2880
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:49,000
I don't know.

2881
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:50,000
It'd be fun to make like a Katamari game.

2882
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:58,000
Our buddy Jason's in chat right now, which by the way, nobody asked why he wasn't in the intro tonight, but Jason was traveling tonight.

2883
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
So he wasn't able to get the intro done for us.

2884
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:01,000
So Jason's just fine.

2885
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:05,000
He's in our chat room right now and says, I was in Canada for a week and I didn't have poutine.

2886
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
Well, Jason, now you got to go back.

2887
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:11,000
Now you got to go back.

2888
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:12,000
All right.

2889
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2890
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:17,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight and listening to the program.

2891
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:21,000
We really appreciate it and hope you guys have a great week.

2892
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:24,000
Be good to each other.

2893
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Don't be jerks to each other.

2894
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:27,000
Nobody likes a jerk.

2895
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:28,000
That's very important.

2896
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:31,000
And do I have anything else to say?

2897
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
I don't think so.

2898
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:34,000
I think we're done.

2899
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:35,000
We'll see you next week, guys.

2900
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:36,000
Have a good one.

2901
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:37,000
Goodbye.

2902
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
They were all still true.

2903
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
See you next week.

2904
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:37,000
Thank you.
