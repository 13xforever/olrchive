Loserloose, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, Microsoft has been experiencing ups and downs with the ups of Xbox One sales and the downs of layoffs. What's in store next for the one?

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Also, the Playroom is set to be expanded with more tools for indie broadcasters. Could you soon see us on PlayStation 4? Find out on another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Live on this July the 20th, 2014 with the 560th episode of our program.

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
We are back after a week off. We were gone last week, but we're back all again to do another program for you fine folks listening to us on our podcast feed over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
We're available on iTunes or Stitcher or who knows where. Tune in, all these different programs.

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
And also, of course, live. We do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, VOG Network.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
In studio here, my name is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts. Welcome back, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah, yeah. Here we go again, right?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
You're wearing an adorable shirt tonight, by the way.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I am.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
You're wearing a Mega Man shirt.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Rock-a-mon.

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
And I was commenting when you walked in here, I said, oh, Alan owns that same shirt. And yes, he bought it out of the woman's section. It's a t-shirt.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Who cares if it's guys or girls, right?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, but it's very-

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
F your gender norms in t-shirts, especially.

01:43.000 --> 01:57.000
It's really hard to see in this light, but this particular color of blue makes my eyes look extra blue because I have weird colored blue hazel eyes. And so my eyes change color with what I wear.

01:57.000 --> 02:08.000
I will point out, though, that Rock Man or Mega Man or whatever you want to call him is kind of doing that pose where he has his fist up like that. And on Alan, it doesn't really have much of an effect. But on you, it kind of looks like he's grabbing your boob.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Would you let Mega Man grab your boob?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
No.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
All right.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
It's just the power that he's absorbed into his, you know, his buster.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm sorry. No man is allowed to grab my boob without consent. Be he fictional or real.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Fair enough. Fair enough. And I must acknowledge-

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
What about Garrus?

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
What about Garrus? That's a good one. Thank you, Tech Master Loki, by the way, also here in studio. What about Garrus?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I think Dan wouldn't mind.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Garrus may have your consent. All right, that's fair.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
You know how everyone has the pass list or something? Then, yeah, maybe.

02:42.000 --> 02:52.000
And going to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com because, again, we do tape live on Sunday nights, Rama says, the difference really is in the cut of the shirt.

02:52.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, I know. I know. Which sadly probably makes it a little more uncomfortable for a girl to get in a guy's shirt. But not really. You just buy it. Like, you wear dance shirts and stuff, right?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Not really.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Really?

03:04.000 --> 03:19.000
I did when we first got together because I was still in extra baggy everything mode because it was early 2000. And now, like, that Borderlands shirt that I won at GamerX that I got for playing Borderlands, the pre-sequel.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Right.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
When I get a sewing machine, I'm just going to girl cut it and leave it as a tunic.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Oh. Well, that works.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
I guess I'm just really spoiled being gay because one of the biggest perks is that Alan and I can, like, totally share all our shirts because we're, like, similar sizes and everything.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, I mean, I've before worn some of Dan's old t-shirts and I made my smock for oil painting class out of one of Dan's old shirts.

03:42.000 --> 03:53.000
So I had this big dog shirt that had a dog with no butthole on the back of it that I was wearing. And I made a full on smock out of Dan's t-shirt. Now it's covered in oil paint.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
I do want to talk about GamerX with you, but I do want to, of course, say a few more words with Techmaster Loki, who sadly could not attend GamerX this last week.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
That's all right. I was pretty sick on Sunday anyways.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, I still went to San Francisco.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
What kind of sick universe is that where we go to the con and you get sick?

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
Well, it's because I have children and children get sick. And so apparently I caught my baby's virus and then I got it.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
So basically I was running a fever in the day. And so and I was tired because I kept waking up every half an hour because of the baby.

04:28.000 --> 04:43.000
So then I drove three hours to San Francisco. So the combination of having a fever, walking around, driving three hours, no sleep, just not fun.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And then it was crowded at Pier 39. And it's just like, I don't want to be I don't even want to fucking be here.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
It's always crowded at Pier 39.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I know where you get the doughnuts.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
My wife was going to get the doughnuts and she said it looked overrated.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
So they are not overrated. They're amazing.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
No, all I got was because I wasn't even that hungry because I said I felt like shit.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
So I got ice cream there, of course, you know.

05:11.000 --> 05:20.000
So I got ice cream and then we went like my wife's sister's like boyfriend walked us all the way down to like this fish place.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
I don't even know where the hell it was. I was like, I'm like, there's fish here. Why are we walking three blocks everywhere?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I'm like, why are we walking way the hell down here for this fucking thing?

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
And so we got like some I got fish and chips from there.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
And sadly, I couldn't enjoy it as much, you know, because like I said, I felt like crap.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
Did you see where, you know, years and years ago, Orange Ons Radio, we did a live broadcast from Pier 39 of a DDR tournament.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
This is this is back when OLR was a station, not just a show as in the live five days.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
This would have been like probably about the third year of our existence.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
Probably would have been like 2004, 2005. We actually did a live broadcast from Pier 39 at a place that is now a sports bar.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Just did you see that an arcade there?

05:59.000 --> 06:11.000
Some it's one of those like arcades with my quotey fingers, meaning it has a crane game, a deer hunting game, one racing cabinet, a street fighter machine with monitors.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
We didn't go that far down there. We probably went just just a little bit.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
And we really were just trying to go to the aquarium. We did that.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
And it was really short. And then afterwards, you were just like, we want to go home because there is a baseball game going on.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
We're just like, oh, no, we're not going to fight this traffic. We're just going to get out of here.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Jamie and I actually cut out of GamerX a little early just because we were so exhausted.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
And, you know, I think she had to get home. And, you know, we just I slept the entire way back.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
You really did. And then went home and slept. Yeah, it was a sleep emergency.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And then I woke up and slept some more.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
But yeah, so we didn't we weren't even really in town at all. Hardly on Sunday.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah. Next time, I think we're not going to Pier 39, obviously, because that's overrated.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
But I think we'll just go to Central Park or not Central Park.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, I keep thinking our New York listeners to be very happy if you want to say if I went to.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, if I went in here to go to Central Park now that we go to the parks, the park called their Golden Gate Park Gate Park.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, whatever. OK, so Golden Gate Gardens are really cute.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah, I don't think so. Golden Gate Park and we probably go to the beach, you know, because Josh has never seen the ocean.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
But so that's what we'll do next time. We're not even going to mess with, you know, that part of town.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
I wanted to go to the Exploratorium. If I had the energy and I didn't feel like crap, I would have moved it.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
It's Pier 15. Yeah, it's Pier 15.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, that was the other thing, too, is like we wanted to go home because the baby, you know, Danny was in his car seat like all day.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Like he's just miserable because I think it's so hot. Sure. Sure. Just like, you know, he was tired.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Let me let me shift gears here a little bit because, you know, it is a video game show.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
So when I ask you about something else that has to do with gaming on Twitter this week, you've been blowing it up with codes for Destiny.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
So I can't imagine anybody that didn't want to get into that.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
At least it's following you on Twitter that wanted to be in the Destiny beta hasn't gotten in there one way or another.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
I mean, this beta seems about as open as Gmail when it was in its beta for its fourth or fifth year.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
We're like literally. Well, yeah. And every code they give you, they give you three codes. Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
But yet you had all these codes. But we were talking before the show and you haven't yet to be able to play the beta yourself.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
No, I didn't get a chance to. I installed it. That's about as far as it went.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
And now that you're telling me that it's done today, I guess. Well, it's done on PlayStation today.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
And it'll be back on Wednesday for all systems through, I think, Sunday.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
And they're doing a huge stress test on the 26th.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
And that is the day where if you log in after 2 p.m., you get something.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Because they're like perfectly trying to stress test it. So they're trying to give incentive for people to log in.

08:42.000 --> 08:50.000
So if you log in after like 2 p.m., you get some item or badge or some special person item that you get to use in the main game.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
But it surprised me because I'm usually not the shooter game fan. You are with the Call of Duty stuff and everything.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I hit max level in Destiny today.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
It looked fun. It looked fun. I was pretty tired today and I didn't even get a chance to...

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
I didn't really have a lot of free time to play anything. I thought about it before I came here.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm like, I could play this for like an hour. But I'm like, I don't really have time right now.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't really want to do that. I gotta get out of the house.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
I was surprised. You can piecemeal it pretty good. Meaning like if you only have like little 10 and 15 minute bursts to play,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
you can play like one little story chapter in about probably not even 15 minutes.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
So at least the early ones you can.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Well if it's going to be back next week for also PlayStation, then I may do that.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
So I was thinking it was only on 360.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
No, no. Everybody.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Or 360 and Xbox One. But yeah, I'll probably give it a shot next week then.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Excellent. I want a full report next week. Alright.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I'll talk about my own experiences in the Destiny Beta a little later when we get into How Was Your Gaming Week,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
as I'm sure many of you have been trying it out.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
And I want to hear all your opinions in our chat room and on email and all that good stuff.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
But first, let me talk to DarkSakura about the trip because I said we would come back to this topic.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Let's talk a little bit about GamerX. You didn't get to go the first year, unfortunately.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
So what were your thoughts on GamerX going for the first time?

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Sadly, if we're hearing is true, there will not be a GamerX in the future.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Not under the same name.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah, I kind of hope that's what they do with it.

10:16.000 --> 10:24.000
If they want to reinvent it to be a con that has a more general name so that it doesn't feel like it's only for ga-

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
I mean, I said this before. There's a lot of people out there that wonder,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
well, why would I go to GamerX? I'm not gay.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And I'm like, you don't get it. It's not about that.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
So I think if they have to kind of change the name to get that message across,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
if they go with like an Everybody Games con or whatever direction it is they're going in, I get that.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And I think that would be a good thing for the con.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
But anyway, your thoughts on your first and maybe last year?

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Keep in mind, I've been to a number of different conventions of various size.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
This is probably the smallest one I've been to, including Mobicon in Mobile, Alabama.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Including the Sacramento ones?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
The Sacramento ones have gotten really big.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, SacAnime is like really big now.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah. Anyway.

11:01.000 --> 11:11.000
But that being said, it was, I'd have to say, pretty well handled for its size.

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
I think that, you know, it was probably one of the more positive con experiences I've had.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
Although it was, by my esteem, really casual. Really casual.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
But I had a really good time.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
And for me, I'm not very good around a whole lot of people.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
I usually just sort of migrate on my own and go through places.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
But it was nice running into people I hadn't seen in a while.

11:39.000 --> 11:48.000
Actually, two of my good friends were there on, I ran into both of them after a cosplay contest.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
And I spent most of Friday with my friend Brian. Hello, Brian.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Did you run into Explicit at the con?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I didn't. I did. He used to come to the show all the time.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
He just had other things to do about five years ago. He hasn't been on in forever.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I ran into him at the con, and it's probably the first time in like five years.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
He sets up with a little team. Him and his team set up the gaming rooms at conventions.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Like here in Sac, and now in the Bay Area, and all these other places.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
So they're going to come on the show, and he's going to be back in like a month or so.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Right before SacAnime. I told him we were going to get him to come on.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Yeah, right?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I just see him on Facebook all the time.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah, him and his posse are going to come on and talk about like setting up arcade rooms at cons.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
So, it'll be fun. But anyway, sorry, I just thought I'd throw that out there.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Speaking of like people I haven't seen in forever.

12:32.000 --> 12:41.000
Well, now, going, I thought that the games rooms were maybe a little small.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
And I'm not meaning that there weren't a lot going on.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
There was too much going on for the size of the rooms that the games were in.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
I think it probably could have benefited by some bigger meeting rooms.

12:52.000 --> 13:01.000
However, they were, after seeing them set up for changing the ballroom in between different panels,

13:01.000 --> 13:09.000
going to the full size from having the mini rooms, I thought that their management of it was very well done.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
They were very efficient.

13:12.000 --> 13:21.000
The going in and talking to the convention staff, everybody was friendly, everyone was really helpful.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
And I really didn't run into, like I said, I didn't run into anybody really negative as far as the con goers either.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
I think it probably could have benefited from having a little bit more going on.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
But other than that, it was really fun, really casual.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
Now, you actually did cosplay and you entered the, I don't want to say mannequin, the masquerade, right?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
You were actually in that?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Well, there's a difference between a cosplay contest and a masquerade.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, sorry.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
I put a hat on and somebody mistook that for me doing Joker cosplay and that's about the most cosplay I've done.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
Besides the time that Rama had me wear his Black Mage outfit, I guess that was the most cosplay I ever did.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
Well, I was the only Homestuck cosplayer, which surprised the crap out of me.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
Because usually it's like if you get a convention, you have a small infestation of Homestucks.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
However, I did run into a guy wearing a car cat t-shirt.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
Well, more like the cancer t-shirt, but only in the right blood color.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
And a very, very pink cape.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
And he gave me a huge hug and then pulled me aside to watch Homestuck fan animations.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
And I wish I still had his name. I feel really stupid, but he was a really great guy.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Shout out if you're out there listening.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I totally would have worn my dusty old Sackboy costume if I had went.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh my gosh.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
It's still in my garage.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
You would have totally won something.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
Although the cosplayers, the Maleficent, so beautiful.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
We had a drag Maleficent. So nice.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
Honestly, what I really loved about the cosplay contest is that no matter if the cosplay was really intricate,

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
like that Roy in the Mario Kart, in a cart.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh, the Roy Koopa was...

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
That was phenomenal. The Drow Queen. She was amazing.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
And she's so sweet. We chatted before the thing.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
And whether it be something way up on that level or something where it was more conceptual.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Who was the lady that came out that was like the PMS Avenger or something like that?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Oh, no. Hot Flash.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Okay, I was at the Hot Flash.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
From her own webcomic.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I knew it was some type of...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
That's a good way to promote your work though.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Right? Yeah. But no matter where they were at,

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I mean, no matter if the cosplay was very intricate or very conceptual, whatever,

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
everybody was really positive.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
And it's not to say that other cosplay contests aren't like that.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
That's not what I'm saying.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
But I didn't even feel like people were snickering or chatting.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
People were just really excited to see all this diversity.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
And I'm not just saying that in terms of GLBTQ, YA, all that stuff.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm talking about diversity in what they were seeing on stage.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah. And on top of that too, I ran into a trio of Dragon Age cosplayers.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
One of which I'm now Tumblr buddies with.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Nice.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
And they were all so sweet and positive.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
We sat and talked shop about cosplay for a little bit and talked about Dragon Age.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
And they were as nice as they could be. They were great.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Some of the first people I met at the convention.

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
But you saw people who really put a lot of effort into their passion.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
And it was really cool.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It was a lot of...

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
There was no judgment on anybody.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
And I'll tell you this, I mean, while I was the only Homestuck cosplayer,

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
it was pretty nice having a couple of people actually recognize the character

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
and get pictures here and there.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Because I was like, oh, that's fun.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
And even though if I went around half high from huffing E6000,

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
it was really cool just sitting down and getting a chance to hang out.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Because it was so much more casual.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
I got to really discuss the types of things that I usually only get on forums.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
I'll just say quickly, and Rama in our chat room says,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
I assume there's pictures for us to see, right?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
There's a video coming and it's very, very well done by our pal Eddie

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
at Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
I don't think Dark Soccer's cosplay is in the video, sadly, but...

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
There's a really awful picture of me that someone took.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
I'll just post my selfie because my selfie went okay.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
There you go.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.000
But it was funny even though my prop wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
The sphere turned out epic.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
And so I had people wanting me to poke them with my giant Skaia fork.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And I said, well, I have to have your consent.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Because one of the rules of peace binding is that you couldn't poke someone

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
without their consent.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
So I just walked around, hey, can I poke you?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Nice.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Which was really funny.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
And I was actually really grateful to have Brian around for some of that

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
because I was having to manage my stuff and my costume

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
and the giant red fork of death.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Akdeft in our chat room says,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Sky and Dark Soccer, confirm or deny,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
was GamerX the best smelling con you've ever been to?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
There was no confunk.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Seriously.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
Okay, there was an occasional whiff of Axe douchebag spray.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
But other than that, you know, not really.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Hey, now I have smashed douchebag spray in the back.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I use it sparingly.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
Well, I bought Dan Axe deodorant because it only smells minorly of douchebag.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
And I do go around buying my husband's deodorant and smelling it

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
to determine what I want my husband to smell like.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That's fair. That's fair.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Anyway, I want to say a couple of things about the con too

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
because I was really proud.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I think I was really proud of GamerX 2

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
and how it's really grown since the first one.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
And, you know, I was asked this on Twitter this week,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
and that is, like, what most surprised you about GamerX 2?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
And to be honest, although this sounds really weird,

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
my honest answer was that there was more gaming content at GamerX 2.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Weird.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
And, like, I know that sounds like a really weird answer,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
but, like, the first year really felt like

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
we are like-minded people getting together to throw a party.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And that was still continuing this year.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Like, we are still, like, all these inclusive like-minded people

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
trying to get together to throw a party.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
But now it's like, and now some companies are taking notice

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and actually wanting to be a part of that too.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
The gearbox panel is really awesome.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
And props to 2K, you know.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
And they did a great job showing Borderlands the pre-sequel,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
which is the first...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
It's so fun.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
...which is the first time they've shown that in playable form.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
They had a wrestling game there too.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I totally don't know shit about wrestling.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
WWE 2K.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Is that it? All right, thank you. Sorry.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Look, I can't follow everything.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And the wrestler guy was there, Darren Young.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Darren Young was there, yeah.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
He was, like, their big guest this year.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And then, you know what, Ubisoft,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
despite all the crap they got for the Assassin's Creed thing,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
and, you know, rightfully so, and the cosplayers even,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
you've all seen this by now,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
the ladies wearing the boxes that said,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
too hard to render.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, that was great.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
They were actually walking past the window

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
when Alan and I were waiting for you.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Oh, how funny.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
They're in the video Eddie took too.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Ubisoft seemed to, you know, take their licks in good stride,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
and they actually had, like, a Celebrate Diversity poster

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
with the Rayman Rabbids.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm sorry, not the Rayman Rabbids.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
The Raving Rabbids in all the, like, different colors.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
And they were, you know, doing giveaways and stuff too.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
And indie games.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Can we talk about the indie games?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
That rabbit butchering game was great.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
The game, the perfect woman game,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
did you play the Connect one?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I saw it, and I just watched people play it.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I wasn't going to play it.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It was really well done.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
It's one of the, you play, you play, like,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
a woman who's going through these different struggles,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
but it's one of those things where it's, like,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
you're kind of laughing at how absurd it is,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
but then when you really take a step back and look at it,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
you're like, this kind of is sad.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
This isn't funny.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
This is sad.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Because, like, you start and, like,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
you'll do a stage where it's like you're age seven,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
and you are doing child labor in a factory

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
and making Walmart shirts or something like that.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
And you have to, you move your arms in different poses

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
and things, and the better you do,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
you know, the better you go on.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
And then it's like, at one point, I swear to God,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
there's a stage where it's like,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
you're 60 years old and you've become a whore.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Like, and you do all these, like, sexual positions

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
as this old grandma.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
this is, like, I'm laughing at how absurd it is,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
but then I'm like, this is not funny.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
So then you kind of see the, you know,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
the progress you make and so forth.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
And that was, if there is an outside the box type of game

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
or even, like, a best of show, that game was it.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I love that game.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And then there were other really neat games, too.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
The rabbit game, though, was great.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Where you play, it's sort of like Smash Brothers meets Mappy.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Uh-huh.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It was the big four player game where you play

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
as little pixelated rabbits.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I thought you were the one that told me about that,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
or maybe it was Brian that told me about it.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
The duck game is the one I played.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Duck, that was what I was thinking.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Oh, yeah, duck game.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Okay, get this.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Okay, I want the duck game.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Get this.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
That was on Ouya.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
They had an Ouya room,

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
and they were showing some different Ouya games,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
and I kind of walked out of there going,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
you know, I know Loki really bags on the Ouya,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
but I liked a lot of the stuff I was seeing.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I kind of walked out of there going,

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I might want to get an Ouya.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
And don't forget about don't play Jenga on the ice.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
That's later.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
But, yeah, they had the duck game.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
They had, of course, read-only memories

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
is something that, you know, the company behind GamerX

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
is trying to promote because that's their game as well.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
They had another like music hybrid game

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
that I didn't really get to play a lot of.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
I heard more about it in one of the panels.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
But that was, you know, neat looking.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
So, yeah, it was like kind of the duck game especially.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
It was really fun.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
So I was looking forward to getting an Ouya possibly to try that.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
And, you know, again, more indie games,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
very well represented, very happy about that.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
What was I going to say?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, yeah, so it was great to hang out with the other podcasters, of course.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
That part was really cool.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Just it's like being at home and being at family.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It's like going to that family reunion every year.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
That's what GamerX felt like.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Did you get a better turnout for the cross zone panel this year?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Yeah, actually.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Well, last year.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
I missed the full room.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Last year wasn't bad.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
This year was probably like three quarters full of the room.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
So it was pretty good because it was a bigger room than last year.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
So it was nice.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah, it's all on video.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
So that'll be out there at some point.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And, yeah, it was a great panel.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Had a really good time.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Dark Sakura was on the panel.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Anything you want to summarize about it real quick?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
It felt like a really positive experience

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
although like the one photo I saw of you is really derpy.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
I was in mid-explanation like bleh.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
We went to a private celebration party Saturday night

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and that is where the Jenga-thon continued.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I don't know how it started,

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
but all us little podcast sisters were playing Jenga like hardcore.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
And I don't mean like just lighthearted fun Jenga.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm talking like this is serious business here with Jenga.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
And then also in the board game room somebody had brought Don't Break the Ice.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
So somewhere it changed from Jenga to playing Don't Break the Ice.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Meanwhile the other group of us was playing Cards Against Humanity.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Yes, yes.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Which wasn't it, I think it was Eddie's first time playing it.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Oh yeah.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
So that was pretty, I love when you get Cards Against Humanity virgins.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
And they did give out new decks at GamerX.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I didn't get anything.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
They were hidden.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Do you know how they had the big candy bowls out that had candy in them?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
The decks were underneath the candy.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
So if you went into the bowl to pick the candy there were decks in there.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Oh God.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
So yeah, somebody like Grandpa or somebody got Reject decks.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
But I don't think it's unique to GamerX.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I think they've been at other cons too.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
But the Reject decks were there.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
That was pretty cool.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I did get some League of Legends skins.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Which, since I'm going to start playing it, it was kind of an incentive to start playing it again.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
There you go.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Yeah, the cosplayers actually got some goodies.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
If you were cosplaying you had access to the Cospetality Lounge.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
And they were giving out, because League of Legends was also a sponsor of the convention,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
they had two different skin cards.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
And then you got a pin that has a mask on it.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
You know, the old style Harlequin masks.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Oh nice.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
That said Cosplay 2014.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
A nice, legit pin.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
So it was really, really nice.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
That's really cool.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And that's a lot of the craftspeople too.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
We just, you know, basically just hung out shooting the shit about art.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
About, you know, commissions and laws and that type of thing.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
And the one lady was like, oh yeah, I totally recycled Disney pins into stopwatches.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
So it was actually really cool.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I was really admiring her work.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I was really happy for that gal that won the audience favorite.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Because she said it was her first time ever doing cosplay.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Right?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
The loth.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
Like, she was legit, like, choking on stage and starting to cry.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
And I got a little verklempt sitting in the audience.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Because she was an older lady, right?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
She was like late 40s or something, she said?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
A little older than me, yeah.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
But she and I were talking before the costume contest,

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
and we were actually talking about making teeth.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Because her fangs were fitting her a little bit badly.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And we were just talking about, you know, making your own teeth

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
versus ordering acrylic teeth versus having them made.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And so that was the other thing, too.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
I love just hanging out when you're in a casual.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
And it was a contest, but there was no competition, if you know what I mean.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
There were no real major egos involved.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Everyone was hanging out, having a good time.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
I ran into a good Cecil cosplayer for Welcome to the Night Vale.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
And he and I hung out after the OLR panel.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
He was in there.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
And we were just hanging out there chatting, and then we chatted before the thing.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
And I hung out with a couple of Assassin's Creed cosplayers,

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
and my friend Caitlin, who I met through school.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
She was cosplaying Link, the one with the good chain mail.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Nice.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
And so she's just running into people I hadn't seen in a while.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
We could talk on and on and on about the con.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I do want to get to this week in gaming.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
But real quick, just one other question.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
If they do do something next year, I mean, obviously it won't be Gamer X3.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
You said doo-doo.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Oh, stop.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
If they do decide to do a con next year under another name, will you go?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Sure.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Yeah, me too. Absolutely.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm really rooting for those guys.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
I hope they broke even, at least if not made a tiny profit.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
And I hope they can pull it out for next year.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
I just think that it needs to be somewhere other than in the city.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
I think they might want to look at to save on expense.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
I know they really, really want to keep it in the city, and I know what that means.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
But maybe move it out towards SFO?

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
See, I honestly, honestly think that maybe in the same place that YowieCon's been a few years,

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
because that was a really, really good con site.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
It's a little hard when you have to travel between multiple floors to get to your panels and your rooms.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
That was really the biggest complaint I had.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Don't count San Jose out either. San Jose is a great town.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm not saying San Jose out, but I'm saying be close enough to the city, but not be limited by being in the city.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
Because that was one of the hotels outside Barlingame.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
Great location, good view of the bay, everything was nice.

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
But the big thing is that I think it really needs to be opened up to younger people and not be 18 and up.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
While it was fine to have it not be so completely overrun,

28:25.000 --> 28:32.000
I think that having it open to younger people is definitely going to give more encouragement to people who are struggling.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
I've been hearing that feedback a lot, so good, good.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Alright, well, let's move on. More on GamerX to come to vognetwork.com.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
We have that video, the VOG vlog will be coming soon, and some interviews I did there will be coming soon as well.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
So, excited about that.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks. On to the video games and the types of games that we have been playing this week.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with how was your gaming week?

28:53.000 --> 29:00.000
I played Final Fantasy XIV a little bit, finished up more quests that I still had open.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
Back into Bravely Default a little bit, I've just been really slacking off on playing.

29:04.000 --> 29:14.000
And I actually downloaded Bejeweled 3 on Steam, just because I have this weird stupid addiction to puzzle games like that.

29:14.000 --> 29:22.000
And I think I played Bejeweled 3 for like two hours one night when my brain was completely non-functional.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
It was, I don't even know why I did that.

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
And then I have the Adventure Time game and finally decided to hook up my controller, so I'm going to be playing a little bit more of that.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
Other than that, I've, I don't know, I really haven't been doing much gaming this past week,

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
just because I was so tired after the convention. So, I don't know, what are you playing, Loki?

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
I am playing nothing, because I've been working on my game.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Because of baby plagues?

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
No, because I'm working on my game and yeah, I'm mostly just not having time.

30:00.000 --> 30:10.000
I did download the Destiny beta, but didn't get a chance to actually play it, so hopefully when it launches back up again next Wednesday,

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
I'll get to actually try that a little bit. Maybe I'll take some time off to actually play some games.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
Just not really, I don't know, I didn't really want to get back into my Steam backlog right now, because it's so big.

30:24.000 --> 30:32.000
But I'll have to figure something out. That and Minecraft need to really do some updates on the Minecraft stuff,

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
just because it's poor and desolate right now.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
We need to weed.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
Well, I don't know, hopefully no one's gone in there and destroyed everything, because...

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
We had a whitelist server, so I doubt that's happened.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Yeah, so I don't know, I'm just trying to figure out a way to get more people to play.

30:51.000 --> 30:59.000
It's almost like I kind of wish we would have joined another server that already had an established base there, but it's just...

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I'll play more this week.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
We'll see, I don't know.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
If you set a day, we can try and all be on.

31:04.000 --> 31:13.000
I just have to update it again, and just get all the updates in place, and then kind of go through.

31:13.000 --> 31:23.000
I was going to update the arena, but I was developing weapons and stuff in there, and I just didn't get a chance.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
I kind of got distracted, so we'll see.

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
I forgot, because we weren't here last week as well, to the other games that I played.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Other than the indie games there, there was Borderlands, the pre-sequel.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Isn't that what it was called?

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Yeah.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
That was fun.

31:39.000 --> 31:45.000
I suck playing it on a controller, because I've been playing it on PC, but it was really, really super fun.

31:45.000 --> 31:53.000
I really wanted to ask them about the fact that most of the characters are robots, so the fact that running out of air wouldn't really affect them...

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
It'd only be, I think, if you were playing Claptrap.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
Well, Claptrap... Oh, that's right. The other guy that became a robot, he's actually human, but yeah.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
But yeah, the other three playables were human.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
I was very happy, because my favorite character in Borderlands 2 is asexual.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Maya.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Oh.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
The siren.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Interesting.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
I didn't know that they...

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
That's why they came out on one of the panels, didn't it?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I asked the question. They gave me the answer.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Interesting.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
So, yes.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Official.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
There it is. Official.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
Alright, my gaming week, then. I will talk a little bit about what I've been playing this week.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
So, I mentioned the Destiny beta earlier, and I've played it enough where I've hit max level, which isn't...

32:34.000 --> 32:40.000
Yeah, it's only level 8. It's not like I have to play a lot a lot, but it means I'm playing it enough where I enjoy it.

32:40.000 --> 32:47.000
So, here's what I actually kind of compared Destiny to, and I know a lot of you guys have been playing it, so I'm kind of curious what you guys think of this comparison.

32:47.000 --> 32:55.000
I kind of think Destiny is Halo, obviously, mixed with, you ready for it? Fantasy Star Online, I think is the best way to describe Destiny.

32:55.000 --> 33:04.000
And the reason why I say that is because obviously it has those kind of like MMO components where you pick up quests and things, which I think makes it really easy to compare it to World of Warcraft.

33:04.000 --> 33:14.000
But I actually think the way it's designed feels a little more like Fantasy Star Online, because you have that centralized hub that has all your shops where you get all the upgrades, and then you have the different places that you visit in that hub.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
But then you go out into the world, and you're going to the same zone over and over again.

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
And it's not as repetitive as necessarily as it was in Fantasy Star Online, where it was like Forest, Forest 2, Forest 3.

33:25.000 --> 33:32.000
But you're certainly going to the old Russia map, and okay, this time you land here, and you're going into this building and exploring.

33:32.000 --> 33:41.000
Or this time you're going to go onto the other side of the map beyond this hill, and you're going on your mount, on your rocket over here, because you've got to go find some people over here.

33:41.000 --> 33:49.000
So it's like you're going to different portions of the map, and then eventually you open up an explore mode where it's just, okay, now you're on the map, and you do pretty much whatever you want.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
Kill whatever you want for experience, and if you see these beacons, you can pick up these quests and do that too.

33:54.000 --> 34:04.000
So in that way, and not only that, but you can put together your parties of one to three people to take on this content together.

34:04.000 --> 34:12.000
So in that regard, it felt a lot like PSO to me, because PSO, you can do it by yourself, or you can do it with other people, and that whole thing.

34:12.000 --> 34:24.000
I did try to do the PvP a little bit. There's a section of Destiny called the Crucible, which is essentially what you would be looking for in what the makers of Halo are going to do next.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
There was a little capture the flag type game in the beta, where you basically hold three points.

34:29.000 --> 34:38.000
I am awful at it, which I expected, because I'm really bad at first person shooters. So in that regard, it kind of takes the fun out of it when you're playing against really, really good people, and it's like you just die, die, die.

34:38.000 --> 34:45.000
And even though I couldn't hear anybody, that's probably for the best, because I was probably getting called all sorts of names in the book, and it's just, you know.

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
I did notice though, and to Destiny's credit, it seemed like after I had died for the fifth time, a little thing popped up and said stat boost.

34:52.000 --> 35:02.000
So I think it actually does start to take pity on you if it realizes you really, really suck, and it actually boosts your stats, which I'm thankful for that, because I need some boosted stats.

35:02.000 --> 35:15.000
But the cool thing is, I didn't even really have to touch that. I did that because I wanted to check it out so I could say something about it if I'm going to do a quote, quote review of the beta, although you really shouldn't review betas.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
But y'all, everybody's playing it, and y'all making impressions on the game from it anyway. I'm doing the same thing.

35:20.000 --> 35:29.000
And in a positive way, I think with this game, I don't know if I necessarily would have been like totally wanting to buy it day one, but now after this beta, I'm like, yeah, I'll buy it day one.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Because there's enough single player and co-op material to make it really interesting.

35:34.000 --> 35:49.000
I did a dungeon, I'm using my quotey fingers, a dungeon, although they call it a strike team mission. It's all the tropes of a World of Warcraft dungeon where it's like you go in an instance and you get a few mobs and then you have these boss monsters that you kill and so forth.

35:49.000 --> 35:56.000
It doesn't seem like everybody plays a unique role yet, but I bet they will later, where like the warlock can do certain things, the titan can do certain things.

35:56.000 --> 36:05.000
But I ran one of those dungeons with Ian from Koopa Club, who's pretty good at Destiny and was helping me out and reviving me a lot, and that was actually a lot, a lot of fun.

36:05.000 --> 36:18.000
We had a random guy that joined the party too, who had to revive me like all the time, but we got through it without completely dying and having to start from the beginning, so I was really happy with that progress. I got a ton of XP from it too.

36:19.000 --> 36:27.000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetworld.com. Fifth Dream says, I ran around and died in Quake for many hours. I probably got two kills.

36:27.000 --> 36:33.000
Sjo100Matt says, Aren't there buffs in some MMOs that do the same thing? If you fail to raid a few times, you get a special buff?

36:33.000 --> 36:46.000
Yes and no, Sjo100Matt. They do that for usually PvE content, but not PvP that I've seen. I'm sure some of the MMOs out there have it, but just not one that I can think of off the top of my head.

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
Brad from Paw Culture agrees with my assessment. That's exactly what I thought, and that's like peanut butter and chocolate for me. Very good.

36:54.000 --> 37:05.000
That sounds like, well, they do that for like, I know Call of Duty does that. They have death streaks where if you die, you know, five times or four times in a row without getting a kill, you get a perk.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
There you go.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
It's usually something really minor just to help you out a little bit.

37:10.000 --> 37:20.000
Alan Alchemy says, Unreal Tournament is the only competitive arena FPS where I still have a good time even when I got juiced to respawn every two seconds and sucked out loud. I'll probably have more fun with it when I play with friends.

37:20.000 --> 37:31.000
I think if I could do PvP with friends, it would be more fun. And to be fair, my buddy Justin tried to invite me to a game last night, but I wasn't a high enough level yet. So he tried to get me into PvP, but I couldn't do it.

37:31.000 --> 37:46.000
So, there's that. Yeah, I liked Destiny enough where I'm going to for sure buy the full game day one. I'm on board now. Like, I didn't think I'd like it that much because I suck at first person shooters, but I loved the Phantasy Star Online element of it.

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
Made it so that if I wanted to play an easier level over and over to try and level up a little bit, like, I really like that.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
The one thing I am going to razz Destiny on is kind of the same thing a lot of people are picking on, but it really is a problem.

37:58.000 --> 38:08.000
The story and the voice acting are not at the same level as the rest of the game. And I am going to pick on the same thing a lot of people are picking on.

38:08.000 --> 38:15.000
The voice of Ghost in particular and Peter Dinklage's acting is not up to par with the rest of the game.

38:15.000 --> 38:22.000
And I know that sounds like a pretty shitty thing to say about a great actor, but the reality is some lines are laughably bad.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Like when you're fighting a boss and the ghost suddenly pipes up and says,

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
It's coming through the wall! Like, it's just really awkward.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
Like, I'm just like, okay, turn him off. Shut him up. Can we change the ghost or whatever?

38:35.000 --> 38:42.000
I don't necessarily blame Peter Dinklage for that. I worry part of that is in the direction of the game.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
And maybe just that the ghost character is very bland.

38:46.000 --> 38:55.000
And if you think about it, we've had some really strong support characters with you in other games of a similar nature.

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
Borderlands, right? Another which I didn't even invoke Borderlands necessarily with Destiny, but obviously a lot of similarities there too.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
But Claptrap, come on, awesome character, awesome support, right?

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
Look at Portal, GLaDOS always taunting you.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Or Wheatley.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Or Wheatley, right? Great characters.

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
You know, Ghost is not that, is nowhere near that same level. Ghost is bland.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
And that I think is one of the worst possible things you can do.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Or even like, was it the Arbiter or whatever?

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
There's this random cutscene too that was just really uninteresting that I wanted to skip.

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
So, again, it's a beta, so I'm not going to say this is the way the game is, period.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
I realize there's parts of the story I probably haven't seen, more layers of the onion to peel back and so forth.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Well, isn't this something that they're talking about stretching out for like ten years or something?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
You know, like, Destiny?

39:48.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah, I don't know if it's through DLC or what that is, but I am a little concerned that Ghost may not be fixable at this point.

39:56.000 --> 40:04.000
The game will survive on its strong gameplay, but that is going to be a detraction from the game, unfortunately.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
It would be great if you can switch Ghost with a different Ghost at some point.

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
It could seem like that's something you could do by looking at the inventory, but we'll see what happens with that later on.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
So, let's see.

40:18.000 --> 40:27.000
Fifth Dream says, well, he's a robot drone thing, so I get that maybe it's supposed to be the mood he's supposed to be,

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
but if he's a motionless drone, then he shouldn't also be going,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
It's coming through the wall!

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
Go for A or B, but not this weird, awkward point in between.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
Just make him completely Tyrion Lannister, that's all you need to do.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
Fuck this trying to act like a robot, just Lannister all the way.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That would be perfect.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
Alan Alchemy says, a motionless robot without empathy isn't a very good mood to set in an action game.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Maybe that's the direction he got.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
You're a robot, so you don't actually give a fuck about anything. Talk like that, perhaps.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Brad from PodCulture says, everything is fixable, just a matter of how much work you want to do on it.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
And Fifth Dream says, I don't know, I liked Ghost, maybe I'm weird.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I also hate Sailor Moon Crystal, so maybe I'm weird.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
Hey, it's the show where every gamer has a voice. Every weird gamer gets a voice in Fifth Dream.

41:14.000 --> 41:21.000
Alright, again, I don't want to harp on that too much, because that's one minor little blip on what otherwise is going to be a fantastic game.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
So, yeah, looking forward to that on, what is it, 9-9 that that's out?

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
I know it's one of those dates that plays the numerology, so very cool.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Otherwise, I've just been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV.

41:32.000 --> 41:39.000
I got my Scholar to level 50, woohoo, and we took down Good King Mooglemawg Extreme this week, so that was neat.

41:39.000 --> 41:49.000
We tried to do some pulls on Ramu on Extreme mode, and wow, that was a clusterfuck, but I felt progress, so that was a good place to be.

41:49.000 --> 41:57.000
And also, I want to shout out this, because Alan finally linked his Steam library in mine, so I can play all the games he has that I don't.

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
And one of those games I spent a little time with the other night was Pac-Man Championship Edition, or Championship Edition Deluxe, excuse me,

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
which I've played to death on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but come on, I had to play it on the PC as well,

42:10.000 --> 42:17.000
and it was weird seeing the little arrows by Pac-Man where you could actually see what direction you've punched in to go next.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
I don't remember that being in the other versions, but it actually kind of, especially when you're going slower speeds,

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
it enhances things a little bit, because it's like, oh, now I can see what direction I'm going in.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
When you're at speed level 40 or 50, though, things are moving too fast, you can't even look at that arrow.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
But yeah, a strong, fun game as it was before.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Alright, that's it for our gaming weeks. Let's do some quick plugs. Housekeeping.

42:39.000 --> 42:45.000
We will be here for the next several weeks. The next week we will not be here is Labor Day weekend.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
We will not be here Labor Day weekend, as I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
And being that it is Labor Day weekend, a lot of people here in the States have other plans and go off and do other things,

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
which would likely include Loki and Dark Soccer and many of you that are listening.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
So we will not be here Labor Day weekend. I think Dark Soccer, you said you're going to SAC Anime, right?

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
I might.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah, so you got that. So we will not be here Labor Day weekend.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
If you are in the Atlanta area, or really anywhere within a 500 mile radius of Atlanta,

43:11.000 --> 43:18.000
I do hope you come to check out Dragon Con. Lots of VOG personalities will be there.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
I don't have the entire list memorized, but I know at least myself, Travis from Understation Live,

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
Bobby from Bobby Black Wolf, I'm pretty sure John from Critical Miss is going to be there,

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
and other guys from Network. I think Brian from British Invaders is there this year.

43:31.000 --> 43:37.000
Lots of people will be there, and we do have a panel on Monday to talk about networking.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
And then Bobby and I will be on some other panels throughout the weekend. Very excited about that.

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
So Dragon Con 2014 is only like six weeks away. But sadly, OLR will not be here that weekend.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
That is Labor Day weekend.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
That's that.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
Plugs. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR. Follow us on Facebook.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
And I am going to start plugging this every week, because Jason worked very hard on this,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
and we don't really give it enough credit.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
I want to plug our YouTube channels. That's YouTube user Orange Lounge Radio.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
Do subscribe to us over there, and check out the videos when they're posted of our episodes.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
It's a great way for you to listen to OLR on anything.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
If you want to listen on your 3DS, you can do that, thanks to YouTube.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So check that out on YouTube.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
That's it for plugs. How about gaming news?

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
45 minutes into the show, it's time to get to some gaming news. Let's do it.

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
Yes. So Microsoft, they have put out the word that, hey, guess what?

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
You know, when you take $100 off of a console, it's going to sell better.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
And that's the case with the Connectless Xbox One.

44:43.000 --> 44:49.000
It's actually double the monthly sales of the Xbox One console, so not bad.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
They haven't said exactly how many systems were sold during that time, but they have shipped,

44:53.000 --> 45:00.000
I guess in April they said they have shipped 5 million systems, so I don't know where they're at exactly yet.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
We'll have to wait until the MPD numbers come out, I guess, in a few more weeks, I want to say.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
So yeah, that's pretty cool.

45:08.000 --> 45:17.000
And see, my question though still is, they don't have the Kinect available separately yet,

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
except I know they have the Kinect 2.0 for PC, which is $200, and that makes absolutely no sense to me.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
And I think that's mainly for developers, but they don't have the Kinect sold separately.

45:29.000 --> 45:39.000
And on top of that, the games that do require Kinect don't have the labeling on them like they do on the Xbox 360.

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
So for example, when Fantasia comes out, if you're a consumer and you don't know what you're doing,

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
and you buy an Xbox One without Kinect, and you buy that game, you're fucked.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Because you didn't know that it required Kinect, because it doesn't say on it.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
So I'm surprised they haven't figured that out yet.

45:56.000 --> 46:03.000
So yeah. If I were to buy an Xbox One, I probably would get the Kinect version.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
Just because you never know what they're going to use that for later on.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
Like if that's going to tie in with their VR stuff or who knows.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
But I'd still want it for $399.

46:18.000 --> 46:25.000
Do you think this is the beginning of a trend for Microsoft that's in some ways badly needed?

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
The backpedaling? No, they've done that for a long time.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
I'm talking about the actual sales and all this.

46:31.000 --> 46:38.000
Yeah, I mean that definitely helps. I think more of the strong lineup that they've got coming third party and first party is more going to help them.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Sorry, let me rephrase. Are more sales a good thing? Yes, stupid. Of course they are.

46:42.000 --> 46:50.000
What I really mean by that is, is this a good sign that this could continue this inertia through the very important holiday season?

46:51.000 --> 46:58.000
I think so. I think both systems are going to see a pretty decent boost in sales because there's a lot of good games coming out.

46:58.000 --> 47:06.000
That being said though, there's still on PlayStation 4, there's not a lot of first party games that I really want to sell me that system.

47:06.000 --> 47:12.000
That's kind of the thing. I really want a PlayStation 4 more than I want an Xbox One.

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
Just because I like the PlayStation Plus stuff and all that.

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
But I can't see myself getting a PlayStation 4 right now because there's actually more Xbox One games I want to play.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
Well, really only one Xbox One game I want to play right now. Forza Horizon 2.

47:27.000 --> 47:37.000
There's just not enough exclusives right now. I wish half those 2015 games were coming out fourth quarter because that would really sell me a system.

47:37.000 --> 47:45.000
And that's the other thing too, is by 2015 fourth quarter, I need to have both systems. All three systems because there's so many great games.

47:45.000 --> 47:52.000
I'm pretty sure the Halo collection and the fact that I can play Halo 2 with my friends all over again is going to be the thing that pushes me over the edge on Xbox.

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
I don't know. I like Halo, but I don't know if I'd want to buy that.

47:58.000 --> 48:05.000
Well, I mean, that's the thing that's pushing me over the edge. I still want also Sunset Overdrive. I'd like to try it.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Oh yeah, Sunset Overdrive definitely is going to be awesome.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
There's other things that are sweetening the pot too, but that's the thing where it's like, alright, you broke me, that's the one.

48:12.000 --> 48:20.000
But that's the thing, they don't really have a whole lot, like first party stuff for Playstation 4, they don't really have a ton. They have LittleBigPlanet 3.

48:20.000 --> 48:27.000
And that's not even really, I mean, I don't think that's going to sell anyone's systems. Especially since it's on Playstation 3 as well.

48:27.000 --> 48:36.000
And that's Drive Club, but that was supposed to have been out last year anyways. That's not really, it's really third party stuff that's kind of pushing, but that's both systems.

48:36.000 --> 48:45.000
I mean, you can, I don't need the buy, but that's the other thing too. A lot of games do play slightly better on the Playstation 4 versus the Xbox ones.

48:45.000 --> 48:53.000
I'm pretty sure come holiday, Sony's going to sweeten the pot on the Playstation 4 by keeping the same price for the system.

48:53.000 --> 49:01.000
So $3.99, but they're going to start to include games with it, or download codes for games, or free Playstation Plus or something with it.

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
Like some of their, at this point, aging games like Knack, these things can just be thrown in.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
I mean, those copies aren't flying off the shelves anymore.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Yeah, they're not worth anything though.

49:12.000 --> 49:20.000
To somebody who might be sitting there going, Xbox One looks cool, but Playstation 4 also cool and comes with two games.

49:20.000 --> 49:27.000
But see, yeah, and I understand that they can do that, but they're even kind of doing that already with the Xbox One.

49:27.000 --> 49:37.000
I mean, they had, was it for a while there, they were giving out Titanfall with stuff, and they were also doing Forza 5, and it was still the same price.

49:37.000 --> 49:46.000
I want to say, I have to look it up though, because I can't remember, but I want to say that the Destiny bundle that they have coming out in September

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
is not the same price as just the standalone system.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
I want to say it's actually more, so I don't know if you're really saving any money there.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
Let's see here, if you know it's for Destiny.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
But, I don't know, I wouldn't necessarily want to buy the system for Destiny.

50:03.000 --> 50:11.000
Yeah, $4.49, so it's $50 more, so you're saving a little bit of money, and I mean, what are you really getting?

50:11.000 --> 50:19.000
The system looks a little bit different, and you get, you know, a trial to, you know, a 30-day trial to PlayStation Plus, which is woohoo, I mean.

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
But, that doesn't seem like much of a deal, you're really only saving about like $10 there.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

50:27.000 --> 50:33.000
Sky, Sony should keep the price and include the cameras, kind of an FU to Xbox.

50:33.000 --> 50:40.000
You know, during E3 this year, there was a point where Bobby and I looked at each other, and if he's in chat right now and listening, he'll tell you this is true.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
We looked at each other going, they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it.

50:43.000 --> 50:50.000
Because it was the way they were talking or whatever, we're like, they're gonna fucking do it, they're gonna include the camera, this is gonna be the kick em in the balls moment.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
You know, like, oh my god, oh my god.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
And then it ended up being something else, and we were like, oh.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
That could've been such a moment.

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
But like, I know we're gonna be talking about it a little bit later, but they're still not utilizing that camera for anything.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Like, they're not.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
There's not, outside of Just Dance and so forth, there's not.

51:07.000 --> 51:14.000
The fair thing is, to be fair, at least Sony was never trying to kind of go out there and going, this is an essential part of the system.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
You need, you know, it was always like, okay, yeah, it's there if you want it.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
And you can stream with it, and you can play Just Dance, we have the playroom and all that.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
You know, it's a fun little thing, but, you know, it's not required.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
And yet that thing was still flying off of shelves because of the streaming component alone.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
People really wanted that camera for the live streaming.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
So, I don't know. I still, I want these systems.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
I mean, ironically, you know, the Wii U has more games for it right now.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
They're coming out fourth quarter.

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
I mean, Smash Brothers and Mario Kart, I could see myself playing that stuff, but it's just, you know, I don't know.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
It's hard to decide what system I'd want to get.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
I guess I'd have to wait until the fourth quarter, see if there's gonna be any more price drops or anything like that.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
I don't think there's gonna be any price drops, but bundles or something.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
It's always good to wait.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
I forgot about this. Bobby just linked to a picture from the E3 wrap-up this year in one of the galleries.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
And he linked to a picture, and that was me.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
He had his camera out ready to take a picture of me at the moment that they announced that the camera was gonna be included.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
Like, to get my big, like, ah face, you know.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
But then it ended up being something else, so my picture's a little more reserved, where I'm like, hmm.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
But he had his camera out ready to go. That was funny.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Alright, let's move on.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
Something that you can play probably on your One and your PlayStation 4.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
Tekken 7. Tekken 7, it's happening.

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
IGN, I guess, kind of spoiled things a little bit, talking that Tekken 7 was coming.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
And this was before the developer actually announced it.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
Of course, the EVO was going on last week while we weren't here, and this is where Tekken 7 was finally unveiled.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Tekken 7 will be running on Unreal Engine 4.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
It's in development for the PS4 and the Xbox One.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
No word about the Wii U, but don't count on it.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
If it's Unreal Engine 4, it's definitely not coming to the Wii U.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Yep. Unless they get some type of downgraded version.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Coming on the GameCube!

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Now, this is what's also interesting.

53:03.000 --> 53:09.000
Producer Katsuhiro Harada announced this at EVO 2014 to officially announce the game.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
However, this was not the game they were originally planning to announce.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
There was no trailer prepared for Tekken 7 because of this.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
They had to do one very quickly in his hotel room.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
They put the Tekken trailer together quickly.

53:23.000 --> 53:35.000
And they asked fans to show excitement for the video to overcome the difficulties of having to explain to his boss at Namco Bandai when he gets back to Japan.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
Because, again, that was not the game that they were supposed to reveal.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
What was the game they were supposed to reveal?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Don't know.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
Now, more information to come at San Diego Comic-Con on this game.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
Apparently, that was the place where they were going to reveal this.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
Interesting that a lot of gaming news is going to come out of San Diego Comic-Con this year.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
Well, gee. What other game could they possibly be talking about?

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Probably either, I'm guessing, Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Maybe. I mean, what the hell ever happened to that, right?

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
Because, I mean, obviously if they have an engine now built for Tekken 7, that's going to be the engine that that's running on.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Right.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
So, I'd be willing to, but that's probably what it is.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Or who knows? It could also be a new Soul Calibur game.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Or something, you know, one of their other franchises.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
Because it's been Soul Calibur 5.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
That was a while ago.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
It was a while ago now, so it could be due for that too.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
So, we'll see. We'll see.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
But, yeah, Tekken Cross Street Fighter is more likely.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
But, I'm sure there will be plenty more news to come out of San Diego Comic-Con.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
Among other things is what Nintendo is going to be there.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
I just didn't mean to interrupt you.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
Oh, that's okay.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
It's Evo.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Evo. Sorry.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Evolution.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Oh, okay.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Did you hear about the guy who wasn't...

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
Sorry, before you all make fun of me, ask me how good I am at fighting games.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
I'm not. Sorry.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
By the way, did you hear about the guy who just...

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
Street Fighter wasn't even his game and he went in and just won the whole thing.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Oh, really? Was that the guy who won on the PlayStation 1 controller?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Yeah, it was the PlayStation controller.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
It was awesome.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
We were watching him play as Rose.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
You know why I call it Evo?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Because I think of that song from 2DX Red.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
E-V-O-66.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
You remember that song?

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Anybody?

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Hello? Dark Tetsuya has to know what I'm talking about. Somebody.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Alright, anyway.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Fine then, Dark Soccer. Why don't you take the floor with another story?

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Well, maybe I will then. Geez, Rob.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Well, how about some crappy news?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Everyone likes crap, don't they?

55:28.000 --> 55:36.000
Microsoft is laying off 18,000 employees and closing Xbox Entertainment Studios.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
Basically coming from Phil Spencer is saying that...

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
Well, he says he expects to close Xbox Entertainment Studios.

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
And then says, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of the entire team.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
Even though we're laying you off.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
But yeah.

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
It's basically, they're going to be letting a lot of people go.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
Which of course means that a whole lot of people are going to be jobless.

56:03.000 --> 56:13.000
Which, again, I could say certain things about that, but I'm not going to get political.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Yeah, that sucks. Bad news.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.000
So that means, hey, there's a bunch of Microsoft people who are going to be looking for jobs.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Good video game companies.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
We should probably throw out some job fairs.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
That's a bummer. It's never easy to talk about layoffs.

56:31.000 --> 56:41.000
I mean, I heard it was mostly the Nokia side of things, but it's definitely impacting the entertainment and Xbox side too.

56:41.000 --> 56:49.000
Actually, it says that the total is $12,500 for them at Nokia.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
Which was from an April acquisition.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
But they're talking about doing other layoffs.

56:56.000 --> 57:02.000
And they're not saying specifically what divisions, but the biggest one is Xbox Entertainment Studios.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
And now, Loki, I think you have a little more on this layoff stuff, right?

57:07.000 --> 57:17.000
Yeah, so basically one of the things that they were talking about, of course, that the Xbox Entertainment Studios would be affected.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
But this does not affect Quantum Break.

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
Remember, Quantum Break also had kind of the live TV show portion of the game.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
But that apparently is still on track, according to Microsoft.

57:32.000 --> 57:39.000
And also, they're still committed to Halo Nightfall and the Halo TV series.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
So I guess we'll see what other stuff comes out of that.

57:43.000 --> 57:53.000
And then also, it's apparently affecting some of the other country teams, including Europe, Middle Eastern, and Asian Territory Xbox teams.

57:53.000 --> 58:05.000
And they're saying that, I guess, 75% of the full-time positions available on Xbox EMEA would be axed.

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
And your employees would have to reapply for the remaining open roles.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
That kind of sucks. That's a lot of cuts.

58:13.000 --> 58:21.000
A lot of this is really surprising how fast that Xbox Entertainment thing just fizzled.

58:21.000 --> 58:29.000
I'm really kind of, I mean, it's not like we haven't teased Microsoft before about pulling the plug on things way before they should have.

58:29.000 --> 58:35.000
I.e. Game Room, I.e. 1 vs. 100, I.e. the Xbox Vision Camera, I.e.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
Yeah, the Entertainment Division was gone before it really started. That's kind of weird.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
This is Murica.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
It's still weird.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
If we don't get instant results, we can't.

58:48.000 --> 58:57.000
Well, it's more of they're playing it safe, because this is a lot of a big gamble on whether it's going to take off for them.

58:57.000 --> 59:06.000
And I think that they're figuring it's just not, that they're not able to do this exclusive TV service that they're playing on.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Maybe they're going to go to a different route.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
Well, could a lot of that, though, I mean, the fact that they pulled the plug this quick,

59:11.000 --> 59:17.000
Dark Soccer, come from the fact that they got such negative feedback when they did that very first unveiling of the Xbox One.

59:17.000 --> 59:23.000
And the internet blew up with movies, movies, movies, sports, sports, sports, no one cur.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
Like, do you think that Microsoft kind of went, oh, crap, nobody cares about this.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
So I guess that's pretty knee jerk.

59:30.000 --> 59:37.000
Yeah. It was weird that like just last month they were hyping up this whole that they dug up the eat is they dug up the garbage in the desert.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Right. They're going to do this movie about digging up people's garbage in the desert.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
And by garbage, I mean, copies of E.T., the extraterrestrial. Right.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
They're they're going to do this whole movie about digging up garbage in the desert.

59:48.000 --> 59:54.000
And like it was this big thing. And now it's just I mean, I can't imagine that movie isn't still happening or is it.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
No, I would imagine that's being finished.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
But still, I mean, that wasn't even had a chance to see how many viewers that would get.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
But to be fair, though, what have they really announced that they're canceling?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Because the only shows they even talked about that they were going to have were the Halo one and break and quantum break.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And those are still happening. So, well, I mean, I don't even know what's canceled.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Other than who there might have been a show on Fable, which I totally wouldn't have given a shit about.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
They have a deal with Sarah Silverman comedy, something with her.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Oh, God, I thought I read. Oh, she's funny. I think I know she's funny, but it's like, I don't know.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Don't get me wrong. I love the Sarah Silverman program.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Yeah. And I'm sad that that is off the air, but she'll find another place.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I just I don't know. I think I think you'll even need like these kind of outlets anymore because you can just do your own thing on YouTube or make your own website and have your own streaming thing.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And people don't really need that. They're not going to be like, oh, I'm not going to watch it because it's on the Internet.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Right. There's tons of shows that the Web series and stuff that they have that are quite successful on YouTube and other streaming sites.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So maybe that's the problem is there's so much competition out there with that kind of stuff that no one really does care about.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Microsoft put now, hey, look, we've got TV show. Cool. So is everybody else?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Yeah, I think that's a big part of the problem, too, is how fragmented the distribution, digital distribution of TV is getting like it's it's getting really bad, you know.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And when Netflix got really big and everybody wanted a piece of that, I was just talking Hulu, but I'm talking HBO has their own thing.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Comcast has their own thing is like everybody wants their own digital TV thing. It's like there may not be room for for Microsoft in that picture.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:44.000
You know, and unless Microsoft is going to get the next orange is the new black, you know, they're not necessarily going to sign up all these people interested in the in the TV thing.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So I guess they never took the took the financial chance to find out. I guess Microsoft is not in a place where they can take that risk.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I do remember now they had was it that there is one show that I read or one thing that I know that they announced that they are probably not going to do, which was was it Powers or something like that?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Oh, yeah. That was that was Sony. Oh, that was Sony. Yes. Oh, OK. I still don't care about that.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yeah, it was Sony. You know, it was Sony. OK, well, whatever. I thought that was another show.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But I guess Sony already has an entertainment division. Sony has a music division. Sony is a big company besides just PlayStation.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:33.000
They're making movies. Also, keep in mind, you know, the difference between laws versus a U.S. based companies and Japanese based companies.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They can get into much broader ventures over there a lot more easily than we can because of trust.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And I think Microsoft would be in a good position to maybe team up with somebody else for that.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And maybe that's ultimately what's going to happen. Maybe Xbox Entertainment's being closed because there's going to be a deal coming with.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I don't know. Like, what what what TV network is is Halo supposed to end up on?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Wasn't it the thing with CBS, like maybe Showtime or something? I don't know where I'm getting that.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
They still have a. No, I'm thinking that because the lady that was the head of she came from CBS.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Do they still have like a share like NBC or something? You know, because I know they have MSNBC.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I don't believe Microsoft actually has a stake in MSNBC anymore. I don't think. Don't quote me on that.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
But I remember they were trying to get rid of it. So. But anyway, it'll be a.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Why wouldn't they just like I mean, so what? Just like. Oh, why wouldn't they just partner up?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I guess because they want people to be drawn to the Xbox platform, but I don't know.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Put in Netflix or something. So what? So you can watch a Halo show on a Sony platform.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Oh, you're making more money. Who gives a shit? You know, I don't understand what the problem is.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
People aren't going up. OK, let's be real. Here's Microsoft. Nobody.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Let's say that you have a new orange is the new black, whatever. Nobody is buying a fucking console for a show.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Nobody. I'm sorry. Even if it was like Game of Thrones, I don't think anyone would fucking buy a console.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
No, I would agree with a show. I would agree with that. And so who cares?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Just put it on Hulu, put it on whatever. It's it's although I will say this.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's not necessarily about making it, you know, that you have to buy the console for the one show.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:25.000
But it's about enhancing the value of the console when it sits next to this self next to Nintendo's console and Sony's console for the whole family.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And maybe mom is making the purchase or mom and dad together or mom and mom, whatever the family is, are making the decision together that day to get the console.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
If it says, oh, my kids will enjoy it because it has sunset overdrive.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Oh, but I'm going to enjoy it because it has orange is the new blacks creators next project or whatever.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I keep you reference. Red is the new blue. Red is the new blue. Yes.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Red versus the new blue is available here on I would watch that.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yeah, I think I would do as long as it has donut and text.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It's available here on the Xbox one. And so I'm going to buy this because Sony doesn't have that and Nintendo doesn't have that.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I would totally watch a red versus blue movie. That would be fantastic.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Like in theaters. But no, seriously, though, I think it's even less of just looking at the console thing.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It's even more of like they're just they're online services justifying the cost of paying for Xbox Live.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Because, I mean, they're trying with the free games and stuff, but it's just not quite what Sony is offering.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Real quick comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Rama says Sony has many divisions, but on the computing entertainment one is profitable.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Lol. Samsung is the new Sony when it comes to TVs. That's true.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I have heard Sony has not been the PlayStation has been something that's been keeping them afloat, which is interesting.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I wonder if just before the NFL season there will be a rise in Xbox one sales.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Madden usually offers an NFL Sunday ticket subscription if you buy the game. Word is they're offering it on the Xbox one.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:09.000
BSingle40 in chat says didn't NPD report come out Friday saying PlayStation 4 won June despite the Microsoft price cut?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Loki, you're the expert on the sales stuff.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I didn't remember looking at the numbers. I don't know.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
That wouldn't surprise me.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I think they were both up. I'm not sure. And I think I remember seeing that. I just don't remember.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Because, I don't know. Because they would have, let's put it this way.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
They would have said we outsold the PlayStation if they outsold the PlayStation because that's something they're rubbing.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
They're going to try to bend it however, you know, sounds the best for them.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Tigerclaw in chat says you think Nintendo will ever join with an entertainment network?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
No. Very much no. It's not the business they're in and I don't think it's something they want to do.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It's about how they do things.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Nintendo wants to keep their hands on the reins.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Keep in mind, and nobody talks about this on the Wii U, nobody talks about it, but it's there and it is kind of neat.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They have a TV experience that enhances the TV you already have.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
That just proves that Nintendo is not interested.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
They have built something that enhances the TV you already have.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Where you can watch American Idol or big sports games and actually chat along with other viewers in a Miiverse style environment.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
If you own a Wii U, check it out because you probably didn't even know it was there.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And they've actually been adding to it and enhancing it.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I bet Drag Race is fun to watch with that.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I don't think they have it for Drag Race but they ought to.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
That would be funny.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
They ought to. I'm going to petition Nintendo.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Wait a minute. I have a business card from Nintendo PR. I'm going to email him tomorrow.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
You know what's funny?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Tiara and I used to do that for books.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
When the Harry Potter books would come out, we'd just sit online and comment back and forth about where we were.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
OMG. OMG. OMG.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
What the fuck is he thinking?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
It was pretty funny.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Book chat.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
That's what we need. We need ebook chat.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Ebook chat.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I'm going to patent that.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
You have ebook chat on the iBook store or on Kindle or whatever.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Better check and see if that's been reserved.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
You can leave comments and books so that people in your book community can read the comments they left on sections of books.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
That'd be great.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
You could be a millionaire.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Alright, well here's something that now let's hope.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I know this game isn't coming to Wii U but let's hope that there's a way that my mother can participate in the chat for this next game we're going to talk about.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Mortal Kombat X.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Because you know my mom's a big Mortal Kombat fan.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Rab.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Rab.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
That's so gross.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I haven't shown her the new trailer.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I really need to get a reaction video.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
You know how people film reaction videos on YouTube to Two Girls One Cup?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I need to get a reaction video to my mother watching the new Mortal Kombat trailer.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And especially the announcement for Raiden is going to be in the game.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Classic Mortal Kombat character.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
How could they do that?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Has Raiden ever not been in a Mortal Kombat game?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
He wasn't in IV, was he?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It would be so weird to have a Mortal Kombat game without Raiden.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
So of course he is in the game.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Of course the Thunder.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Or Christopher Lambert, if you remember the movie.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So that is that.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Now also interesting about Mortal Kombat X.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And yes that's X not X. That's how they're marketing it.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Mortal Kombat X is going to have at least one guest character from an outside franchise because Freddy Krueger did so well.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
They're not confirming that Freddy Krueger will be said character.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
But they're going to add some type of guest character into the game.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Which of course begs the question.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Who do you think that character should be?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Did you know we actually did a list list on this a long time ago?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
What character should be in Mortal Kombat as a franchise character?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
We did this some time ago.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Who won? I can't remember.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I'm actually pulling it up right now because Dark Tetsuya compiled it.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I do remember on the list was the Bride from Kill Bill.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Was one of the characters.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Which is still an answer I really like.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
That's for sure.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I believe the winner was Ash from Evil Dead.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Which actually seems plausible.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Why not? Why not?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I guess getting the Bruce Campbell likeness would be the trickiest part unless they did like a...

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
The chin.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah I don't know.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I would think...

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
He'd probably do it.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I would think Jason and Michael Myers.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I mean if Freddy Krueger is going to be in it.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Jason seems like a really logical step.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I know they do like...

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Because there's also Jason X right?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Or Friday the 13th X with Jason in space.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I mean come on.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Anyway.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Number 3 by the way.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
So in that list list.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Number 1 was Ash from Evil Dead.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Number 2 was the Bride from Kill Bill.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Number 3 was Mr. Rogers.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I don't know how that happened but it's really funny.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
So that was from an old list list we did some time ago.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Awesome.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
That's so like insensitive now.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You know what?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Just the Mortal Kombat people should just license the engine and do nothing but horror

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
film bad guys the fighting game.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
You know they do have that.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Why not?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
There's a fan made game that's like that.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And Ash is actually in that.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I just don't remember what it's called.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Alright.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
But like they should also have like the people who like the sole survivor out of horror flicks.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Like Alice from the two Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Sydney from Scream and Gale Weathers.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And the psychic kid from Friday the 13th.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Was it 3 or 4?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Yes.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
The title of the game.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Wasn't that Corey Feldman?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
How about as a playable character in Mortal Kombat X, Carrie's mom.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
She could use like psychic powers.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
You can see your dirty pillows.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
When she does a fatality on Sonya she can be like, I can see your dirty pillows.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
They're all gonna laugh at you.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And smothers her with a pillow.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I like that.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
That wasn't even on the original list list.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Can we go back and amend it with Carrie's mom?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Part B, Rob.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Part B.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Part B. List list the sequel.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Have we ever done that?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
No.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Let's make that a thing.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
An unprecedented moment in all our history.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Was it the aunt or whatever from Sleep Boy Camp?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
How about, what was, oh my God, Angela.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
How about just straight up Angela from Sleep Boy Camp?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Anyway, did you know, I'm sorry, I have to just do a tangent while we're talking about bad horror movies.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Because if my buddy Rene from Killer Queens from Outer Space is out there listening, he'll appreciate this.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And I learned this on the show I was on.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Did you know that the little boy who played Angela's brother who dies in the opening moments of Sleep Boy Camp,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and I won't spoil anything, the little kid who plays her brother is actually the situation's brother.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
No fucking joke.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Like the situation from Jersey Shore, that's his brother in that movie, Sleep Boy Camp.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Only douchebags call themselves the situation.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I learned that when I guessed it on that show.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And I was like, get the hell out of here.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
What a small world.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Anyways, the game I was telling you about-

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
You've never seen Sleep Boy Camp, right?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Is, uh, was it-

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Okay, mandatory this has to happen.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
We have to watch Sleep Boy Camp.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Well, I also didn't see Mean Girls, so-

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Oh my God, Jamie, you're killing me.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Alright.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Yeah, even though I know lines from the movie, go thig.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
You can't sit here!

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You just can't ask people why they're white.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You know enough about Mean Girls, you just need to watch the damn movie.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Yeah, I know.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Terrordrome, the game Rise of the Boogeyman is actually the horror game, fighting game that's actually free to play.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.000
If you want to check it out, it's free to download at www.terrordrome-thegame.com.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Ooh, I like the suggestion from Fifth Dream in chat.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
American McGee's Alice in Mortal Kombat.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Well, might be too young, though. I don't want to see all that yucky violence on kids.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Is Alice an adult?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Yes.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Well, then I guess maybe it will work, but I don't know, it's a little weird.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Little weird.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
In theory, it sounds good, but I don't know.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
What about, like, um, wasn't...

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I think Lollipop Chainsaw was, um, Warner.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Oh!

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
That game was almost embarrassingly bad and hilarious.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
We keep thinking movies, but maybe another character from another big gaming franchise.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Because they were trying to get something exclusive to...

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Because Kratos was in Mortal Kombat 8, or whatever it was, on PlayStation,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
there was talk that they were trying to get a similar character.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Everybody assumed he was Master Chief.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
But something like that on Xbox, it never happened.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It needs to be Coco Tapioca from Space Channel 5 Part 2.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
No.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
What?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
If they really want to go crazy, you know, maybe a little bit bonkers, or conquerors...

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Stop. Stop right there. I'm not even going to let you finish that.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
We're going to move on. More news. Dark Saga.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Okay, well, we've heard of it happening before, where the news will just say,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Oh, look! We'll use whatever picture this is to describe whatever,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
and no one can get on us because we have money.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Ha ha ha ha. Copyright, blah blah.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Except that, um, they really kind of fucked up here.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.000
So, basically, it was, um, a news station that was doing a discussion about, um,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
children, you know, being used as soldiers.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And, um, and this was on ITV, um, uh, well, actually, one of them,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000
the first time it happened was, um, on ITV, where, uh, they used clips from Arma 2.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Well, now we have another, uh, company that's, uh,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and I believe it's Fox and Friends, that, you know, had their Bioshock Infinite logo thing.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Now we have, uh, screen caps from Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
to talk about child warriors.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
And this was, uh, on, uh, news channel Russia Today.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah, I saw the clip. It was really awkward kind of seeing that.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It's like, you know, stock footage amongst all this other, you know,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
which is, which is really the horrific topic, if you think about it.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
To, to see this just really made the whole thing even more awkward.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
This is stupid.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Yeah, I mean, do your research interns.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Either that or, you know, wouldn't it be funny if, like,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
there were stealth interns placed to get major companies in trouble by exposing?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Don't you feel like, though, how this happens is that some intern just went to Google image search

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
and put child soldier and thought that picture and didn't even, like, fact check it

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
or do a backwards image search to see where it came from or any of that stuff?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Exactly that. I mean, the big thing is that, and I've learned this, my teachers taught me well.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
If you are going to find an image, there are certain things that you're going to have to put in your search

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.000
when you're looking for it, including stock image, royalty free, or public domain, you know.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
If you're trying to use something you're not going to have to freaking pay for.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Then again, I've seen quite a bit of, and I'm not going to say that it's Russian media in particular,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.000
but I've seen it mostly out of Russian media where it's like, well, like my friend in Australia,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:09.000
her Homestuck fan art being used on the cover of a Russian publication about a story about the American justice system

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
and it's a troll holding, you know, it's Terezi.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That's one thing, but specifically the news. I think the news is exempt from some of that stuff because it's the news.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:26.000
This is supposed to be an unused publication, you know, and then we're seeing it,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:35.000
but it's just really more or less a matter of either lazy searching or disregard for copyright or a combination of all of the above.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming out soon

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
in a game store near you that perhaps will have artwork that will soon be on the local news. Loki.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000
This might be on the local news just because it was, you know, a popular game a long time ago.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Well, it's still pretty popular, I guess, but for the Wii U, the disc version of Wii Sports Club will be coming out on Friday on the Wii U.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And that's literally it.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That's it?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
That's it. That's it.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Alright, I guess this is a slow week.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Let's see, going to Japan and checking out some of the releases over there.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I don't see anything on the PlayStation 4 this week. I'm wondering if it's a slow week over there, too.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.000
On the PlayStation 3, Dead Island and Sengoku Basara 4 are getting, like, remastered.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
They're not new, they're just re-price reductions, re-bundlings of the game, essentially.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
There is another new game, though, called Under Night in Birth Exe Late, which is an Arc System Works game that's out on PlayStation 3.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You can also check out a Monster Hunter Frontier G5 premium package, also out on PlayStation 3 this week.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
So lots of redos in Japan this week.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Same thing on the Xbox 360, that same Monster Hunter Frontier package is on the 360 as well.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
A 10,000 point Xbox gift card, branded for Monster Hunter.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
10,000 points? And they still have point cards?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I guess.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I guess maybe in Japan they do. There must be some type of difference going on there.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
On the Wii U, that same Monster Hunter Frontier package is out as well.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
That might explain the slow release dates in Japan this week, because you know it's Monster Hunter.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But hey, on the Vita, things are a little more hopping with Corpse Party Blood Drive, and Re-Vice-D comes out there as well.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And Tokyo Shin Seiroku Operation Abyss is out on the PlayStation Vita as well.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
That's your Japanese release dates? Oh, wait, 3DS. Sorry.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
3DS Yoshi's New Island is out in Japan this week. That's a pretty big one.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Dark Sakura?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Jack shit?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
In the UK?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Yep, nothing.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Alright, matches what's going on over here. I guess it's that part of summer where you need to catch up on your Steam backlog.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
It's when they say, go outside.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Or that.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Play.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Or that.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, which you could also play this week if you wanted. Loki.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Alright. Let's see.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:10.000
There's always these Kickstarter stories about how things kind of go awry, and a game that's promised never comes out.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Well, this one is kind of the case. This was a game based off of the web series Yoggcast, or I think it starts actually a podcast.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
But Yoggcast's Yoggventure game.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I believe, and I know this is going to take people by surprise, I'm not super familiar with that group, but I believe they're big on YouTube.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Well yeah, I know they do Minecraft videos and stuff like that, but I know it's a YouTube channel, but I thought they had a podcast too, but whatever.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:49.000
But anyways, Yoggventures. They actually Kickstarted this. It had made, or went way above what they had originally asked for.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I want to say that they were originally asking for $250,000 and ended up with $560,000 in pledges.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:05.000
However, now development has ceased on the game. Apparently, they just ran out of money.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And, you know, it's kind of surprising. They're basically saying that they worked on the game, it was an amazing experience, blah blah blah.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:27.000
They really wanted to achieve some lofty goals set out, but they didn't have enough experience in planning and management and that kind of thing.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And I guess he had put some of his own money into it and just couldn't quite get the game finished.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
And so, because of that, I think they're giving people copies of a game called TUG instead.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:53.000
But, you know, there's a little bit, some more details on that, talking about the mismanagement and stuff and just kind of maybe inexperience.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:08.000
For example, there was an artist they had paid to do some in-game artwork for them and I guess they paid him, or paid them $35,000 for two weeks of work that produced, or two weeks that produced no work.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Apparently, the artist signed the contract, got the $35,000 payment, put two weeks worth of time in, and then accepted full-time employment with LucasArts.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:28.000
But because of the way the contract was poorly written, he had no obligation to do anything, so he got the money and just kind of left.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So, and just like there's a lot of drama with just, you know, being uncomfortable with how it was being managed and stuff like that.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000
It just goes to show you, but like, I remember one of the comments, you know, when he's, they're explaining to...

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Sorry, I'm laughing because Rama in chat says, Rama brings in the ball pit.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Sorry.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
That's a good zinger, Rama. I like that. Sorry. I don't mean to kick this while it's down.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:02.000
You guys know I've had my own concerns about Kickstarter and obviously this news story exacerbates a lot of those issues.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:11.000
However, I mean, for the people that backed this and supported it, especially coming from, you know, a production that is indie like we are and has really kind of worked from the ground up.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000
It is, it's not an easy thing to see. I think it's just one of those, it's a caution for everybody.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Well, I think also it was, it was, when they...

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
It needed an adult, I hate to say it.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
It really sounds like a lot of the way contracts were written and this guy could get no money.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000
They even broke it down though, like, and they spent money on legal, you know, legal fees and stuff.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Why didn't they have someone write up a good contract?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I mean, you would think that you would write up a contract that doesn't have a fucking out where I could just take the money, come up with nothing and then fucking leave.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Damn, I want to sign one of those contracts.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
You know, I mean, it's just, it sounds ridiculous.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And also I haven't really, you know, not too familiar, I kind of looked at the Kickstarter thing.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000
They didn't really have any playable or I want to say that they didn't really have a lot of footage from the game right away.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I think they showed a little bit, not too, you know, they had some footage, but I think it was after the Kickstarter thing was done.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So it was all off of concept art and that's always really wary to me.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:21.000
If you don't have anything to show of your game and you're trying to sell your game, that just seems like a stretch.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And I mean, granted, yeah, it's probably based off good faith, you know, because it's a channel you might like and stuff.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:35.000
But I don't know, especially I'd be kind of leery, but I guess I wouldn't.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Once again, you know, I want to say this should sour everybody for, you know, any Kickstarter project because there's been plenty of projects that have gone through Kickstarter and been just fine.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I mean, look at the John's sister's twisted dreams. Look at, you know, Shovel Knight.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:58.000
There's Among the Sleep and, you know, a lot of other successful campaigns that you don't really hear a lot about because there's no drama in there.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
No one wants to report on like, oh, this campaign was successful. The game came out OK.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Yay. Hoping Kickstarter is, you know, come back.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It's just, I don't know, everyone seems to focus on the negative.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But yes, there are a lot of projects out there. You just have to really be careful with what you're you're backing.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:23.000
And remember that, you know, if you're backing like 15 bucks, you're probably not going to be able to have any sort of recourse if they don't come back and do anything.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Because obviously, if you want to file legal fees and stuff, it'd be more than your fifteen dollars.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
So it's not worth it. Just be careful, I guess. And do your research.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And also only back projects, I would say that actually show something, you know.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Going to a chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, sadly, it's not the only project to suffer this kind of problem.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Too many high level goals, not enough experience and planning to ground it in reality.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Some guy recently wanted to make a Naruto MMO without actually having the license, experience or technical planning.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Just a page of text professing his awe at starting something like it.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Shadowrun returns divinity, Original Sin, Wasteland 2, etc.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah, some good points.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And as Joe and Hunter Matt says, this is what happens when you use Kickstarter to avoid going through a publisher or someone who could oversee your project to make sure stuff gets done.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Same person can deal with all the legal stuff. Some people can pull it off, others can't.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000
But, I mean, that's not saying that you can't go through Kickstarter and do all that stuff.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.000
You can just, you know, the problem with inner experience is you don't know how much money you're going to need for, like, legal and stuff.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And that's kind of the problem I think they ran into is, like, they tried to cut corners, I want to say, with how much they spent on that.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And if you spend a lot of money on legal, you can actually get somebody, like, for example, on Reddit a lot, there's the video game lawyer.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
They have services where he'll write up contracts for you and do that kind of thing.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And he has experience with indie game developers.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000
You know, it's not that expensive and you just have to know what, you're going to have to spend some of your own money on that stuff.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And even just starting your own company, you're going to have to spend some money, you know, trademarking your product and all that stuff.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So it just, you have to know that you're doing that and you also have to be smart about it because, yeah, I mean, there's, you know, you could get sued by somebody else for, you know,

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
if you're, you know, copyright infringement or if it's too close to some other thing, like in the Naruto case.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
You can't fucking kickstart something you don't have the rights to.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I mean, maybe they're naive and think that.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Like, for example, there was one I saw that was a really shitty looking game, but they called it, was it Grand Theft Pizza delivery or something like that.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I'm like, that's going to fucking get sued if it didn't look like complete shit.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I'm sure that they don't give a shit about it. But, you know, the fact that it, they raised like a few thousand dollars for a really shitty game.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000
But the name Grand Theft, whatever, and it looks like a Grand Theft Auto type, you know, over a head game, except just drawn at them as paint.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
But still, it's, you know, you got to be careful.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, just stick to potato salad.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Don't get me started on that. Do not get me started on that.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000
That's one of those things where everyone thinks that they're, you know, oh, I'm going to back money this because that's silly.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
He, you know, the only one that's laughing is the person.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
You're the problem.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Fifty thousand dollars.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
You're the problem.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Right. Moving on. You spend your money on what you want, but I'm just saying.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000
All right. Moving on to one more story here about money.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Would you be surprised if I told you that some of your favorite YouTubers are getting paid to cover games by publishers?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Publishers are paying them to cover certain games.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Well, if you're shocked to hear that news, welcome to the internet. Enjoy your stay.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Gamasutra actually did a survey of YouTubers and Let's Players with over five thousand subscribers.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And according to the numbers, twenty-one percent of them participated in Paola.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Five percent of them, when a dev offers money, sixty-nine percent saying no.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
The other five percent prefers not to say, so you can assume that that's a yes.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Very, very interesting.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Do you believe that this stuff should be disclosed whenever it happens?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
What do you guys think about this?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I mean, is this news like, oh my God, this needs to stop?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Or is this like, oh, I'm surprised there's not more of them?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Pay me.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Pay me.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Well, we kind of knew that this kind of stuff was going on.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Because remember a while back, that whole thing leaked out back when the Xbox One was launching.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And there was like, oh, these incentive programs.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:33.000
If you're on certain networks and stuff that you would get, you know, more ad revenue if you covered a certain game during a certain time period and that kind of thing.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
So I'm not surprised that this is happening.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I do think that they should disclose it because I think if you're not disclosing that it's like an advertisement or, you know, an advertorial, I guess they call it.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
That it's kind of disingenuous.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I don't know. I just I think that they need to disclose that kind of stuff.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Because, I mean, really, I wouldn't think any I wouldn't think poorly of somebody that does that as long as they're disclosing it.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Because let's be honest, you're not making a ton of money on a lot of people aren't making a ton of money on YouTube.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And if you're going to do that as a full time thing, then you need to be open to any opportunities that may come your way.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Not necessarily, you know, you know, hurting your own, I guess, honesty, but just, you know, taking an opportunity to say, hey, you know what?

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
You know, it's like Deep Silver or whatever paid us to show off some footage of Saints Row.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
So here's some, you know, check it out or I don't know.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I think you'd want to be a little clever in how you say that. You just want to say, hey, I got paid, y'all. I got paid to do this.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:58.000
You know, maybe Deep Silver, who has sponsored some brand new microphones and soundboards for our show, has asked us to talk about this particular game.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
You know, that might be another way to do it. I don't know.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Maybe that just kind of look at it going, how would I do it? Because I would think any money, you know, I'm not just going to take it to the bank because I've never made, I don't, if you, if y'all think we make money off of OLR or VoG network, you're high because we don't.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:22.000
But if we did, if somebody wanted to pay us to cover a certain thing, I think I would feel like, okay, it's not going to be a lot of money.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.000
It's probably something that would just get put right back into the show. So it would also buy us new webcam.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:39.000
It'd also have to depend on what it is because I remember like back in the day, you know, even with like some of the all game stuff, you know, we had opportunities to, you know, look at like certain accessories and stuff.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And it was just kind of like, nah.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I think it happened one time.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Yeah, one time, whatever. But, you know, I was like kind of like, nah, we're not going to do that.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
All right. Anyhow, let's, let's go to a time when things were simpler.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Things were a lot simpler and you didn't have to worry about it.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
People couldn't even stream this game online. You know that? But they do now. I think they do.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
It is the classic game of the week.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Although many of you have probably already played this game.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
But if you haven't played this game, then play it again.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Play it for the first time.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Do it. Do the thing.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Do the thing. Here it is, your classic game of the week.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Final Fantasy.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.000
So, yes, I picked Final Fantasy, which I've done a bunch of other Final Fantasy games, but I have not yet done Final Fantasy.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:41.000
So it is a role playing game that was created by Sakaguchi Hironobu, done by Square, which is now, of course, Squeenix.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
It came out in 1987 and, of course, it was the first.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:53.000
It came out on the Famicom slash Nintendo Entertainment System and has been remade for other consoles since then.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
More recently, it was packaged with Final Fantasy II, the original II, and not Final Fantasy IV.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Basically, you play as the Light Warriors, who each have an elemental orb that have been darkened by various Fiends.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And so you have to go defeat the evil forces, restore lights of the orbs, and save the world.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It is one of the early games to do random battle encounters for experience.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:32.000
At least do it in, I would probably say, a way that's become an accepted method of doing it.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:39.000
It's turned into a norm because it really set a precedent for how encounters are going to work in a game.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
So basically, it's an overworld map, a town and dungeon map, a battle screen, and a menu screen.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:53.000
The overworld is, of course, scaled down so you can walk all over it, your little guy being the avatar that you're following through.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And you get, of course, different classes. You start off with a fighter, thief, black belt, red mage, white mage, and black mage.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Of course, we know the way they look because we know them very well. We also probably have all read 8-bit theater.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And then you get class upgrades, so you can go up to, of course, stronger character classes.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:29.000
You have some magical weapons and armor that when you use them in combat, they'll cast spells.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:38.000
You have artifacts for protection from spells. You can buy items. You can get tents and cabins to regenerate while you save.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Aethers are always fucking expensive. And you do different quests to gain special items.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:52.000
You do have your magic, white magic, which is your defensive inhaling, and black, which is destructive magic.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And red mages use a combination of the two. But you can only carry, the spells are actually classified by level 1-8 with 4 white and 4 black spells per level.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And you only learn 3 spells per level. And the other ones that can cast, besides the red mages, would be the ninja and the knight. Of course, depending on their class.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:27.000
So, basically, the game was... Sakaguchi wanted to make the game for a long time, but Square refused.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And then when Dragon Quest came out and became such a hit, they're like, okay, here, make a game! Get us Dragon Quest money.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So, basically, it was done by a group that Square called the A-Team, which was Koichi Ishii Akitoshi Kawazu.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And, of course, he was the one responsible for the battle systems and the sequences that he based off of D&D.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And the game Wizardry. Do you remember Wizardry?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Oh god, yes. That's old school.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
But the basic heart of it was, it's an RPG that begins when you create the character.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So, it really is strong for the storyline. Of course, we have Uematsu doing the music.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And they got an Iranian-American programmer named Nasir Gebelli to code the game.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:40.000
And so, as far as the graphics, they were designed by Shibuya Kazuko, and then also Ito Hiryoku as the debugger.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:50.000
So, basically, it just started with, they had the development ROM, they took it to the Famicom magazine,

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
and they wouldn't review it, but Famitsu did it and gave it exclusive coverage.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
And they originally were only going to make 200,000 copies to ship.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.000
And he begged them to do 400,000, which they agreed to.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And once it was localized in North America, it really, really took on.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000
There is no version of the game that was marketed for the PAL region until Final Fantasy Origins in 2003.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Oh wow, I didn't realize that.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So, in 1987 and 1990, there was the original Final Fantasy.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:35.000
In 1989, they did an MSX2 version that had some graphic upgrades, expanded music and sound effects, and it had loading times.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.000
There's the Final Fantasy I-II version that was in 1994 for the Famicom.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Final Fantasy came out in 2000 for Wonderswan Color, which is the one I have.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
That was actually what led me to get my first Wonderswan, was that version.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:58.000
There was Final Fantasy I and II, Dawn of Souls, which was for Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Origins for PlayStation,

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Final Fantasy for Mobile Phone, which was better than the 8-bit version, but less advanced than more recent versions.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
There was the PSP, sorry, PSP version.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.000
There was the full motion video sequences, remixed soundtrack, extra dungeons, script from Dawn of Souls,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
virtual console release, which was the NES version.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:24.000
There was an iOS version based off the PSP version, one for Windows Phone, and one for Android.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:31.000
That last one, the Android one, was based off the PSP version, but did not have the bonus dungeons.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And the very first re-release was the one done for the MSX2 that was published by Microcabin in Japan in June 1989.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Switching to some of the music from one of the remakes since you're talking about them.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:54.000
But it also had almost three times as much storage space as the Famicom, but the big problem it had, loading time.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
But it did look and sound a lot better.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So, and of course we've got, like I said, all those other various versions that were released for various different reasons.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.000
So if you haven't played it, why the hell not? And go ahead and get it.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000
There are also, keep in mind, nods to the original ones we had.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000
The soundtrack was released with the score for Final Fantasy II in 1989.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:30.000
And there was a track that became the big one that has been in every Final Fantasy game ever called the Prelude, which you played right at the start.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And I mean, even in Final Fantasy XIV, the game starts off with that.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.000
So, of course there have been other adaptations.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:45.000
There was, in Captain N, the Game Master, there was the Fractured Fantasy of Captain N.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Of course we had 8-bit theater, like I mentioned before.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And don't forget the Dead Ale Wives parody that they would play on Dr. Demento has been done in 8-bit theater style as well.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I said I wanted blue eyes, but I decided gray. Okay, whatever. Cast Magic Missile.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
So basically, that's it for Final Fantasy.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000
There's a whole lot more we could go into on this one, but I'd say at this point, look for it yourselves.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
If you haven't already played it at this point, my gosh.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000
The remakes are out there everywhere on the mobile phone and everything. You can find this somewhere. For sure.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
So yeah, check that out.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week. Final Fantasy, as in the original Final Fantasy.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Again, one of those games when she says it's the game of the week, I go,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
you mean it hasn't been the game of the week before? In the past 250 plus times we've done this segment.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
It's never been the classic game. Nope, it hasn't. So there it is.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
A classic classic game without which we wouldn't have had a lot of games.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Well, and honestly, it's a really deep story for something that came out when I was a preteen.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I remember playing this on Nintendo Entertainment System, like staying up all night with my friend to play Final Fantasy.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
You know what's funny though? I never beat it. We got all the way to Tiamat and couldn't beat him.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Dan and I were doing a playthrough together and we actually had the airship and then decided we got bored.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Bored now.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, history.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Alright, let's take a break. We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come here on this week back after a week off.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
We have your food question of the week. We're going to talk about more playroom news.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:43.000
There's things coming to that that sound exciting. Net neutrality talk and maybe some Power Rangers chat.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I wonder if Shane's going to run into the room when he hears that. We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live on this Sunday evening, July the 20th of 2014 with episode number 560 already in progress.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I hope you guys had a good week last week even though we weren't here. I know some of you guys rely on us to help you get through your Monday at work.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:22.000
But we're back and I hope you guys found another great indie show to maybe add to your rotation in the time we were away.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Because you know we always say here at Orange Lounge Radio, support independent podcasting. There's so many great shows out there, hardworking.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Obviously we're always going to pimp our pals at vognetwork.com. I always like to promote with the guys I was doing stuff with at GamerX like Koopa Club and Video Game Realness even though they weren't there.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.000
But in spirit they were Game Bar, Game Buoy.org and so on and so on. So many great shows.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:55.000
But even if none of those, none of the above appeals to you, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there hardworking doing shows for guys like you to discover.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:04.000
So go and seek them out, the independent podcast of the world. In the meantime we will resume with our independent podcast and some rapid fire news. Loki.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Yes, I'm kind of happy to see that there's actually one of the D3 games I like. Onichambara Z2 Chaos is coming to Japan.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Now if you may not be familiar with the Onichambara series, it's basically like a bikini samurai game.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.000
A very scantily clad woman with samurai swords and a cowboy hat fighting zombies.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It's been around since PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 4 version is going to feature 1080p and 60 frames per second.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Also I guess they're saying it's going to have new features like a cross-merge combination element, multi-character combo attacks and a quick time kill mode.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And I guess players will be able to trace lines on the DualShock 4 touchpad to deliver critical blows to enemies and stuff.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:07.000
It's supposed to be out in Japan in October. Hopefully that means it's also going to be out in North America, which is very likely.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And the fact that it's also region free, also a good hope.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And I'm very excited because if a game like this is on the PlayStation 4, then that means that eventually Earth Defense Force will be on PlayStation 4 as well.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Speaking of which, man, that is a game I need to go back and finish playing because I started that back in February and I just kind of gave up on it.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Some positive notes in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com. Brad from PodCulture says,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Boy, talk about a guilty pleasure game. Fifth Dream says, finally, on a system I have. I'm going to totally get this.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:48.000
I wish it would bring more of the simple series stuff over there like, we need an HD remake of Ambulance vs. Zombies.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Or they had one that was also with like little maids vs. zombies. They had a lot of things versus zombie games. I'd love to see that.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Alright, people love zombies it seems.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Yes. So, on top of that, there is a brand new rhythm game that's coming out on I believe IOS as well.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:23.000
It's a game called Alpha Beats. And what makes Alpha Beats a little different than your standard kind of tap to the music type game is it's also kind of mixing in like Scrabble in there.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000
So you have to tap on the letters to the beat and you create words with them and you score points that way.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
That sounds kind of fun.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Yeah, and apparently the game does have some pretty good music in it. It's only $1.99 so you can check that out on the IOS.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Are we talking licensed music when you say pretty good music or just originals?

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.000
It's like indie stuff. Like they've got a disaster piece. It's the composer that did Fez.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Oh, okay.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
They've got some music from...

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Kind of like the direction the new amplitude is going in a little bit.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And also if you want additional music they have in-app purchases for that. So you can get some additional music that way.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:17.000
And then last but not least, a really strange looking game that kind of reminded me a whole ton of Noby Noby Boy or seriously like something that you would see from like the developers of Katamari.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:25.000
But it's a game called Push Me, Pull You. And it's basically a two versus two local multiplayer game.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And it's coming out I guess sometime in 2014 on PC, Mac, and Linux.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:42.000
But it involves almost like, not like a human centipede, but like you know, I don't know if you remember the cartoon Catdog where you know you have a cat on one end and a dog on the other end.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Well it's two torsos of humans attached to...

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I remember that show. That's How Does It Take a Crap?

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Yes. It's two torsos that are kind of attached to each other in the middle.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:59.000
And it makes like those Noby Noby Boy type thing. And you have to move a ball around with that.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And so you're fighting against other, you know, other players that way. And so you kind of have to like, you know, ride around each other and get the ball around.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I don't know. It looks silly. And should be coming out later this year.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
But yeah, totally getting the Noby Noby vibe from that.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Very cool. How'd you check that out? Lots of neat sounding games there. Guilty pleasure to music puzzle to genres I like to okay whatever. I'll try it.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Alright, moving on. Let's talk Virtual Console for a minute. We haven't seen a lot a lot of activity on Wii U Virtual Console lately.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
And Sega was a big big supporter of Virtual Console. Like all the Sega classics out there and all sorts of forums.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:46.000
But apparently no current plans for Wii U Virtual Console games from Sega. And this was in response to a Twitter.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Now Sega did clarify these comments a little bit in a statement saying quote Sega would like to clarify a statement that was issued over Twitter.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:03.000
All options are currently on the table concerning development for the Wii U Virtual Console. Although there are no immediate plans, this does not negate the possibility and exploration of creating for this platform.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:11.000
So in other words, nothing now and nothing on the table for the near future but they're not pulling like an EA or something where they're like we're done with you, bye.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Sega loves the Wii U. I mean they have their own, the Sonic games are coming exclusive to the Wii U and 3DS.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:25.000
So I would think that they're in a pretty good, you know, standing. And I don't even think, they probably just maybe they're just not making a lot of money off of those.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And the fact that they'd be reissuing probably games that have been on there before that it's just almost not worth it to put the effort in.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:37.000
And let's be real, if you're trying to play a classic Sega game, there's an abundance of places available to play said games.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Including what the Sonic collection, Mega Sonic Genesis, I don't know.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Yeah, I want to say that they're probably making a ton of money off of that stuff on Steam because that's where it's at.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:58.000
You can get like 40 games for like 5 bucks. So Virtual Console is kind of hard to justify paying $6 a game when they're so readily available at other places.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:06.000
It really is, it really is. Maybe the portability of the 3DS. And the 3D remakes are something. That's, you know, a little different.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:16.000
But, yeah. Alright, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, a little bit of rabble rabble going on right now over the Club Nintendo Elite rewards which were unveiled this week.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:27.000
The North America rewards were unveiled and, you know, in years past they've given away like, you know, they'll send you things in the mail like calendars and sometimes even like little collectibles and really cool little things.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Well, this year, none of that. All the rewards are downloadable games.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:48.000
If you are Platinum, you can get, you can choose from Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Dylan's Rolling Western, Dr. Luigi, Earthbound, Fluidity Spin Cycle, Game & Wario, Mario & Donkey Kong Minis on the Move, and NES Remix.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Some of those games, by the way, are 3DS games, not just Wii U games in there.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:03.000
If you are a Gold status, you can get Donkey Kong 3, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Metroid, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Land 2, 6 Golden Coins, Wario Land 2, and Zelda 2 The Adventures of Link.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
So, some people not happy that they went all DLC.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
So you only get to pick one of those?

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Yeah, you get to pick one of those.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
That's like 5 bucks for the Gold set.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
For the Gold level, yeah.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
And so, some people not happy about that.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I understand why people are a little irritated because they went and did those surveys.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Because, you know, in the past, the rewards have been very lucrative, and I get that.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
But at the same time, reality check, you guys.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Nintendo hasn't exactly been bringing in the cash this year.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
So they have to make some cutbacks some places, and this is one of them.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000
You know, so at least there's something being given away here.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
And probably next year's going to be a lot better because they're going to have the Amiibo figures.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Yeah.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
So you'll see something like that.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yeah, perhaps.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
But, yeah, I just, you know, take it with a grain of salt, you guys.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Nintendo hasn't had the best year.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
This is where they had to make some cutbacks.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
They can't exactly afford to buy everybody these little minifigures and, you know, send them all to people's houses this year.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I'm a little, like, you know, I'm like, well, I'm Gold status on Club Nintendo.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
And I pretty much have every single one of those games that I wanted.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I guess I'm going to end up getting Donkey Kong 3 on 3DS because it's like the one thing I don't have.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
You know, so all right, I guess I'll get that.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
But I'm not, like, mad.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I'm a little bit like, oh, man, I was hoping for something a little better.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:28.000
But I also kind of think, like, I've gotten way more bang for my buck out of the whole 10% back on the Wii U when you buy the games digitally.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I've gotten way better perks from that than this.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
So you win some, you lose some.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I'm just still thinking about the statue we got from Club Nintendo.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Right.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And it was just a really nice, you know, Super Mario Brothers cast.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Well, that was when Nintendo was making buku bucks.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
They're not now.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
So this is what happens.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
You want the perks, buy more Nintendo.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Exactly.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Maybe, I mean, if Mario Kart 8 keeps selling, maybe there'll be more of that next year.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Who knows? Who knows?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
All right.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Let's see.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
One more story for you guys.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
This is a game that was actually unveiled at GamerX.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I believe I was at the panel where they talked about this game for the first time.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000
It is a game from Atari, of all folks, called Pride Fest.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Pride Fest is a game coming from Atari where you will be creating and launching your first gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender pride parade.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:27.000
The game will allow players to design and customize floats, solve challenges to unlock new festival and parade supplies,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.000
and each building has a fun capacity, and once it's filled, the building upgrades and draws even more city folk to the party.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
No further details at this time, no images or anything like that.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
But I need to know if they have t-shirt cannons, because that's really the most important thing.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Yeah.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
As long as I get to make my asexual float, I'm happy.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:53:01.000
I think it's, you know, on one hand, I'm kind of like, all right, this is just going to be another one of those dippy management, tiny tower-esque iPhone games, you know, whatever, whatever.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:10.000
But at the same time, it is really cool that Atari, which has a lot of history behind it, is doing a, like, pride game.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Let's just hope, and I'm glad that they're doing that, let's just hope that it's done tastefully as well.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Yeah, there's a lot of room for error with that in there.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Fifth Dream says gay pride tycoon, and then gay pride simulator 2015.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Yeah, and sometimes these pride events can be pretty commercial, so I'm curious to see how they pull it off. We'll see.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I'm trying not to be a cynic about it. I'm really not. I think it's really cool that Atari went to GamerX. I think it's really cool that they were kind of feeling out the con.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I think it's really cool that Atari has a game coming out.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
There's that too. And it's great. What are you laughing about?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
SSG100 Matt.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:53.000
SSG100 Matt in chat says, is there a Mama Tits expansion where you can beat down protesters?

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I love Mama Tits.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Oh my god. You know what's funny? A friend of mine I've known online for years. A friend of mine online dates back to Life Journal, is now a drag queen in Seattle, and like knows Mama Tits, and actually wrote the article about that that went viral.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So it was really funny to kind of watch it from his perspective on Facebook.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
That's cool.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Yeah, all these people are like seeing that video. So, anyway, um, yeah, that would actually be really awesome. You know, but the game that's not talked about in this story is that they also confirmed that RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis 2 is in the making for iPhone.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Work! Yes!

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And they go, woooo!

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Have you ever played, I'm sure, Loki, have you ever played RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
No, I have not.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I haven't either.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
It's, you know, it's one of those things where it's like you have to try it if you're a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Is that like the Kim Kardashian game?

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:52.000
No, it's a little better than that, but like, it's all these quotes, because RuPaul actually recorded dialogue, and they got like Pandora Box, a bunch of people to do dialogue.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:55:02.000
So it's like as you're running through it, you know, you hear a character, yes! Woo! You better work! Amen! You know, it's just like all the little catchphrases from the show.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
It's fun for five minutes, and then you're like, turn the volume down.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Okay, I have to ask, is Drag U still running?

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
No, Drag U was cancelled a year or two ago.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I'd never watched Drag Race, but I watched Drag U.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Yeah, RuPaul cancelled it. Well, he didn't cancel it, but confirmed it was cancelled a couple years ago.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.000
That was just such a cool show, because I know that's not what we're talking about.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:31.000
It's fine. You know what, if we want to have a Drag Race side conversation, we will. God damn it.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Just because I thought that it was good that it was, you know, sort of in the theme of the whole glamour of drag, but something that was for women who were feeling drab.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Yeah, it was great.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I thought that, because there's a lot that women can learn about just glamour and letting loose from drag queens.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.000
It was a very new version of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. You remember that show? It was very, you know...

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Love that show.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
But on top of that, it was...

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I don't know why I love that show.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Loki loved that show more than I did, like seriously.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Except the first, was it the pilot episode or the pilot season or whatever, what the fuck was going on there?

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Because the cast was like, eh.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
It was different.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Yeah, I didn't like different. I don't like different.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
You bought the soundtrack, even. I remember that.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I downloaded the soundtrack.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
No, Rob, I bought the soundtrack. At least three tracks out of it made it into my spin class that I was in.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
It had like, was it the...

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
It had Basement Jackson in it.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Oh god. Where's Basement Jackson? Have they released a new album?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
That's something you need to look into, because I fucking love Basement Jax.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
In the basement. At the Alamo.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
At any rate...

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I gotta look that up right now.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
It's not, you know, dressing up in things that someone would wear every day.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000
But it was a really, you know, just interesting, fun thing to do.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And I don't know if you've also heard of the women who dress quote in drag.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Who basically go from...

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Both queens.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yeah. But I think...

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Which is, and I mean no disrespect with this comment. Absolutely none.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.000
But when Victoria shows me all this burlesque stuff she's doing, I'm like, so that's basically being a drag queen.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
But like taking your clothes off.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Oh my god, there's so many albums I've missed!

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
What the hell?

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I didn't...

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Alright, anyway, anyway.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Yeah.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Alright, we can talk about...

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
So how about this, how about I start watching Drag Race next season?

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Fantastic, we should have a viewing party or something, it would be fun.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Alright, anyway, from drag queens to a very similar subject, Star Wars, right?

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Dark Saga?

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Oh yeah.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I mean...

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Because there were lots of queens in the Old Republic.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Did you see what Queen Amidala's wearing?

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Have you ever seen Travis doing his Queen Amidala?

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
With the bra on his head.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Yes.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Which actually is funny, I miss taking a picture of my cat with my bra on her head.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Because I just left it on the bed and next thing I know I see the cat's head peeking out from under the middle bit.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I'm like...

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000
And the first thing I thought is, my cat is Queen Amidala, thanks Travis.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
So anyway.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Star Wars The Old Republic generated 165 million last year.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
But guess what's still on top?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Wow.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Wow.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Wow.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
And I actually went and looked at the list and worldwide MMO titles in 2013.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Top was World of Warcraft, followed by Lineage.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:31.000
And then Terra Online, followed by Star Wars The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, which I played for a little bit.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
It was pretty.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Eve Online, Ion, Blade and Soul, Lineage 2, and Rift.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I'm kind of surprised that Terra's as high up on that list.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I guess it's bigger in Korea and stuff though, isn't it?

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Yeah, and this is a worldwide list.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Yeah, okay.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Well, yeah, Lineage wouldn't even be in the top 10 if it was just America.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I mean, no offense, Lineage is fine.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
It's just that that game has its huge following in Asia.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I still have my Lineage Coke can.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Oh, right.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Yeah, not a bad game.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Not shading the game, I'm just saying.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I'm still incredibly jealous that China has Call of Duty Online.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I would be very curious what would happen to that list if you threw the MOBAs into the mix.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Because, you know, something we're not talking a lot about tonight, but is very much going on, is like, you know, the International for Dota 2, and it's on frickin' ESPN3.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I've still not tried a MOBA at all.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
You really? Just try it for fun.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:33.000
The problem is, I think the easiest one to pick up and learn is Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm, but it's still in its super special secret club invite phase.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
So you have to, you know, get an invite in order to play it.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
But League of Legends has a decent tutorial.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Dota has a really good tutorial, too. I just think, or Dota 2.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I just think the problem with Dota 2 is that there's a lot more micromanagement in that game.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Like, when you look at the management in that game versus Heroes of the Storm, it's a lot.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And that doesn't make it bad, people. I'm not saying that makes Dota 2 bad.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I enjoyed my time with Dota 2.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
What about the DC one that they have? Don't they have, like, a DC or Marvel one or something?

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Oh, I'm sure everybody's going for that now.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
By the way, Alan's made quite a bit of commentary about Queer Eye.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Oh, please.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000
In the chat.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Oh, I'll read it here.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Yeah, you read it.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Okay, so fine. If the chatters want to talk about Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, I don't have a problem with that.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Alan Huckabee says,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy sucked after the third season because the guys they made over just got hotter and hotter and hotter.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.000
The dudes in Season 1 and Season 2 were real trolls, so the turnaround was incredibly impressive.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000
In later seasons, it was like, okay, this dude is not having trouble getting laid.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000
We're just giving him some hot bro 25k of new shit for his apartment and a haircut.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000
This isn't interesting anymore.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
True that.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.000
It kind of just jumped the shark at some point, especially when they started having the Queer Eye for the Straight Girl and all that.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
It wasn't the same thing.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:48.000
So, anyway, more news. We have Pinball FX2 coming out for Xbox One on July 31st.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
The circle is complete.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000
And it will include, basically, the entire Pinball FX2 library, or nearly all.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Including the Star Wars packs, the Marvel Pinball Tables, Plants vs. Zombies, and the original Zen Tables.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:13.000
And it is going to be, the tables will be 1080p, 60 frames per second, and they will range between $249 and $299 with packs at $999.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
So, and that's in American dollars.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:24.000
And then last, but not least, we have a game that's now called Game Journal Simulator.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Basically, you are playing as a journalist for a video game company.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:40.000
And so, basically, it's just, it's something more inspired by Goat Simulator and Rock Simulator 2014.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.000
A collaborative project between, I guess, Evangelho.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
So, are there two buttons in the simulator? One for copy and one for paste?

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
It's a fair question. He's laughing.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Oh, no, because you have to have the action menu button for find inappropriately copyrighted material to use as your source.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Repost, repost, repost, repost.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Let's make Podcast Simulator.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Podcast Simulator.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Clickbait headline, clickbait headline.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000
That's right.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
You won't believe the things that they're doing in this generation of gaming.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Here's ten reasons.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Let's talk all about Kickstarter, picture of giant breasts.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
You know, it's like, what?

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
I got to see this picture.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Oh, that's not even, doesn't have anything to do with it.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Alright, that was some rapid fire news.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Because every week on this show, we go to our Facebook community and we go to our Google Plus community.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
And when you put those words together, you get foogle.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:51.000
And because of my playlist reset during the show earlier, I don't have my music for this.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I kind of want a new theme song.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000
We have foogle-y, we have foogle-y, I don't know.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Oh, my God. Can somebody put that through auto-tune?

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
No, it wasn't out of tune, was it?

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
No, no, put it in auto-tune.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Alright, forget it. I found it.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
It's not here, foogle.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Alright, here it is, the foogle question of the week.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
As technology improves, the graphics in games gets more and more real.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
In fact, a news station used a screenshot from Metal Gear Solid 5 in a report on Child Soldiers.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
So we talked about this earlier in the show.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Womp, womp.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.000
When was a point from you in video game graphics history where you said,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000
wow, these graphics look so real.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Come on, we've all done it, right?

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Like, they can't get more real than they are now, right?

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
I could actually tell you an example.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
You've got to get away till the end.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Admit it, was it Mode 7, or was it the PlayStation 2 or even 3 era

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
for you to believe a Final Fantasy cut scene looked way too good?

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
What is it?

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
So let's go to some of the comments.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
We're going to start over on Facebook.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:08.000
From AZHP who said, when the PlayStation 2 was being revealed to E3

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.000
and they showed that it could render Final Fantasy VIII's ballroom scene in real time,

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I was blown away, I wanted the PlayStation 2 right then and there.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
And they never did do that, of course.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
That was like the PlayStation 3 and the Final Fantasy VII pages.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
It's just concept only.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
They like to do that a lot.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Robert K says, it wasn't until the Dreamcast and Shenmue that I was left absolutely gobsmacked.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
For the time, the realism was nothing short of astounding to me.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Characters that didn't look like you'd lose an eye if you bumped into them

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
in a true living lifelike world and a kitten.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Tech 2030 says, Grand Theft Auto 3 was the first game that blew me away with its graphics.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I was a Nintendo kid up until that point, but after playing it at a friend's house,

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
I went out and bought a PlayStation 2 for it.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000
SHJ100Matt says, I don't remember the specific game,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000
but I do remember family members being blown away at times.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
My father was blown away by Star Wars Shadows of the Empire on the N64,

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000
and my older brother thought I was watching a live NBA game

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
when he caught me playing NBA 2K1 on Dreamcast.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Rod L replies and says, I'm going to show my age now.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.000
The 1990 hit on Commodore 64, Creatures.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I love this answer, and I must be showing my age too.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:22.000
The art style was very much in the vein of the kids' TV show Trap Door,

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
but with a bloody-minded sense of humor.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
It was the quality of the animation that blew me away.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.000
I remember thinking, this is like watching a TV show.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
That's an awesome answer.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And Rod is over in the UK where the Commodore 64 was even bigger than it was here,

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
so I'm sure that's where that kind of comes from a little bit.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Because I don't remember that game over here,

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
but by 1990, we had a Nintendo in the house,

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000
and I wasn't playing as many games on Commodore 64 at that point.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I miss Commodore.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Sniff. All right.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I'll find you one.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Huh?

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I'll find you one.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
My parents have one to give me if it still works.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.000
It's in their garage.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Get it.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I know. I don't even know what to play on it.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
I don't have discs.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Where am I going to find five and a quarter floppies to put Commodore games on?

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I'll get back to you on that.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Okay. Good.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Renee, if you guys want to donate something to push the show forward,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
you want to say a nice thank you or something for the past few years,

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
get me a Commodore 64.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Not that I'm not above begging when it comes to a Commodore 64.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Don't they have those newer ones?

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Yeah, I really thought about getting one of those.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
They were kind of overpriced.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
They did an MSX too, so if somebody wants to.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
No, actually, if anyone wants to donate anything to the show,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
it'll be a Duo RX for Jamie.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Just send us classic games.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
That's it.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Send Jamie a Duo RX.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
And some chicken.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
And some chicken.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
All right.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Renee replies and says,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
It took me a little while to think of when exactly this happened,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.000
but I pinpointed to when Virtua Fighter came out in the arcades

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
and then onto the Sega Saturn.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.000
That game and that console really opened my eyes

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
and made me realize that this was what was to come in the future of video games.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Alan Alchemy says,

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Here are my biggest three.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
The Mode 7 used in the opening minutes of Secret of Mana.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
The pre-rendered opening cinematics of Resident Evil 2.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Ooh, that's a good one.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:09.000
And the graphics of the launch title Soul Calibur HD remake for the Dreamcast.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Joe G says,

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I'd have to say the opening cut scene from Final Fantasy VII.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
It was so gorgeous.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
I'd say Final Fantasy X, but I played.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Oh, sorry.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
It was XII, not VII.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Sorry, guys.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000
And that was Haseo Sumeruogawa who said that.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Final Fantasy XII.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
I misread.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I just saw the II.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000
But, yeah, the opening scene to XII was pretty kick butt.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Pretty kick butt.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
All right.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Let's go over to our Google Plus page

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
because I know we got a couple answers over there.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I don't want to make sure we read those too.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Let's see.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I think there's just a couple.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Three.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Act Def says,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I think it was during the PlayStation 2, Xbox GameCube generations

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
that actually got me to say this almost looks real.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Granted, in comparison to what we have now, they kind of suck.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
But it was pretty cool to see some realistic graphics back in the day

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000
and just be amazed at how much video games have improved in that sense.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Ronnie B says,

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
When I played Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
That's a really good answer.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Redertainment says,

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I was playing NBA 2K13 and my mom saw me playing it,

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
thinking it was an actual live game.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
My mom asked me why I was watching a basketball game from earlier in the year.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.000
I simply told her that it was a video game and not a real one.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I've never had a problem telling the difference between video games and reality

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
because reality bites.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
There you go.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Thank you for those answers from our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Dark Soccer, I know you were waiting to answer this yourself.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
When did video games, when did it get too real?

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000
It wasn't necessarily a thing for me.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Just because, I mean, if you put a CG thing next to you,

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I can almost always pick it out.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
But then again, I know things to look for.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I can't turn that off.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000
My boss, when I worked at Aladdin's Castle, his name was Anthony.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I would love to find him again.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
He was a great guy.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
But we had Tekken 3 there.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
And this was before any other place had Tekken 3.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
They were only at Namco Arcades.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.000
And he was looking at the intro to Tekken 3 and he's like,

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
he's like, I promise you 10 years from now,

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
no one's going to be able to tell the difference.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And it was just like,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
and in that case, yeah,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
there were some games you really could not tell the difference.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Yeah.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
So, and I think my response was,

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
no, they're always going to be too pretty to be real.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Strangely accurate.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.000
That was during my Jinx obsession,

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
because I was vaguely obsessed with Jinx Kazama.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Loki, do you have an answer for this?

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
There's never really been a thing where I've said,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
oh, this is going to be like the best it's ever going to be,

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000
but the graphics and graphics of the five are pretty damn impressive.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Yeah.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Even just the current gen, or last gen stuff, I guess, is pretty nice.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I mean, as a game, I guess you got to get it on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Whatever, right?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Add that to the list.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
But yeah, I mean, I think that's really impressive.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I want to say there was probably a time like PlayStation 2 or something,

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.000
probably one of the intro videos or something that looked really good.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I don't know.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
I remember being really impressed with Twisted Metal Black

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
when that first came out, and that's even pretty basic.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I really wish they'd do another.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
I know they did Twisted Metal, but that was all fucked up.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I really wish they'd do more of a Twisted Metal Black type game.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
It'd be amazing.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
All right.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000
I would say my answer would be, honestly,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I would go way back to the Nintendo Entertainment System

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000
and a game that, when it came out, I was like, this is like a cartoon.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I'm playing a cartoon, and it looks just like a TV cartoon.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Mega Man 2 was the game, and I was like, the graphics are so freaking good.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
It's like I'm playing a cartoon.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
It really is.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:51.000
And then probably, honestly, I remember playing on the Super Nintendo Pilot Wings

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
and just being blown away by the Mode 7 stuff.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Like, how cool was that the first time you saw that?

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
I mean, you go back at it and look at it now, and you're like,

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
God, it's so pixely and blocky.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
But at the time, being a kid, especially,

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
and taking that big step up from the Nintendo Entertainment System

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
just blew my mind.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
The Rocket Belt stuff was so much fun.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
I remember, like, arcade game-wise, I mean,

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I used to love some of the driving cabinets and stuff,

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:19.000
but one of the most fun driving cabinets I had would probably have been

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
the F-Zero GX cabinet.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Oh, yes.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
That was just awesome.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
It's awesome.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
It's really just kind of the sense of speed,

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
especially when you get those fancy cabinets that tilt and everything.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Oh, that was awesome.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Good times. Good times.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
All right, great answers.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Thanks, you guys, for another successful FUGO Question of the Week.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Let's get back onto some other gaming news.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
We'll run through this pretty quick because I know we have a few emails

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
because we weren't here last week.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
We've got to catch up on some emails.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000
So, Loki.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
So this is kind of neat.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Sony kind of picking up the, hey, you know what?

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
People are actually using Playroom to do things other than just play Playroom.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.000
They're actually doing shows and all sorts of stuff.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Of course, not necessarily bringing light to the porn stuff,

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
but, yeah, they're doing shows.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
So guess what?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
There's going to be a brand new update that's coming called Set Maker,

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.000
and it adds a bunch of new functionality to it to aid in production of hosted shows.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.000
You can use a tablet as a production suite.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
You'd be able to add all sorts of different virtual objects and effects,

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
studio lights, digital banners.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
This is really cool.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
They can even interact with Twitch and put polls up where they can,

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
you know, who's your favorite character?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000
And they list some stuff, and you're able to vote in real time on there

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
and that kind of thing.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000
So really cool stuff.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
I'm glad to see they're kind of embracing what people are doing in game room,

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
and maybe we'll actually see some more shows out of this.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
It'd be pretty cool.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Yeah, you know, I'm all for indie broadcasting,

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
and I think it's really cool.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Do you think this is something we should – I'm going to pose this to the chatters.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I know that Dark Soccer is not interested in doing video,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000
and she doesn't have to because, you know, even when we were doing the Justin TV thing,

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
we found a way around it.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
But is video something you guys are seriously interested in?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Because if so, we have a space for it.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I can plop a PlayStation 4 over there.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000
We can maneuver Jamie so that maybe just her shoes are on camera or something

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
and do the show that way again.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I'll make sure to wear funny socks.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I think you should do that.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
I'll be Nanny.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Yes, you're like Nanny from Muppet Babies.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I'll speak with a trombone or I'll wear a mask.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Although I just want to say I think you're a very pretty gal,

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000
and you should have nothing to worry about with a camera.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I respect that it is your right to choose who you'd like to do it or not.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I don't want it to steal my soul.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000
But yeah, maybe that's something we're going to have to look into.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
I don't know. Would you guys be interested in that?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Rob, I'm like Daft Punk.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Huh?

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I'm like Daft Punk.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Are you?

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I'll have an Android outfit for –

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I would have to see how it affects, stream wise,

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:58.000
if you can stream that to Twitch and it might be hard watching the chat room for Twitch.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
I don't know how it even displays on TV as far as showing what's on there.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000
I don't know if it's –

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000
That's a very good point, especially on nights when we have a lot of people here

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000
and we have guests, especially when Jason's here as well,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
and then we have another guest on top of that.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Everybody's got their computers.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
We've got to be very careful with the bandwidth.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.000
That's a very good point and something we have to take into consideration is that audio gets priority.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
The show is called Orange Lawns Radio and that is always going to be the priority.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I never got the thrill of watching it because I kind of –

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000
but at the same time, I realize some of our listeners want to see that

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000
and we do have these things that happen occasionally where it's like it is a visual reference.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Like something falls over or something funny happens or I'm saying look at that

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
and it just inevitably happens even though it's a radio show.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
So I can respect that.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
But I love the idea, so we'll see. We will see.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000
All right. Yeah, sg100matt says, I don't see why not.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Sounds like something that could be cool, but I would block the chat room on there.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Too much venom.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Oh, I would too.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I wouldn't even have it on the screen and I would have some type of sign that said to join chat,

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
go to live that – or we could actually moderate it.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000
And then if you don't even pay attention to the comments in there, it won't even be an issue

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
because yeah, I'm not going to have people trolling for the sake of trolling.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Anybody who has something intelligent to say is intelligent enough to go to another website to do it, right?

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000
There you go.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:25.000
All right, let's talk about Super Smash Brothers Wii U, which is – is that its real name?

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
That's the name they're going to release it as?

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.000
It's actually – the box art says Super Smash Brothers for Wii U.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
That's so weird that –

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
It's so stupid is what it is.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I'm not a fan of the name. I'm really not. I mean, I understand –

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Yeah, the other one's Super Smash Brothers for 3DS.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I don't like that. I don't know what they were thinking with that, but whatever. So it is what it is.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
It's worth their thinking that we don't want to come up with a name.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
This is the company that thought Wii was a good name?

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:53.000
But it ended up working. But anyway, anyway.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.000
So apparently there is a rumor out there, thanks to a GameStop manager, so to tell you with a big grain of salt,

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:06.000
that every copy of Smash Brothers that comes out for the Wii U is going to come with a free amiibo figure

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.000
and that the street date for this will be November 21st when this comes out.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I wouldn't doubt this at all, actually. This makes a lot of sense.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:21.000
The date makes sense. The amiibo figure being thrown in there makes a lot of sense to kind of get people started with that.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I wouldn't doubt that there might be two SKUs, one with a figure and one without, or that, you know, this being GameStop,

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:35.000
the figure is a pre-order exclusive at GameStop. Maybe they get one figure. Amazon gets another figure.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Target gets another. Who knows? Something along those lines. I really hope it doesn't go that way.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:49.000
But Nintendo has done something that I really hated. The Xenoblade thing when they released that only at GameStop

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
and online on Nintendo's website. That was like the worst thing they ever did.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:59.000
So it could be a possibility. But yeah, we'll see.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Also, in the Smash Brothers universe, there were some new characters confirmed this week.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:09.000
A couple of folks from Fire Emblem, Lucina and Robin, and Captain Falcon officially added to the Smash Brothers roster.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
And Lady Robin.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
That is right.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Because Nintendo has no problem rendering a woman.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Rendering female characters is very easy for Nintendo.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
It is a little weird to see.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.000
The Wii U is simpler hardware, Dark Soccer. Is that the issue?

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
It's a little strange that they're gender swapping just that one character.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
I mean, are they gonna...

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Oh yeah, Wii Fit Trainer can gender swap male and female.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Yeah, but that's two different characters though. I don't think there's a female Robin in Fire Emblem.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I think it's just that they created this new character. Does that increase the roster?

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Although, maybe Lucinda will have a swap with...

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Can we get a male Samus, but just call it Justin Bailey?

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
That'd just be Sam.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
And he is Justin Bailey.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Alright.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Yeah, so that's pretty cool that that's out there.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.000
However, the only downside to that is that I still have not had Nests confirmed for me.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Look, I've given up hope that Luc... I don't care that Lucas doesn't come back.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
I've given up on that a long time ago.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
PK Fire!

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Where the fuck is Ness? Where is he?

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Do not piss me off, Nintendo.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Do not piss me off.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Well, they have Gamescom, they have Comic-Con.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
They've gotta save their announcements.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
They're gonna slowly... they're slow burning this.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
True.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Shane's texting me from the other room saying that in Fire Emblem, when you pick your gender, you can be female Robin.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.000
So it is...

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Okay, so it's a legit character thing.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Thanks, Shane. Who's too lazy.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Thank you, Shane.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
She's screaming from the bedroom. Welcome!

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
He's in the living room.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Where's your living room?

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000
I saw him just in there.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
You texted me from the living room?

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
He said he was lazy.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Do I need to go put a condenser mic in there?

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
He said, no, what's that?

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
What's a condenser mic?

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Alright. Moving on.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.000
That kind of makes me think of the weird conversation I had with Dan the other day.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000
What's that?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Mopar. Mostly old parts and rust.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And then he had to go look it up.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I know mocap. Alright.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
No, it's Dan got filters for my car.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Dark Sakura. Let's move on. Another story.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Well, people don't like this bullshit about the net neutrality changes.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
They really don't like it.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Like, you heard about the guy who went in and tested the throttling.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
And then posted that up for everyone to get pissed off about.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Well, there's also now over 1 million comments to the FCC about the net neutrality changes.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:39.000
In fact, according to Gigi Sohn with the FCC, as of noon, and this was on the 17th of July,

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:46.000
1,300,000 net neutrality comments had been filed with the FCC.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:55.000
And we had a lot of this put out, a comment put out by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:01.000
that runs a site called No Slow Lane saying, and I'll just read the quote on here.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:08.000
This is an extraordinary outcry from over 1 million Americans, forcing the FCC to extend its deadline to handle the deluge, make it clear.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.000
The American public demands that the FCC side with them on net neutrality.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Not big telecom companies like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Time Warner.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:21.000
And that's a quote coming from Keith Rota, the PCCC organizer.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Whoo! Keep making your voices heard. They're listening.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:32.000
That's great. Yeah, definitely. If you don't let your voice be heard in this government stuff,

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.000
then they're just going to do what the companies are paying them to do.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:41.000
And your politicians will keep voting the way that their lobbyists pay them to.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Until they know that they won't get reelected if they continue to do so. So, very important.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000
All right, just a few more stories and then the mailbag. Loki.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:55.000
So, in Europe, there was this whole thing about the free-to-play games and, you know,

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:05.000
they basically forcing some, or they wanted some better restrictions regarding in-app, accidental in-app purchases made on different devices.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And they're actually pretty happy with how Google's handled everything.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Apple, on the other hand, hasn't really stepped up yet.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
And now, what exactly has Google done?

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Well, they have decided in the European regions to actually not mark games that are free-to-play, if you will,

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.000
that have in-app purchases as actually free.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
You can download them.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:38.000
You know, the advertising, I guess, might be, I'm not sure how they actually have them listed right now.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:44.000
They don't really have them listed as free, but you can just download the games even though they are free-to-play, but you have in-app purchases or something.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:49.000
They should have, like, a thing that says in-app purchases or something. I think it would be pretty good.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:54.000
If maybe not free or something. Or free with in-app purchases.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Why can't they do that? That doesn't seem that hard to say.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
And this, I think...

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Well, on the app store on the iPhone, it does say right under the album art, it says,

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:09.000
this app may contain in-app purchases or it says this app contains in-app purchases.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:14.000
And you can even see what the top in-app purchases are to get a sense of what's in the app.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I know. I think, once again, it's just people not taking responsibility.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:25.000
And a lot of this comes from, you know, the complaints filed against EA for Dungeon Keeper, which, you know, they advertise that as free,

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.000
but it's definitely, you know, forcing...

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:36.000
They're doing whatever they can to persuade you to buy in-app purchases by crippling the game so badly.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:44.000
I don't know. I think that they should maybe have a few more, you know, safeguards in place,

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000
but I think they're almost getting to the point where it's all they can really do,

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:53.000
and it's time for the users to be responsible for what they're purchasing.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:23:01.000
And if they're giving their kid their tablet and their kid is running in-app purchases because they forgot to put...

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:07.000
They didn't put on parental settings or something like that, then I think it's really their own fault

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
and they should be responsible for those purchases and can't say,

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:16.000
oh, I didn't know that my child ran up $2,000 in purchases or something.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I don't know. Or maybe, well, they're not going to limit them to how much they can purchase per day,

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
but, you know, maybe that might be a good option or something.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
By default or something, no.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Oh, they'll never do that because they don't want to inhibit you from spending money on their storefronts.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Alright, well, going to another story, and I bet this is one that Shane might actually get up and come into the room for.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
We'll see because it has to do with Power Rangers.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
What's that?

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Yes, it's about the Power Rangers.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I'm going to screw something up. Just wait.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Alright, here's the deal.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:51.000
And this even came up earlier when we were talking about Kickstarter stuff.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000
So Chroma Squad is this game that was on Kickstarter some time ago,

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000
and the developer, Behold Games, has put an update on their Kickstarter page

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:07.000
saying that there is a royalty share deal being negotiated right now with the Power Rangers owner, Saban,

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000
who actually owns the rights to the Power Rangers right now.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.000
But here's the thing is that Chroma Squad isn't supposed to be about the Power Rangers.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
It's about the Sentai.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:25.000
And they actually say in the response that Behold Games wrote it to Joystiq, who is doing an article on this,

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.000
said, quote, Sentai is a genre that is not a creation of Saban.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
So if we're negotiating a win-win partnership, we won't change anything in the game,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.000
and we'll make it in a way that we can get some advertisement from them and use some direct references of their show.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I know some of the players will like it.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:45.000
But it's not a genre. It's actually, it's a franchise.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.000
It's owned by Toei.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Yeah.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
So they're wrong again.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Well, they still earned $97,000 plus on Kickstarter back in 2013.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.000
The early access beta version of the game was up in April for their backers.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.000
And, yep, there's still some updates going on on Kickstarter about all that thing.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000
And, by the way, Behold Games has agreed to discuss terms with Saban.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000
They have not actually partnered with them yet.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.000
That is not something, like, they're not actually...

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
But Saban doesn't, whatever.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
It's complicated, right?

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Stupid.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
So, did I get everything, Shane?

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Yeah.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Yeah, he said, eh.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Are you playing...

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.000
For the record...

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Are you playing Chroma Squad?

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
For the record...

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.000
I can't even hear him.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Sentai is a genre.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Super Sentai is a copyright owned by...

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I think it is Toei.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Yes.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
And, for the record, the first Sentai series was Gachamon.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Wait, Shane, are you playing Chroma Squad?

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
No, I'm playing Pokemon.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
He said, no, I'm playing Pokemon.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Let's be honest.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Okay, Ramus' little thing is tokusatsu, but the Super Sentai is a copyrighted title.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.000
But, looking at, seriously, the looking at the pictures, you're like,

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000
okay, that's, you know, Power Rangers.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I understand that, you know, Sentai is a genre, but it looks like Power Rangers.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.000
The other issue is there's a lot of people in this country who don't know better,

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000
who look at it and go, oh, it's a Power Rangers game.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And, sometimes, that can be very tricky with the law.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Uh-oh, Shane came in to talk.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
He's got something very important to add to this.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000
No, I was just going to say that I don't think Saban had a problem

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.000
when Mario RPG had to ax some Rangers.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.000
That was a rip-off of Sentai stuff.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
That can be parody at that point.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Yeah, and this is parody, too, isn't it?

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I mean, there's nothing on here that Saban needs to touch and ruin, so.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Does Saban like to touch and ruin things?

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Yes, the last four seasons of Power Rangers have been god-awful.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Allegedly, just because I don't want to get sued by him, too.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
It's true.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000
All right.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
All right, there you go.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
The word from Shane himself there.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Well, the thing is, though, is they're not going to be able to,

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I mean, they don't have the money to fight that,

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.000
so they kind of have to take whatever deal they're going to get.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.000
But, yes, they should have really made them not look like Power Rangers,

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:26.000
because it seriously looks very close, and it gets down to that,

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
oh, well, it's parody or something like that.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.000
But if it fits to the point where just Joe Blow on the street or whatever

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.000
looks at your product and they think that it's this,

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000
even if it's not Power Rangers, but they think it is,

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:46.000
then you have a copyright case or, I guess, a trademark case.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I don't know what you'd call it.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
It looks too close to Pokemon.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
It looks too close to Power Rangers.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And nothing like Pokemon.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
What about NB Rangers and DJ?

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
We can't hear you. We can't hear you at all.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
What about NB Rangers and DJ Max?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
They look more like Power Rangers.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000
I feel like that boyshoe here over the guy in Japanese talking,

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
yet it's just the same thing.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:17.000
I'm just repeating it in the mic because Shane is too lazy to get his own translator.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Anyway, look, we're moving on to the mailbag,

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
but I want to say some things in the chat room,

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
although I don't know because I don't want to inflate Shane's ego either.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.000
But Act F says, see, Shane knows. Shane is the man.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.000
And Rama says, thank you, base Shane.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
And Pop Coffee says, Shane with the real talk.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Well, there you go. All right.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Well, here's our Power Rangers liaison.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Power Rangers and Pokemon liaison here at OLR.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
And maybe Destiny.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Hey, who hit max level in Destiny, Shane?

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Not me.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Not you.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I had to go to sleep.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Excuses, excuses.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Hey, hey, nobody can hear you, so what you're saying doesn't matter.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Let's move on to the mailbag.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
And what does matter are emailers.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000
When you guys email us every week at participate at orangelawnsradio.com.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Again, that's participate at orangelawnsradio.com.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.000
You guys participate with our program and send us emails.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Witch Dark Sakura dives into this participate mailbag

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:12.000
and reads her favorites here on air.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Hold on real quick before I got to totally derail everything.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
God damn it.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Because I just had a wonderful thought.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Stop the music. Stop the music.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.000
No, I was just thinking, you know, because...

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000
I don't know why the word genocide made me think of Betty White,

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
but wouldn't it be hilarious if they couldn't get Peter Dinklage

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.000
to do his lines in Destiny, you know, well enough

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.000
that they should just get Betty White to do the voice of Ghost?

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
It would probably be better than Peter Dinklage.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Shane also said that.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Show of hands, who would prefer Betty White to Peter Dinklage?

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Show of hands.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I have no point of comparison.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Alright, show of hands.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Well, Betty White is always better than anything,

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
so that's the only comparison you need.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Back to the mailbag.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Betty White, if you're out there, email us.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
First email.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000
And of course we've got two weeks worth of them to go through.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
So, um...

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Excuse me.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I agree with that depth in our chat room.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
What the fuck, Loki?

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I don't know.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Alright.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Happy Sunday, Orange Lounge.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
In today's gaming scene, stuff like YouTube and Twitch are thriving.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:21.000
With so many gamers and media nuts upping their video and audio editing skills,

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.000
what do you think it takes to stand out amongst the crowd

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
and turn this into a career one day?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Along with the music I'm making, I do fishing, hunting, and gaming videos,

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:31.000
and I could use the advice.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Much love, Orange Lounge.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.000
EA skeezy.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Be entertaining.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Passion.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Proper spelling.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Drive.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I think enthusiasm goes a long way.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Grammar.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.000
And I realize there's a lot of cynicism out there in the gaming community

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:53.000
that does very, very well, but I also think that's kind of like a landmine.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:57.000
I think there's a far greater audience that want to listen to people

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:00.000
that genuinely love what it is that they're talking about.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:03.000
And I think if you love what you're doing,

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
then that ends up being infectious,

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
and people want to be a part of what it is you're doing.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Then again, we might be the wrong people to be asking

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
because we don't make money off of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network,

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.000
but I can tell you these are the things I like to see in other productions.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.000
It does help to have very clean presentation.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Because coming from a design standpoint,

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
if you're going to be putting out a visual product,

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.000
the first thing people are going to see is whatever introduction you have

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
to said product.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.000
That's going to be the cover to your book, pretty much.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000
And people do judge a book by its cover.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
I'm not saying content isn't important.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I'm saying you want to have something that well represents the content

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:49.000
and gives a person an idea to what they can expect.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Don't burn your fucking bridges.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Networking is so, so important in this industry.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Never burn your bridges and piss somebody off

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:03.000
because you never know when that's going to come back to haunt you.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I think that is very, very, very important because,

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
and I say this all the time in any podcasting,

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:14.000
I have zero tolerance for when a podcast decides to shade another,

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.000
hardworking any podcast, talk shit about each other on air,

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
just for ratings or whatever it is.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I think that's trashy.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
And nobody wants to hear that.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
And it just makes everybody involved look stupid.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
And I want to be known.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I don't know if anybody out there talks natively about OLR.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
I don't think so anymore.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
But if that's happening, I don't want to be.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
We've had them all eliminated.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Well, we've outlived them all.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Longest running. Hey.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:42.000
What if I piss the bridge and burn somebody?

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:45.000
But I'm just saying, don't ever burn the bridges

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
because that will come back to get you.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Like I'm telling you.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
You're going to have to learn to swim.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
From what I just told you, the whole don't shade other people,

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
there's people on my little black list I've got.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And yes, I have one.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
And I've never told you who's on it because, again, I'm not in that business.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000
But these are people who were talking negatively about our show

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
or on a forum or something else.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
We're saying things that I don't think were very cool.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
And I will never work with those people.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
They're all gone by now because they couldn't make it.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I wonder why.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.000
But these shows I would never work with ever.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Yeah, I wonder where those guys on Digg are now.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:23.000
The ones that were trolling you some time ago?

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Whatever.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
On Reddit, I guess.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
No, it was Digg.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
No, no. That's the joke. Where are they now?

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000
On Reddit.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
And they're probably on Fortran.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Maybe.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
They're on slash B.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
So, anyway.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
There you go. That was my long-winded answer to the question

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
that I hope was what you were looking for.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.000
I do think that good design goes a long way.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000
This one, this is kind of a long one. This is from the 10th.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000
So, it was before.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Okay.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:55.000
All right.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Hey, OLR Crew, AZHP here.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I've been behind on the podcast lately.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
That's okay because we've been behind doing them.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.000
But you guys talked about a topic a few weeks ago that's been on my mind.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Universities offering scholarships for people who are talented at League of Legends.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:12.000
You guys mainly talked about it from the standpoint of our video games support.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I wanted to cover it from a different angle.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
The school's angle.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
If you're a school trying to recruit talent,

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.000
you want to provide scholarships that attract talented people.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.000
High school kids nowadays are playing League because it costs nothing

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
and they're super invested in it.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:30.000
You're going to attract more attention if you're catering to their interests.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.000
The school gets eyes on its people who are the right age to be applying for their gaming.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Hold on. I lost my place.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Who are the right age to be applying to their schools.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:48.000
If you're offering a scholarship to something as ubiquitous in the gaming world as League,

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
it's going to get competitive.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
You're going to get applicants who are prodigies at the game.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.000
People who are extremely talented and not just from a pure Twitch gaming perspective,

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:02.000
but also are proven to have great tactical thinking and work well with others.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.000
These are great qualities that schools look for.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
And if the programs become very successful,

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:10.000
the school's League ends up competing in international and big tournaments.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:13.000
And that's promotion for the school every single time.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I can think of tons of people who would love to go to a school that has a talented team,

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
a League team playing at it.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:21.000
In short, from the school's perspective,

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.000
getting with the times and offering scholarships to people who play a majorly popular game

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.000
is extremely forward-thinking and proactive.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I think that if they play their cards right,

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.000
it will end up making their school much more palatable to the next generation of kids

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
applying to college and in the next few years.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Of course, this hinges on Riot maintaining the popularity of League,

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.000
but if all things remain on the same trajectory over the next few years,

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
League is just going to get bigger and bigger.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Sorry for the long email, but I wanted to provide another perspective

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000
that seems to have gone unaddressed in your guys' discussion.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Keep up the great work, AZHP.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.000
I think that was a very well-thought-out email with some very good points.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
And it was well-written. It was spelled right.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
As AZHP tends to do.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000
So, another one for his gold file.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
I really have nothing to say in response to that.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I think those are all very good points.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Again, it's been a couple weeks, so I can't remember exactly what we were saying about it on the show.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
It was about the...

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
I know we were talking about the whole sport and all that.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000
You know, is it really sport? And that's kind of the direction we went in with it.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.000
But I think he does make a good point.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
I get sweaty playing League.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I think he does make a good point that it's just like, you know, kids today think League is cool

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
and might want to go to a school with that.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.000
And, you know, people that are good at League are probably going to, you know,

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.000
again, making some generalizations, but probably going to excel in these particular areas.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Actually, SSJ100, Matt has a good comment.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Sure.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000
My problem with this is my problem with college sports in general.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:52.000
These kids will bring in a lot of money for their school, but none of that will trickle down to the students

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.000
who have to pay for a lot in terms of room, board, and living expenses.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
So, basically, they're bringing them in as revenue generators.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Right.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
All right.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Well, very good response email.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
All right. Last email.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Yep.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000
It says Jell-O, and then this subject was a typo on my iPhone. I refuse to correct it.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Okay.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Fair enough.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
I thought it was about Jell-O, and Jell-O is pretty fucking good.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
There's always room for Jell-O.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Especially with whipped cream.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Hey, OLR crew. Just listened to episode 559 and super excited that you guys are making it out to DragonCon.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
I'm going to be traveling down from New York City.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:31.000
I grew up in Alabama. Shout out to DS. Woohoo!

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
So, it's just like going back home.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Sadly, it is just, unless DarkSakuraLoki pulls something out last minute, it is just me going.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000
It's not the whole OLR's crew, but a lot of diverse-

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
I'm probably going to Disneyland instead.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.000
A lot of diverse people at VoG are going to be there, so excited to meet you.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Two questions first.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:57.000
When you guys go to conventions, especially multi-fandom, multi-genre conventions, what do you make and aim to spend the most time on?

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Panels, game room, dealer's room, parties, or exploring something unfamiliar.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I haven't been to a real convention in several years, and now that I'm an adult and I'm needing to take time before I can interrupt my life for a week to do this,

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:15.000
it makes me think cons are vacations for nerds, so I'm looking forward to the party fun and mostly stress-free weekend.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:22.000
I will tell you one thing. Any con you go to is scheduled an entire day after your travel to sleep.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Yes. I do that with DragonCon.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:30.000
And so, I say look at the schedule, plot your time wisely.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:41.000
I'd say that if you plan on going to the same convention for multiple years, do like some of the big events over different years.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I don't go to masquerades anymore. While I want to support the cosplay community, after Anime Expo, I don't go to masquerades at big cons anymore. I just don't do it.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I like the way that Bobby and his friends did it at DragonCon, where they watched the masquerade on the TV, because DragonCon's big enough.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Yeah, AX started doing that.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:04.000
And then everybody just orders the pizza and just watches it on the TV. I thought that was a really cool way of doing it.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:12.000
So you kind of have that private viewing with the convention people, but you don't have to fight the crowds to get in the real room and all that stuff.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.000
As far as what I like to do most at the convention, I like to do the parties honestly. I'm not going to lie, that's my favorite thing. I like the parties.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000
I almost hate the parties.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Well, you and I are different in that regard though.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
I like ghosting parties.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000
What's that?

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Meaning you find out what parties all of your friends are having, and then you go get free drinks at each party, hang out with your friends until you get completely sick of how loud it is.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Then you have quiet time in the elevator going to the next floor to the next party, and then you ghost that one too.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:51.000
And not really bringing free drinks. What I like to do is I would have the medium-sized bottles of liquor and make my contribution to little parties.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000
That works.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:40:02.000
But for the most time, the biggest thing that we did, our parties just consisted of finding some way to hook up a Super Nintendo to the TV and playing Super Mario World all night.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000
That was the one stupid thing I didn't do at GamerX was bring my own gaming console to hook up to the TV to invite people to the room.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.000
You guys were hardly in there at all. Every time I went back up there to get my quiet time, you guys just weren't there.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Well, that's good because you want a quiet time. And you know me, I would have been like, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Basically all of my times up there were take off the shoes, let the feet rest, switch into costume.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:37.000
I would say to this emailer, not to drag this out too much longer, but just plan on the panels you want to do and decide is this a must-see or a would-like-to-see.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.000
So for example, you're going to put the VOG Network panel on Monday on your must-see list.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.000
That way you make sure and come to the thing at all costs.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:51.000
But then on your kind of want-to-see list is that, okay, if I miss these, I'm not going to be upset about it.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.000
But at the same time, if I'm not really doing anything, I'm going to try to make these panels.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:58.000
But with DragonCon, you have to line up for a lot of them like way in advance.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Not ours, certainly, but a lot of the big ones with stars, you're going to have to line up way in advance.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Also, if there are any particular movie showings or anything going on, big events, if they don't interest you, use that as your dealer's time room.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Have fun, and if you're not having fun, change what you're doing.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Also, if you're cosplaying things with big wings, don't wear them into the dealer's room.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
I learned that the hard way.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Fair enough.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.000
I thought, I'll go in the dealer's room. Good photo ops. No.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Because they actually had a photo section on the corner of the dealer's room that year at AX.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
And I was like, I'll just go in there and do that. No.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Because you still have to navigate through the crowd together.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Okay, oh, there's one more. Okay.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:42.000
And lastly, dark soccer, this is for me. I have one cosplay already, but I feel like I need another.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Who should I cosplay? I can't decide. No homestuck, please. I'd only want to do a troll and a thank you to body paint.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Well, I was going to say, if you were going to do homestuck, I think that, and this is from Duchok.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:02.000
I would say anyone who cosplays Dave Strider with the turntables gets cool points in my book.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.000
I'm just saying, that would be the homestuck I'd like to see.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000
I don't really know what you're into.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Yeah, I have no idea what you look like. Not that, I mean, you can certainly cosplay anything you want.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Different gender, different whatever. But sometimes that's a good place to start.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Like, I probably am going to do Joker for Dragon Con because you know what, with a red beard I kind of look like him.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:29.000
So that's a good place for me to start. So that might be a good place for you to start.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:33.000
But yeah, I think it really depends on what you're into. What are you into? What do you love?

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Yeah, I mean, the whole reason I picked a homestuck cosplay is because I needed something quick and easy.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:44.000
I didn't have time to plan. And so, the Jane costume was quick and easy.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:48.000
I mean, the prop took me weeks to make, but other than that, you know.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:58.000
And I just want to make crystal clear that I'm saying that do what you love and it doesn't matter if you do or don't look like them.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:04.000
I'm only saying if you have no idea where to begin, that could be a starting place for you.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:11.000
But I will tell you what I do. The first thing that I do is I decide if this is something I'm going to make from scratch or if it's something I'm going to thrift.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Because most of the time my thrift costumes are my, you know, wear throughout the day and then I save my better ones for, you know, actual gatherings and photo op times.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:30.000
But, like, my King of Fighters Leona costume was part from a thrift store and part from an Army-Navy store.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Where we just modified an already existing double-breasted jacket into the top for my Leona costume.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:41.000
And then used all the leftover straps for the rest of the material.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:52.000
If you are going to wear an outfit that requires combat boots, make sure they fit you before you wear them.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Make sure they're not molded to somebody else's freakin' feet. Mold them to your damn feet. It takes a month.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I made that mistake and I played DDR in my Jill costume. I had, you wouldn't believe, oh my God, my feet were a nightmare.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:15.000
And by the way, that comes from, I think I said it came from Duchac.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:30.000
But the other thing, too, that I would like to say is that if you're going to, the other thing that I do with my costumes is that I find, first of all, as many references from whatever it is I'm doing it from.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:37.000
And easy if you're doing it from a 3D video game that you have fly cam controls in, like in Mass Effect, easy.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:45.000
If it's a game you can also rip the textures from, do that, because then you can get a really good idea for the patterns of the material.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:51.000
And then find other cosplayers. Learn from other people. See what they've done. Look for patterns.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Tumblr will almost always have cosplay tutorials up. And then plot your time wisely. That's the big thing.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Alright.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.000
And if Ron has got anything else to add, let me know.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Big response to that email. Any other emails? I thought you said one more.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.000
No, I said the one more was that lost a little bit to the email.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Well, then there you go. Well, you should send us more emails. Participate at orangelandrada.com is the place to send us emails.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Learn to sew.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000
And I'll meet you, like any good drag queen would do.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.000
I need to, I need to, I would need a sewing machine.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Alright. I believe now we are going to get into the FUs of the week. In fact, I don't believe it. I know it. We're going to get into the FUs of the week right now.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:52.000
I have to actually add what Rama just posted in chat. Cosplayblogwiththebrain.wordpress.com.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Okay. So, um, FU to just how intensely tired I've been and how hard it's been to go back to, um, my, uh, uh, sort of paleo-y regimen.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Because work has metallopurkeys. I love metallopurkeys.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Um, so I'm really, this week I got to buckle down and I'm going to go through, uh, what's called the carb flu.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:29.000
The first thing that happens after cheating at all is that when you go back to just eating regularly, you just start getting tired and tired and tired.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:35.000
And I know that's part of what's happening to me. So, just, ugh.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
I accidentally whipped the mic.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Yuck.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Yucko.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Uh, Loki.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Um, all I can say is also FU to being tired and then, um, FU to texturing because god dammit it's fucking hard.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Trying to make like texture map that, or texture atlas that works with a bunch of stuff and just trying to lay out how the hell that's going to be done.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:08.000
And, I mean, I designed my primitive models in a certain way that I didn't want to texture anything.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:15.000
And then here I am now with texturing stuff. So it's just because I changed everything and it's taking so long.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:22.000
But I just have to figure out a way to texture stuff. It's just difficult.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:27.000
I may just put something together temporarily and just keep moving on. I really think that's probably what I should do.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.000
That's it.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Alright, um, my FU of the week goes to the fact, speaking of drag queens and all that, my FU of the week goes to the fact that Bianca Del Rio is here in Sacramento tonight.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:47.000
And I'm here with you lovely people. Don't get me wrong. I love you guys and doing the show and everything.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.000
But god dammit I'm missing drag queens to be here.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Not just any drag queens. Bianca Del Rio people. Winner of Rudolph's Drag Race Season 6.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Alright, anyhow.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Let's move on. Because I do love you guys. We've got some more gaming news for you.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.000
And then your turn to call into the show. 1877 Game O.L.R.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.000
Or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. But first, a couple more stories.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:21.000
In a world where PC games are not the only things to receive day one patches. In fact, more often than not, console games receive day one patches.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:28.000
And all sorts of bug fixes from launch. And even sometimes it's still broken way after launch.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:34.000
But you know what they want to bring to consoles instead that is on PC? Early access.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:41.000
That's right. Games that are not yet done that are in a beta or alpha state that you would purchase.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:46.000
And you would receive updates as they finish the game to help the development of said titles.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Now yes, I understand that they do this on Steam with indie games. And you know what? I'm kind of cool with that for most cases.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Some people kind of abuse that and now of course there's the stuff in place where gaming may never be finished.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:12.000
So they're trying to do that both on the Playstation 4 according to Adam Boyz.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:26.000
And basically saying, you know, we're figuring... That's one massive conversation we're having internally at what point does a game meet standards of release?

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:33.000
We're still at some point... We still at some point ensure that we're being mindful to the consumer.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:39.000
We don't want somebody to stumble across a title and expect a full product that have a negative effect.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:45.000
We're figuring out what's okay. We obviously have tech requirements, checklists that people have to adhere to.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:51.000
So we're internally discussing what does that list look like and where the caveat is stuff like this.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:50:02.000
So it's still a project with lots of minds are considering. No details yet, but perhaps something in the future.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:09.000
And then of course, you know, Microsoft are thinking the same thing.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Of course, I guess the director of the ID at Xbox program, Chris Charla, is basically saying,

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:22.000
you know, it's something developers have been asking for and we are listening really closely to developers.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:27.000
There's lots of heavy deep thinkers, experts, PhDs working on whatever.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:35.000
Basically, they know it's a way that they can make some money. So they're going to be possibly thinking about having these available.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:41.000
I worry because especially when companies like EA said, hey, you know what, we should put out games in early access.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:48.000
OK, your games are already fucking early access based on some of the problems that people have been having with networking.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:58.000
And just I don't know, I I'm worried that it's going to be abused because as it is, yes, it's already kind of abused.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:06.000
And now it's just kind of giving, you know, like EA and out or something like, oh, it's beta or like, hey, you want to get in that beta for destiny?

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:15.000
I mean, guess what? You can pay for the beta access, you know, the early access. It's going to cost you $60 and it gets upgraded later on or something like that.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:22.000
What's next? Are you going to kickstart that shit? Are you going to fucking have crowdfunding to get, you know, pre-orders in the game?

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:25.000
You pay, you know, $10 and you get this and whatever.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Well, didn't they have that with Ni No Kuni? I remember something like that. They had done a little, I mean, I didn't take it too seriously, but they had something like that.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Yeah.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:39.000
But then Nintendo had the Wario or game and Wario fart starter, whatever it was.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:45.000
That was social media sharing. Like that wasn't really it, but it was, it was funny to see that whole like tongue in cheekiness of it.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Butt in cheek.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000
All right.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vogniteware.com says, I won't support this. It's already being abused on Steam.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:02.000
It is a very slippery slope. Like indie developers who need a little extra push on their first game. Yes.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
EA, not so much.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:13.000
I think there's a lot of indie developers out there that are just like, let's see what kind of, what I can scramble together real quick and then put it on there and get some money.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:24.000
And maybe they legitimately want to make a good game, but I think there's a lot of people out there that are legitimately just doing it very quickly so that they can get some money and they're never going to touch it again.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Well, what an interesting little tie in as we move into our last story tonight about EA and Maxis and The Sims 4, which I'm sure you can just imagine the money that is set to be made by EA with this game.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:43.000
The Sims 4 in a new trailer, it was a 20 minute gameplay walkthrough that they had posted.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:53.000
There was an image, one little frame got caught that said in the screen cap, quote, The Sims 4 Premium, save on new packs with early access and exclusive items.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Become a premium member to get early access to three new packs with exclusive items. Your Sims can throw a spooky costume party, camp in the great outdoors, and toast to the new year in style.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:08.000
I'm surprised they didn't know about this. They have a premium edition of Sims. I mean, what do you think that is?

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
All the sale information is on site anyway.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:21.000
And it's not new for EA either because Battlefield had premium memberships and so on. Is anyone really surprised by this information? Anyone?

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:29.000
I'll be more surprised if the game works day one. Sorry about it, but that's where I'm at with, you know, after the whole SimCity debacle and that whole mess.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Well, at least this one is offline.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:34.000
So that's good.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:40.000
But I do like how the premium edition is not a season pass. You don't get free content. I mean, you get some content, but it's discounts.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Because as someone pointed out, you know, regarding The Sims 3, hey, if you pay $19.99 for the base Sims 3, it's going to cost you almost the same price as an Xbox One to get all the content in the game.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Dar Sakura, any interest for Sims 4 over there? Because I know you used to play The Sims like pretty hardcore, at least more than anyone else I knew.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Yeah. I mean, I've been thinking about buying the premium, honestly. Just because I...

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
So this news doesn't phase you. You're like, alright, par for the course.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:14.000
But even like with the stuff that they took out, like there's no swimming pools or babies anymore. I mean...

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:20.000
I'm thinking about it. Either that or I'm just going to go just reinstall all The Sims 2 stuff and put a high res mod on it.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Well, funny that you should mention Sims 2, because there is an expansion, a new little upgrade that they just did to Sims 2 to basically say goodbye.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Origin registered owners of Sims 2 will get a free copy of the most up-to-date version, The Ultimate Collection, before the support ends on July 22nd.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:48.000
It includes all the expansions. I guess players are able to transfer their save files from whatever it is they have into this game.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:56.000
So anyone who purchased or registered a digital copy of The Sims 2 on Origin will automatically receive The Ultimate Collection. So that's kind of neat.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:02.000
So then I could actually just go buy it on Origin and get every damn thing.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
They don't sell it on Origin.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Or I could just buy... find one of my old copies.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.000
You have to find your old copy and you have to actually call it in to register, because there's no way to register it through Origin.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.000
There's no keys or anything?

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:14.000
No.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:17.000
I'll just get it for free later. I mean, I'll just get it eventually.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:18.000
So now...

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.000
I know, I know. I don't really care.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
Just wait for another Humble Bundle that EA puts out.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.000
I don't want to have to run it through fucking Origin anyway, so whatever.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Origin isn't as awful as it was a couple years ago.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:33.000
I still don't want to run it through Origin anyway, because I run like a...

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Sims 3, thankfully, didn't have to go through Origin for a lot of its stuff.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.000
And I could run my mods, except Sims 3 kind of ran like crap.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:43.000
See, that's what's holding me back, actually, about Sims 4.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:49.000
The fact that Sims 3 ran so unbelievably horribly, that...

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Sims 4 is probably not... and Sims 4 is going to require Origin, I'm sure.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:54.000
So...

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:57.000
Which is interesting, because it's offline, but not really.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:58.000
So...

02:55:58.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Alright.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:03.000
We've got to connect online to purchase all those fucking packs now, don't you?

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.000
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, the Skype...

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:11.000
L1 word.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
The Skype line is now open for your calls.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:18.000
You can talk to us on any topic that we've covered tonight, or maybe something that we missed.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Anything from last week, even, would be fine as well.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Which I totally realize that I neglected to in the opening, because we went so long,

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
I never did a last week's music set to Holic...

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Or, excuse me, last week's news set to Holic, so I apologize for the oversight.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:34.000
But, yeah, we're running too long, so sorry about that.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Sorry to the fans that were waiting for that segment.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000
But, you know, we have to talk more about GamerX and other stuff anyway.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
We do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:47.000
The one and only Rama. You know what to do with the fastest internet in the chat room.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Hey, Rama, you're coming through really quiet for some reason.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.000
Is your mic in its usual place?

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
Hold on one second...

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
There you go. You're already better.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:01.000
I had to turn up the mixer for a little bit.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
You're much better. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:06.000
I just want to kind of break down the whole Tokusai thing real quick,

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:09.000
so everyone have a brief explanation of what it is.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Please.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Sure. I mean, Tokusai is a genre. It's live-action special effects.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Under that is the Super Sentai series, Ultraman, Godzilla, all that type of stuff.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Gotcha?

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:31.000
Yeah. And, you know, from that article, I think those guys at Crozna,

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:37.000
they could get away with it, provided that they say this is the series

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:41.000
and it has no direct correlation to what Saban is doing.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:44.000
I mean, it'll be similar, but there's no direct correlation,

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.000
as in the American changes and stuff like that,

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:52.000
because they have gotten away with stuff like this in the comic books and, you know.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Do you think that Saban, should they go down this path of taking legal action against the game?

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
You know, that's a big if, but should they?

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Do you think they might try to attack, though, saying that the average user,

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:09.000
let's be real, the average computer game player probably doesn't follow this stuff as closely as you do,

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:14.000
but the average user would think it's Power Rangers?

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Pretty much, because to be perfectly honest,

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:22.000
if you were to get about ten Power Ranger fans in a room,

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:26.000
maybe one or two of them would know what the original Japanese series is.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Good point.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:32.000
You know, there's like a Power Morphicon or something's happening here in, what, August?

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Because Shane kept telling me he wanted to go,

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
but that's something that's happening in SoCal in August,

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:39.000
and I wonder if this is going to be a part of the conversation there a little bit,

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
show up in a panel or something.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Possibly because Power Morphicon, it's a celebration of the original Japanese Super Sentai series

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:53.000
and other series like Masked Rider, Ultraman, and the American series just Power Rangers,

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:57.000
Masked Rider, Kamen Rider, Beetleborgs, all that cool stuff.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Yeah, like the actors from different series and stuff.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:04.000
You know, I don't really watch the Power Rangers especially as much as Shane does,

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.000
but he forced me pretty much at gunpoint to watch one of the episodes from Japan

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:12.000
with the Train Rangers or whatever they are, and that was actually pretty cute.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Yeah, I mean, honestly, if you watch the American series,

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:21.000
you'll eventually will find your way to the original Japanese.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Just watch Mega Ranger, that's all you need.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Yeah, Jamie makes a valid point, because not for nothing,

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:33.000
and I'll swear on a stack of Holy Bibles before you go up in flames,

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:40.000
99% of the Sailor Moon fandom started out on the dubbed series,

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
before they found the original Japanese.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Or there was a magazine called An America that had a full spread about Sailor Moon

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:55.000
while they were still in negotiations, and some of us found our way to fan subs. Just saying.

02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Yeah, but when Rama talks about the 99%, you are probably in the 1%, just saying.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:04.000
You are the 1% Dark Sakura of anime fandom.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Whatever.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:12.000
I just wanted a chance to say that to Dark Sakura and call her the 1%.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:16.000
Alright, anyway, Rama, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Can I just quickly plug the GoFundMe with the banner that's rotating on the vlog network real quick?

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Yes, of course you may.

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:28.000
Okay, in case you haven't heard, one of our staff members, Avalon Cosplay,

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:32.000
when she was coming back from a convention, she found out her house burnt down.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Fortunately, insurance is covering everything, but as of right now, they're just trying to make ends meet

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:43.000
with a new place to stay, food, work, all that stuff, until the house is built.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:48.000
If you go to animejamsession.com, there is a banner, there's a button on the site

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:53.000
with information and where you can go to donate, and there is also a rotating banner on vlognetwork.com.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Excellent, and yes, if you are listening live right now, you can see that banner right at the top of the screen,

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:01.000
live.vognetwork.com, a great thing you guys are doing.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:08.000
Those are the types of ads I like, ads to help people out during times of crisis, so best of luck to that.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Before I let you go, on a lighter note, Rama, while I have you on the line, I have to ask you this,

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.000
and I know I could go listen to Anime Jam Session for even more in-depth discussion,

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Rama, I just need to, in like one sentence here, I'm just going to put this word out there,

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.000
and I just want to hear your thoughts, I'm going to put that word on the table and walk away.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Dashcon.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:38.000
I need a moment.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:41.000
Okay.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Did you just take a hit? Was that what that was?

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
No, well, that too.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
Or were you inflating a ball pit?

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:54.000
Do I have to bring another ball pit to the chat room?

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:56.000
Perhaps.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:02.000
Now, I feel like it's mandatory that every convention from here on out has a ball pit.

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:09.000
The con I'm staffing, we already said it, ball pit confirmed for DerpyCon.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.000
There you go, there you go. Alright, but seriously though, Dashcon.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:22.000
There isn't a word that can describe this because it went mainstream.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:28.000
This was in papers, it went beyond mainstream.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:31.000
It got very real. It got real. Balls got real, yo.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:32.000
Denny's.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:38.000
Yeah, with Denny's is fucking making a reference to like, what did they say on their Twitter?

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
Oh, well, yeah.

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:44.000
Sorry your food took so long, you can have an extra hour in the ball pit.

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:45.000
One of my favorite-

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:48.000
I swear to God, Denny's is so fucking funny on social media.

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:55.000
One of my favorite actors, Ostrick Chow, he even took a picture of himself in a ball pit and said that he got an extra hour.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
Amazing. Amazing.

03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:03.000
Alright, Fifth Dream says, Sky, Sky, Sky, let's have a ball pit at Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival.

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Okay, look, gay orgy is not the ball pit you're thinking of that we're talking about here.

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:09.000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Alright.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
Okay, this was on Denny's Twitter.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Welcome to DenCon. On your birthday, you get an extra hour in the pit.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.000
Once again, horrific food, but hilarious sentiment.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:27.000
I almost want to eat at Denny's just to support their social media team.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Alright, Rahm, I gotta let you go to try and get another call, but take care.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
No problem, you take care, bro.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:33.000
Alright, bye.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:37.000
Sorry to let Rahm go early, but he will get an extra hour in the ball pit for his troubles.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:43.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Give us a call.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.000
Did they also have a bouncy house?

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
Yes, there was a bouncy house.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:53.000
There's like a deflated bouncy house in there for adults.

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:54.000
It's pretty amazing.

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:57.000
Well, what would have been the average age at DashCon?

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
I think 17, probably.

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:00.000
I don't know.

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
I don't know why I'm looking at you, Loki.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Like, you'd know the answer of all things DashCon.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:08.000
Well, I just saw the picture of the ball pit, that's about it.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:13.000
I saw, being that I am a Tumblr user, I mean, I see a lot of dumb shit on Tumblr.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:17.000
But I see a lot of really funny GIFs sometimes, and I see a lot of really hot things, too.

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:23.000
But I also see lots of reports on DashCon and that sort of thing, and it's just been...

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:28.000
It made me appreciate GamerX, too, that much more.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:33.000
Because GamerX, especially for the first year they ran, they were a very well-run con for the first year.

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
And a very well-run con in their second year.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:38.000
And so it just kind of goes to show you that, wow, it could have been a lot worse.

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
Wow.

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:41.000
All right.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:46.000
I'm going to go to Twitter real quick, because I did see some tweets come in.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.000
Dartatouille had sent us a tweet saying, just two quick things.

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:53.000
One, will there be more Mortal Kombat 8 tournaments a la Cross Zones in the future?

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Yes, that is something we have wanted to do.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:02.000
I would think that the time that Nintendo inevitably puts out DLC, we'll want to get on that pretty fast.

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:05.000
But I can't see why there wouldn't be a tournament before then.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:08.000
I'm sure in the next month or two we'll do another tournament.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Just, we were all busy with the whole going to the con and preparing for our panel and all that stuff,

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
which hopefully you guys will get to see the panel, too.

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:20.000
Tigerclaw tweets us saying that Akiva Goldsman is producing the Space Invaders movie.

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
I forgot that that was a thing.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:25.000
They are making a Space Invaders movie.

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:26.000
Why?

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
Because they made a Battleship movie.

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:29.000
Why not?

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:30.000
Yeah, that was so...

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
One last call for calls.

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:36.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Akdeft tweets us saying, here's a really great video game music bundle and you can pay what you want

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
and for a good cause, too.

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:49.000
And it's groupies.com, G-R-O-U-P-E-E-S dot com slash GMG.

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:53.000
And I'm trying to look at this link real quick here, but I'm trying to do it on my phone

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
to see of what it is you get.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:59.000
Oh, you get the Rogue Legacy soundtrack and Kernel 2

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:03.000
and the Banner Saga by Austin Wintory, Hotline Miami.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
Oh, that's a really good soundtrack.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
That's very cool. I like that.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:10.000
So for a minimum of a dollar, you get all those soundtracks

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:15.000
and once they reach $2500 in sales, they're going to do another...

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:19.000
VidBoy and Lifeform do a collaboration for the bundle.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:20.000
That's kind of neat, actually.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:23.000
I like that idea that they get all the...

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:27.000
It's like a Kickstarter, but with actual product you're just getting right out the gate.

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:30.000
Groupies is kind of neat because sometimes they'll do different things.

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:33.000
There's one I did that had...

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:38.000
There was games in there and soundtracks and all sorts of random stuff.

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:41.000
It's usually a mix of things.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:44.000
That's really neat. I like that.

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
Thank you for the FYI on that.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:49.000
Tigerclaw says there's a Ouija board movie coming out, but they already did one.

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:50.000
It was called The Exorcist.

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Wasn't there a Witch Board?

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
Yeah, there was a Witch Board.

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:58.000
I saw the trailer for the Ouija board movie and it looks very generic.

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:06.000
Yeah, I guess just to cash in on all the board game movie craze and scary movies and all that.

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:10.000
Alright, well, our phone isn't lighting up.

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:14.000
I guess that means no one else wants to call in, but that's okay because we're 20 past 9 o'clock.

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:17.000
I knew the show would run a little long tonight since we had to catch up for a week.

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:20.000
If you have more things you want to say after the fact, Twitter.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
You can also send us an email at any time.

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:26.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to do that.

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:30.000
Thank you guys for showing up tonight.

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
Thank you guys for listening to us on the podcast feed.

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
Thanks for your support of the show.

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:37.000
We always say here at Orange Lawns Radio, if you like what you heard here at the show,

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
tell one or two friends about the show.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:43.000
Help spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:44.000
We really appreciate it.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:47.000
We don't ask for your money and we don't have a ball pit, I'm sorry to say.

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:54.000
But when we do get money someday from selling shirts or something, we'll have a ball pit for you.

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:57.000
I never checked in with Loki for last minute stories, so I'll do that real quick.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:58.000
There's not a ton.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:03.000
There was this really cool mod that they have for Grand Theft Auto 3 called Liberty City Nights.

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:09.000
It's actually on ModDB and it adds some enhanced graphics to Grand Theft Auto 3

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:16.000
as well as improved car models and lighting to make it all very glowy and looks like midnight club almost.

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:23.000
So you can check that out on moddb.com slash mod slash GTA LCN.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
Alright.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:28.000
And then I also wanted to say, I actually posted about this.

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:34.000
I'm kind of looking forward to see what kind of games we get out of it, but apparently this month,

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:42.000
there is a game jam going on called Katamari Jam, which looks pretty awesome.

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
Yeah, I heard about that. That sounds awesome.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
So I want to check that out.

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:47.000
Very cool.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
Alright, well thanks again everybody for listening.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:50.000
It's time to wrap up the show.

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:54.000
Before we do that, we're going to get around, go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000
Um, Darcy, I'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
I want poutine.

03:08:58.000 --> 03:08:59.000
That sounds good.

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:08.000
I think I'm just going to go to the KFC A&W place and get fries and curds and then order a side of gravy.

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:09.000
There you go.

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:10.000
I'm going to have poutine tonight.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.000
Make your own little like hack, A&W hack poutine.

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:20.000
My final thought tonight is now that you've talked about poutine, I want to take a trip to Canada.

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:21.000
I seriously do.

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:24.000
It's not like just now I want to go to Canada, but I've wanted to go back for some time.

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:25.000
I miss it.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
I have friends in Toronto now, thanks to the podcast sister.

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:30.000
I have friends there, but I also really love Vancouver.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:31.000
I got to go back there too.

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
Shout out to all our Canadian listeners.

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
I miss you.

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
Low key, your final thought.

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
They already have one game for Katamari Jam.

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:43.000
It's called Dama Cube and it looks pretty cool.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:44.000
It's a puzzle game.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:48.000
We roll stuff up as a cube.

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:49.000
I don't know.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:50.000
It'd be fun to make like a Katamari game.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:58.000
Our buddy Jason's in chat right now, which by the way, nobody asked why he wasn't in the intro tonight, but Jason was traveling tonight.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
So he wasn't able to get the intro done for us.

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:01.000
So Jason's just fine.

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.000
He's in our chat room right now and says, I was in Canada for a week and I didn't have poutine.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000
Well, Jason, now you got to go back.

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:11.000
Now you got to go back.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:12.000
All right.

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:17.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight and listening to the program.

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:21.000
We really appreciate it and hope you guys have a great week.

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:24.000
Be good to each other.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Don't be jerks to each other.

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:27.000
Nobody likes a jerk.

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:28.000
That's very important.

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.000
And do I have anything else to say?

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
I don't think so.

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:34.000
I think we're done.

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:35.000
We'll see you next week, guys.

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:36.000
Have a good one.

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:37.000
Goodbye.

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
They were all still true.

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
See you next week.

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:37.000
Thank you.
