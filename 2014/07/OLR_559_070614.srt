00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
This week gamers may hate everything, but that list includes gender inequality.

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,480
Feedback convinced the IESF to open a gender neutral division for their esports competitions.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,280
Also, ClickDB returned, hooray!

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,240
Gears of War 4 did not confirm.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,720
We'll explain on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,980
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,600
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:45,240
It is Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday July 6th of 2014 with the 559th episode of

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,640
our show.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,200
We are here over the next few hours to talk about video games with you guys in our chat

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,040
room live.voggenetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,120
at 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,120
In studio, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Summers.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Uh-uh.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Uh-huh, uh-huh, you're here.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,560
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
You kind of tired.

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
You're tired.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,320
You were very peppy during the Bobby Black Wolf call a little earlier though.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,280
Yeah, the caffeine's already starting to wear off.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
I see, you had your cup of coffee.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,040
I had orange chicken tonight and it makes me dead inside.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,720
Are you excited to go to convention with Rob and Alan this weekend, GamerX?

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,760
I'm too busy to be excited because of cosplay props and the fact that I had a moment of

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,280
stupid and forgot that, um, spray paint dissolves styrofoam, so I'm having to make a new skaia

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,520
for my giant fork.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Oh no.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,800
Are you going to tell us a little bit about your cosplay or is this a surprise?

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
It's not a surprise.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,040
I'm cosplaying as, uh, the crocoteer Jane from, uh, uh, Homestuck.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,360
Which is why I had to, when you said the character, my eyes glazed over.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
I totally cleared it up.

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Oh, hi, Techmaster Loki.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
How are you?

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm fine.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Hey, I'll come back to you in a minute.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,800
Now, Dark Sucker, who is this character for those that don't know?

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:11,320
Jane Crocker is the heir to the Betty Crocker, uh, uh, corporate monopoly of the universe.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,880
Like the people that make cakes?

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,760
Yes, except it's really a troll who is the Batter Witch.

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Okay.

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
The Batter Witch.

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Okay.

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,240
So anyway, there's your fandoms are so strange, but all right, you know what?

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
I watch Big Brother.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
It's totally trash.

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,480
So she has this, her, she doesn't have a laptop.

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,180
She has a tiara top and she gets taken over after she's already got here, which makes

51
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,320
her kind of evil.

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,480
I don't know why, but Homestuck sounds like that.

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,400
It sounds like that game that you play where like you have a folded piece of paper and

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,340
somebody writes one line of a story and then you fold it and somebody writes the next line

55
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,080
of a story and you fold it and somebody writes the next line.

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,160
And then you have like this total like mishmash hodgepodge, like random crap story that comes

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
out of it.

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,320
And somebody, if you'll follow the story, it makes sense.

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
I understand.

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,080
It's especially when you go back and go, Oh, that's what that weirdness was from.

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm not a hater.

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
I'm just, just saying it's, well, this is the time to get into it because we're at the

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
gigapause.

64
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Okay.

65
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,460
Do I, should I even ask?

66
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,640
Because the Homestuck game is under production right now.

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,240
So put the final, uh, arc of the story on pause until the game is done because people

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,160
paid $2 million for it through Kickstarter.

69
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,080
Oh, so that's a little bit of an obligation to make the game.

70
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
I see.

71
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,320
So yeah, we're getting Homestuck game.

72
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
All right.

73
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,960
And no expanded universe for you.

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,360
Oh, there's also, um, there's actually a new comic series.

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
That's like little mini comics that expand on different things going on in the Homestuck

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
universe called paradox space.

77
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
All right.

78
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
You know what?

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
We all have our fandoms.

80
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
We all do.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
All right.

82
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I am looking forward to seeing your cosplay.

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm sad the animal crossing villager thing never panned out.

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,240
I was, I could still hit you with a bug net.

85
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Oh yay.

86
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
All right.

87
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Really?

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,000
All I have to do is wear clothes and carry a bug net.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,760
Maybe, maybe we can hit up a fabric store really quick and try to try to figure out

90
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,880
how to make that caught like one of those really funny hats they wear in the game.

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Okay.

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
We'll figure something out.

93
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
All right.

94
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Anyway, uh, tech master Loki's here as well.

95
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Of course.

96
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Cause you heard him earlier.

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
How you doing Loki?

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Doing fine.

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,040
Which fandoms do you have that other people probably wouldn't get?

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
Um, I don't think I have any.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes you do.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes you do.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Before the show, before the show, you were talking about that you're going to take a

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,680
day off of work in August to go see, that's not weird.

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,600
I think I would do it.

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,760
There's a lot of people that are looking at that new movie going, eh, I don't know.

108
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,220
I guess, I guess it is looking a little better the more that comes out about it.

109
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,640
It doesn't look as horrible as some of the ideas first thought, but I don't know.

110
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,440
So you're like super into Ninja Turtles though.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm not super into it.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,560
I mean, I haven't watched any of the stuff that Nickelodeon's really done.

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,760
Um, I'll just go see the movie.

114
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I liked the last movie.

115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,960
I was just kind of sad they didn't really continue on with that.

116
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Everyone hated it.

117
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,880
I don't understand why I thought it was, it had the perfect vibe to it.

118
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,120
I thought to use me in Ninja Turtles always made pretty good video games.

119
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,120
I used to love the cartoon when I was a kid, um, it could be worse than some of these other

120
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
movies.

121
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,720
Like I just watched, um, was it World War Z?

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,200
Yes, the zombie movie where they kill the, or they cure the apocalypse with meningitis.

123
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,240
I heard they totally changed the movie version from the book though or something.

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,640
It was so stupid, but whatever.

125
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,160
Um, so I don't know.

126
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,680
I don't really care that it's Michael Bay doing the movie and stuff as long as it doesn't

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
seem too cheesy to me.

128
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,960
You know, like the Transformers movies were just kind of retarded.

129
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
I don't know.

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Mm hmm.

131
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,360
So I, and painting game was good.

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,680
I mean he did that.

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,680
So bad boys was supposed to be pretty good.

134
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,480
So was he Independence Day?

135
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,800
Oh no, that was the, that was the Emmert guys who did Stargate and stuff.

136
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Yeah.

137
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,720
No, they have, was it that Pompeii or some bullshit, I don't even know if that's come

138
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
out.

139
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
No one, no one cared about that.

140
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Yeah.

141
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,120
It's like, no, I think after, what was it, what's the last movie that they had the last

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
disaster movie with, uh, what the hell was that?

143
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,920
Uh, the Mayan apocalypse apocalypse or I don't even know what the fuck it was called.

144
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,680
Was that the one where like they're trying to take out, yeah, 2012 and they're trying

145
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,560
to take off from the airport.

146
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,480
They outrun an earthquake like three times in an airplane is like, okay, this is such

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
filler right now.

148
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
It's ridiculous.

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,840
But okay, whatever.

150
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,240
Um, I just, but see that movie though, those kinds of movies are just, you know what to

151
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
expect in the end.

152
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
You know what?

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
I am totally psyched for independence day too.

154
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Who gives a shit?

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Is that actually happening?

156
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
That's actually happening.

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Who gives a crap?

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Who cares?

159
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
I don't care.

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
All right.

161
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I will see that.

162
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm, I'm really sad though because Harvey Firstine, his character died in the first

163
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,040
one, or at least it's implied.

164
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Maybe he somehow survived, you know, because that was, that was the character to root for

165
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
the full bonkers.

166
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,360
I mean, it's in the future now, maybe they've rebuilt him to cybernetic, you know, Harvey

167
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,780
Finds.

168
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Maybe it involves his mother.

169
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,920
Cause you know, in the first movie, I got to call my mother.

170
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Yes.

171
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,520
And he can be dressing in drag as his mother.

172
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
And better.

173
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Yes.

174
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Was there a video game for independence day?

175
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Oh yeah.

176
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
It was terrible.

177
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
It was PlayStation one.

178
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,240
There's always like interesting movie game tie-ins.

179
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,560
We'll talk about that in a minute here, but I got to go to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com

180
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,000
because of course we do tape live at Sunday nights at the voice of the East network, voggenetwork.com.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,720
Blender's a fan of world war Z, the book saying the book is awesome.

182
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Let's see.

183
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
Tigerclaw would like you to know Loki, Michael Bay is not directing it, but act after saying

184
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,680
Michael Bay is involved and that's enough.

185
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
It doesn't.

186
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
I see even that I don't really care.

187
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,360
I mean, it's just like eventually it's statistically possible that M Night Shyamalan will make

188
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
a good movie again.

189
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,240
I mean, so that will happen someday, but it's just like Michael Bay, you know, I don't hate

190
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
everything that he does.

191
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,520
I just hate the transformers movies, like the last few of them, cause they've been really

192
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,920
just kind of stretching that franchise then it's just not really about the transformers

193
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
anymore.

194
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,420
It's just kind of this thing that they spun it into.

195
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,000
That's what I don't like about Michael Bay, but his movies are fine.

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,300
I know going into it, I expect a very low intelligent, lots of explosions action movie

197
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,380
and that's what I get.

198
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,780
So I'm not let down by Michael Bay.

199
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:34,820
It's just when they start making testicle jokes in transformers 2 that's a little kind

200
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,020
of like, okay, this is a little weird.

201
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
Let's see.

202
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:49,820
I did not realize, well, Jack Bauer is soon going to be, soon going to be solid snake.

203
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,700
So you know, that guy's everywhere.

204
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Even soon.

205
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
He already is.

206
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Yeah, it's true.

207
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
He is.

208
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
So, uh, let's see.

209
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,420
A dark to Tia says, I don't think the Bay TMNT will top the 1990 original, but I don't

210
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,260
think it'd be any worse than TMNT three.

211
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,940
Hey, I am a little TMT three kind of had like camp value because I had a little bit of that.

212
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
It's so bad.

213
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
It's kind of good going on.

214
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
A little disappointed.

215
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,180
Casey Jones isn't going to be in the movie.

216
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
Oh really?

217
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,700
Um, but I guess they have to save stuff for sequel and I know they were talking already

218
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,740
for the sequel, like Bebop and Roxy.

219
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
So I'm, I'm down with that.

220
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
There you go.

221
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,540
Um, so we're talking a little bit about, uh, you know, games based on movies of, or that

222
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,560
we bring up this topic once in a while, but I think it's good as we get a lot, we get

223
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,180
into the big summer movie season to kind of revisit this once in a while.

224
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,780
Like what are the big movies that are out there that you're really surprised don't have

225
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,020
like a video game behind it?

226
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,900
Because for me, like whenever I think about that question, especially now, like these

227
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,540
past couple of years, I'm always surprised there's not really a video game for the hunger

228
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
games.

229
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,340
And yeah, I know there are some, there's the iPhone games.

230
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,300
I do know there's that, but I don't, I mean like those really just seem like totally different

231
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
ideas.

232
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,740
I mean, essentially who's the target audience.

233
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
That's the thing.

234
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
I know, I know.

235
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,580
But the one hunger games game that I can think of was basically a two D temple run that just

236
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,620
had a hunger game stuff slapped all over it.

237
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
You know what I mean?

238
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,380
Like I would like to see like a legit, like multiplayer you're in the arena type of thing.

239
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,580
Closest thing you're gonna get to that is the Minecraft mods where you can play hunger

240
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
games in that.

241
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
Yeah.

242
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
And that's actually pretty cool.

243
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,140
You know why they won't do one, right?

244
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,340
Because it's because kids, why wouldn't there be a battle royale video game?

245
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,460
Yeah, that's true.

246
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,220
I realized that kind of subject matters a little iffy, but I mean, catching fire, I

247
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
hope this isn't spoiler.

248
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
I don't think it is.

249
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,580
The catching fire does involve adults, not kids still, you know, fairly young, still

250
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
teenagers.

251
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Hmm.

252
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,460
They could, they could find a way to work into the video game to make it less controversial.

253
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I don't know.

254
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,220
I mean, it worked in the movie without being like, you know, those movies aren't like offensive

255
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
or whatever.

256
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,440
Remember people categorize movies and video games differently in this country.

257
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,300
And those people are dumb, which is, you know, which is always a little weird to me, always

258
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,860
a little weird to me, um, dungeon buster in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

259
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,640
says X-Men days of future past should have gotten an X-Men legends or Marvel Alliance

260
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,140
kind of game.

261
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,140
Yeah.

262
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,700
There hasn't there, has there been a new X-Men game to support this, these, this new movie?

263
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
I don't think there has been.

264
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Activision used to do the licensed movies for the Marvel properties and stuff.

265
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Yeah.

266
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,600
Now they aren't, um, cause they used to do all the sorts of movie tie-ins and even their

267
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
own things.

268
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,580
And they tried rebooting like the X-Men with, uh, I remember the last X-Men game was, but

269
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,100
it wasn't very good.

270
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,060
Um, and I think they've just kind of given up on that, although they will, they occasionally

271
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,980
will do the quick cash-in on movie franchises, like the walking dead, which was terrible

272
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,860
or, um, the fast and the furious, which was also terrible.

273
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,740
That walking dead one in particular was always so weird to me because you had two walking

274
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
dead games.

275
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,300
And I think I get it because Telltale licensed the, the original comics, right.

276
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,260
And then Activision licensed the show and that's why you had the two walking dead games.

277
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,700
One of them, fantastic.

278
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,140
The other one, absolutely awful.

279
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,140
Yeah.

280
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,580
It's in the fast and the furious game was just ridiculous.

281
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
It was just stupid.

282
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,300
Um, and, and Activision will do that.

283
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,380
They will, you know, make a quick buck on some of these, you know, licenses and stuff,

284
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,460
but they just haven't done that recently.

285
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,920
I think the closest that you've gotten to new superhero games recently is probably the

286
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,100
Lego Marvel superhero stuff.

287
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,620
That's really, I mean, those are actually not bad.

288
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,700
It's just all the Lego games start to kind of blend together eventually cause it's all

289
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,840
kind of the same form.

290
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
It's a formula that works.

291
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeah.

292
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
They have the same sense of humor.

293
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,100
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

294
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,420
Um, let's see some comments in our chat room.

295
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,320
Tiger class as most movie tie in games were mobile games.

296
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
That's that is true.

297
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
That's true.

298
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
The X-Men had a mobile game.

299
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,420
I want a Pacific rim fighting game.

300
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,460
There they had won a Pacific rim game, but it's X-Box live arcade and PlayStation network.

301
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,460
It's shit.

302
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,460
Oh, sorry.

303
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,460
That's too bad.

304
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Yeah.

305
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,940
It's like street fighter two, the movie, the game.

306
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,220
I think it, at least I think it was those platforms and not just, um, I could be confusing

307
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,660
it with real steel.

308
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,500
Um, but it was both of those games are actually very similar and it was just not very good

309
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,580
at all.

310
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,920
Um, going into current events, uh, something we were talking about briefly last week, act

311
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,140
deaf in our chat room says Activision is why I'm weary of platinum's legend of Corey game.

312
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
Hmm.

313
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Uh, let's see.

314
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,980
It's some, there was some talk in chat about, uh, let's see, Blender says, Pulp Fiction,

315
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,140
the game, bring out the gimp bonus around, uh, blueberry responded and said, isn't basically

316
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,940
saints row Pulp Fiction, the game.

317
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,300
It used to be, um, now it's just fucking nuts.

318
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
That's the thing.

319
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,100
I mean, seriously, no, it's saints row five.

320
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
It's fucking nuts.

321
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
It's no seriously there.

322
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
You go and play.

323
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,740
I mean, do yourself a favor and go play.

324
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,820
I think one of the best in the series was saints row to at least best when it was kind

325
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,660
of still hinges around the fact that it's a gang, then they're, you know, fighting to

326
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,500
get their territory back and that kind of stuff, um, with, you know, the wacky kind

327
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,020
of mini games and stuff and just the humor and see the part of, I think the saints row

328
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,380
series that they've lost in three and four was the brutality of like, cause it's a true

329
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,780
to you fucked up.

330
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,020
Like those gang leaders, like when they got revenge, they got revenge in the most fucked

331
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
up ways.

332
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,060
And then there was one where this guy ends up killing one of your crew members.

333
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,380
So we do you kidnap his girlfriend cause he's a monster truck, you know, um, monster truck

334
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,020
driver and you, you, uh, stuffer in the trunk of one of the cars that he's going to crush

335
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,220
and he kills her.

336
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,340
He forces the gang member to kill his girlfriend for people.

337
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
See that was just like brutal.

338
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,780
But in, you know, three, it's just like, it's just got ridiculous.

339
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,980
And in four was just, it's not even, I don't even see that as part of the series.

340
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,220
Any more ridiculousness is what appealed to me though.

341
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Because like that's, that's all I ever played the grand theft auto games for.

342
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Yeah.

343
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,420
But like two was it, two had a good balance of ridiculous and like still kind of grounded.

344
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,340
I mean it wasn't, it was, I mean you had the septic Avenger where you'd spray poop on people,

345
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,180
you know, with, uh, with a septic truck.

346
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
And that was awesome.

347
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,540
That was absolutely awesome.

348
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,340
And they had, you know, the ability where for no apparent reason whatsoever, you're

349
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,900
going to have the ability to, you know, uproot things off the, you know, the street and

350
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
use them as weapons.

351
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,220
So, Oh hey, look at that, you know, fire hydrant, I'm just gonna rip it out of the ground and

352
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
hit people with it.

353
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,820
That was, that was awesome.

354
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,140
It just made no sense, but it was awesome.

355
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,880
But being a, you know, uh, the president of the United States and being trapped in a virtual

356
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,040
matrix world and stuff and being a superhero, it's just so ridiculous that it's just kind

357
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,900
of, I don't know, it's like, it's like they wanted to make a different type of game, but

358
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,180
they had to make a saints row game.

359
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,580
It's like, Oh, well we have to make a saints row, you know, sequel, but I really want to

360
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
make crackdown.

361
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
It's, that's what it seemed like to me.

362
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
All right.

363
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,740
Let me read a few more comments here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and then

364
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,540
we'll get into our gaming weeks and tonight's gaming news.

365
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,740
Um, let's see, uh, Blender says, surprise, nobody mentioned Firefly.

366
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,220
Now it usually does come up in these types of conversations about what, you know, movies,

367
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,940
which I guess technically the movie was serenity, but y'all know what we're talking about.

368
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,180
Uh, what usually that's that whole universe comes up as something that could be ported

369
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,180
to games.

370
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,820
And it does seem very surprising, you know, because it's very clear at this point, not

371
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,180
even Netflix and Hulu and Yahoo, not even Yahoo screen or whatever saved community.

372
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,940
Not even that is going to say Firefly at this point.

373
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,000
I mean, all of those actors have moved on to other projects.

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,220
It's getting older and older.

375
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Right.

376
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,060
But I'm really surprised that like the story couldn't continue in a tell tale esque kind

377
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,980
of episodic game, you know, classic point and click adventure type of thing.

378
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
There were comics.

379
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,380
Yeah, I guess that's true.

380
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,340
There were a lot of the weed and stuff has been continued in comics, hasn't it?

381
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Yes.

382
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
Sadly for Buffy.

383
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
Yeah.

384
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,580
You know what would make a really awesome movie, I think is Borderlands.

385
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,700
Borderlands has a really good kind of, uh, you know, environment and characters and just

386
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,700
that humor to it.

387
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
I think that'd be really good.

388
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,740
I got to see a little bit of the tales from the Borderlands at E3.

389
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,020
We, we were lucky enough to go to a telltale presentation for that where they played through

390
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,700
the first 20 minutes of the game.

391
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,420
And I must admit my knowledge of the borderland bland universe is not very deep.

392
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,460
I have familiarity with both games, but I just never got like sucked into them the way

393
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,260
a lot of other people have, but I was still able to follow the game that they were playing

394
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
well enough.

395
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
And it was amusing.

396
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,260
It had its parts.

397
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,820
And I, I was very, um, kind of taken aback how the art style worked so well and the way

398
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,460
the game looks in this completely different type of game.

399
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,980
So there's that, you know, the tales from the borderlands is shaping up to be pretty

400
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
interesting.

401
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,620
Um, anyway, uh, also go to our chat room over at live.vog network.com.

402
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Um, Kaijudo said most video game movies are bad, so I'm glad they seem to be making less

403
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,620
of them.

404
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,660
And blueberry jumped in saying, I agree with Kaijudo, I don't miss the console movie games.

405
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,620
They had zero ambition, negative ambition level.

406
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,500
See they didn't use to like, I remember back in the day, like what the Batman game on the

407
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
NES was awesome.

408
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Oh yeah.

409
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,820
Uh, the star Wars, super star Wars on super Nintendo was like some of the best platformers.

410
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,180
Both had a claim to these.

411
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Yeah.

412
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
I knew their shit.

413
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Yeah.

414
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
They did.

415
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
When it came to those games.

416
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
I mean, those games are on point actually.

417
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,620
Now that I think of it, claiming a ton of fucking awesome use all the Simpsons games.

418
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,860
I mean, those are just fantastic.

419
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Yeah.

420
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,300
Some of those Simpsons games really weren't bad.

421
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,380
Like they seriously knew how to take a franchise or your license and make a decent game out

422
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
of it.

423
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
But they had a few stinkers too.

424
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,580
I mean, they, they didn't, they didn't bat a hundred.

425
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:47,060
He did do a, the Barbie games, which, all right, um, all right, let's get into, uh,

426
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
our gaming weeks.

427
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,200
Cause we always like to, uh, towards the top of the show, establish our frame of reference

428
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,060
and where our heads are at this week by talking about what we have been playing this week

429
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
in video games.

430
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
Dark soccer.

431
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
How was your gaming week?

432
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:04,660
Well, um, I, I've actually hardly touched my DS except to do puzzles, you know, for

433
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
shoot pass.

434
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,700
Um, I played some final fantasy 14 yesterday, finally finished the rescue quest.

435
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:23,060
Now I don't get another quest until 49, which sucks cause I'm almost a 47, um, there, uh,

436
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,580
drew was at my, uh, uh, July 4th party.

437
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,060
I was like trying to say Friday something, but it was Friday, but it was also July 4th,

438
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,060
um, and brought over the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure game for PS3, which was pretty cool and about

439
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,340
as over the top as I expected.

440
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,860
Um, and you guys are kicking some classics on the 4th of July too.

441
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,420
We had some super Mario world going on and Julian was introduced to children's in time

442
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,460
and got frustrated in through the controller, which meant no more super Nintendo for him.

443
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
Right.

444
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,740
At least, at least they used to build the controllers to take a beating back then who,

445
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,700
which one of us didn't throw a super Nintendo controller back in the day?

446
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
He said it slipped.

447
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Of course.

448
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Of course.

449
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,780
I said slipped with a lot of force.

450
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,780
No.

451
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,420
So anyway, um, but yeah, he got introduced to turtles in time, which is like one of the

452
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,740
best games ever.

453
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,860
And I, uh, excuse me, I got, then you took a nap.

454
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
No, I'm sorry.

455
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,860
I got that adventure time game, the, because I don't know, oh, the, why are we in the dungeon?

456
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,380
How is that?

457
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,620
Let's do the dungeon because I don't know.

458
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,940
Um, I actually need to have my controller hooked up to play it.

459
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Let's explore the dungeon because I don't know.

460
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Oh, okay.

461
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Whatever.

462
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,220
Anyway, I've heard very mixed things on it and mostly negative, I gotta say.

463
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,420
It looks cute, but I haven't really gotten to play much of it.

464
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,180
Um, I, I have, I just found the controller to hook up to it.

465
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,940
I'm gonna try to play a little bit, but I have cosplays to work on, so no.

466
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
Fair enough.

467
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,620
I have blue balls on my desk.

468
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,620
Okay.

469
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
Hemispheres.

470
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,620
I have blue half balls.

471
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,340
You're going to have some vog balls next week at, or this coming weekend at GamerX to give

472
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
out.

473
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,980
I will, I will, uh, keep them close to my heart and then throw them out.

474
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Sounds good.

475
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
All right.

476
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,500
If that's it for your gaming week, let's check on Loki.

477
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
How was your gaming week?

478
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,220
Um, I didn't play a whole ton.

479
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:27,300
I did play, um, Mario Kart Wii because I did borrow that from you and, um, I tried to get

480
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
my son to play it.

481
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,420
Of course, he wanted to watch.

482
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I did.

483
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,420
Actually, he played it a little bit.

484
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,180
And to be clear, you're not talking Mario Kart 8, the newest one you're talking about

485
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
last year.

486
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Mario Kart Wii, yeah.

487
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:43,540
And, um, I tried using that Wii wheel, you know, like, I, at least I had him using it

488
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
and stuff.

489
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,820
That thing is fucking terrible.

490
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,700
I don't know why they'd ever try to do that control scheme.

491
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,380
It was just, it's god awful.

492
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,260
It's a little hokey, but they try, I guess, you know, kids really get into it.

493
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Like, they really get into it.

494
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,700
I understand that, but, like, it's super hard to play it that way.

495
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,340
Did you know that Mario Kart 8 will let you use, like, the Wii controller in the same

496
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
way?

497
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,220
Like, you can still use the wheel in Mario Kart 8, and you can use the gamepad screen

498
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,260
as, like, a giant controller, basically.

499
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Yeah, no thanks.

500
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,780
I don't need gyro controls for, you know, that type of game.

501
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,540
Again, I think it's kids versus adults.

502
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,060
Like, you and me, we want that precision that comes with the more, like, you know, tactile

503
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,700
response and feedback.

504
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,820
But I think for a kid, you know, who just spins the wheel everywhere and just watches

505
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,660
their car drive in circles, it's fine.

506
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:34,060
I'm actually interested in trying to, now that I've, you know, have that, since my system's

507
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,300
still modded, I'm trying to actually, to load in the custom tracks that people have made.

508
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,500
I've actually watched some videos of it, although a lot of those custom tracks aren't very good

509
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,640
that people have made, but it's still interesting that you can do that.

510
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,940
And there's even tracks in there that I forgot were in there, and so it was, I don't know,

511
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,100
it was kind of fun.

512
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,100
I don't know, I still like, I do like how they had the Mii integration stuff in there,

513
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,660
where your Miis are in the background, so I kept pointing out to them, like, well look,

514
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,420
see, you know, there's mommy in the background right there, you know, she's driving that

515
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,500
car and, you know, there I am right there.

516
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,980
So that was kind of fun.

517
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,060
And then really, that was, that's all I played this week, because I was, you know, working

518
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,180
on game stuff.

519
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,860
Once again, now I'm trying to still skim by with, you know, just learning a few things,

520
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,980
but it's like forcing me not to.

521
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,840
So I started learning how to write shaders, which, you know, that's basically the language

522
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:40,180
that you use for telling how to draw stuff on the screen, so you can have, like, reflections

523
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,180
and all that fun stuff.

524
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,240
And when I hear, like, shaders, it makes me think about, like, drawing the shade and those

525
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,860
sorts of, like, yeah.

526
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:52,220
It's working with, like, you know, lighting and stuff like that, so I'm making a really

527
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,180
custom shader for what I need it to do.

528
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,480
So I've been trying to figure that out, and originally I was gonna, you know, cut corners

529
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,740
and do it as a surface shader, because that's, the language is very, it's high level, so

530
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
it's really easy.

531
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,780
You just put, like, you know, lighting on, diffuse, yes, you know, and that, you know,

532
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
just really simple stuff.

533
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,280
But I can't, I have to do it as a vertex and fragment shader.

534
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:23,560
So I have to learn everything to actually do it instead of just skimming, you know.

535
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,720
So once again, I went through the whole surface thing, and I kind of learned how to do that,

536
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
and then I went back, because I had actually started doing the vertex fragment stuff first,

537
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,040
and I was like, I don't get this.

538
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,560
And then I went back to it, and I kind of understand it a little bit more now.

539
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,040
And now I'm actually trying to write it as I'm kind of watching the tutorial series,

540
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,960
and it's helping.

541
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,020
So I kind of understand why things are being done in certain ways and stuff.

542
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,780
So I'm hopefully gonna get that done, and then, once again, the goal is to create assets

543
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,480
so I can keep moving on with the game.

544
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,800
But at the same time, I'm kind of learning how to do interesting things, and once again,

545
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,880
I came up with some really high concept, you know, idea of something I could implement

546
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
in there.

547
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm like, I don't really need to do this, but that would be so cool if I could.

548
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,440
And so, we'll see, I don't know.

549
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,280
Well good for you for still sticking with it.

550
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Yeah.

551
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,440
Have more time, so.

552
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,040
I imagine at some point we should probably address something you've been tweeting about

553
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,980
this week as well.

554
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,240
You found out this week that a lot of your news and information you've talked about on

555
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,360
this show has come through.

556
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,680
You know, your work, you work in gaming distribution and so forth, but this week.

557
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:40,860
This week, we found out, see, here's the thing, it's funny, because we were told one thing,

558
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,820
they put out a press release saying another thing, and you know, I think they were trying

559
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,820
to spin it so that it wouldn't seem so bad on the one company, but basically what happened

560
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,940
is the owner of the company, he wants to get out.

561
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:00,380
He's been doing it for 30 plus years, and he's not young, you know, and he wants to

562
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,660
sell the company and just kind of move on, and the company's not as profitable as it

563
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,540
used to be, and it's kind of just like treading water, so he's gonna get out.

564
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:14,800
So he sold it to the next biggest competitor, which is Ingram Entertainment.

565
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,500
So they're gonna buy it, but they're doing it as an assets person, which means that they're

566
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,980
buying the assets of the company.

567
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:29,580
They're buying the customer lists, and they're buying the inventory and whatever else, you

568
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,740
know, that kind of stuff.

569
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,560
So not the employees, but they're having everybody stay on until the end of September to help

570
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,000
transition all the customers over to the, you know, the new company and just to kind

571
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
of smooth that stuff around.

572
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,760
So you can quit now if you want, but you don't get a severance, and if you stay on, you get

573
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,220
a severance, and the way they spent the press releases, they're like, yeah, you know, there

574
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,640
may be some layoffs, but you know, or there may be some layoffs, they said, but it's really

575
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,460
from what we were told, it's everybody, maybe there might be a few people.

576
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,900
It sounds like if you wanted to stay, you'd have to relocate to Tennessee or wherever

577
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
these guys are located.

578
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
I don't even know.

579
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Yeah.

580
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,580
And they have, like, their main business, Ingram, is beer distribution.

581
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,780
That's where they make a lot of their money, is alcohol distribution stuff, because they

582
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,480
do a lot more than just entertainment stuff.

583
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,580
They do, you know, alcohol, I think they do music, books, you know, all sorts of stuff.

584
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Alcohol.

585
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Tell me more.

586
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,140
And they also do, like, they sell to different customers than we did.

587
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,360
Like, they do grocery store, which, you know, usually has high returns, and we didn't mess

588
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,700
with it.

589
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:45,700
So I don't know, it's like, so, you know, I was kind of looking to get out of the company

590
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,180
anyways, because it was kind of just a dead end, it seemed like, and now kind of just

591
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,180
have more motivation to do that, because I have really no choice in three months.

592
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,420
But at the same time, it's a little bit of a relief, you know, and but for everybody

593
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,260
else, so they're, like, really bummed out and crying, but I'm just like, for me, it's

594
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,180
like a whole lot less stress, because I'm like, wow, I actually don't need to worry

595
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,340
about order forms that are in December, because I'm never gonna, I don't have to do that,

596
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,740
you know, I don't have to worry about getting this done, because it's not.

597
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,260
I'm glad you're spinning what can kind of be a crappy thing, like layoffs kind of into

598
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,660
the positive, and yeah, you're a smart guy, you're gonna turn out just fine.

599
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,180
If anybody out there listening might have some leads for Loki, email the show.

600
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,860
Well, it's just gonna be tough, because I haven't interviewed, I mean, I've been there

601
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,820
for 14 and a half years, so I haven't interviewed in 14 and a half years, so, you know.

602
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,980
Now's the time to start researching with that and all that, so practice, practice, practice.

603
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,660
All right, well, good luck to you, Loki.

604
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm sure you will be just fine.

605
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,280
Which means, though, in the meantime, though, I will be bringing that cabinet over at some

606
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,820
point, because I can't stay there.

607
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
I can't stay there now.

608
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:59,100
You wouldn't happen to want a framed poster of True Crime New York that's signed by the

609
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
entire cast.

610
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,940
I don't know where we could give it away.

611
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Maybe a listener wants it.

612
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
We can give it away.

613
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
There you go.

614
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
All right.

615
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,940
And a lot of kind words there from our chat over at live.vognetware.com.

616
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,880
Dungeon Buster says, good luck, I'm sure you'll land on your feet somewhere.

617
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
So you will.

618
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
All right.

619
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,860
On to my gaming week, and the types of games I've been playing this week.

620
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,460
I've kind of been all over the map.

621
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,580
For MMOs, I've still been continuing on both Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, which

622
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,340
I talked already about XI a little bit and my resurgence with that last week.

623
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,980
I got my Corsair up to level 37, I think, and I'm doing my rank commissions right now.

624
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,580
So if you've ever played the game, you know that at one point in the game, you have to

625
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:46,460
travel to all the different cities and kill a dragon boss is the big thing to do.

626
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,460
That's kind of where I'm at.

627
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,460
I forgot about that.

628
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,060
It's so much easier now though, because once you go to a city, once you activate the telepoint

629
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,580
and now you can work to that telepoint, whatever you want for 500 gil.

630
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,060
It works like it doesn't.

631
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,980
So I made the trek to Windhurst on the boat and everything one time, and now I don't ever

632
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,420
have to do it again because I can just work on the telepoint.

633
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,420
Aw man.

634
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Aw man.

635
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
Aw man.

636
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,420
Aw man.

637
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
Aw man.

638
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Aw man.

639
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,420
Aw man.

640
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Aw man.

641
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
Aw man.

642
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
Aw man.

643
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Aw man.

644
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,420
Aw man.

645
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,420
Aw man.

646
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Aw man.

647
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,580
ig

648
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,520
just gonna live in the guild house forever our guild house is pretty sweet i gotta say

649
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,780
if you happened to be on uh midgar summer on virus c14 you should look us up have fun

650
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,520
with us darn what do you do in the guild house can you actually arrange stuff in there and

651
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
parties

652
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,340
guild officers and and the like shane is the guild leader he can designate people who can rearrange the furniture and i know i'm

653
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,000
Allen and this guy zach

654
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
that plays with us have both been very big on like

655
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:06,200
arranging the house and putting everything in and you can actually build a lot of the furniture through crafting and some of it takes rare

656
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,920
materials that you can only get from certain bosses they're like rare drops from bosses for example crystal tower which is the big 24 man raid

657
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,600
in the game right now has a chance to drop an item that you turn into these glowing sword

658
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,680
arches that you put out in front of your house so i think that's a really clever little way

659
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,920
to incorporate the housing with the rest of the game is that you know the better you are

660
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,960
at farming certain items that can actually go into your house i'm really looking forward

661
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,920
to some of the pvp they're building it in the new patch because right now the only pvp

662
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,580
they have in the game is called wolves den which is just an arena style pvp it's four

663
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,380
versus four kill or be killed that's it just straight up you know arena play but now what

664
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,060
they're putting in in the patch they're gonna put front lines is what it's called and for

665
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,260
those that have played wow it sounds a lot like arathi basin and it's basically king

666
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,200
of the hill with the several different hills like you try to control the nodes for as long

667
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,560
as you can but here's the thing because there's no factions in 14 you know world of warcraft

668
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,420
has horde versus alliance star wars the old republic has you know the force and you know

669
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,060
the dark side and all that you know it has all the most games they don't do it like they

670
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,060
did in 11 where it's the starting you well there is that but keep in mind that in final

671
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,660
fantasy 14 that doesn't mean like usually in games you can't talk to people on the other

672
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,260
faction you can't party with them you can't work with them but in final fantasy 11 and

673
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:32,360
final fantasy 14 you can you do pledge allegiance to a nation um but you you aren't like like

674
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,380
bound to them for all your interactions and things you can still do things with other

675
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,540
people but it does sound like in this battlegrounds it is gonna be representing the nation they

676
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,780
haven't really said yet if you can rally for another nation or how you're gonna play with

677
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,100
your friends i guess we'll know more about that on tuesday when the patch hits but it's

678
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:57,260
going to be 24 versus 24 versus 24 72 player battlegrounds it's gonna be a cluster fuck

679
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:03,020
i can't wait i'm surprised you haven't tried to put was it ballista in there i don't even

680
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,140
remember what the point of that was ballista was the whole thing where you were trying

681
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,820
when you would kill things you'd get the rooks or something you get the the feathers that you

682
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,340
throw at the roof i don't know it's weird anyway uh okay enough mmos because there's been other

683
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,780
stuff as well um okay so steam had a big sale this weekend i'm not talking about the summer

684
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,580
sale man i know that was a big deal but this weekend i'm supposing in the honor of fourth

685
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,620
of july which by the way i hope you all had a happy fourth uh in the honor of fourth of july

686
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:34,900
they had duke nukem 3d the remake on sale for like 250 so i was like sold i gotta get this so

687
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,420
i played some duke nukem 3d i was playing through the first um and it's it they did they redid the

688
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,660
textures and it's so it's a little more hd but it still has that look and you can play the classic

689
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,220
like if you don't want to play the new one you can play the classic but i think the new one retains

690
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:55,740
that feel of the classic but yet you know works right and widescreen looks a little sharper and

691
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,180
on my computer which you guys know i upgraded my computer like four months ago blazing frames a

692
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:09,180
second boy i love it so it's just fast fast fast so much fun i need the um they need to get it so

693
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:14,620
i have somebody to play more i do have it i have it already we've got to set up a multiplayer night

694
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,780
because i i got it for the whole reason i got it is because they're saying that eventually they

695
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,500
were gonna have multiplayer there and then they added it yeah so i do have it in fact i'm checking

696
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,140
right now just to make sure um this has got to happen because i i want to play multiplayer so

697
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:36,100
bad and like i could play with strangers and the lobbies and stuff but um it's been a long time

698
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,820
i haven't played since high school that was my that was my college that was freshman year in

699
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:47,780
college in the dorms that was my game like i used to i used to build the crap out of those um let's

700
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:52,860
see duke nukem forever duke nukem 3d megaton edition so yes i do have that all right awesome

701
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,820
and then now one other game i'll give a quick shout out to is an iphone game believe it or not

702
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,260
but uh you know these guys nimblebit they make a lot of the really addicting iphone games like

703
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:08,820
tiny tower and oh god what else did they make the um uh airplane the pocket planes is that what it

704
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,300
is so they have a new one out it's called disco zoo oh my god and uh this is something one of my

705
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,740
friends was visiting this weekend and and she told me you've got to check out disco zoo and so i i

706
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,100
downloaded and checked it out and it's got you know unfortunately it has all the tropes of your

707
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:32,180
classic free to play iphone game like you try to find the hidden animals in a little puzzle

708
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,980
so like you have like 10 clicks in the puzzle to find the animals but let's say you don't totally

709
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,700
reveal the animal you get like three fourths of it a little thing will come up and say if you want

710
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,460
five more guesses you can either pay the one real world dollar or you can watch a quick video for

711
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,820
15 seconds and i'm just like ah but the game itself is really addicting and it has all that

712
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,260
cute stuff or like the you know the art style is very you know retro and the little people in the

713
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,660
zoo say things that are really funny if you look out for them like a bunch of memes everywhere

714
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:08,980
like in the pig pig exhibit there's a little guy that'll say that'll do pig and let's be honest

715
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:17,220
here you know given that's yeah i understand it's monetization but that's not so bad 15 seconds of

716
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,380
my time it is i i hit the button and i put the phone down and go do something else real quick

717
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:27,380
and then come back and yeah that's that's doable yeah it's it's totally doable so you know a nimble

718
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,100
bit does a really interesting job of kind of walking the line there on the it is free so i

719
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:38,340
mean you know whatever it is um but you know it's so easy to spend 99 cents to get your disco bucks

720
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,700
so so why is it called disco zoo this is the most so the big trick you know how in tiny tower you

721
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,940
have to like restock your stores so in the zoo you have to wake up your animals so you like your

722
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,940
animals will be awake for 20 minutes or whatever then you have to go wake them up but if you want

723
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,020
to get them to stay awake you can spend your disco dollar to throw a disco party and the disco party

724
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:05,700
will keep them awake and then of course it plays this really stupid eight-bit retro disco music

725
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,460
but then all the lights light up and if you have like uh trophies in your uh zoo pen or whatever

726
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:17,940
they'll light up and use all the animals start dancing it's really ridiculous but like who

727
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:25,380
doesn't love the idea of a disco zoo hello so anyway who doesn't like it rob the animals

728
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:32,340
let the cows sleep oh oh i can't i and that's the best part i can't wait for peta's response

729
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,060
i will say though you know it's the game does have like unicorns and shit in it that you can

730
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,340
have your zoo so you know there's is the unicorn shit rainbow i haven't checked yet but the

731
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:52,500
unicorns can wear fezzes you can get your animals i guess anyway all right look i'm gonna stop

732
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,580
pimping a game that they're not paying me to promote i just will say as far as mobile phone

733
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,900
games goes nimblebit tends to put out pretty quality stuff and this is just another one in

734
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:06,660
their little uh archive but beware of the temptation of monetization uh because that is

735
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:13,860
what it is all about right all right uh that's it for my gaming week let's do uh quick housekeeping

736
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:18,740
and then we'll get to the news tonight housekeeping very important update there will be no live orange

737
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:24,500
lounge radio next week we will not be here live in seven days very sorry guys but as you probably

746
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,540
have it memorized but she does all the videos um the very um the ones that make you think anita

747
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:19,620
sarkeesian is that her name yeah the tropes versus women yes yes yes she her panels at the same time

748

749
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:33,060
little smaller side rooms podcast cross zone uh ourselves uh game bar uh game buoy dot org

750
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,260

751
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,500
a video game realness is there in spirit sadly they couldn't send anybody from canada

752
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,460
uh to come to the show uh but yeah we will all god why i always have the sinking feeling i'm

753
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,660
leaving somebody out i i am i apologize because i'm doing this off spur of the moment but um

754
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,020
we will all be there uh and uh talking about podcasting so if you want to come say hi and

755
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,420
learn a little bit about the art of podcasting how we do it the tech end of things uh come say

756
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,780
hi saturday at two o'clock if you're not able to come to gamer x um look for the uh archive of the

757
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,580
panel i'm sure will be on some of the feeds of the shows i just mentioned uh it'll also be up on

758
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:23,300
youtube eventually if last year is any indication so uh wait for that um also uh i should speaking

759
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:29,700
of panels and the like uh dragon con 2014 is happening uh and vog will have another panel

760
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:35,460
tentatively monday morning is uh when the vog panel will be uh more information to come on

761
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,580
that later but uh uh bobby and i making at least the two of us making appearances on a couple other

762
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:46,340
panels throughout the show i know travis donovan is going i believe john from critical myths said

763
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:51,700
he's going and i know some of his co-hosts also go to the show uh i think this is the year the

764
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,540
guys from British invaders make it out too so there'll be quite a representation from the voice

765
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:01,460
geez network at dragon con this year um so we will definitely think of a meetup something

766
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,140
something especially if some of you guys are going to be there in atlanta over labor day weekend so

767
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,260
a couple chances to catch us at various conventions um but sadly that means no olr this weekend and no

768
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:16,900
olr labor day weekend because you know conventions will uh take precedence uh on the podcast feed we

769
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,100
may or may not have something i would hope that maybe we can tape a little something something at

770
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:28,260
gamer x with maybe some of our friends so you may see something on the feed uh a little later

771
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,580
than usual i just hate to go a whole week without content on the feed i know it happens sometimes

772
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,740
though but i know some of your monday morning listeners really rely on us to get you through

773
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,340
your work day or your commute so we're gonna we're gonna try and have something for you even if the

774
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,940
best of but uh please forgive us if we do take the week off completely use the opportunity to visit

775
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,740
another fantastic independent podcast um because you know all these indie producers they work hard

776
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:56,820
at what they do so if you can't listen to us this next week listen to somebody else uh that uh that

777
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,300
loves to uh do this for free every week all right um let's get into some gaming news shall we

778
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,020
it's that time loki start us off all right let's uh let's talk a little bit about

779
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:16,340
um this is kind of interesting now we talked about this before lindsay lohan and had some

780
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,980
issues with certain characters or a certain character in grand theft five she thought hey

781
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:27,540
it's based off me i mean the character lazy jones is kind of i wouldn't say it's based exactly on

782
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:34,260
lindsay lohan but it's like you know the typical hollywood you know actress that's kind of

783
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,860
falling off the deep end you know getting into drugs and all the scandals and that kind of stuff

784
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,260
but now she's taking it further besides saying that this character is based off her she's

785
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:52,500
actually suing rockstar games saying that this character is you know basically just a complete

786
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:59,460
rip off of you know her personality her persona and she feels that she should be compensated for

787
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:07,700
it which it's parody stupid so i don't think she's gonna get any money but hey it's free advertising

788
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:13,220
there's a lot of people like uh this story by the way so here's a fun fact about me i bet you

789
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:20,340
would never guess i listen to conservative talk radio i do i do i i like to listen to how the

790
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:25,060
other side thinks that's kind of like you know i'm all about educating and listening to all

791
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,740
different angles right so and in this town there's really no other choice if you're going to listen

792
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,060
to talk radio on the drive to work if you want to hear how the traffic's going to be the reason why

793
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:38,500
i bring that up they do the news while i'm on my way to work you know all morning long this came up

794
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,540
on the drive to work and on the drive home they mentioned it that lindsey low hand was suing

795
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:49,140
grand theft auto 5 and i was just like okay so if this you know radio station is talking about it

796
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:55,460
then everybody's talking about this well she's basically saying okay that you know the character

797
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:02,900
in the game uh depicts her voice image and person personal style also that you know it's an in-game

798
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,500
they have an in-game spoof of the chateau mamont in west hollywood i guess where she lived for

799
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:14,260
several months and basically saying that lacy jones is a reference to low hand and the suit

800
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,820
claiming you know they want unspecified damages more like that they know that the game you know

801
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:25,620
made a billion dollars yeah 11 billion dollars they want some of that money it's good luck i

802
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:32,580
mean but i i just don't see how um you know they didn't call her lindsey low hand she doesn't look

803
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:38,820
like lindsey low hand it's just i don't know it good luck i just don't think that they're gonna

804
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:44,260
win i mean better people have tried guys you don't our chat room over at live.vog network.com says i

805
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,060
thought you could parody a person as long as you don't use their real or show name and complete

806
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:54,980
likeness well even in some cases though you can like remember in uh mba jam uh way back in the

807
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,300
day you had the codes where you could unlock like political figures in the game but i believe i

808
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,820
believe it's different when it comes to political parody and things like that like i think you can

809
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,980
use likeness and so forth but i'm just saying like the whole parody of real people is certainly not

810
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,180
new to video games it's in the same stuff happens on tv shows where you know you have like you know

811
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,660
your criminal you know dramas and stuff like that like law and order and stuff they'll parody

812
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:24,980
news um you know events and stuff like that to come up with their plot lines for certain shows

813
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,460
and you know the characters you'll see oh okay that that's supposed to be like a michael jackson

814
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,740
type character or oh that's supposed to be you know this type of person but it's not really them

815
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,940
it's different in this it's a similar scenario so you kind of catch the reference but it's not

816
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:47,220
it's not like directly saying you know oh this is lindsey this is uh minzy mohan and you know

817
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:54,500
uh you know it's not that you know direct i guess do you know what this reminds me of do you remember

818
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,500
a few years ago and i know we brought this up on olr because we were talking exclusively about

819
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,300
music games for a while but do you remember when the uh lead singer of delight the band that did

820
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,020
grooves in the heart like the epic 90s dance anthem right remember lady miscure who fronted

821
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:15,060
that band she sued sega for space channel five because of ullala's likeness to her or whatever

822
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,460
it was but there it was a little more rooted i don't know why like my mind goes to that but i

823
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,260
believe they settled i think she did get money out of that like i don't think they approached

824
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,980
her first for the role yeah that was that was the big difference too is that sega had actually

825
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,020
gone to her but i don't they obviously they approached lindsey lohan for anything and i

826
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:42,500
i just don't see to see them doing anything that she's not gonna get any money no but but yet now

827
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:48,260
every talk radio and you know buzz station in america is talking about lindsey lohan again it's

828
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:52,980
great it's great publicity since they have you know with the pc and uh you know ps4 xbox one

829
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,580
versions coming out i knew okay i knew he would show up the minute i invoked her name because

830
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:04,820
my partner alan huge fan of lady miscure right yes so what do you i know you got to say something

831
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,220
on this what happened set me straight the thing that gave miss lady cure the edge is that sega

832
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,580
had approached her about making a game and they pitched the game to her and she turned it down

833
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:19,140
and they made the game anyway so they talked to her like she had receipts to be fair jamie brought

834
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,660
that point up but you might not have heard it before you stormed in here yeah i'm sorry

835
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:31,780
it's the feed delay that's all right but yet you you still used to do you think that ullala was

836
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,580
i mean knowing because i think most people look at lady miscure and go you know they don't really

837
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,660
know her because they only know her from the one song but you followed her a little more in that

838
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:47,940
era uh so do you think that she had a point like was ullala a lot like her so all i'm gonna say

839
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,700
is that i imported that game from japan the week it came out for my modded dreamcast and i think

840
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:59,780
it was egm or one of the big gaming mags at the time that showed a preview of it of coming out

841
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:07,220
in on the dreamcast in japan and this this was what 90 99 2000 so ign looked like a really nice

842
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,860
geo city site there was the internet wasn't what it was and you couldn't like stream gameplay

843
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:18,020
videos and all that when i saw that game i was like they made a delight game that's lady

844
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,660
miscare without any i had no idea about that sega approached her i i just thought this was this

845
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,060
random thing that they put out i got that game because i thought it was a lady miscare game i'm

846
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,540
not even kidding that is so funny because i remember when this story came up on olr

847
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,500
five years ago or whenever it was that she sued we all looked at looked at it and went this bitch

848
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,060
crazy she don't have a case but yet we didn't know at that time that angle that that sega had

849
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,860
actually approached her or whatever you know and so so it ended up that they did have a point so

850
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:51,140
the the fact that it was a music game and i was really into para and all that and the whole 60s

851
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:58,900
mod sort of laughing gogo dancer futuristic um that style looked really interesting but when i

852
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,940
saw the character and how she danced i was like that this is delight the video game this is a

853
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:09,380
groove groove is in the heart video or music video the video game and that was just something that i

854
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:16,660
came up with from looking at the magazine footage there was ironic that yet in despite that lawsuit

855
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,780
then michael jackson really did turn up in space channel 5 part 2 space michael because he loves

856
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,780
sega he had a relationship with sega with sonic 3 the music but he just took his name off of it

857
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,980
because he didn't like how the synth sounded yeah yeah uh really quick before you go um what do you

858
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,740
think you know that this all being said revisiting the hot stories from five years ago what do you

859
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,540
think of this whole lindsay lohan versus grand theft auto 5 thing i know that she hasn't been

860
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,900
able to work much in hollywood because she's uninsurable and apparently she's been clean for

861
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,020
a couple years like one or two years i think well but even in our chat room live.vogniteware.com

862
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,300
nemesis 47 saying lindsay's show on oprah canceled because she couldn't stay away from the booze or

863
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:01,380
the drugs yeah i heard that the reality show was rough so she okay i was gonna say that being the

864
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,860
overly litigants to try to get money for the work that you're not getting because you're

865
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,100
an addict is something that an addict would do and i would think that if she

866
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:16,100
was clean and had good people around her they would maybe say um maybe you shouldn't do this

867
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,260
but the fact that she's suing is a weird sign because i think if you go back her and her mom

868
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,260
used to try to sue everybody because they needed money she's broke because she can't she can't work

869
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:31,620
so it's unfortunate if that's what happened all right well thanks for storming in here bye hey

870
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,860
wait wait before you run any any other thoughts for the listeners excited for gamer acts next

871
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:41,300
week anything you wanna say no just excited for the con and take lots of pictures i don't have a

872
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,740
3ds so i don't know what i'm gonna do in the lobby when we're waiting for people because everyone's

873
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:49,540
everyone's doing street passing and on their 3ds maybe you can borrow shane's yeah try to borrow

874
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:56,180
one of shane's there you go that works all right thank you alan for jumping in appreciate it uh

875
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:01,540
go to our chat i'm over at live dot vog network dot com uh kai judo says ullala looks nothing like

876
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:06,820
delight uh delight didn't invent the dance every e trip and chick was doing those dances back then

877
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,620
keep in mind though a big difference between delight the band and uh lady miss cure who

878
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,620
fronted it some of the members of delight went on to do other things too from what i recall like

879
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,820
tawa tay was one of the members of delight and he he does like or at least he did in the late 90s

880
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:26,100
early 2000s like he remixed every big pop song had like a tawa tay remix so i know uh i know that was

881
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,420
part of it uh dungeon buster says when the lawsuit broke i still didn't see her in the game and fifth

882
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,980
dream says i thought of her when i saw ullala long ago before i ever knew about a lawsuit very

883
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,780
interesting how some people see it some people don't and i guess to bring it back to current news

884
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,540
the same could be said about this whole lindsey lohan thing some people see it but they didn't

885
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:49,060
i don't think they approached her about anything i mean no because clearly parody yeah so good luck

886
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,820
well and grand theft auto kind of does a lot of parody the whole thing is parody yeah yeah i just

887
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:02,500
she's just great it's it's just a you know an attempt to get money and here we are she's she

888
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,620
knows she doesn't have a case she's hoping for a settlement all right lindsey you're just never

889
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:15,140
gonna be better than mean girls and it makes me so sad you know who will ensure probably for work

890
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:25,540
the porn industry anyway all right uh let's move on with some more news oops except i was very

891
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:30,340
ill-prepared and i don't have my story up jamie can we go to your story next sorry yeah there was

892
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:38,660
some um i would like to say that this is a a good turnaround i was very happy with this but there

893
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:44,500
was something going on with the iesf the international e-sports foundation or sorry federation where

894
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:50,180
there was a hearthstone tournament that they were going to have um be male only there was and they

895
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,460
had male only and female only divisions but there hadn't had anything planned for the female only and

896
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:01,060
weren't going to include anything for the male only they have sensed um and i know that everybody

897
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,340
knows about this bobby talked about it it's been all over the the facebooks and the the medias of

898
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:13,860
socialness but they've turned around this decision and are having an all-inclusive uh a division and

899
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:21,460
a women's division so basically um it's open for all they're going to be letting uh anyone of any

900
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:26,900
gender participate in the hearthstone competition and it sounds like anything uh going forward

901
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:34,820
i had remembered seeing something about that they were maintaining it as male only so that

902
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,140
and this i don't know if this was something just from one of the feminist forums i read or what

903
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,100
but that they didn't want a conflict when a man got defeated by a woman

904
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:55,060
and i'm like dude suck it up she's better than you deal with it i'm not saying this excuses it

905
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:00,580
but could it possibly explain it dark sakura because when i first saw this story i was like

906
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:05,540
this is a cultural thing right there's there's there's you know because obviously feminism

907
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:10,500
although we we have a way to go in this country we're still more progressed than a lot of other

908
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,580
places and so when i first saw this article i thought maybe cultural differences were coming

909
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:19,060
into play do you think that that was part of it it doesn't really matter misogyny is misogyny well

910
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:26,020
no no i understand that but i mean it's also kind of i don't know like uh how do i word this

911
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:33,940
it might be really hard to tell an entire country to change their culture overnight even though we

912
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:40,820
all look at it and we say this needs to happen the reality is change doesn't happen overnight

913
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:45,540
change doesn't happen overnight unfortunately so then what about the olympics in russia

914
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:53,380
were they supposed to make everybody adhere to strict uh you know cisgender

915
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,620
you know heterosexual relationships in public

916
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,260
were they supposed to enforce that on everybody else again it's very important i'm not saying

917
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:10,100
i support their culture i think this is silly that's how i'm equating it yeah you know okay

918
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:16,260
you have an international event you're supposed to accommodate all cultures yeah and the biggest

919
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:23,380
thing is basically being inclusive for everybody especially since they were like oh well we we

920
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:29,860
support this we you know we support women in games we need more than act like it you know

921
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:35,060
screw those guys i don't care if they you know me this is me saying this on a personal level

922
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:42,100
okay so what if a guy loses to a woman boo freaking who yeah no i agree with that women are

923
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:47,220
better than some you know it doesn't even matter it's not all women are better than this than guys

924
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:52,180
or all guys are better than women this it's some women are better the thing that i had a hard time

925
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,940
wrapping my head around and it's just again and again it kind of made me go is this like a cultural

926
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:02,180
thing i don't get or whatever is that they had this separate contest for women in like like only

927
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,500
women were able to do the tech and tag tournament contest and like that even wasn't something that

928
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:11,460
was open to men and i thought that was weird because i was just like well but it that's a

929
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,420
fighting game and this is a fighting game why does it have to be i mean it just it didn't make

930
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,140
any sense to me and i was like is there like a cultural thing where women play more tekken than

931
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:31,380
guys and i'm like totally missing it i i think that for um some some cases having the the

932
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:37,220
women's division and this is what my thought was with this that it was more like throwing a bone

933
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:42,980
you know basically oh here's something to keep you quiet because i mean how many different male

934
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:49,540
dominated fighting game tournaments have there been across the world as opposed you know how

935
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:57,220
many women show up to some of these events and report on being harassed yeah or you know flat out

936
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:06,020
being um assaulted at some of these events what can we understanding that it's going to be very

937
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,500
difficult to make something change overnight because a lot of rights issues unfortunately

938
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:17,940
take generations to change i mean like look begins at home it okay so excellent where we're how do we

939
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:25,460
how do we fix this how do we stop this crap where i mean i i think it is ridiculous that women get

940
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,740
harassed at these things and there needs to be more of a social check and balance where there

941
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:36,020
needs to be more guys out there that are willing to step up and say hey not okay to like another

942
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:40,740
guy because guys do this usually to impress other guys at least that was always a feeling i get

943
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,580
growing up when i'm being bullied or whatever is that people would bully me because they're trying

944
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:50,420
to impress their friends well it's also the infliction of of particular gender roles and

945
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:57,060
gender behaviors on people that you know if a guy shows weakness or you know any type of emotional

946
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:03,780
vulnerability then he's you know a quote a sissy or there's something wrong with him for you know

947
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:10,580
being having emotions for being human right or that if a guy doesn't you know pursue you know

948
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:17,860
pursue and get the woman that there's something wrong with him you know meanwhile women are taught

949
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:22,660
you know from a young age if you get a compliment you don't say thank you you go oh no no no you're

950
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:27,220
you're supposed to dismiss it like you're not worthy or that you've been given a great favor

951
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:34,340
by some person thinking that you're pretty you know forget that you know i might be a great

952
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:42,740
writer or that i have all these skills no it's pretty i don't want someone i would rather be

953
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:49,780
called smart and thoughtful than be told i'm pretty i would rather be told i'm strong or that

954
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:55,620
i can go to the gym and lift weights in the guys section and not be a novelty then be told i'm

955
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:04,900
pretty you know i think you're pretty pretty awesome thank you i know thanks but i mean the

956
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:12,660
same thing is that the the and and i mean this is yeah i'm going outside of the whole uh you know

957
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:20,820
video game tournament thing you soapboxing on this show never what go for it but i mean i think that

958
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:26,900
the tournament's just a symptom the the fact well yeah i mean that's why i was saying it was

959
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,380
this is this is something this is a bigger cultural issue the fact that the press had

960
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,780
to check them on this to get them to change their mind is what was sad it shouldn't have

961
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:41,620
been an issue to begin with it should have not even occurred to them that they would have

962
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:48,660
anything that was un-inclusive but again i mean i i hate to harp on this but again that is is that

963
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:53,060
a finland way of life versus i don't know i don't live in finland i don't

964
00:59:53,060 --> 01:00:00,020
no i'm not i'm not saying it's okay but it is interesting how you know this cultural thing over

965
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:06,340
here goes viral over here and blizzard has to step in and be the ones that fixes it which i

966
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:10,340
will say in this situation i think blizzard deserves the kudos because they're the ones

967
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,940
that put their foot down and said hey i don't care who you are or where you're from if you're

968
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:19,220
gonna use our game this is not okay well like i was saying before i don't think it really matters

969
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:24,500
so much that it's finland that the decision was coming out of finland i think it's if you know

970
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:31,540
you have an international community you go by international standards meaning you be inclusive

971
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:38,660
you don't do things that are gonna offend the people that you are hosting okay i have to play

972
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:42,340
devil's advocate here though just just just to be fair because when we talk about international

973
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,940
you brought up the olympics earlier and doesn't the olympics separate every sport in men's and

974
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:56,340
women's not every i think i think that they're i mean there are they there's definitely some that

975
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:04,020
are co-op but i think that they um there was some drama coming up about that because i honestly

976
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:10,340
i believe that if you're gonna segregate those it should be by like weight class

977
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:17,860
yeah i i mean i kind of get the separation a little more when it's i don't know it's

978
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:22,660
it's a tough issue because like i kind of get it from a like olympic sport style standpoint

979
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:28,100
because it's just the fact of the matter is men are statistically going to be this average women

980
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:33,380
are statistically going to be this average so i from a physical but hearthstone is overthinking

981
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,860
this is hearthstone yeah exactly hearthstone isn't that that's my point at the end of the day

982
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,660
hearthstone and esports in general are not physical competitions in those way and you

983
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:47,540
could argue me and say oh but it's physical because the hand-eye coordination or it's

984
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:52,980
physical okay whatever so what if some guy gets butt hurt i don't care it's not physical in the

985
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:58,660
way that you know agility average or weight average but but you know you're also right

986
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:05,540
there's that there's a lot of women built like men a lot of men look like women here's one of

987
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:11,060
my examples and i know this is stupid but look back to wrestling in the 90s when you had china

988
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:16,820
did she wrestle in the women's category no she wrestled with the men because she was built like

989
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:23,300
one of the guys i mean she did take testosterone for a while for weightlifting i mean she well i

990
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:30,340
mean not testosterone she was taking just the the anabolic steroids but still um i know that's

991
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:34,420
a dumb example but that's one of them but you know and at the same time with me saying that

992
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:39,620
i don't care if you know some guy gets butt hurt if a girl beats him on the same token i think that

993
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,300
if a girl is beaten by a guy she needs to be gracious and just acknowledge that he beat her

994
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,940
fair and square has nothing to do with their gender uh bobby blackwolf in our chatter live

995
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:52,660
dog network com says there are some mixed competitions pairs figure skating for instance

996
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:57,540
uh and there are mixed doubles tennis but i can't think of where you have just a man competing

997
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:03,780
against just a woman in the olympics uh ballroom dancing was once an olympic event too a test event

998
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,500
that never went anywhere well you know and i don't i think on our our little podcast we're not

999
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:12,500
going to be able to solve this issue very easily this is something that you know this is obviously

1000
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:19,380
a much bigger issue but i think this is something that is going to be a generation as we shift into

1001
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,980
another you know this this generation where you have a lot of like moms and dads like you know

1002
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:30,180
folks like loki right raising his kids loki was raised on video games and so that's going to be

1003
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:35,460
a part of the culture that he hands down to his kids and what i mean with that is that e-sports

1004
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:41,140
as it becomes more and more mainstream that's going to become a part of culture too and i think

1005
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:46,740
as these stuff mature as these things get more social acceptance then i think a lot more of these

1006
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:52,580
bigger difficult questions are going to have to be tackled as to why do we separate these genders

1007
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,340
should we separate these genders is this a good idea my other thought is that i

1008
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:02,580
in the realm of public sports like actual physical sports i would still like to see things divided by

1009
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:10,260
weight class or by ability class or by a particular level like that because and um because not only do

1010
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:16,260
you have the genders that people are born with but you have people sure who are transgender sure

1011
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:24,020
meaning or even identify as gender neutral or true or z or and and this is going to be kind

1012
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:29,540
of touchy for me to say it this way but there are still physical there are physical difference

1013
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:35,300
differences in the type of muscle that women and men build i'm studying this learning anatomy and

1014
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:41,620
my own weightlifting right and even if you have a trans woman she's still going to have some of the

1015
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:47,860
the male musculature physically i'm just talking physically only right you know so that in and of

1016
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:53,060
itself where you have someone identifying as a woman she's going to be eligible to go in the

1017
01:04:53,060 --> 01:05:01,300
women except that there's that touchy part of how her body is built so i honestly would like to see

1018
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:07,380
you know in the realm of sports just have the categories completely wiped away like that have

1019
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,220
it all be based on physical ability and the same thing goes with these tournaments like that i'd

1020
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:18,180
like to see it based off of personal ability rather than be some boys club all right well to

1021
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:24,100
be continued um yeah again not not an easy topic that uh society is going to solve uh with just

1022
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:28,260
this i i think this is something that's going to continue but i will say kudos to blizzard

1023
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,260
for kind of going okay when it comes to and i hope you all know that sometimes i just want to present

1024
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:38,260
devil's advocate opinion on this show i i do feel that uh you know blizzard stepping in and saying

1025
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:43,780
who cares if you are a guy or a girl it is all the same it's all even when it comes to hearthstone i

1026
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:48,740
think that was a great great thing um and i also you know what else i think is also a great thing

1027
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:55,540
that pretty much everybody i saw on twitter in response like you know people that regularly speak

1028
01:05:55,540 --> 01:06:00,020
up on feminist issues and people that don't it seems like everybody out there on twitter was

1029
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:05,380
kind of you know of the mindset of this is not right this is not the way it should be and so

1030
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:10,420
maybe the positive at the end of the story is maybe that is a sign that things are getting

1031
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:19,300
better if not at a snail's pace okay anyway let's move on speaking of uh things that are moving

1032
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:24,660
along very very very slowly uh the playstation vita you know a lot of people are wondering if

1033
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:30,500
sony's given up on the playstation vita because they haven't really been pushing any games for it

1034
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,940
they're relying on third parties and thought i heard that they weren't doing any first party

1035
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:39,460
games but then again they have um they do have one game coming out from sony japan later this year

1036
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:46,420
but that's it well uh here's the thing uh sony in a recent interview said that uh there's uh

1037
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,500
the new slimmed down model of the playstation vita of course you know we've heard about that

1038
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:56,100
especially over in japan and so forth um it has spurred quote strong interest among gamers and

1039
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,740
that there will be more stock coming quote to ensure continued momentum leading into the

1040
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:06,020
holidays um the numbers for the playstation vita they've noted have been picking up towards the

1041
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,620
play or as the playstation 4 is launched but we haven't seen the exact numbers for the playstation

1042
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:17,380
vita in some time right now the vita is unable to be purchased from sony at least as far as i'm

1043
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:21,060
concerned do you think that company do you think that could be because they're trying to put a lot

1044
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,420
of stock and one thing that isn't mentioned in this interview or in this article or in this

1045
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:30,020
discussion is the fact that there's a momentum shift coming towards this playstation tv which

1046
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:38,260
will be able to handle the vita well um i know right now that it's um they've it's unavailable

1047
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:42,980
um not i didn't think it was selling that fast in the beginning anyways and even with the redesign

1048
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:48,580
i don't think that really pushed that many extra systems out there maybe it did but um right now

1049
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:54,580
it's a temporary it's temporarily unavailable to be purchased so whether that means that they're

1050
01:07:54,580 --> 01:08:01,700
allocating those systems to other retailers or that kind of thing but the fact that nobody it

1051
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:05,540
seems like from when i was reading like a neo gaff and stuff that people aren't finding them at

1052
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:14,100
retail that kind of makes me scratch my head a little bit like why so maybe they are my guess

1053
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:19,620
is that they're scaling down the production on those systems just because they are thinking that

1054
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:24,340
the playstation tv is going to take a bigger chunk out of the market over here maybe and

1055
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:29,940
they don't want to be left with a bunch of extra hardware that they can't sell um maybe that's the

1056
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,820
thought um i don't know i do think though that it might pick up a little bit because i know

1057
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:40,980
was it with uh they just would have they just added support for unity for playstation mobile

1058
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:46,340
so like if i wanted to now i could publish a game to playstation mobile and what's kind of

1059
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:51,540
cool about it is i can actually test it on a retail um a retail system just like i can you

1060
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:57,300
know an android or iphone game all right go to our chat room over at live.vog network.com fifth

1061
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:03,940
dream says i buy more games for vita than anything ionotropic says so many free vita games via

1062
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:09,460
playstation plus had to buy a 64 gigabyte memory card kai judo on the other side says they need

1063
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:15,220
to stop this vita thing it's a waste of their time and money no one is buying that crap well i i

1064
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:19,620
bought that crap but i also bought it based on you know the launch titles and some of the things

1065
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,700
that were out then and it is a little bit disappointing to see sony not really putting

1066
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:28,980
out a lot of new stuff themselves but you know like the the chatter who said that they do seem

1067
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:34,900
to still support it through playstation plus an awful lot and it is kind of cool that you have

1068
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:40,900
the whole uh streaming through the playstation 4 is is is a pretty neat feature that i do use

1069
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:45,380
i think though that unfortunately that the failure of some of their big temple titles

1070
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:49,940
that they had like the call of duty you know black ops game yeah that was supposed to be fantastic

1071
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:54,660
but then it was done by the same guys that did the resistance game which was not good and then

1072
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:59,060
that game was not good and it's just very underwhelming like if that had like actually

1073
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:04,580
turned out to be a really good game i think that could have really helped you know push the system

1074
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:08,580
on a side note um i don't have the story in front of me or anything i'm just going kind of going off

1075
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,900
of memory but i thought i saw something where ea officially dropped support for vita in this past

1076
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:20,580
week which not true because they have well not exactly they have the legacy version of uh fifa

1077
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:27,700
oh roster update yeah roster update reskin of fifa you know um so that's technically coming but um

1078
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:33,860
yeah they don't have anything coming to um that system and ironically they do have a wii version

1079
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:41,060
of fifa coming as well but um nothing for the wii u uh rama says just price cut the darn vita to 149

1080
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:45,460
and watch it sell like fucking hotcakes that comment live dot vog network.com probably will

1081
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:51,380
well it the playstation tv 99 that's why i'm saying the playstation tv is going to be the

1082
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:57,620
thing that cannibalizes the already very very tiny vita sales it could drop that system down

1083
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:02,260
99 dollars that'd be really interesting to see that happen it would if they could get if they

1084
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:06,020
could get it under the ds's price but i can't imagine the hardware i mean they'd have to sell

1085
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:10,100
that thing at a loss i can't imagine the hardware is only 99 bucks to build those things no not with

1086
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,740
that screen on it unless they're well they could consider dropping the touchscreen or something

1087
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:21,300
dropping the touchpad in the back who knows um you know i honestly think the back touchpad thing is

1088
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:27,220
kind of dumb the beginning but i don't know it's just i think it's that screen that's really costing

1089
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:34,020
them all right well let's move on loki all right so amazon is right now fighting against the ftc

1090
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:40,900
because they're trying to get them to restrict um add-on purchases within their mobile apps

1091
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:45,540
so basically what they're trying to do right now which i don't know i'm kind of on the fence with

1092
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,660
both of the stuff like they're trying to require password entry for in-app purchases which i think

1093
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:56,980
i'm okay with um overhaul their refund process to aid parents seeking um you know

1094
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:02,420
recompensation for unwanted purchases made by children okay that i have a problem with

1095
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:09,060
because they should be limiting what they should have a limit of how you know their children

1096
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:14,420
shouldn't be able to access in-app purchases i think the best way around it would be to say

1097
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:20,020
create a second password maybe like a pin like you had for like it you know an atm card or

1098
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:24,260
something like that where you just have like a four or five digit pin that you enter in

1099
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:29,540
to authorize those purchases instead of you know having to remember your whole password if you know

1100
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:33,780
if the whole point is oh well we want to make sure that's streamlined enough so people don't

1101
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:37,860
go oh well i don't want to log in to buy this i don't remember what my password is or something

1102
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,940
and so i'm just not going to do that um and they're thinking that that's going to cut into

1103
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,940
sales but at the same time i think parents need to be responsible for their children's purchases

1104
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:52,980
in these games also it should be on amazon and even you know apple or um you know google to

1105
01:12:52,980 --> 01:13:00,340
be policing these games or apps that are on their services that are just blatantly trying to trick

1106
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:05,940
people into making in-app purchases i think that needs to be a little bit more um policed but

1107
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:11,460
i think both they need to kind of meet in the middle a little bit i only i think it's a little

1108
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:17,860
ridiculous to you know make it so that it's easier for them to get uh refunds on the stuff

1109
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:22,180
one it should really be up to the parents i mean we've got to put some responsibility on these

1110
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:27,380
parents here you know that oh well i didn't know my my my children you know were playing with this

1111
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:32,260
and i logged it you know logged in for this well why are you logged in first off for purchases made

1112
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:38,980
on this stuff um it's i don't know it's like if you leave your credit card out and you're you know

1113
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:43,220
kids run up a bill on something like that are you gonna you know call the credit card company

1114
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:48,660
and go well can you give me a refund because i didn't know doing my kids are making purchases

1115
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:56,660
on this stuff i mean i don't know so they're fighting it right now and apparently um they have

1116
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:04,580
not uh the fcc has not responded to amazon's latest statement which is you know uh that they're

1117
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:14,500
already doing enough i don't know it is a very interesting issue the whole uh kids making these

1118
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:20,260
purchases on the devices and you know as it gets easier and easier to do that you know just touch

1119
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:25,780
here to buy you know there's it's so easy for kids to do that but yeah i mean i believe on the

1120
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:30,660
iphone you have the whole you have to put your password in again yeah they have they have the

1121
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:34,100
or at least you can enable iphone i think you can enable that and they even said you know when

1122
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:37,780
customers told us kids have been purchases they didn't want we refunded those purchases

1123
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:43,460
and they're also saying that you know uh they have you know currently implemented a prominent

1124
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:47,940
notice of in-app purchasing effective parental controls and real-time notice of every in-app

1125
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:53,860
purchase and i think if i remember correctly and i'm not sure how amazon's you know stuff is forked

1126
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:59,140
as far as android goes or even i know they have that amazon os or whatever for their phone or fire

1127
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:05,460
os and stuff but they've got you know in google i think they've got support now for multiple user

1128
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:10,820
profiles for these things and i think you can assign stuff to children assign stuff to parents

1129
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:15,700
where you can maybe have it where you know the parents have to authorize those purchases or

1130
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:19,940
even just not give them the option to be able to purchase anything you know what i think they just

1131
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:24,100
need to do is they need to turn on some of those parental controls by default i think that would

1132
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,540
be the right thing to do is that the whole requiring the password every day that should

1133
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:31,220
be on by default of course then what happens when the kid finds out your password but

1134
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,940
well that's that's another on top of that also or or the fact that you know

1135
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,820
um if what they need to do is they need to override it for free purchases because i know

1136
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:45,860
even still like on um the apple store and stuff you still have to put in your password for free to

1137
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,820
download so let's just get rid of that for free purchases that way your kid isn't bothering you

1138
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:55,540
for stuff i'm laughing because i know how they're going to stop it is because we're talking about

1139
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:59,860
iphone what did they just put in those newest iphones they have the whole thumbprint sensor

1140
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:03,140
so it's only going to be a matter of time before it's like okay you want to buy this put your thumb

1141
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:07,860
on the thing and then now a kid is kids not going to be able to do that what do you cut off daddy's

1142
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:12,820
they they want they want as little little resistance to make those in-app purchases

1143
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:16,660
because i know that this is why the government's pushing back but that's why i'm saying do the you

1144
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:20,820
do the pin do the pin so it's real easy it's just like the security on your phone just put in the

1145
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:25,140
pin and be done with it and then that way you don't have to remember a big long password if

1146
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:29,620
that's what you really want to do have that option in there um because i think they have it

1147
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:33,780
like on the xbox and stuff where you can put a pin in for like parental controls very interesting

1148
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:38,180
comments in our chat room over at live.vog network.com kai judo says i remember in the 80s

1149
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:41,700
we used to call the 900 numbers and run up the phone bill parents would tell the phone company

1150
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:46,980
their kid ran up the bill that sounds like this all over again um s2100 matt says those same

1151
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:51,620
parents complaining are the same people that were once kids that ran up their own parents phone bill

1152
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:56,580
via dial-up gaming and porn phone lines that's a very interesting sort of generational perspective

1153
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:02,740
there that this isn't necessarily a new issue yeah exactly but like when i ran up the phone bill

1154
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:06,500
because i connected to a phone number that happened to be long distance for you know

1155
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,860
prodigy or whatever because i didn't know you know i didn't i didn't know that this was going

1156
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:16,260
to be even though it's within my area code that this is going to be a toll call or whatever

1157
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:20,660
you know that kind of crap because the phone company does weird shit like that um because

1158
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:24,180
i didn't know that my parents didn't go oh we need to call the phone company tell them that

1159
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:28,180
it was my kid connecting we got to get a refund fucking take some responsibility they they took

1160
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:33,300
responsibility and said okay this was your fault because you didn't know this don't do it again

1161
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:37,060
but we still have to pay this and because you know it was our fault that you did

1162
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:44,260
take responsibility for your actions or your kids actions take responsibility yeah oh i know i it's

1163
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:48,100
funny when you brought up prodigy because i i guess it the whole generational thing i did do

1164
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:52,820
that remember when they used to charge by the minute for chat rooms oh my god one month i ran

1165
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:58,740
up a very big bill and by using like chat rooms or whatever and oh i felt the wrath of my mother

1166
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,900
oh yeah oh yeah and i got restricted from that stuff and it got to the point where like

1167
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:10,820
she would intentionally pick up the phone to screw up my my uh my modem connections if she

1168
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:14,260
knew i was on the computer when i wasn't supposed to be like on the modem or something she'd just

1169
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:20,980
pick up the phone she knew it would kick me off and leave it off the hook nice

1170
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:28,740
oh boy and uh bobby blackwolf in our chat room live.vognetwork.com similar story i ran up the

1171
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:34,340
bill for quantum link or q link since it was 30 cents a minute or something i ran up a 400

1172
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:42,500
bill one month and it was never on it again very interesting generational shift there all right uh

1173
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:47,700
moving on some unfortunately sad news to follow up those stories but we have news of another

1174
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:54,420
developer closure airtight games unfortunately shutting down their redman office no announcement

1175
01:18:54,420 --> 01:19:00,260
uh the studio just kind of disappeared and uh it disappeared less than a month after their

1176
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:05,940
big game murdered soul suspect had just come out this was confirmed on twitter through tweets from

1177
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:11,940
the company thanking those who quote supported us and made the last 10 years possible that's

1178
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:16,900
never a fun thing to report on i mean luckily redmond is is also the home of you know huge

1179
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:21,540
mother ships for nintendo and microsoft so hopefully those folks can find gameful employment

1180
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:27,220
somewhere else but never fun to report on that i will say though i did not hear a lot about

1181
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:31,540
murdered soul suspect um i've only heard of this like through other people that are like oh yeah

1182
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:35,620
i wanted to check that out it was okay i just don't think it was what they're expecting it to

1183
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:40,740
be i mean i didn't really have high hopes for it anyways it seemed like kind of a supernatural la

1184
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:48,180
noir um and i just don't know if it was it wasn't that big of a title i think and it just unfortunately

1185
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:53,860
just didn't you know get the reviews or anything that they're hoping it didn't kind of get the buzz

1186
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:58,740
yeah i think a game really well it's being really marketed too much either so i mean i don't know

1187
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:03,380
maybe the maybe the publisher didn't really uh believe in it i don't know all right well that's

1188
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:11,060
unfortunate uh moving on before we get to uh release dates dark sakura lol lol a lot um

1189
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:18,180
basically uh and i i don't know how many people listening believe any of that crap that displayed

1190
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:24,260
on fox news but there's a show called fox and friends or a segment that has rick perry the

1191
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:31,060
asshole um inviting in this particular segment invited uh president obama to the texas border

1192
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:38,980
to see the uh quote immigration crisis ooh um the banner that they used for this for

1193
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:47,380
defending the homeland looks quite a bit like the bioshock infinite uh you know logo

1194
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:54,020
which is funny because basically isn't the point of bioshock infinite fighting the right wing and

1195
01:20:54,020 --> 01:21:03,700
winning kind of the ultra right wing doesn't it involve that sorta yeah yeah so um basically

1196
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:10,660
ken levine got a wind of this and he said glad to help fox glad to help and then my favorite thing

1197
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:16,020
is it's not the irony of that fox news thing that bothers me so much it's the type setting

1198
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:23,620
it really is bad because that n and d are too close together it's just awful do you think fire

1199
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:28,020
your designer do you think they really like lifted it from a bioshock game or is there

1200
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:36,500
something their designer did yeah yeah i mean we we sample other we we quote other people's work

1201
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:40,420
from time to time and doing it

1202
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:48,820
in this blatant way means their designer is not no especially since the typography is actually

1203
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:55,700
kind of bad um yeah i think that they ran out of ideas um you have uh some comments in the chat

1204
01:21:55,700 --> 01:22:00,900
room there that i think define this a little better uh act f saying with your uh what bioshock

1205
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:07,140
it's all about kind of but not exactly is what i said but the point was comparing it to fox news

1206
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:13,220
alan alchemy makes a great one though here it's mostly a parable about jingoism segregation

1207
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:21,060
nationalism uh is a better way to describe it and eugenics is a huge one so i know i think

1208
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:28,180
i don't know that's not as funny when you say it that way but my point was it was basically

1209
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:34,500
the the worst of conservatism yeah of that era right and fox is the worst of conservative well

1210
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:40,580
not the worst but the uh the the about as far worse as you can get that and still remain public

1211
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:49,220
uh uh what's the word i'm thinking of socially acceptable on air yes all right

1212
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:53,620
uh loki were you gonna jump in with something real quick i just think that i don't i don't know

1213
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:58,660
if they i'm sure that they don't even know what bioshock infinite is and most likely that they

1214
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:03,140
just probably drew from the same sort and same inspiration that bioshock infinite that's what

1215
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:08,500
i was wondering is that maybe is it it's not fox news it's whoever they hired as their designer i

1216
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:13,940
i can't i could see though jamie's idea of like a rogue granted the banner shape is the same but

1217
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:19,620
it's it's kind of a stretch i mean it's aside from it having kind of the same theme to it it's just

1218
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:24,420
it's not like they you know it's not like the daily show where they they take you know an

1219
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:28,340
actual logo for something they kind of rearrange the words so they like to do really bad photoshop

1220
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:37,380
all right anyway that's that's not how basically the way the way having a designer works is that

1221
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:44,900
the designer said okay wage slave do this so that we'll pay you for something okay you haven't you

1222
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:52,740
have until five minutes to make it ah okay designer presents work can you do it in comic sans

1223
01:23:53,460 --> 01:24:01,860
fuck you fine and some person who has absolutely no idea about what design or good typography is

1224
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:08,580
approves it and it goes on air i want this to look a little more friendly and whimsical maybe uh

1225
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:12,020
there's this font on my computer comic sans have you thought about trying that one

1226
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:17,700
i would like to print out everything i would like to print out the phone book in comic sans

1227
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:19,940
turn it into a giant spike and shove it up your ass

1228
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:30,820
hey that's mean and then i'm gonna take papyrus and print the bible in that and shove it up your nose

1229
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:36,100
or maybe just an unabridged dictionary that's a little bit longer

1230
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:43,940
oh oh oh i'm going to lock you in a prison where all the walls are printed in helvetica

1231
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:48,980
i was gonna say if i if i say you will learn what good type looks like if i say three hail

1232
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:57,220
helvetica's will i be forgiven we need three hail helvetica's and a myriad pro all right moving on

1233
01:24:57,220 --> 01:25:02,340
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates okay nemesis wingdings is

1234
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:09,060
still better than comic sans i kind of love those wingdings but wingdings will never be

1235
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:14,100
as good as the emoji set that is now uh on all the phones and that's ridiculous

1236
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:22,340
it's ridiculous well you don't like emoji no emoji emoji is my favorite way to respond to

1237
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:27,300
facebook posts now because you know extrovert is on this big trip in europe and he keeps tagging

1238
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:32,420
all this like really dumb shit he sees look it's rob on money look it's rob on money and it's like

1239
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:37,140
i don't know like why it's supposed to be funny but i'll just reply with that emoji that just

1240
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:42,420
has like the like look on its face like i hate you so much you know which one i'm talking about

1241
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:46,900
if you look at all the faces there's one that has like the eyes pointed to the side the you know

1242
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:53,300
the slyly judging you i hate you candy look at that face all right anyway uh let's travel

1243
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:57,220
around the world and check out release dates there's nothing coming out this week what nothing

1244
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:02,740
coming out this week nothing coming out this week yeah it's absolutely dead not a single thing well

01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:07,860
that was a short release date say yeah exactly yeah nothing nothing coming out oh i'm sorry i

1246
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:17,060
take it back there was the uh 3ds uh was it scooby-doo and looney tunes cartoon explosion

1247
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:21,060
or something like that i don't know so basically there's a no one cur coming out it's scooby-doo

1248
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:28,020
and looney tunes worlds combined you know it's like it's like space jam but less jam well now

1249
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:33,780
see and before you said space jam i was gonna say well which of our listeners have actually pre-ordered

1250
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:39,700
that but then you go and say space jam and i'm like oh space jam was a pretty rad movie

1251
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:46,100
come on warner brothers you've got midway now so i mean you could you could technically make

1252
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:53,780
a new nba jam game that's space jam space jam oh my god oh hey hey working on another space jam

1253
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:58,260
they are working on another space jam movie so this could possibly happen it prison happening

1254
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:04,820
with lebron or something yeah oh man that would be amazing that would be cool michael jordan needs

1255
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:09,300
to make a cameo until we get space jam 2 let's travel over to japan and check out some of the

1256
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:14,020
releases that are coming out over there no space jam 2 to report but we do have on the playstation

1257
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:22,580
3 this week on july the 10th uh sakio shogi geckie sashi 13 comes out this week uh this is some type

1258
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:28,180
of board game series that is on the playstation um i don't know what much more of the game than

1259
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:33,540
that though you said it was shogi right yeah it's it's a classic game very very classic board game

1260
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:39,060
that would be like strategy kind of like i think it follows a lot of the same principles of go

1261
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:44,260
i would imagine it's kind of like how they release monopoly on every single console and handheld and

1262
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,820
everything right it's like classic american board games get released on all that stuff wheel of

1263
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:56,100
fortune too game shows anyhow uh on the xbox 360 this week in japan oh nothing nothing until the

1264
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,260
17th it looks like it's a pretty dry week in japan as well because there's nothing on the weu this

1265
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:08,100
week either uh taking a look at the 3ds though there is some type of special pack a 3ds xl pack

1266
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:14,020
uh it's called the yukai watch edition uh that i think just includes that game and it's a 3d that

1267
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:19,220
has the little character there on it uh for those of you that need to import a japanese 3ds i suppose

1268
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:26,660
there's that uh yukai watch 2 also comes out ganzo and hankei come out in um uh japan this

1269
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:31,540
week on july the 10th so kind of a slower week in japan as well how about uh how about the uk dark

1270
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:40,420
sakura we actually do have a couple um on the 8th is cubit rebooted for the pc and on the 9th

1271
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:47,620
mousecraft whatever that is is that like mousetrap the amazing board game for me it's on

1272
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:56,900
ps everything i believe it's a puzzle game i believe it's falls in the don't care category

1273
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:06,260
it's like okay compared to tetris and lemmings combined so boring to register participation

1274
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:11,140
for this week's episode of orange andreja at vognetwork.com use the passphrase move all

1275
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:16,340
right just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week but first loki all

1276
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:27,300
right um so i don't know i mean i'm not too excited that he's back but cliff uh cliffy b

1277
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:34,020
he uh tweeted i'm officially back making video games again because apparently he retired for

1278
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:43,700
a while um so yeah and of course you know he was uh the main developer behind uh or main i should

1279
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:51,860
say the lead behind uh the gears of war series and um kind of with that you know it's not surprising

1280
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:57,540
since everyone's expecting a next gen gears war game uh one of the voice actors uh who did cold

1281
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:02,980
trains voice was contacted for the next gears war game so put two and two together cliffy's

1282
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:11,540
probably working on a new gears war game i don't know if that's necessarily a given i don't know

1283
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:18,900
but i mean i if i were cliffy b i might want to do something else too maybe he's going to go around

1284
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:23,540
and form his own independent game company you know like he can he can kind of do the miyamoto thing

1285
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:28,340
and oversee gears of war 4 but he doesn't necessarily have to be like actively involved

1286
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:34,020
if that makes sense i guess i don't know all right well i think everybody might want to get

1287
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:40,500
involved with this because it involves food oh wait it's denny's food blah that's that's a

1288
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:45,300
stretch of the word remember this red velvet pancake so we had at christmas i'm sorry they

1289
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:51,060
weren't there died with blood denny's was awesome when i was 21 and like regularly went out to

1290
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:56,260
dinner at two in the morning but now that i'm in my mid-30s like i really three people splitting

1291
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:03,540
a sampler bam exactly where we have enough money to afford a sampler amongst the five of us yeah

1292
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:10,420
i claim a cheese stick mozzarella sticks sound great now if i want gas we've been playing vampire

1293
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:16,500
live action for the last seven hours mozzarella sticks man you said see it used to be like this

1294
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:23,460
here's the routine go to qsar do a half day pass playing qsar for five fucking hours get out of

1295
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:30,580
there midnight go to denny's sampler well anyway is denny's a big thing nationwide or is that more

1296
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:33,620
of a west coast thing because i know we don't really have diners here in california like they

1297
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:39,700
do the east coast they have denny's back east yes i don't know like i just said i used to finish

1298
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:46,260
playing live action vampire i larped keep in mind go eat at denny's we don't have waffle house here

1299
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:51,700
or you know dunkin donuts every denny's is everywhere rob all right fine and you know what

1300
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:57,300
we don't have waffle house out here yes because the nine dollar minimum wage because assholes

1301
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:02,580
yeah all right anyway uh so why do i bring up denny's on our video game show because

1302
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:10,180
uh denny's is doing a greatest hits remixed menu that involves working with atari to create video

1303
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:17,620
game food remixes so there's classic atari games like asteroids centipede and breakout

1304
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:26,900
so one of the games is hashteroids where you're delivering 40 tons of condiments to uh the fourth

1305
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:32,340
planet in sector 7d whatever that means uh so i guess you're fighting giant hash browns instead

1306
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:39,780
of the pixely asteroids uh sector 7d isn't that like the same isn't that where like homer simpson

1307
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:46,180
works and maybe maybe uh takeout instead of breakout is where denny's food is built up in

1308
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:50,820
a wall and you have to take it down by feeding customers and then there's something called

1309
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:56,100
centipup which i think is made out of uh those hush puppy little deep fried balls of dough or

1310
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:02,340
whatever those things are they sell so how would you feed customers um with that do you like bounce

1311
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:06,900
them off of like a you know the wall i don't think that's actual this is not actual food that you

1312
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:11,940
order in stores it's a promotion they're doing online uh through mobile app you can actually

1313
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:18,180
play these three games on denny's mobile iphone app i will say this though it to denny's credit

1314
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:25,620
as much as i think their food is is really really bad um i think denny's is a master at social

1315
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:31,140
marketing because their twitter account is always on point and their tumblr i'm always seeing them

1316
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:35,940
on tumblr because they're saying hilarious things all the time so i will give them that so they are

1317
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:41,620
pretty good at following the pulse and they did social media they did try to do that whole bacon

1318
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:47,460
food menu and actually tried you know was it their bacon milkshake thing but it was not i thought

1319
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,980
that was jack in the box did the bacon milkshake uh well okay i think that was everyone that did

1320
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:56,420
bacon everything uh jack in the box did the bacon milkshake but that was with a jack in the box they

1321
01:33:56,420 --> 01:34:02,900
don't technically have any other milkshake other than just vanilla they just put different syrups

1322
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:07,940
in there um and then denny's actually i think it was a bacon sunday is what it was and it was

1323
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:14,580
disappointing unfortunately all right well we are going to take a trip to simpler times but quick i

1324
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:20,180
want to read this because this literally just came in on twitter from akuma jp uh who actually lives

1325
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:24,740
in japan and wants to kind of follow up on something that i was saying during the japanese

1326
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:30,900
releases uh saying that it's not a slow week because yokai watch is the biggest game in japan

1327
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:35,300
right now and people don't and who wants to compete against that even pokemon needs to think

1328
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:39,380
twice interesting i guess that's one of those games that hasn't crossed the cultural barrier

1329
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:44,420
yet because i don't do you even yokai watch i don't know that game i i know of it i haven't

1330
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:48,020
like the name sounds familiar but it's not something that's really crossed over here yet

1331
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:52,340
as far as i know and to go back real quick about mouse craft because now i just found the

1332
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:56,740
screenshots that remind me of myself what it was it's like a cross between lemmings and tetris you

1333
01:34:56,740 --> 01:35:03,300
drop like tetris pieces to help the mice get through like a maze of all sorts of things and

1334
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:11,380
you have a cat that's kind of crazy it looks cool oh yokai watch is a cute cute cute thing

1335
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:19,460
uh it's a 3ds the original game was out in july of 2013 and uh it is not something that's been

1336
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:22,740
released here it's only in japan so maybe it's something like bravely default well they'll bring

1337
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:27,540
it over eventually uh there have been manga adaptations of the game uh that they've done

1338
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:32,580
there's an anime tv series that they did that started in japan in january 2014 and they're

1339
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:38,020
doing a movie at the end of this year so yeah wow this is a pretty big deal over there so uh

1340
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:44,580
let's see uh the protagonist is searching for bugs in the world woods of sakura new town he

1341
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:49,860
comes across a peculiar capsule machine next to a sacred tree uh when he opens the capsule it

1342
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:56,740
brings forth a yokai named whisper who gives uh kita ghost butler a device known as the yokai

1343
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:01,700
watch using this kita is available to identify and see various different yokai that are haunting

1344
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:08,020
people and causing mischief so it sounds like ghost pokemon katai i've been dealing with that

1345
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:12,180
kata his name is kata well then i'm surprised this isn't something they've tried to bring over here

1346
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:19,700
yet maybe coming done by the same group responsible for professor latin and inazuma 11

1347
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:24,260
well this is why i like doing the show live because you know what i i know i don't think

1348
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:31,060
any day i learned any human being cannot play everything so this is always nice to you know

1349
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:35,220
find out about things especially worldwide that are big elsewhere so thanks for the tweet

1350
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:41,700
akuma jp appreciate it all right uh let's get to the classic game of the week let's go to a time

1351
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:44,980
when there was a lot of stuff that came out in japan that i've never heard of that's for sure

1352
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:51,780
but this game this game is definitely more than all of us in this room this game but this game

1353
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:58,900
is definitely oozes murica murica murica this is a this is an american game an all american game

1354
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:04,500
how how appropriate for this uh long weekend thanks to the fourth of july all right so dark

1355
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:11,940
sakura what is the classic game of the week the oregon trail i figured it was about time

1356
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:17,460
this is a great selection i just want to point out the audio we're gonna hear tonight for the

1357
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:22,180
oregon trail this comes from not like from the fifth edition yeah the apple 2e edition

1358
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:28,580
like didn't have music like maybe like a really bad synthesized you know theme but that's it so

1359
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:33,780
we're gonna hear some uh digital fart yeah so slightly and and if uh j this music is appropriate

1360
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:34,420
yeah jason's

1361
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:45,300
it's really quiet but there it is anyway the oregon trail um was developed in 1971

1362
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:51,860
by three school teachers in northfield minnesota uh the primary one being don

1363
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:59,620
rawich i guess that's how its name is pronounced raw it's um two of his buddies who are also

1364
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:05,060
teachers helped develop the game and this was done using the hp time shared basic

1365
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:11,540
running on an hp 2100 mini computer back when we actually categorized them as such

1366
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:18,980
um he had the game running for that semester when semester was over he deleted the program

1367
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:25,140
but he printed the source code in 1974 the minnesota education computing consortium

1368
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:31,780
uh was developing educational software and they hired him and so he basically uh

1369
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:40,100
redid the oregon trail for them and it ended up being very very popular in 1978 mecc

1370
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:48,420
was trying to get more people to use the apple 2 computer and so the oregon trail was uh in

1371
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:54,740
creative computing's uh may through june 1978 issue written in basic 3.1 and then

1372
01:38:56,100 --> 01:39:04,020
there was the apple pds disc series um oregon trail 2 that came out in 1978 as well um so

1373
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:09,140
basically there have been a bunch of different versions of oregon trail come out since then

1374
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:14,900
but all of us here we have been you got a rough trip ahead of you partner we've known of this

1375
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:18,580
game for a while the narration's a little louder than the music was sorry about that

1376
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:25,220
well in in this case the game has been something that has existed as long as we've been alive

1377
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:35,300
right so starting off with other editions outside the 70s versions there was uh the 1985 uh oregon

1378
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:40,900
trail for apple 2 1990 had the oregon trail classic edition for macintosh um there was

1379
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:48,100
oregon trail deluxe 1992 for das and macintosh uh 1983 through 96 oregon trail version 1.2 for

1380
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:55,540
windows 1986 oregon trail 2 for windows 97 oregon trail third edition then we had fourth fifth there

1381
01:39:55,540 --> 01:40:05,300
was a dsi where uh in 2009 uh oregon trail for we and 3ds uh the oregon trail american seller for uh

1382
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:09,940
ios and android and then in 2012 there was the oregon trail for windows phone

1383
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:16,820
so what was the big thing that we used to have to do in this game apart from you know forting

1384
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:22,500
rivers and whatnot shooting buffalo shooting buffalo and only being able to carry 100 pounds

1385
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:29,540
back to the wagon you had to hunt and basically i know loki was the type that tried to shoot up

1386
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:38,500
5 000 pounds of buffalo and i did everything died in the original version you had basically

1387
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:44,500
no graphics and you were timed on how fast you could type bang wham or pow and misspelled

1388
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:50,100
words were a failed hunt in the graphical version you had the little man with his rifle

1389
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:57,620
um you could get bison they yielded the most food and were the slowest moving rabbits and squirrels

1390
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:06,500
were fast you could have uh deer and elk and bears and other bison and other type of animals

1391
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:10,340
but you could like you said you can only carry 100 pounds in the early versions of the game

1392
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:17,060
it uh in later versions as long as there were two members of the wagon party 200 pounds could be

1393
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:22,020
carried back and then later versions you could actually have different hunting environments

1394
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:28,660
so you could hunt in the snow or the grass and the overhunting of animals would result

1395
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:34,020
in a scarcer game and it would reduce the number of animals that would appear later on in the game

1396
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:38,500
so it did teach a bit of conservatism you know um you could die in the game well

1397
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:47,140
by you i mean all of your family uh they could die of various diseases like

1398
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:54,420
measles snakebite dysentery typhoid cholera and exhaustion and in later versions um

1399
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:59,780
you could have a funeral if the environment allowed you to have a funeral and you could

1400
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:06,580
write a tombstone um but you still couldn't have a viking funeral which sucks but you could write

1401
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:11,780
this person blew donkey goats or you know donkey balls or something on their tombstone and that

1402
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:20,020
was always great you could uh you actually had a score you had um an unscaled number of points

1403
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:27,380
that was for each remaining family member weighed by party health um your possessions and your cash

1404
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:36,420
on hand one point per dollar and then you would have a difficulty scaler so it was it was kind

1405
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:42,660
of interesting but you know now there's been of course all kinds of clones um mecc did uh the

1406
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:48,820
yukon trail and the amazon trail and of course we know you have died of dysentery is on a number of

1407
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:53,380
t-shirts and memorabilia i have a you have died of dysentery sure i have to say this real quick

1408
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:58,980
though because the whole tombstone thing one of the big features was that not only would you fill

1409
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:02,580
out your tombstone you know putting like pepperoni and sausage or whatever you want to put on your

1410
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:08,020
tombstone right that what would happen is that when other people play the game their wagon would

1411
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:11,460
come through and it might say like there is a tombstone here do you want to stop and look

1412
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,860
and you would see like you know the tombstone of whoever had played before you it was like

1413
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:22,420
that was me versus circa 1983 but then you know you know kids kids did all sorts of dumb shit

1414
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:26,020
right so like you know we would be there and we would walk up and we'd do you want to see the

1415
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:30,020
tombstone yes and it would come up and it would say you know teacher name is a fag or whatever it

1416
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:35,380
would say there because you know unfortunately uh years ago it was okay to say those things

1417
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:42,020
but um you know that's that's that's what kids did in school play the oregon trail and write

1418
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:48,500
obscene things on the tombstones there were uh of course all different types of parodies that

1419
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:53,460
were done for promotional tools there was uh the one that fool did in 20 what

1420
01:43:53,540 --> 01:44:00,820
do you friend i'm new here nothing i'm making you sound like um mutley i'm reading a little bit

1421
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:06,260
okay because i find it funny the act deaf is like i've never played the oregon trail and then like

1422
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:11,140
miss shame you know it's like act deaf dude well you know i know i know she said it with

1423
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:14,420
tongue in cheek but i just laughing because i'm like well he's mexican of course he's

1424
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:21,540
never played the oregon trail well they didn't play that in school for other uh uh different

1425
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:26,740
types of uh alterations made in the game for marketing fallout boy did the fallout boy trail

1426
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:35,300
so um there was a game loft did the updated version for cell phones um for ipod uh touch

1427
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:43,220
and iphone and those that were have been on the app store since march 11 2009 various other

1428
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:47,780
versions came out and basically the cell phone version is very similar but you have three

1429
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:54,020
different wagons you have the basic wagon a prairie schooner or a conestoga wagon and you

1430
01:44:54,020 --> 01:45:00,740
can be a banker a carpenter or a farmer um of course there were there's a facebook version

1431
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:07,220
uh then there's the oregon trail and it was released by the men who wear many hats

1432
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:15,940
and it's basically trying to uh survive the zombie apocalypse so uh there you go

1433
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:24,100
have you played the oregon trail no that game is funny i am not you have to check that out

1434
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:31,380
so i i think that the the version that i found the video for is really funny because you start

1435
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:37,620
off as this enthusiastic girl narrating the story and i'm like bitch you're gonna die you're gonna

1436
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:43,060
be the first to get dysentery or drink the cholera infested waters this version that we're looking

1437
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:48,740
this version that we're looking at here is like one of those classic cheesy 90 cd-rom games

1438
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:55,140
like classic like i'm expecting the sim city anchor woman to come up on screen any minute now

1439
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:01,060
those 90s uh cd-rom games are so cheesy that i like when people give me links in the chat room

1440
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:07,620
that i cannot check on my phone there was there was also one it's not the oregon trail but it was

1441
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:15,140
a um it was kind of like a mini game type version of the oregon trail that was on steam um i don't

1442
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:18,820
remember the name that might be what they're linking to it's not the oregon trail but there's

1443
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:22,660
one that's pretty funny it's just like you know you're just shooting everything throughout the

1444
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:27,220
whole thing nice just guns everywhere i just can't remember what it's called because i have 240 some

you're an honest man she already posted something like i have it was she has like frosty in her eye

1466
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:30,980
and i'm like what how the hell did you get frosty in your eye and how is that my fault again i'm

1467
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,820
sorry i don't understand what are you doing with frosty in the first place because i did not

1468
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:39,620
realize there was going to be frosting related things happening now i now i have a craving for

1469
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:45,220
cupcakes damn you loki but uh so i i don't know that's probably what i'm gonna be doing just

1470
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:52,660
working on i mean i i probably will end up going to her parents house i wish i could stay home

1471
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:58,900
maybe maybe i can convince her that i could stay home and nap because that would be nice but um

1472
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:03,380
i don't know i'm gonna work on it during the week that's why i do my lunch nowadays because

1473
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:10,260
there you go nobody that played games with me works with me anymore and uh our game room's gone

1474
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:15,780
and uh it's kind of sad but i'm glad you're speaking of which i will be i will be ebaying

1475
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:22,420
most of my gaming related stuff uh from our game room on ebay so look for xbox 360 and playstation

1476
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:29,620
3 systems oh nice so i got playstation 3 160 gig systems that are they are pretty much brand new

1477
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:35,540
the box got beat up and that's it oh do you have any ps3s or ps2 compatible no damn that's just

1478
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:40,580
my original one at home but no these are all 160 gig systems they're the first redesign all right

1479
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:46,420
so uh so hopefully i'll be putting that up and then um whatever else i have i have a lot of

1480
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:52,340
crap at my desk and i need it it all needs to go so uh we'll see i'll be auctioning some of

1481
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:58,740
that stuff just to make some extra money because uh because i'm broke okay maybe maybe i see that's

1482
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:03,380
the other thing too is maybe i'll just trade that stuff in the game shop or something for uh

1483
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:09,940
playstation 4 and uh there you go xbox one or wii u or something um so there's that option too because

1484
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:15,140
i know one time they were giving you 100 bucks for playstation 3 well be careful because it's

1485
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:19,380
gonna keep going down and down and down so you gotta figure out what you're gonna do yeah sorry

1486
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:23,460
uh anyway quickly speaking of cons dark soccer i know you used to go to this comedy you haven't

1487
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:27,540
been in a while but i think this past weekend i believe i heard anime expo had its big weekend it

1488
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:33,540
sounded like registration was a freaking mess when has it not been a freaking mess why can't

1489
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,380
why can't conventions figure out their registration lines what is what is up with that

1490
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:43,780
the understaff and overbook all right well the story fingers crossed the gamer x will not have

1491
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:49,060
that problem but i suppose just turned to crap last year it went very well the gamer x registration

1492
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:53,620
went very well last year but getting in on the thursday night really really helps with that so

1493
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:59,300
um let's see uh i want to quickly give a shout out to another program on the network as well

1494
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:04,500

01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:16,100
one of the hosts is very very very old just kidding love you travis uh they are going to be back

1497
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:19,780
after their short hiatus on july 12th so i just want to give them a shout out and encourage y'all

1498
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:26,020
to check them out if you uh if you like your uh very random sci-fi chatter that is very

1499
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:32,100
it's the type of show that you can really only do in the internet environment that vog has and it's

1500
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:36,660
it's a lot of fun and very kind of like family uh entertainment so check that out i don't mean

1501
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:42,660
family friendly dysfunctional family yes exactly i mean like dysfunctional family exactly exactly

1502
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:46,580
love it but that's where dark soccer and i got our starts so i just want to give them a shout out

1503
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:50,180
okay rapid fire news we got a lot of ground to cover we got to keep things moving so we have

1504
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:54,500
plenty of time for calls so let's get to it loki some rapid fire news okay so this is kind of neat

1505
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:59,620
because i didn't even know that this worked as it was wired now i guess wirelessly but apparently

1506
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:04,500
the dualshock 4 controllers work with the playstation 3 which that's totally news to me

1507
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:09,300
because i totally miss that um but yeah they have a brand new ps3 firmware update that now allows

1508
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:15,380
you to wirelessly sync your dualshock 4 controller with your playstation 3 so for me that's a good

1509
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:21,380
reason to get dualshock 4 because i only have a playstation 3 right now but i didn't know that

1510
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:27,380
that worked so that's pretty sweet um so yeah and i guess um if you do sync it to your playstation

1511
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:32,500
remember you're gonna also have to re-sync it to your playstation 4 but that's just as easy as

1512
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:38,420
connecting it with a usb cable and pushing you know a button i'm excited about this i love the

1513
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:44,180
ps4 controller yeah so that's really cool it's great um they don't have it where you can use the

1514
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:49,300
playstation 3 controllers on the playstation 4 do they i don't believe so playstation 3 wouldn't

1515
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:53,700
have the touchpad either which is kind of an essential you actually have to click that that

1516
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:58,660
you actually have to click that that that replaces because there's the share button

1517
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:05,380
the uh the tapping the touchpad replaces like what used to be the back back or select button that

1518
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:09,380
replaces it well they could just emulate that they could have you know left side of that is

1519
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:14,900
starred or left side is you know back or whatever um we'll see i think oh they actually that's

1520
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:20,500
exactly what they do in a ps now so they do they do have a setup for it now that you mentioned so

1521
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:24,740
that'd be kind of cool if they had that option but i i they wouldn't want to probably you know

1522
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:29,220
cannibalize their playstation controller sales but very true it would be nice you know if they

1523
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:37,620
had that um they had a special grand theft auto um patch this week that was a free update the

1524
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:42,500
independence day special included a bunch of cool stuff including american fly t-shirts

1525
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:48,500
uh mullet haircut for females and a fireworks launcher also um a giant monster truck that you

1526
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:54,980
can buy um in game what's also cool is they have the option to buy fireworks and actually set up

1527
01:53:54,980 --> 01:54:01,220
your own fireworks show you can actually set timers on each one and you know launch fireworks

1528
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:05,860
which was really cool um apparently though that's only going to be well at least the fireworks part

1529
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:11,060
is only going to be limited to this week um which is very disappointing because that sounds really

1530
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:15,940
cool i wish they would just open that back up but maybe they'll be just like there was snow at

1531
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:20,980
winter maybe that something they're gonna add each year or something just to kind of keep it

1532
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:28,820
fresh but uh that's really cool and you can download that for free so check it out and then

1533
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:36,660
uh last but not least there's another oculus rift demo now for uh south park and it looks like

1534
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:43,460
that they've just basically taken the south park stick of truth um environment and also uh just

1535
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:48,980
threw like some characters in there and stuff but pretty cool looking you can wander around

1536
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:55,620
south park and just kind of get the look there you can even go in the hell and um i don't know

1537
01:54:55,620 --> 01:55:05,540
it's a neat idea although at least not as terrible as south park 64 there is that all right uh some

1538
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:10,180
other quick news uh this is unfortunate about mario kart 8 you know for such a stellar wii u

1539
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:15,620
game that has a pretty great online system it was really only a matter of time before as they say

1540
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:20,820
hackers gonna hack and uh some youtube folks uh have published a youtube that show how to hack

1541
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:25,140
mario kart 8 uh they're saying well i don't think it shows everything they're just saying it's a

1542
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:30,660
proof of concept for now but basically using a browser exploit they can make moo moo meadows

1543
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:36,580
play the final lap music immediately or make it play no music at all uh they can rename things

1544
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:42,500
like they rename moo moo meadows to shitty luck course they can corrupt the font they can crash

1545
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:47,300
the wii u and alter the wii u menu fonts unfortunately the the thing about this is that

1546
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:52,820
these exploits could lead to online cheats and i'm hearing that some of that is being spotted as well

1547
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:57,140
that folks are able to cheat online hopefully nintendo will patch it and put the ban hammer on

1548
01:55:57,140 --> 01:56:01,540
this quick now that they have a system capable of patching uh because the wii u can do that for

1549
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:06,420
games hopefully they will clamp that down and uh fix that it's not even with the games though it's

1550
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:12,580
with the internet browser yes on the wii u so yeah but they could still patch out the exploit

1551
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:18,020
in the game yeah so all right and uh this was mentioned earlier during the release days dates

1552
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:23,380
but uh just to make sure we all know qbert rebooted is a thing and that is happening it's

1553
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:28,660
coming out on mobile and steam uh qbert hasn't been seen in a while unless you caught his cameo

1554
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:33,940
in wreck it ralph but qbert was that little orange fuzzball with a very long nose that used

1555
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:39,940
to say a string of punctuation when he would fall to the bottom and little known thing back in the

1556
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:45,220
day those old arcade machines actually had a little like device that when qbert would hit the bottom

1557
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:49,940
it would make a very loud thud it would actually make like this big clamp uh a sound of a sandbag

1558
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:54,020
hitting the bottom or something but anyway uh and then qbert would say a bunch of punctuation which

1559
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:59,300
we all know was just fuck you know like what i usually say when i die like really easy cheaply

1560
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:04,660
in a game like that anyhow now you can say swear words all over again with qbert on steam and

1561
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:11,700
mobile devices it will have the isometric gameplay of the original arcade game uh in a 2d pixel style

1562
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:19,140
and a 3d hd overhaul think kind of what pac-man and some other arcade remakes have had so uh

1563
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:24,820
should be interesting hopefully it's not too overpriced uh mighty number nine

1564
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:31,940
uh the company that was developing mighty number name cons concept usa which as you all know this

1565
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:36,980
is inafune's pet project that's basically mega man without saying mega man right this is the

1566
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:42,100
whole like screw you for not bringing any regular mega man games here is what we're going to do uh

1567
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:48,980
anyway uh concept has announced now a new second paypal funding campaign to cover new stretch

1568
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:57,700
goals for mighty number nine uh a 100 000 target for english voice acting uh the update that

1569
01:57:57,700 --> 01:58:02,100
concerns this whole drive is that anything collected in this new effort is only going to

1570
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:07,220
be used to address new features the original donation toll is still dedicated to the original

1571
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:13,860
game and the first round of stretch goals which um it's very interesting that english voice acting

1572
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:18,420
was not considered in the original but you know i suppose usually the english voice acting turns

1573
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:26,660
out terrible anyway so um not always uh anyhow um you can do that on paypal a 23 pre-order will

1574
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:32,660
basically be a digital pre-order but there are other bonuses as well uh there's also a animated

1575
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:38,980
series coming out of this there's lots and lots of lots of new stretch goals so there you go dark

1576
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:48,260
sakura we have some stuff um what's uh coming up for one thing is that namco bandai has uh

1577
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:55,780
going to be doing a uh a racing game called project cars that's uh actually done by slightly

1578
01:58:55,780 --> 01:59:07,460
mad studios it's going to be um for xbox one ps4 pc and steam os and it's supposed to also uh

1579
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:12,500
you know there's the same group that did need for speed shift so hopefully we should see this uh

1580
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:18,820
before too long so it's also going to be one of the first morpheus games that come out um one of

1581
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:25,300
my stories didn't load it's also a kick-started game as well um and there was supposed to be a

1582
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:32,580
weu version as well of that um should be should be interesting because uh it looks fantastic

1583
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:36,340
um and the fact that they finally got a publisher because i know for a while there they didn't have

1584
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:41,860
anybody um pretty exciting to see something like that come out since it's it looks to be

1585
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:49,940
the same caliber of like a gran turismo or forza um other uh good actually this uh

1586
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:56,980
is that a shovel knight is going to have butt mode yeah um basically will it friend your butt

1587
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:07,700
yeah well basically if you enter w s w w a e a w as your name then um you uh all mentions for

1588
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:15,060
a bunch of recurring words shovel knight health magic are replaced with butt so and this is i

1589
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:20,900
think supposed to be on all the versions so like of all heroes none shown broader than butt butt

1590
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:31,860
and shield butt butts that's funny yeah lol butts uh was that other thing able to come up if not

i'll jump in here no it brought up a story from uh last week don't all right let me uh i'll jump

1592
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:40,020
in here real quick and mention because i definitely want to give a shout out to um

1593
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:44,340
good news and gamers doing good and i know we have a lot of fans of these summer games

1594
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:50,820
that was covered last week i think i think we talked about that it was going on but we didn't

1595
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:56,100
talk about their final tally all right for this so but i've got the story up then okay go for it

1596
02:00:56,100 --> 02:01:02,100
i just thought it was old no um so basically uh the summer games done quick uh gaming marathon

1597
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:10,340
raised over 700 000 for doctors without borders uh last week so very good for them

1598
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:19,380
that basically means that a combined total of more than 2.75 million were raised for charities

1599
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:24,660
all right and oh well if we covered that twice because that's it's good to cover it that's right

1600
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:31,460
all right uh let's see and there will be a matter of time before the winter games or the official

1601
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:36,500
awesome games dumb quick uh happens and then we'll cover that one three times just to just

1602
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:45,140
to make up for it all right uh finally rob huh but lol but uh let's go to the frugal question

1603
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:49,220
of the week you take facebook you take google plus you slam those words together you get frugal

1604
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:53,940
it's

1605
02:01:56,980 --> 02:02:02,100
every week we ask a question of our social media communities and we read some of our favorite

1606
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:07,140
answers on the air and this week we asked uh have you seen this whole story about the Denny's and

1607
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:12,980
Atari thing and be honest has there been any of these video game commercials that you've actually

1608
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:19,380
enjoyed as a sort of guilty pleasure be honest we won't judge you even if it's yaris and then

1609
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:23,860
i put a little footnote we actually might judge you a little bit for yours so let's see what what

1610
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:30,740
commercial sponsored games will our fans admit to actually liking a little bit and starting right

1611
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:36,900
off tech 2030 says a little shame to admit i actually like the yaris video game on xbox 360

1612
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:43,220
it was simple but addictive covers head with paper bag and you should feel ashamed

1613
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:46,180
yeah well that that look of silence is you being judged right now

1614
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:54,580
thank you for your honesty i appreciate it all right um let's see becky m replies and said my

1615
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:59,380
guilty pleasure is yo noid the nintendo game that featured the noid character from dominos pizza

1616
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:05,220
commercials uh febreeze a replies and said the doritos games on xbox live were amazing

1617
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:11,620
dark tetsuya says i still have sneak king on the xbox which was fun albeit creepy as heck though

1618
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:17,380
i think my favorite of these was spot on the nes a puzzle or board game starring the old seven

1619
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:21,540
up mascot i think he did that for a classic game of the week cool spot was awesome and sneak king

1620
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:27,060
the only game i can think of that actually was a hybrid game that both the xbox and xbox 360

1621
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:31,860
versions were on the same disc that's right played in both systems why they didn't do that more

1622
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:35,860
often especially with some of those games that were pretty close to each other yeah it was beyond

1623
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:40,180
me uh let's see critical myth also green sneak king was hilarious especially when you realize

1624
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:44,980
that the king was an uber stalker and that was supposed to be quote good advertising uh renee

1625
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:50,500
replies and says not just yo noid in the dominos tie-in but i also enjoyed mckids hell of a

1626
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:56,340
platformer despite the obvious tie-in andy r says motorstorm rc on the vita comes to mind

1627
02:03:56,340 --> 02:04:03,300
i'd forgot about this one that was a that was like uh iron man off-road racing from the pizza

1628
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:07,860
parlors back in the day that game was cool uh andy r also says the game wasn't great but it was free

1629
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:12,660
in the u.s thanks to the advertisement promotion which is a price i can get behind uh burr says

1630
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:17,860
cool spot was actually a pretty decent platformer with impressive graphics for its time i really

1631
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:22,740
enjoyed playing through that one of my amiga 500 ospher says remember when burger king gave us a

1632
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:28,100
code to let us unlock memories for ddr extreme on the playstation 2 us version it was a while

1633
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:32,980
after the game's release too that's right and that that was like a year after the game was that was

1634
02:04:32,980 --> 02:04:37,140
crazy yeah it was one of those things where they knew that the song was in there but there was it

1635
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:41,860
was locked and they thought it was just like oh this is just something that they left on there

1636
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:46,340
but they didn't really you know utilize it yeah and then come to find out oh there is actually a

1637
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:52,980
lock code there yep yep uh nemesis 47 replied and said there was the ronald mcdonald game on

1638
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:59,620
the sega genesis which was enjoyable and also sonic 3 fruit roll-ups anyone uh degener johnny

1639
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:03,300
says to be completely honest the one commercial game i keep close to my heart is the seven up

1640
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:07,220
spot game for the sega genesis to this day it still ranks as one of the most enjoyable

1641
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:11,940
platformers i've ever played by the way where is that little guy that's a good question whatever

1642
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:18,340
happened to spot i guess all the best advertising you know things go away after a while though it'll

1643
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:22,580
come back in 20 years it's just like no one remembers the california raisins and they had

1644
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:27,860
you know that game too i will always i will always remember the where's the beef lady i mean i

1645
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:32,900
understand she probably died or something but you know a long time ago but where's the beef that was

1646
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:39,220
the she was wondering where the beef was because only the beef would have saved her life the beef

1647
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:44,900
unfortunately contained the cure for her uh illness and she never found it so she died all

1648
02:05:44,900 --> 02:05:50,420
right uh hitstun says yo noid was random and bad and i loved it everything everyone and everything

1649
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:55,140
are trying to kill the dominos pizza mascot or make them lose a card game the game requires

1650
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:59,380
throwing a yo-yo at random places to find invisible items that you needed to survive it would have

1651
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:05,220
been nearly as interesting if it starred a masked ninja with a bird all right and uh lastly going

1652
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:11,220
over to google plus and looking some of the answers over there appletainment replies and says

1653
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:16,580
to be honest as i sit here sit being my heineken while listening to the new coldplay cd i abhor

1654
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:22,100
product placement in all of its forms i avoid product placement similar to how i avoid the noid

1655
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:26,980
i can even think i can't even think of any good or bad product placement in games especially the

1656
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:32,900
new mirror's edge coming in time for the future that answer reminded me of that one scene from

1657
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:41,540
wayne's world that's exactly right i will not bow down to corporate sponsorship uh and lastly

1658
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:46,420
act dev says probably the burger king games and the doritos games on xbox though there are a few

1659
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:52,100
games on mobile devices that are fun enough as well uh quickly going around the room any um

1660
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:59,060
commercial based games that you enjoyed i like the burger king games i'm very sad they never came out

1661
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:04,260
with they're supposed to be doing more with connect yeah like what the hell um then they

1662
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:09,380
also checks quest because that was pretty awesome i just got a text message from our buddy jason who

1663
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:14,020
i believe is stuck in traffic in the bay area right now who said checks quest uh so that's

1664
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:20,660
awesome and then uh i did like cool spot cool spot was one of my favorite games uh dark sakura did you

1665
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:27,060
have a commercially sponsored game that you admit was a guilty pleasure not really i thought you

1666
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:33,620
liked the spot game no oh all right um yeah i actually really didn't have too many of the

1667
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:41,140
sponsored games i just i'm trying to think and no i don't really think i did i was a big fan

1668
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:45,540
of sneak king that would have been my answer but some of the chatters uh beat me to it alan's here

1669
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:50,100
hi alan hello what do you want to say just submit all right submit so does it have to be a game

1670
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:56,020
specifically put out by a product company or just can it be a real game with all that also

1671
02:07:56,020 --> 02:08:00,580
had the sponsors sure a real game that has sponsors why not crazy taxi is an amazing game

1672
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:07,540
and that had real stuff in it pizza hut kfc and what else that that was uh the the offspring

1673
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:12,580
yeah well no that was just licensed music but i mean like take me to p take me to pizza hut like

1674
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:18,100
the the people it was a part of the game yeah that's a good answer i could vote for um crazy

1675
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:22,660
taxi didn't they take that out of some versions like later on they didn't they would just say take

1676
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:28,340
me to pizza or something or they'd just say take me to the hut yeah they were just generic

1677
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:34,340
also take me to the shoe store because of when this happened and just how it was so weird but

1678
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:41,140
space quest 5 um which was only done by one of the two guys from andromeda the sierra online game

1679
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:46,740
space quest 5 had in it it was mostly a star trek parody uh because you were the captain of a junk

1680
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:51,300
ship and whenever you pulled up the comm screen like in star trek when they talked to the guy in

1681
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:57,620
the window there would be a switch to sprint and the sprint logo for real like they paid for that

1682
02:08:57,620 --> 02:09:04,020
placement and it's like and this was like 91 or 92 so this was i want to say it was groundbreaking

1683
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:09,140
but it was like what is going on wasn't that back when like murphy brown was doing sprint commercials

1684
02:09:09,140 --> 02:09:14,180
yes and it was the weirdest thing and it's a perfectly good point and click adventure game but

1685
02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:20,020
sprint the phone company was in space quest 5 whatever happened to candice bergen it was

1686
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:25,940
random thought and then in space quest 6 when they brought back the um announcer from laughing

1687
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:32,740
if you try to click on like the edge of a bridge that's broken um if you want to like try and jump

1688
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:38,500
across it it's like no no and uh you have to you have to do a walking jump because in this game

1689
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:44,900
you can't switch to sprint so they referenced the previous that there was sprint sponsorship in five

1690
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:49,860
and six wow that's those are some good answers alan i'm glad you popped in here game you're welcome

1697
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:30,260
a happy canada day belated to all our canadian friends because that was what monday so all right

1698
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:36,020
uh that was day the first oh tuesday so i i got my calendar all made jeez rob i know it was the

1699
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:40,500
first one would think you didn't live in canada well actually i have a really funny story about

1700
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:44,660
when i went to canada for the fourth of july yet we found ourselves there on canada day but i'll

1701
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:47,860
have to tell that another week because we're running long all right uh let's get back into

1702
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:57,220
some gaming news loki all right um so the oculus um they of course are been sending out dev kits

1703
02:10:57,220 --> 02:11:02,580
and you know uh there's dev kit 2 coming right around the corner in fact i think they started

1704
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:09,220
shipping that but they had to suspend sales of dev kit 2 actually to china the reason being is

1705
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:17,620
that they've had an extreme reseller um purchasing problems in china and so they're just flipping the

1706
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:23,780
over there to make a quick buck and they're basically saying no we need to make sure that

1707
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:28,580
we're doing what we can to make sure that um resellers that are looking to flip our product

1708
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:33,620
for profit are not taking stock away from legitimate developer purchases globally our

1709
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:38,580
product in its current form is development kit and meant for developers to develop vr content and

1710
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:43,700
we're looking into alternative ways to make sure that our development kits are gained to legitimate

1711
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:48,660
developer hands in china and because of that now we're forced to suspend an entire country

1712
02:11:48,660 --> 02:11:55,860
from purchasing i'll let you put two and two togethers um so i don't know in other words

1713
02:11:55,860 --> 02:12:00,740
we're gonna make sure that bobby blackwolf's uh oculus development kit does not end up in china

1714
02:12:01,620 --> 02:12:07,060
on a shady street corner it is kind of lame that they're doing that um that sucks for the legit

1715
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:15,540
people but piracy is crazy in other countries well there's even people like just legit just

1716
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:19,940
reselling the original kits and i'm sure a lot more are going to be doing that now that

1717
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:24,100
you know the dev kit 2 is coming out but i'm sure there's going to be a lot of people just

1718
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:29,380
even all over the country buying that stuff but you know not in bulk i think that's a good

1719
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:32,500
question hey bobby i know he's in our chat room because bobby's commenting on this saying they

1720
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:36,580
haven't started chipping yet i'm in the first batch here this is a good question for bobby

1721
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:41,140
what are you going to do with your dev kit 1 when you get dev kit 2 i don't know well bobby's also

1722
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:45,300
the type he's probably keeping it he's like i'm gonna have them both um but i'd be curious what

1723
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:48,820
a lot of people out there are doing with their dev kit ones i wonder if those are the things

1724
02:12:48,820 --> 02:12:53,220
that are going to end up you know it's it's got it's like how um uh you know like the biggest

1725
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:58,100
buyers of like used iphones are people in other countries where they don't have iphones officially

1726
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:02,180
you know so i wonder it would be kind of fun to have one just to mess around with but yeah

1727
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:08,180
i mean i don't know i don't want to spend that kind of money yet yeah you got you got you have

1728
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:14,900
to finish your 2d game first before you can start on your technically in 3d yeah you have to finish

1729
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:19,540
that first before you get to your he says he's keeping it he said he said that in chat he's

1730
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:24,820
keeping it yeah all right i had a feeling knowing bobby he he likes to demo that stuff too so he

1731
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:27,940
would get used to having two of them but i bet there's a lot of people out there that are going

1732
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:35,380
to unload their dev kit ones so all right um going back to uh some more news and uh i know

1733
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:39,380
this is a game that uh loki loves a lot although i don't know if you play this version of it

1734
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:45,140
minecraft pocket edition i have pocket edition i just don't play it uh pocket edition is of course

1735
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:51,460
the one that's uh on the ios and android and uh i think they have it in some other places too

1736
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:56,580
uh did the uya get the pocket edition no they they advertised that they were going to be getting that

1737
02:13:56,580 --> 02:14:01,300
but they never did they never did all right well anyway um a huge update coming for minecraft

1738
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:05,540
pocket edition it's going to be launching on thursday was that thursday this past week or

1739
02:14:05,540 --> 02:14:12,660

1740
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:19,380
and this version will feature infinite worlds that's a big one caves new blocks and items

including monster eggs and huge mushroom blocks wolves where you can tame a loyal companion loads

1742
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:32,660
of new flowers uh new mobs including endermen and mushrooms new biomes from the pc version mesas

1743
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:38,020
jungle swamps and extreme hills abandoned mine shafts villages and other cool places again that

1744
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:43,860
sounds like it's from pc uh an interaction button so you'll never accidentally punch a sheep again

1745
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:50,180
uh and there'll be a new new feature generation including lakes vines and monster rooms and of

1746
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:57,860
course the ever popular bug fixes so if you are uh and this thing still sells like crazy on the

1747
02:14:57,860 --> 02:15:04,260
ios like the itunes yeah it's good that they're getting it up to that same level yeah and i mean

1748
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:13,300
if you buy one of these you know uh you google tv you know the android tv or i think you can

1749
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:18,420
sideload in newia but the version that they had available didn't have controller support so that's

1750
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:22,180
why i could never get it to work although that was supposed to be coming so i don't know if that

1751
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:26,820
has been added in there at some point i hope it does because i can't play that game on the

1752
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:32,340
touch screen it just it's not fun at all yeah and they did they had a version with controller

1753
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:39,700
support for the um what was it the expiria play but they never ported that stuff over to the

1754
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:44,580
regular pocket edition which is kind of lame are they still planning on the whole uh playstation

1755
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:49,060
4 version will bring in the playstation 3 worlds yeah they're still doing that they just haven't

1756
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:54,500
released the play or have they released the playstation no i believe it's on deck for

1757
02:15:54,500 --> 02:16:00,180
july or august so i think it's excuse me pick up it's soon it's around the corner yeah because

1758
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:04,420
they're going to have the via version coming out also in the xbox one version i'm sure they're

1759
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:09,460
going to disc based versions for all those as well um i'm interested to see what they do with it i

1760
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:14,740
it's been so long since i played minecraft and i feel bad about it because i'm still paying for

1761
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:20,500
the server and it's just like i understand you got yeah well it's just like you know i

1762
02:16:22,180 --> 02:16:28,100
it's hard to get people playing all the time you know uh if i opened it up publicly maybe

1763
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:32,260
but then that then you have to maintain you have to deal with trolls and who knows what

1764
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:39,860
well there's ways around that but it's just yeah it's tough all right well let's move on

1765
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:44,420
with some more news dark sakura well we do actually have more news isn't that great

1766

02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:31,780
justin gary wall of essence by israel cartwright chasm skulker by mike newman master of predicaments

1773
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:36,500
there's basically a bunch of them on here my favorite is goblin kaboomist

1774
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:41,060
because i used to have a goblin deck that makes me laugh sorry this whole story is making me

1775
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:45,700
snicker because i realized we just had a missed opportunity to do a list list here with card i

1776
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:53,140
would put in magic 2015 maybe in a future week because i was thinking oh they have all these

1777
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:59,300
celebrity designers but i don't see dark sakura doing a card for magic 2015 but mox mox prism what

1778
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:08,740
if she could tap to win the game bored yeah tap the wing game board uh wouldn't that be the

1779
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:12,420
wouldn't that be what the notch card would do is you tap this card to throw all the cards up in the

1780
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:20,420
air and quit table flip card to win game or to be done at least all right uh go to the chat room

1781
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:25,540
over at live.vog network.com dark tetsuya says i saw richard garriott's card it even references

1782
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:30,820
the avatar from the ultima series well that's pretty cool i like those little little references

1783
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:37,860
to a classic gaming's past especially a series as legendary as ultima all right loki oh thank

1784
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:45,140
god ubisoft is uh managed to uh come out victorious against a lawsuit a patent lawsuit against them

1785
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:53,060
you play apparently a company or a digital a company that held the patent digital regs

1786
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:58,660
of texas um which i'm trying to see what the patent actually was called you know because

1787
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:06,580
it's always something very generic uh i guess uh was it remotely tracking access to software after

1788
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:12,900
distribution post distribution security and other typical functions of digital rights management

1789
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:20,420
software um of course they had various numerous reasons among them that you know i guess an

1790
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:26,420
agreement between digital reg and valve covering third-party use drm or something whatever i'm just

1791
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:33,540
sad that it did actually end up going through because now uplay's gotta still be there and

1792
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:39,220
uplay sucks they do really try to shove that you play thing down people's throats stop trying to

1793
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:44,100
make it work no one wants you play it's not the worst thing in the world actually i like the fact

1794
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:47,860
that it kind of has the synergy between all the different games but the problem that ends up

1795
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:52,260
happening is that then every company wants that and things get so fragmented it's like what's

1796
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:57,220
starting to happen to netflix everybody's pulling their crap off netflix because hbo wants to do

1797
02:19:57,220 --> 02:20:01,140
their own thing and you know these other companies want to do their own thing and it's like when

1798
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:06,100
things get super fragmented then it's just like oh fuck this this isn't worth it anymore i'm not

1799
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:10,340
going to sign up here here here there needs to be a centralized thing that's that's the only thing

1800
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:16,900
i i problem i have with uplay but i liked that you know i could get achievements or do things in one

1801
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:22,180
game and i could get a reward somewhere else like trying out assassin's creed and getting a few

1802
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:25,940
points there could unlock a song and just dance or something like that that was i gotta think

1803
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:31,380
though that that could still be accomplished through like steam or something i mean there's

1804
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:36,900
gotta be the way to check to see if you have an achievement or something of another game true i

1805
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:40,980
would think i mean i at least there should be a way to do that but then they can't get your email

1806
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:49,780
address and track you and oh target ads all right uh hey a twitch app may be coming big rumor may

1807
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:54,340
be coming to the 3ds and the playstation vita hold on this doesn't mean you're going to be able to

1808
02:20:54,340 --> 02:21:00,340
stream your games um but in a recent interview the co of twitch kevin lin said that the company

1809
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:06,100
would like to bring the twitch application to the 3ds and playstation vita however it would

1810
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:12,500
only be for viewing this by the way following comments from reggie fees may at e3 that twitch

1811
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:16,420
wouldn't come to the wii u because they don't think that streaming 30 minutes of gameplay by

1812
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:23,060
itself is a lot of fun so it's because the wii u can't handle it which we all know is really the

1813
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:28,580
case and we you can and he can't come up there and say yeah we'd love to do that bar systems

1814
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:33,620
underpowered and we can't handle that he can't say that but he really should have just more stuck

1815
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:38,580
to the you know well we've chosen to go with youtube and we think that mario kart 8 looks

1816
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:42,820
great on youtube and people are having a lot of fun with this and and look at the angry luigi

1817
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:47,220
meme that meme that came out of this like that that like you don't have to dog what's happening

1818
02:21:47,220 --> 02:21:56,580
with twitch because again like honestly ironically nintendo at e3 kind of mastered the twitch game

1819
02:21:56,580 --> 02:22:02,340
like they got a lot of people really interested in their shit and a big part of that is because

1820
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:07,300
of the twitch and you see a lot of people really commending them for hey you know what was awesome

1821
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:13,220
about nintendo nintendo like showed actual fucking games at e3 and the games that were in motion they

1822
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:18,260
didn't show cgi packaged things or these pre-packaged demos like they showed the real

1823
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:22,420
stuff and they put that out there so it's it's kind of weird that reggie would say something

1824
02:22:22,420 --> 02:22:28,100
like that when like nintendo actually has a lot they can gain from twitch but i understand if the

1825
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:34,500
wii u technologically can't stream the whole twitch thing like the xbox 360 and the xbox one

1826
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:40,100
can well let's focus on what it can do the mario kart 8 stuff on youtube was was pretty cool you

1827
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:44,900
know and surprised the hell out of me honestly you guys all know when i first talked about mario kart

1828
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:54,020
8 i was like welcome to online nintendo and it is good very very good so all right anyway um

1829
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:59,860
let's move on are we are we just about to the mailbag i think we are it's that time where we're

1830
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:04,900
going to open up the mailbag because you guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orange

1831

with my toe dipping a toe in participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send us an email

1834
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:27,620

1835
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:33,140
so that all of the spam going to the old one before hopefully it's it's all bounced now and

1836
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:37,220
it's gone but we'll we'll see i don't know it's never gone yeah that's true it's never gone

1838
02:23:41,380 --> 02:23:49,380
with the show and dark soccer will read the emails right now hello lr while traveling to and from the

1839
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:54,900
too many games convention in the philly area last weekend i listened to last last week's show rob

1840
02:23:54,900 --> 02:24:00,420
you're welcome if ever there's a sequel to bungee ferret toss uh tossing i will ask you and others

1841
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:07,700
for even more cat pictures oh this is cyyr speaking of bft i was hoping to port it to unity

1842
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:13,780
over the next year destination steam the hardest part will be figuring out a control configuration

1843
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:19,220
that matches the precision and flexibility of an xbox 360 controller but also works with a keyboard

1844
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:24,180
and mouse i do have a few ideas and i'll be working on it so wait do we just like kind of

1845
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:29,460
sort of get confirmation that bungee ferret tossing is planned for steam not that it's

1846
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:36,660
happening but it's planned hmm you guys were talking about the current dismal state of konami

1847
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:40,900
and there is one thing you guys missed bimani is still a significant portion of their business model

1848
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:48,580
they are still running 2dx ddr pop music and guitar alongside their newer releases

1849
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:57,140
jubit um reflect beat sound voltex booth and dance evolution arcade all of those games are current

1850
02:24:57,140 --> 02:25:01,940
and regularly updated with new songs and unlocks true none of it is on home consoles and none of

1851
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:07,860
it is officially in america with the exception of some ios versions but neither of those markets

1852
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:12,980
seem viable right now so i don't blame them is this the majority of konami's business heck no

1853
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:18,260
but it's obviously significantly enough to be a measurable part of their bottom line and seriously

1854
02:25:18,260 --> 02:25:22,500
if you haven't already you guys should take a day trip to sunnyvale and try out ddr 2013 it's pretty

1855
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:27,940
fantastic i didn't realize they had that around here um i think they're getting that actually at

1856
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:32,500
scandia soon i want to say that they're i thought that they were upgrading to that it wouldn't

1857
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:38,820
surprise me because they have a lot of other stuff at scandia but um i i i do it's kind of one of

1858
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:42,500
those things where it's like okay i i get that point and i respect that viewpoint and everything

1859
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:47,860
but it's still it's very hard to sit here after we kind of had that whole peak of ddr in this

1860
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:53,780
hey you know what i was like disappeared i i will take a playstation 4 xbox one game

1861
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:59,140
that's in japan because you can import that shit and it's region free so that's fine i will take

1862
02:25:59,140 --> 02:26:04,740
that but we're not gonna see it even like a dance evolution game or something i don't know it's very

1863
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:10,340
frustrating i just kind of feel like it still feels so small compared to what it could or

1864
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:14,500
should have been i don't know that's where my frustrations come from and i realize they're

1865
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:20,500
still making it but how big is it really but maybe bigger in japan than it is here

1866
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:25,220
and my perspective is screwed i don't know but i will say i still see more konami slot machines

1867
02:26:25,220 --> 02:26:32,260
than i do you know ddr machines anymore i too limit the lack of any ridge racer developed by

1868
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:38,340
namco proper and i'm really disappointed that neither the xbox one nor the ps4 have a ridge

1869
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:44,020
racer game at lunch heck the ps4 is the first Sony console ever not to have one and that's

1870
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:49,940
counting both psp and vita i think that handling the franchise handing the franchise off to a third

1871
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:55,380
party was a mistake the vita version was poorly handled and i worried that ridge will join f0 as

1872
02:26:55,380 --> 02:27:01,220
a prize he had ignored racing franchise i i hope it doesn't happen because six and seven were at

1873
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:06,260
least in my opinion absolutely the highest point of the series loaded to the brim with the amazing

1874
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:12,020
course design and lightning fast action namco does better than anyone else this goes out to loki as

1875
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:17,780
well as anyone who wants to to program anything ever i may not be a pro i may have only developed

1876
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:23,620
a handful of games but i wholeheartedly believe in the 80 20 rule you'll spend 80 of your programming

1877
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:30,420
time on 20 of the result and vice versa a lot of it is spent on the things your players won't see

1878
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:35,700
or fixing things or figuring out how to do things or just figuring out that everything really does

1879
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:40,820
take three times longer than you expected yep that's about right three times is actually a very

1880
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:47,060
accurate estimate and this really is the truth if you are seriously working on a game you don't

1881
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:52,260
really have time to actually play much of anything but it's all part of the game no pun intended and

1882
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:56,980
anyone passionate about creating green games will agree that's well worth it keep fighting that good

1883
02:27:56,980 --> 02:28:03,060
fight aaron yyr thank you for the very good email lots and lots of points in that email and i agree

1884
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:08,260
with what he said about ridge racer i really hope it doesn't go the way of f0 and uh you know

1885
02:28:08,260 --> 02:28:12,340
disappear although i guess we had word that bandai namco is developing something else in

1886
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:16,900
the racing area it's just they're not developing they're publishing oh yeah very good point you're

1887
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:21,460
right very important distinction and not the same thing it's a cool looking game i mean it's

1888
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:26,500
absolutely amazing dan's gonna probably have to pick it up because it looks fantastic but uh

1889
02:28:27,540 --> 02:28:32,820
i don't know uh bobby blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com says speaking of f0

1890
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:38,260
i did play an oculus rift demo full game on kickstarter which is an f0 slash wipeout style

1891
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:43,780
racer it was really good in vr mode oh my gosh i would think a game that fast would make me barf

1892
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:50,100
on oculus maybe not i mean maybe they've they've toned it down or it's not as bad as i think it is

1893
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:57,140
but uh that might be too much speed for vr it might be a bit much all right uh let us uh since

1894
02:28:57,140 --> 02:29:01,700
that's it for emails sadly but you should email us participate at orangelandtrady.com if you want

1895
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:05,860
to be heard on a future week but now would be the time that we do the FUs of the week

1896
02:29:05,860 --> 02:29:31,620
um fu 2 last minute prop making for cosplays and uh aerosol paint

1897
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:39,940
i've been there but it was costuming for stage shows so i feel your pain fu to the fact that

1898
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:44,100
i don't have any cosplay at all for gamer x i'm going to be so uncool i really need to fix that

1899
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:49,780
for game or for uh dragon con but fu to the fact that i'll probably need to lose about 20 pounds

1900
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:55,300
first um and fu my my real real fu i wanted to do is if you did the fact that i slept wrong on my

1901
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:59,700
back or something earlier this week and like my back has been hurting for like a week straight

1902
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:04,100
it's getting better but it's just like one of those like oh it hurts it keeps me like somebody's

1903
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:10,660
poking me poke poke poke poke poke stop it you're annoying stop poking me logan uh just after you've

1904
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:16,260
been tired because even when i slept today he's made me more tired now's a great time to start

1905
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:21,620
drinking coffee i oh yeah you got red bull all right yeah that's right you don't fuck around

1906
02:30:21,620 --> 02:30:28,900

going to warn you i'm not going to have it open for very very long so uh don't be shy make sure

1910
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:50,260
you get through um but but first we still have two stories before we get there so uh loki so

1911
02:30:51,220 --> 02:30:55,380
when would you think they would announce the reveal the new doom game

1912
02:30:55,380 --> 02:31:02,900
well everyone thought quake con and yeah it's gonna be a quake on so uh july 17th you'll see

1913
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:11,700
you'll get the first look at doom and um yeah is this like doom reboot this is the brand new doom

1914
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:17,060
game yeah it's you know the one that they have the beta test for in wolfenstein new order yeah

1915
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:28,100
yeah oh right right um i didn't pick up that game so so yeah cool i mean i don't know um

1916
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:33,540
hard to say much more until we actually see it right i mean yeah doom is gonna be doom

1917
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:40,420
um i'm curious to see who's actually doing it if it's actually id software or if they're kind of

1918
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:44,900
outsourcing it like they did with uh wolfenstein newer because wolfenstein newer i hear is pretty

1919
02:31:44,900 --> 02:31:52,340
good yeah so um it'd be interesting to kind of see what it looks like all right well it's a

1920
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:55,860
classic series that you know we've been waiting for a new title in for a very long time what there

1921
02:31:55,860 --> 02:32:02,740
hasn't been one since this would be doom 4 right uh so what doom 3 was xbox era right so i remember

1922
02:32:02,740 --> 02:32:09,460
owning that on xbox yeah it's xbox pc and then they did the hd remasters of those yeah um so

1923
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:15,220
it's been a while all right well um i think this hopefully it's not as terrible as quake

1924
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:22,180
4 because quake 4 not so good this is very interesting because uh there's a game on

1925
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:29,140
uya called chess 2 and uh it will it does not have a synchronous multiplayer it used to

1926
02:32:29,140 --> 02:32:35,620
but what happened is that microsoft issued a court order this recently uh that is levied against the

1927
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:41,300
game's dns management service um this is interesting microsoft apparently seized

1928
02:32:41,300 --> 02:32:48,900
22 of the domains from this no ip dns service that chest 2 ran because there was evidence of malware

1929
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:53,140
creators distributing harmful software from the subdomains yeah i think it's just they are just

1930
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:58,260
cutting the collateral damage of that it wasn't oh yeah i'm not saying chest 2 is the cause of this

1931
02:32:58,260 --> 02:33:04,580
but it just because of what's going on over here chest 2 got impacted with this so uh very

1932
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:08,500
interesting but just in case you didn't know microsoft does have a cyber crime division and

1933
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:13,380
they do work with law enforcement when there's uh like botnet driven internet attacks that happen

1934
02:33:13,380 --> 02:33:19,060
so yeah chess 2 did come out for the uya in january it is scheduled for a release on the ipad

1935
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:24,420
and pc versions via steam no word if this is going to set it back at all if they're going to have to

1936
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:30,820
figure something out there so we'll see what happens with chess 2 and if they can get it

1937
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:35,220
back online now here's my question about chess 2 is it is it just chess or do they like actually

1938
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:42,020
like i think there's things i think there's some like tweaks to it um i've i looked at it briefly

1939
02:33:42,020 --> 02:33:47,220
but i think there's actually tweaks to it that changed the way it's played very interesting uh

1940
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:51,860
tiger claw on chat says i use the no ip service they have a free domain service well you might

1941
02:33:51,860 --> 02:33:56,820
want to look into this this might be a little bit a little bit alarming but i guess um i guess the

1942
02:33:56,820 --> 02:34:00,980
ceo of no ip says quote we have been throwing everything we have at getting you back online

1943
02:34:00,980 --> 02:34:05,220
with the light least possible delay for legal reasons we have been restricted from reaching

1944
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:09,220
out to you but we simply cannot stay quiet any longer we are very close to a resolution and

1945
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:15,380
we'll update you with more information as soon as we can like chess 2 the sequel is what it's called

1946
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:24,420
it says compare the chess chess 2 relies much less on memorizing openings and more on positional play

1947
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:30,100
there are fewer draws and uh the asymmetric gameplay with multiple matchups keeps the game

1948
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:34,420
fresh and interesting that's kind of cool that somebody although part of this kind of reminds

1949
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:38,900
me of what was that movie this is really cheesy comedy where they were putting on hamlet 2

1950
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:44,740
where the guy was like called hamlet 2 oh was that oh the movie was called hamlet 2 okay yeah

1951
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:50,180
i'm just thinking of demolition i'm not demolition man um last action hero and hamlet's taking out

1952
02:34:50,180 --> 02:34:57,780
the trash not to be uh hamlet 2 was one of those like really stupid funny movies where they had

1953
02:34:57,780 --> 02:35:01,780
like rock me sexy jesus and all this i don't even remember like why jesus was in hamlet but he was

1954
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:09,460
anyway all right uh 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange launch radio the skype line is

02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:19,860

02:35:19,860 --> 02:35:25,060
it was released in theaters it was like direct to dvd anyway we're talking way too much about

1962
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:50,420

1963
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:55,700
saying that um it's seeking to inspire his students uh dana undertakes to write and produce

1964

an original play a sequel to hamlet featuring time travel to avoid the deaths of the characters

1965
02:35:59,700 --> 02:36:02,980

1986
02:37:56,340 --> 02:38:02,900
game show what kind of gaming are you doing these cons if any um they actually had a uh a uh

1987
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:08,020
well here's the thing um one of the local game leagues he'll be here called the color the

1988
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:14,580
colorado cutthroat connection they had the destiny alpha available there and it is a pretty sweet

1989
02:38:14,580 --> 02:38:20,260
game on the ps4 oh right because that was the weekend like because that whole con happened

1990
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:24,980
right after e3 so they got their hands on that and had it available for everyone to play that's smart

1991
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:28,500
because it was only up for a limited time yep i actually got to play it though it's actually a

1992
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:35,940
mixture of halo meets borderlands too so to speak minus the cortana crap of course i noticed the the

1993
02:38:35,940 --> 02:38:39,700
borderland so i that surprised me because i was expecting destiny to just kind of like be another

1994
02:38:39,700 --> 02:38:44,820
halo type of game but yeah definitely i felt some of that borderlands influence in it so i'm i'm

1995
02:38:44,820 --> 02:38:48,900
excited to see what the final product is like but even the alpha i got killed in the alpha way too

1996
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:54,180
easy um i got killed like a couple times though but it's pretty it's it's pretty it's pretty

tonight oh why not i mean that's what the show is for isn't it just you know just driving around

2023
02:41:15,220 --> 02:41:19,540
and sick anyways did i in between dropouts and everything else that i've been dealing with and

2024
02:41:19,540 --> 02:41:25,940
sell coverage and all the concepts did i hear you call superstar wars a good game yes you are

2025
02:41:26,020 --> 02:41:30,980
fucking crazy sir what no you're fucking crazy wait are we thinking the super nintendo game

2026
02:41:31,700 --> 02:41:39,060
yeah yeah super nintendo super star wars empire strike back those games are fucking

2027
02:41:39,060 --> 02:41:45,620
terrible you you just sucked at them that's why you're mad i i'm i'm not i'm not gonna say like

2028
02:41:45,620 --> 02:41:51,460
it's it's funny to make this argument because i played them i will play them again but put

2029
02:41:51,460 --> 02:41:57,700
together those games are very very poorly put together they have a terrible engine they are

2030
02:41:57,700 --> 02:42:03,300
fucking hard i only made any progress on those games because i was a habitual game genie user

2031
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:10,420
as a kid i remember renting the game i don't think i beat it but i had like a heck of a time with it

2032
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:16,340
over you know uh yeah and then run it and that's the funny part is that that kind of a situation

2033
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:23,140
can happen but the game is terrible like go back and play it you will be frustrated out of your

2034
02:42:23,140 --> 02:42:27,860
goddamn mind uh you can i'm looking i'm looking at the wiki right now because i wanted to see like

2035
02:42:27,860 --> 02:42:31,940
what the reviews were not that reviewers are the end-all be-all but i wanted to see like where

2036
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:39,140
kind of opinion lied uh star wars was re-released on virtual console in 2009 uh which i don't know

2037
02:42:39,140 --> 02:42:42,420
if that necessarily means it's still available and that doesn't mean we you that means you have

2038
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:48,260
to go into the we emulation and grab it out of that store uh but i will say superstar wars was

2039
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:54,820
awarded best action adventure game of 1992 by electronic gaming monthly as well as best movie

2040
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:59,220
to game but i don't know anything about like what their average review is but i thought this

2041
02:42:59,220 --> 02:43:05,380
has been a pretty well-received game um and like i said it's not it's not that i it's it's truly

2042
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:11,780
not that i hate it because i played all three of them a number of times and like i said i will do

2043
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:17,540
so again but put together like there's something there's something about those games that looking

2044
02:43:17,540 --> 02:43:25,460
at them in hindsight just doesn't really sit well with me um the and and at the same time it's even

2045
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:32,580
weirder because there was the old the old uh 3d arcade uh star wars where you just pointed at one

2046
02:43:32,580 --> 02:43:39,300
direction of the screen and shot but it's like the good star wars games to me were x-wing x-wing

2047
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:44,020
versus tie fighter rebel alliance and all those kinds of things star wars empire strikes back

2048
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:49,940
superstar wars empire strikes back in return the jedi are really like monotonous mindless games

2049
02:43:49,940 --> 02:43:55,060
and it would be it would be a really good idea for you to revisit those you're still going to

2050
02:43:55,860 --> 02:44:01,860
like facets of the game but all told the game is just particularly strange

2051
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:08,180
well you're getting a very mixed bag in chat uh bobby's threatening to fire you

2052
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:13,860
from the voice of vog right now there's there's there's characters that aren't in the canon

2053
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:20,420
the all of the vehicle levels are not that good the game like i said if i did not cheat

2054
02:44:20,420 --> 02:44:26,020
i would not have made any progress in many in large parts of those games i will have to revisit

2055
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:30,180
these games shortly and tell you if if i still think they hold up all these times later but i

2056
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:34,340
just remember really enjoying them when i was younger uh ssj100 mad i think kind of sums this

2057
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:39,540
up well saying a superstar wars was great and terrible at the same time terrible isn't hard

2058
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:44,020
yeah it it really is a huge conflict like that and i'll tell you what i don't know if you're

2059
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:48,180
going to have time for this but because i'm here all week depending on when you guys get in this

2060
02:44:48,180 --> 02:44:56,260
weekend let's find an hour sit down and record the games and talk about it because i'm here you can

2061
02:44:56,260 --> 02:45:00,500
come to the office we have ample everything to be able to do this kind of stuff let's sit down and

2062
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:05,220
play these games again you want because you want to do is a youtube series where we revisit these

2063
02:45:05,220 --> 02:45:10,020
old games i i don't know about a series because i can't commit to that physically but to have the

2064
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:14,580
two of us in the same place all right revisiting what our memories are just seems like something

2065
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:18,660
that we can do to take advantage of the fact that i'm out here for the time being all right you're

2066
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:22,900
on you're on if we have time i would love to do that plus you need to see my office that i'm

2067
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:29,700
currently parked outside so you know we do we do all right well jason you thank you for sharing

2068
02:45:29,700 --> 02:45:34,580
your opinion it is it is the show where every gamer has a voice even if they are using those

2069
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:41,620
voices incorrectly it's fine no i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding all right all right well you

2070
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:46,340
know i have to use my voice more than just 30 seconds of time of show i know i know all right

2071
02:45:47,460 --> 02:45:53,060
act def says hey i'm jason grump i'm sky not so grump oh lord no no no we're doing our own thing

2072
02:45:53,060 --> 02:45:58,420
all right i somehow i knew he was going to make reference to that but in my defense my thoughts

2073
02:45:58,420 --> 02:46:02,660
on that game predates the the reference that he's making is that the game grumps played super

2074
02:46:02,660 --> 02:46:07,540
empire strikes back and and i thought that they went a little overboard on the fact that it is a

2075
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:15,380
very hard game but my feelings on how the game works predates that by a fair amount so and we

2076
02:46:15,380 --> 02:46:21,620
will have dark sakura with us who is the biggest grump of all we all know that i would don't make

2077
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:25,540
me get up from this chair welcome to come to i want to hear this deconstruction i want all

2078
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:29,380
40 bucks to be there all right i would say four but i know what the plan already is yeah all

2079
02:46:29,380 --> 02:46:32,900

2089
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:24,740

2091
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:36,100
now rama what's on your mind buddy um i demand that vxa jason xv turns in his gamer card

2092
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:44,500
i have all three of those games sitting on my shelf and i will sit here i'll break out the

2093
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:50,180
super nes and i will play those games yes they were hard but that was a fun kind of hard and

2094
02:47:50,180 --> 02:47:56,020
that's a type of hard difficulty level where you go i bet you'll get one of those professional

2095
02:47:56,020 --> 02:48:04,660
gamers who can play call of duty black ops 2 featuring carl winslow blindfolded one hand who

2096
02:48:04,660 --> 02:48:08,580
can go through the entire game you sit the little bastard right here in front of the super nes with

2097
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:13,780
the game controller wouldn't know what the fuck to do rob didn't pick you up superstar wars now

2098
02:48:13,780 --> 02:48:17,300
got you super return of the jedi yeah super return of the jedi it's sadly it's in a box

2099
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:23,220
somewhere but uh yeah we're definitely gonna have to uh uh go revisit the games but look look in in

2100
02:48:23,220 --> 02:48:28,020
jason's defense and i'm gonna i'm gonna just leave jason alone i'm gonna i'm gonna do this whole

2101
02:48:28,020 --> 02:48:35,540
thing there's always some game that everybody seems to like that sometimes we just don't get

2102
02:48:35,540 --> 02:48:39,300
like for me for the longest time that was minecraft like i'm readily admit like all

2103
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:43,700
these people like going gaga over minecraft and i was like what's so fucking great about minecraft

2104
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:49,140
kind of gave it a second look and i i finally understood but you know it's it's i i understood

2105
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:53,860
what he was saying is that you know he's he's not dogging on the games for the present it's it's you

2106
02:48:53,860 --> 02:48:59,220
know the difficulty was so crazy that a lot of people didn't even really get to see the entire

2107
02:48:59,220 --> 02:49:05,060
games well i guess i was one of the lucky ones who did i tell you what i probably won't be able

2108
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:09,220
to go through the entire game and do it again but i'll sit there and give them my damndest to do it

2109
02:49:10,180 --> 02:49:12,660
you you're you're hardcore my friend that's why

2110
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:19,780
no i'm not hardcore it's just that there are some games that are out there either they're

2111
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:25,300
so easy you'll play through all over multiple times where it's so hard that you you just won't

2112
02:49:25,300 --> 02:49:29,380
give up you just play it right through and it's just fun and enjoyable now if you want to talk

2113
02:49:29,380 --> 02:49:34,100
about a game that's a pain in the ass to complete uh the simpsons bark versus space mutants you

2114
02:49:34,340 --> 02:49:39,460
mean to tell me i get through the two the entire level without getting hit twice come on son well

2115
02:49:39,460 --> 02:49:45,780
how about you want like a hard game how about like battle toads or or uh ghosts and goblins or some

2116
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:51,940
of that insane shit or the fact that rygar didn't have a save feature or even a password feature

2117
02:49:52,580 --> 02:49:58,740
like what the fuck whoops is all i have to say about that exactly exactly all right rama did

2118
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:03,300
you just call in to yell at jason actually no i wasn't actually going to call in at all because

2119
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:08,420
i was going to talk about something but since nemesis 47 opened the floodgates to turn the

2120
02:50:08,420 --> 02:50:15,620
chat into um general population and the fact that you mentioned anime expo i have something to say

2121

2133
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:37,300

2134
02:51:37,300 --> 02:51:43,940
considered drag race and sailor moon aren't that much different um well when you get the sailor

2171
02:54:55,220 --> 02:54:59,380
that are on kickstarter you'll never believe there's a brand new game that someone's trying

2172
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:04,580
to kickstart uh called coffin dodgers it's about elderly people racing in go-karts

2173
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:13,300
nice yes so that's that's interesting and then also there's a kickstarter for potato salad

2174
02:55:13,940 --> 02:55:19,220
because you know we haven't abused kickstarter enough someone kickstarted potato salad for

2175
02:55:19,220 --> 02:55:25,860
ten dollars and it's already up to like six grand but kickstarter makes they're five percent or

2176
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:32,660
whatever so hey and i mean it's aside for the fact that it's satire i understand that

2177
02:55:32,660 --> 02:55:36,260
and people are backing it but it's not necessarily people will go through with it

2178
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:44,420
it's still technically a fun my life project but it's just it's so stupid and it's just gonna get

2179
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:49,540
people to i mean why don't i do that i mean shit okay i'm gonna make myself a hamburger

2180
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:52,020
done kickstarter for 10 bucks

2181
02:55:54,180 --> 02:55:59,460
free money yeah better be a tasty burger it will be for six thousand dollars uh we didn't get a

2182
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:03,700
lot of tweets this week but i do notice that pika uno uh sent us a few tweets i want to make sure

2183
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:08,660
i read these uh because he was referencing those emails we had about uh gaming in belgium remember

2184
02:56:08,660 --> 02:56:13,780
that so pika uno uh tweeted us and said shame on you for last week's brussels sprouts pun

2185
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:19,460
also belgium is huge on comic books and stuff but the belgian people i know pretty much buy

2186
02:56:19,460 --> 02:56:26,340
all their stuff from amazon and online uh and pikaruna wants us to know hello i'm the person

2187
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:32,260
who bought eye of judgment at a massive discount which is really the best way to buy eye of

2188
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:39,860
judgment if you're gonna buy eye of judgment the best way is to huh for someone to pay you to get

2189
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:47,380
rid of it please take this off my hands so here's this in a coupon one last bit of uh news here if

2190
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:55,140
you're looking to purchase an xbox um well the connect version two the one that came with the

2191
02:56:55,140 --> 02:57:00,580
xbox one and you don't have one with your system or if you want it for pc i'm assuming this is just

2192
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:05,780
for pc right now but pre-orders are up for it now it's going to cost you two hundred dollars

2193
02:57:07,380 --> 02:57:12,180
so that's a little expensive whoa the new ones are two hundred dollars two hundred dollars

2194
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:17,860
that's interesting is that really trying to encourage people to buy the xbox one that have

2195
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:22,660
it bundled i don't know but it's directly from microsoft and um you can purchase

2196
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:29,140
if we're compatible with the pc uh that's going to be available september uh july 15th

2197
02:57:32,820 --> 02:57:36,420
all right well we'll see how well that works out how the sales that works for them

2198
02:57:36,420 --> 02:57:41,060
that's a little expensive a little expensive and honestly i mean for what

2199
02:57:42,580 --> 02:57:49,140
um and i don't even know are the stanley because they haven't really announced the price yet for

2200
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:54,340
the standalone sensors for the xbox one so is it also gonna be 200 because that doesn't make any

2201
02:57:54,340 --> 02:57:59,940
fucking sense you drop the price of the system 100 and you sell the sensor for 200 that doesn't

2202
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:05,460
make any sense and don't give me this shit that you know going from xbox one the pc that cable

2203
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:10,180
or whatever is 100 bucks because that doesn't make any fucking sense either so i don't know i'm

2204
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:15,620
gonna be interested to see what their excuse is connect one still 100 yeah it's still 100 bucks

2205
02:58:15,620 --> 02:58:20,980
uh maybe that's why it's sold no it doesn't make any sense reduce the price of connect one because

2206
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:25,220
no one's buying it anyways you can buy them used fuck i have one that i want to sell you so

2207
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:30,580
i don't know interesting all right i'm sure more on this will develop oh here here's the best part

2208
02:58:30,580 --> 02:58:35,620
the connects the connect for windows v2 sensor does not ship with any software is intended for

2209
02:58:35,620 --> 02:58:42,420
use with connect for windows uh sdk 2.0 licensed separately oh so what the fuck am i paying for

2210
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:49,060
that 200 is just for the sensor because you have to license the sdk hopefully some clarity will

2211
02:58:49,060 --> 02:58:52,660
come to this in the coming days this seems a little ridiculous for right now maybe there's

2212
02:58:52,660 --> 02:58:56,900
got to be something something else to this all right for now though we're going to wrap up uh

2213
02:58:56,900 --> 02:59:00,420
we got to get out of here it's it's after nine o'clock on the west coast and after midnight on
