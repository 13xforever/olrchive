13000	20000	Tonight, Microsoft has been experiencing ups and downs with the ups of Xbox One sales and the downs of layoffs. What's in store next for the one?
20000	27000	Also, the Playroom is set to be expanded with more tools for indie broadcasters. Could you soon see us on PlayStation 4? Find out on another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	45000	Live on this July the 20th, 2014 with the 560th episode of our program.
46000	56000	We are back after a week off. We were gone last week, but we're back all again to do another program for you fine folks listening to us on our podcast feed over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
56000	61000	We're available on iTunes or Stitcher or who knows where. Tune in, all these different programs.
61000	70000	And also, of course, live. We do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, VOG Network.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
71000	80000	In studio here, my name is Rob Roberts, joining over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts. Welcome back, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
80000	81000	Yeah, yeah.
81000	83000	Yeah, yeah. Here we go again, right?
83000	84000	Yeah.
84000	86000	You're wearing an adorable shirt tonight, by the way.
86000	87000	I am.
87000	88000	You're wearing a Mega Man shirt.
88000	89000	Rock-a-mon.
89000	97000	And I was commenting when you walked in here, I said, oh, Alan owns that same shirt. And yes, he bought it out of the woman's section. It's a t-shirt.
97000	98000	Yeah.
98000	99000	Who cares if it's guys or girls, right?
99000	101000	Yeah, but it's very-
101000	103000	F your gender norms in t-shirts, especially.
103000	117000	It's really hard to see in this light, but this particular color of blue makes my eyes look extra blue because I have weird colored blue hazel eyes. And so my eyes change color with what I wear.
117000	128000	I will point out, though, that Rock Man or Mega Man or whatever you want to call him is kind of doing that pose where he has his fist up like that. And on Alan, it doesn't really have much of an effect. But on you, it kind of looks like he's grabbing your boob.
129000	130000	Yeah.
130000	133000	Would you let Mega Man grab your boob?
133000	134000	No.
134000	135000	All right.
135000	139000	It's just the power that he's absorbed into his, you know, his buster.
139000	144000	I'm sorry. No man is allowed to grab my boob without consent. Be he fictional or real.
144000	146000	Fair enough. Fair enough. And I must acknowledge-
146000	147000	What about Garrus?
147000	152000	What about Garrus? That's a good one. Thank you, Tech Master Loki, by the way, also here in studio. What about Garrus?
152000	155000	I think Dan wouldn't mind.
155000	157000	Garrus may have your consent. All right, that's fair.
157000	162000	You know how everyone has the pass list or something? Then, yeah, maybe.
162000	172000	And going to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com because, again, we do tape live on Sunday nights, Rama says, the difference really is in the cut of the shirt.
172000	182000	Yeah, I know. I know. Which sadly probably makes it a little more uncomfortable for a girl to get in a guy's shirt. But not really. You just buy it. Like, you wear dance shirts and stuff, right?
182000	183000	Not really.
183000	184000	Really?
184000	199000	I did when we first got together because I was still in extra baggy everything mode because it was early 2000. And now, like, that Borderlands shirt that I won at GamerX that I got for playing Borderlands, the pre-sequel.
199000	200000	Right.
200000	204000	When I get a sewing machine, I'm just going to girl cut it and leave it as a tunic.
204000	206000	Oh. Well, that works.
207000	215000	I guess I'm just really spoiled being gay because one of the biggest perks is that Alan and I can, like, totally share all our shirts because we're, like, similar sizes and everything.
215000	222000	Well, I mean, I've before worn some of Dan's old t-shirts and I made my smock for oil painting class out of one of Dan's old shirts.
222000	233000	So I had this big dog shirt that had a dog with no butthole on the back of it that I was wearing. And I made a full on smock out of Dan's t-shirt. Now it's covered in oil paint.
233000	241000	I do want to talk about GamerX with you, but I do want to, of course, say a few more words with Techmaster Loki, who sadly could not attend GamerX this last week.
241000	243000	That's all right. I was pretty sick on Sunday anyways.
243000	244000	Oh.
244000	246000	Yeah, I still went to San Francisco.
246000	250000	What kind of sick universe is that where we go to the con and you get sick?
251000	260000	Well, it's because I have children and children get sick. And so apparently I caught my baby's virus and then I got it.
260000	268000	So basically I was running a fever in the day. And so and I was tired because I kept waking up every half an hour because of the baby.
268000	283000	So then I drove three hours to San Francisco. So the combination of having a fever, walking around, driving three hours, no sleep, just not fun.
283000	288000	And then it was crowded at Pier 39. And it's just like, I don't want to be I don't even want to fucking be here.
288000	290000	It's always crowded at Pier 39.
290000	293000	I know where you get the doughnuts.
293000	296000	My wife was going to get the doughnuts and she said it looked overrated.
296000	300000	So they are not overrated. They're amazing.
300000	305000	No, all I got was because I wasn't even that hungry because I said I felt like shit.
305000	311000	So I got ice cream there, of course, you know.
311000	320000	So I got ice cream and then we went like my wife's sister's like boyfriend walked us all the way down to like this fish place.
320000	325000	I don't even know where the hell it was. I was like, I'm like, there's fish here. Why are we walking three blocks everywhere?
325000	328000	I'm like, why are we walking way the hell down here for this fucking thing?
328000	332000	And so we got like some I got fish and chips from there.
332000	336000	And sadly, I couldn't enjoy it as much, you know, because like I said, I felt like crap.
336000	343000	Did you see where, you know, years and years ago, Orange Ons Radio, we did a live broadcast from Pier 39 of a DDR tournament.
343000	347000	This is this is back when OLR was a station, not just a show as in the live five days.
347000	350000	This would have been like probably about the third year of our existence.
350000	357000	Probably would have been like 2004, 2005. We actually did a live broadcast from Pier 39 at a place that is now a sports bar.
357000	359000	Just did you see that an arcade there?
359000	371000	Some it's one of those like arcades with my quotey fingers, meaning it has a crane game, a deer hunting game, one racing cabinet, a street fighter machine with monitors.
371000	376000	We didn't go that far down there. We probably went just just a little bit.
376000	380000	And we really were just trying to go to the aquarium. We did that.
380000	386000	And it was really short. And then afterwards, you were just like, we want to go home because there is a baseball game going on.
386000	390000	We're just like, oh, no, we're not going to fight this traffic. We're just going to get out of here.
390000	395000	Jamie and I actually cut out of GamerX a little early just because we were so exhausted.
395000	400000	And, you know, I think she had to get home. And, you know, we just I slept the entire way back.
400000	404000	You really did. And then went home and slept. Yeah, it was a sleep emergency.
404000	406000	And then I woke up and slept some more.
406000	410000	But yeah, so we didn't we weren't even really in town at all. Hardly on Sunday.
410000	414000	Yeah. Next time, I think we're not going to Pier 39, obviously, because that's overrated.
414000	417000	But I think we'll just go to Central Park or not Central Park.
417000	421000	Yeah, I keep thinking our New York listeners to be very happy if you want to say if I went to.
421000	428000	Yeah, if I went in here to go to Central Park now that we go to the parks, the park called their Golden Gate Park Gate Park.
428000	431000	Yeah, whatever. OK, so Golden Gate Gardens are really cute.
431000	436000	Yeah, I don't think so. Golden Gate Park and we probably go to the beach, you know, because Josh has never seen the ocean.
436000	442000	But so that's what we'll do next time. We're not even going to mess with, you know, that part of town.
442000	447000	I wanted to go to the Exploratorium. If I had the energy and I didn't feel like crap, I would have moved it.
447000	450000	It's Pier 15. Yeah, it's Pier 15.
450000	456000	Well, that was the other thing, too, is like we wanted to go home because the baby, you know, Danny was in his car seat like all day.
456000	461000	Like he's just miserable because I think it's so hot. Sure. Sure. Just like, you know, he was tired.
461000	465000	Let me let me shift gears here a little bit because, you know, it is a video game show.
465000	472000	So when I ask you about something else that has to do with gaming on Twitter this week, you've been blowing it up with codes for Destiny.
472000	475000	So I can't imagine anybody that didn't want to get into that.
475000	480000	At least it's following you on Twitter that wanted to be in the Destiny beta hasn't gotten in there one way or another.
480000	486000	I mean, this beta seems about as open as Gmail when it was in its beta for its fourth or fifth year.
486000	490000	We're like literally. Well, yeah. And every code they give you, they give you three codes. Yeah.
490000	496000	But yet you had all these codes. But we were talking before the show and you haven't yet to be able to play the beta yourself.
496000	499000	No, I didn't get a chance to. I installed it. That's about as far as it went.
499000	505000	And now that you're telling me that it's done today, I guess. Well, it's done on PlayStation today.
505000	510000	And it'll be back on Wednesday for all systems through, I think, Sunday.
510000	514000	And they're doing a huge stress test on the 26th.
514000	518000	And that is the day where if you log in after 2 p.m., you get something.
518000	522000	Because they're like perfectly trying to stress test it. So they're trying to give incentive for people to log in.
522000	530000	So if you log in after like 2 p.m., you get some item or badge or some special person item that you get to use in the main game.
530000	535000	But it surprised me because I'm usually not the shooter game fan. You are with the Call of Duty stuff and everything.
535000	538000	I hit max level in Destiny today.
538000	543000	It looked fun. It looked fun. I was pretty tired today and I didn't even get a chance to...
543000	547000	I didn't really have a lot of free time to play anything. I thought about it before I came here.
547000	553000	I'm like, I could play this for like an hour. But I'm like, I don't really have time right now.
553000	556000	I don't really want to do that. I gotta get out of the house.
556000	561000	I was surprised. You can piecemeal it pretty good. Meaning like if you only have like little 10 and 15 minute bursts to play,
561000	565000	you can play like one little story chapter in about probably not even 15 minutes.
565000	568000	So at least the early ones you can.
568000	572000	Well if it's going to be back next week for also PlayStation, then I may do that.
572000	575000	So I was thinking it was only on 360.
575000	576000	No, no. Everybody.
576000	581000	Or 360 and Xbox One. But yeah, I'll probably give it a shot next week then.
581000	584000	Excellent. I want a full report next week. Alright.
584000	588000	I'll talk about my own experiences in the Destiny Beta a little later when we get into How Was Your Gaming Week,
588000	590000	as I'm sure many of you have been trying it out.
590000	594000	And I want to hear all your opinions in our chat room and on email and all that good stuff.
594000	599000	But first, let me talk to DarkSakura about the trip because I said we would come back to this topic.
599000	603000	Let's talk a little bit about GamerX. You didn't get to go the first year, unfortunately.
603000	607000	So what were your thoughts on GamerX going for the first time?
608000	612000	Sadly, if we're hearing is true, there will not be a GamerX in the future.
612000	614000	Not under the same name.
614000	616000	Yeah, I kind of hope that's what they do with it.
616000	624000	If they want to reinvent it to be a con that has a more general name so that it doesn't feel like it's only for ga-
624000	627000	I mean, I said this before. There's a lot of people out there that wonder,
627000	629000	well, why would I go to GamerX? I'm not gay.
629000	631000	And I'm like, you don't get it. It's not about that.
631000	634000	So I think if they have to kind of change the name to get that message across,
634000	638000	if they go with like an Everybody Games con or whatever direction it is they're going in, I get that.
638000	640000	And I think that would be a good thing for the con.
640000	643000	But anyway, your thoughts on your first and maybe last year?
643000	648000	Keep in mind, I've been to a number of different conventions of various size.
648000	653000	This is probably the smallest one I've been to, including Mobicon in Mobile, Alabama.
653000	655000	Including the Sacramento ones?
655000	657000	The Sacramento ones have gotten really big.
657000	659000	Yeah, SacAnime is like really big now.
659000	661000	Yeah. Anyway.
661000	671000	But that being said, it was, I'd have to say, pretty well handled for its size.
671000	679000	I think that, you know, it was probably one of the more positive con experiences I've had.
679000	684000	Although it was, by my esteem, really casual. Really casual.
684000	687000	But I had a really good time.
687000	691000	And for me, I'm not very good around a whole lot of people.
691000	695000	I usually just sort of migrate on my own and go through places.
695000	699000	But it was nice running into people I hadn't seen in a while.
699000	708000	Actually, two of my good friends were there on, I ran into both of them after a cosplay contest.
708000	712000	And I spent most of Friday with my friend Brian. Hello, Brian.
712000	716000	Did you run into Explicit at the con?
716000	719000	I didn't. I did. He used to come to the show all the time.
719000	723000	He just had other things to do about five years ago. He hasn't been on in forever.
723000	726000	I ran into him at the con, and it's probably the first time in like five years.
726000	731000	He sets up with a little team. Him and his team set up the gaming rooms at conventions.
731000	734000	Like here in Sac, and now in the Bay Area, and all these other places.
734000	737000	So they're going to come on the show, and he's going to be back in like a month or so.
737000	740000	Right before SacAnime. I told him we were going to get him to come on.
740000	741000	Yeah, right?
741000	743000	I just see him on Facebook all the time.
743000	747000	Yeah, him and his posse are going to come on and talk about like setting up arcade rooms at cons.
747000	750000	So, it'll be fun. But anyway, sorry, I just thought I'd throw that out there.
750000	752000	Speaking of like people I haven't seen in forever.
752000	761000	Well, now, going, I thought that the games rooms were maybe a little small.
761000	764000	And I'm not meaning that there weren't a lot going on.
764000	767000	There was too much going on for the size of the rooms that the games were in.
767000	772000	I think it probably could have benefited by some bigger meeting rooms.
772000	781000	However, they were, after seeing them set up for changing the ballroom in between different panels,
781000	789000	going to the full size from having the mini rooms, I thought that their management of it was very well done.
789000	792000	They were very efficient.
792000	801000	The going in and talking to the convention staff, everybody was friendly, everyone was really helpful.
801000	808000	And I really didn't run into, like I said, I didn't run into anybody really negative as far as the con goers either.
808000	812000	I think it probably could have benefited from having a little bit more going on.
812000	816000	But other than that, it was really fun, really casual.
816000	822000	Now, you actually did cosplay and you entered the, I don't want to say mannequin, the masquerade, right?
822000	823000	You were actually in that?
823000	826000	Well, there's a difference between a cosplay contest and a masquerade.
826000	827000	Oh, sorry.
828000	834000	I put a hat on and somebody mistook that for me doing Joker cosplay and that's about the most cosplay I've done.
834000	839000	Besides the time that Rama had me wear his Black Mage outfit, I guess that was the most cosplay I ever did.
841000	847000	Well, I was the only Homestuck cosplayer, which surprised the crap out of me.
847000	852000	Because usually it's like if you get a convention, you have a small infestation of Homestucks.
852000	857000	However, I did run into a guy wearing a car cat t-shirt.
857000	862000	Well, more like the cancer t-shirt, but only in the right blood color.
862000	865000	And a very, very pink cape.
865000	870000	And he gave me a huge hug and then pulled me aside to watch Homestuck fan animations.
870000	875000	And I wish I still had his name. I feel really stupid, but he was a really great guy.
875000	877000	Shout out if you're out there listening.
877000	881000	I totally would have worn my dusty old Sackboy costume if I had went.
881000	883000	Oh my gosh.
883000	884000	It's still in my garage.
884000	886000	You would have totally won something.
886000	892000	Although the cosplayers, the Maleficent, so beautiful.
892000	896000	We had a drag Maleficent. So nice.
896000	903000	Honestly, what I really loved about the cosplay contest is that no matter if the cosplay was really intricate,
903000	907000	like that Roy in the Mario Kart, in a cart.
907000	909000	Oh, the Roy Koopa was...
909000	913000	That was phenomenal. The Drow Queen. She was amazing.
913000	916000	And she's so sweet. We chatted before the thing.
916000	921000	And whether it be something way up on that level or something where it was more conceptual.
921000	925000	Who was the lady that came out that was like the PMS Avenger or something like that?
925000	927000	Oh, no. Hot Flash.
927000	929000	Okay, I was at the Hot Flash.
929000	930000	From her own webcomic.
930000	934000	I knew it was some type of...
934000	936000	That's a good way to promote your work though.
936000	939000	Right? Yeah. But no matter where they were at,
939000	943000	I mean, no matter if the cosplay was very intricate or very conceptual, whatever,
943000	944000	everybody was really positive.
944000	947000	And it's not to say that other cosplay contests aren't like that.
947000	948000	That's not what I'm saying.
948000	952000	But I didn't even feel like people were snickering or chatting.
952000	957000	People were just really excited to see all this diversity.
957000	962000	And I'm not just saying that in terms of GLBTQ, YA, all that stuff.
962000	965000	I'm talking about diversity in what they were seeing on stage.
965000	972000	Yeah. And on top of that too, I ran into a trio of Dragon Age cosplayers.
972000	974000	One of which I'm now Tumblr buddies with.
974000	975000	Nice.
975000	978000	And they were all so sweet and positive.
978000	982000	We sat and talked shop about cosplay for a little bit and talked about Dragon Age.
982000	986000	And they were as nice as they could be. They were great.
986000	989000	Some of the first people I met at the convention.
989000	997000	But you saw people who really put a lot of effort into their passion.
997000	998000	And it was really cool.
998000	999000	It was a lot of...
999000	1001000	There was no judgment on anybody.
1001000	1005000	And I'll tell you this, I mean, while I was the only Homestuck cosplayer,
1005000	1010000	it was pretty nice having a couple of people actually recognize the character
1010000	1012000	and get pictures here and there.
1012000	1014000	Because I was like, oh, that's fun.
1014000	1019000	And even though if I went around half high from huffing E6000,
1019000	1026000	it was really cool just sitting down and getting a chance to hang out.
1026000	1028000	Because it was so much more casual.
1028000	1034000	I got to really discuss the types of things that I usually only get on forums.
1034000	1038000	I'll just say quickly, and Rama in our chat room says,
1038000	1041000	I assume there's pictures for us to see, right?
1041000	1045000	There's a video coming and it's very, very well done by our pal Eddie
1045000	1047000	at Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.
1047000	1051000	I don't think Dark Soccer's cosplay is in the video, sadly, but...
1051000	1053000	There's a really awful picture of me that someone took.
1053000	1056000	I'll just post my selfie because my selfie went okay.
1056000	1057000	There you go.
1057000	1064000	But it was funny even though my prop wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.
1064000	1066000	The sphere turned out epic.
1066000	1071000	And so I had people wanting me to poke them with my giant Skaia fork.
1071000	1073000	And I said, well, I have to have your consent.
1073000	1076000	Because one of the rules of peace binding is that you couldn't poke someone
1076000	1078000	without their consent.
1078000	1081000	So I just walked around, hey, can I poke you?
1081000	1082000	Nice.
1082000	1084000	Which was really funny.
1084000	1088000	And I was actually really grateful to have Brian around for some of that
1088000	1091000	because I was having to manage my stuff and my costume
1091000	1093000	and the giant red fork of death.
1093000	1095000	Akdeft in our chat room says,
1095000	1097000	Sky and Dark Soccer, confirm or deny,
1097000	1099000	was GamerX the best smelling con you've ever been to?
1099000	1101000	There was no confunk.
1101000	1102000	Seriously.
1102000	1109000	Okay, there was an occasional whiff of Axe douchebag spray.
1109000	1112000	But other than that, you know, not really.
1112000	1115000	Hey, now I have smashed douchebag spray in the back.
1115000	1117000	I use it sparingly.
1117000	1122000	Well, I bought Dan Axe deodorant because it only smells minorly of douchebag.
1122000	1126000	And I do go around buying my husband's deodorant and smelling it
1126000	1128000	to determine what I want my husband to smell like.
1128000	1130000	That's fair. That's fair.
1130000	1132000	Anyway, I want to say a couple of things about the con too
1132000	1134000	because I was really proud.
1134000	1136000	I think I was really proud of GamerX 2
1136000	1138000	and how it's really grown since the first one.
1138000	1141000	And, you know, I was asked this on Twitter this week,
1141000	1144000	and that is, like, what most surprised you about GamerX 2?
1144000	1147000	And to be honest, although this sounds really weird,
1147000	1151000	my honest answer was that there was more gaming content at GamerX 2.
1151000	1152000	Weird.
1152000	1154000	And, like, I know that sounds like a really weird answer,
1154000	1156000	but, like, the first year really felt like
1156000	1159000	we are like-minded people getting together to throw a party.
1159000	1161000	And that was still continuing this year.
1161000	1164000	Like, we are still, like, all these inclusive like-minded people
1164000	1166000	trying to get together to throw a party.
1166000	1169000	But now it's like, and now some companies are taking notice
1169000	1171000	and actually wanting to be a part of that too.
1171000	1173000	The gearbox panel is really awesome.
1173000	1176000	And props to 2K, you know.
1176000	1179000	And they did a great job showing Borderlands the pre-sequel,
1179000	1180000	which is the first...
1180000	1181000	It's so fun.
1181000	1183000	...which is the first time they've shown that in playable form.
1183000	1185000	They had a wrestling game there too.
1185000	1187000	I totally don't know shit about wrestling.
1187000	1188000	WWE 2K.
1188000	1190000	Is that it? All right, thank you. Sorry.
1190000	1192000	Look, I can't follow everything.
1192000	1194000	And the wrestler guy was there, Darren Young.
1194000	1195000	Darren Young was there, yeah.
1195000	1197000	He was, like, their big guest this year.
1197000	1199000	And then, you know what, Ubisoft,
1199000	1202000	despite all the crap they got for the Assassin's Creed thing,
1202000	1205000	and, you know, rightfully so, and the cosplayers even,
1205000	1207000	you've all seen this by now,
1207000	1209000	the ladies wearing the boxes that said,
1209000	1210000	too hard to render.
1210000	1211000	Yeah, that was great.
1211000	1213000	They were actually walking past the window
1213000	1214000	when Alan and I were waiting for you.
1214000	1215000	Oh, how funny.
1215000	1216000	Yeah.
1216000	1218000	They're in the video Eddie took too.
1218000	1222000	Ubisoft seemed to, you know, take their licks in good stride,
1222000	1224000	and they actually had, like, a Celebrate Diversity poster
1224000	1226000	with the Rayman Rabbids.
1226000	1227000	I'm sorry, not the Rayman Rabbids.
1227000	1229000	The Raving Rabbids in all the, like, different colors.
1229000	1232000	And they were, you know, doing giveaways and stuff too.
1232000	1235000	And indie games.
1235000	1236000	Can we talk about the indie games?
1236000	1238000	That rabbit butchering game was great.
1238000	1240000	The game, the perfect woman game,
1240000	1242000	did you play the Connect one?
1242000	1244000	I saw it, and I just watched people play it.
1244000	1245000	I wasn't going to play it.
1245000	1247000	It was really well done.
1247000	1250000	It's one of the, you play, you play, like,
1250000	1253000	a woman who's going through these different struggles,
1253000	1254000	but it's one of those things where it's, like,
1254000	1256000	you're kind of laughing at how absurd it is,
1256000	1258000	but then when you really take a step back and look at it,
1258000	1260000	you're like, this kind of is sad.
1260000	1261000	This isn't funny.
1261000	1262000	This is sad.
1262000	1263000	Because, like, you start and, like,
1263000	1265000	you'll do a stage where it's like you're age seven,
1265000	1268000	and you are doing child labor in a factory
1268000	1270000	and making Walmart shirts or something like that.
1270000	1273000	And you have to, you move your arms in different poses
1273000	1274000	and things, and the better you do,
1274000	1275000	you know, the better you go on.
1275000	1277000	And then it's like, at one point, I swear to God,
1277000	1278000	there's a stage where it's like,
1278000	1280000	you're 60 years old and you've become a whore.
1280000	1284000	Like, and you do all these, like, sexual positions
1284000	1286000	as this old grandma.
1286000	1288000	I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,
1288000	1291000	this is, like, I'm laughing at how absurd it is,
1291000	1293000	but then I'm like, this is not funny.
1294000	1296000	So then you kind of see the, you know,
1296000	1298000	the progress you make and so forth.
1298000	1301000	And that was, if there is an outside the box type of game
1301000	1304000	or even, like, a best of show, that game was it.
1304000	1306000	I love that game.
1306000	1308000	And then there were other really neat games, too.
1308000	1310000	The rabbit game, though, was great.
1310000	1313000	Where you play, it's sort of like Smash Brothers meets Mappy.
1313000	1314000	Uh-huh.
1314000	1316000	It was the big four player game where you play
1316000	1318000	as little pixelated rabbits.
1318000	1320000	I thought you were the one that told me about that,
1320000	1322000	or maybe it was Brian that told me about it.
1322000	1323000	The duck game is the one I played.
1323000	1324000	Duck, that was what I was thinking.
1324000	1325000	Oh, yeah, duck game.
1325000	1326000	Okay, get this.
1326000	1327000	Okay, I want the duck game.
1327000	1328000	Get this.
1328000	1329000	That was on Ouya.
1329000	1330000	They had an Ouya room,
1330000	1331000	and they were showing some different Ouya games,
1331000	1333000	and I kind of walked out of there going,
1333000	1335000	you know, I know Loki really bags on the Ouya,
1335000	1337000	but I liked a lot of the stuff I was seeing.
1337000	1339000	I kind of walked out of there going,
1339000	1340000	I might want to get an Ouya.
1340000	1343000	And don't forget about don't play Jenga on the ice.
1344000	1345000	That's later.
1345000	1346000	But, yeah, they had the duck game.
1346000	1348000	They had, of course, read-only memories
1348000	1350000	is something that, you know, the company behind GamerX
1350000	1352000	is trying to promote because that's their game as well.
1352000	1355000	They had another like music hybrid game
1355000	1357000	that I didn't really get to play a lot of.
1357000	1358000	I heard more about it in one of the panels.
1358000	1360000	But that was, you know, neat looking.
1360000	1363000	So, yeah, it was like kind of the duck game especially.
1363000	1364000	It was really fun.
1364000	1367000	So I was looking forward to getting an Ouya possibly to try that.
1367000	1371000	And, you know, again, more indie games,
1371000	1373000	very well represented, very happy about that.
1373000	1375000	What was I going to say?
1375000	1377000	Oh, yeah, so it was great to hang out with the other podcasters, of course.
1377000	1379000	That part was really cool.
1379000	1381000	Just it's like being at home and being at family.
1381000	1383000	It's like going to that family reunion every year.
1383000	1384000	That's what GamerX felt like.
1384000	1386000	Did you get a better turnout for the cross zone panel this year?
1386000	1387000	Yeah, actually.
1387000	1388000	Well, last year.
1388000	1389000	I missed the full room.
1389000	1390000	Last year wasn't bad.
1390000	1392000	This year was probably like three quarters full of the room.
1392000	1394000	So it was pretty good because it was a bigger room than last year.
1394000	1395000	So it was nice.
1395000	1396000	Yeah, it's all on video.
1396000	1398000	So that'll be out there at some point.
1398000	1400000	And, yeah, it was a great panel.
1400000	1401000	Had a really good time.
1401000	1402000	Dark Sakura was on the panel.
1402000	1404000	Anything you want to summarize about it real quick?
1404000	1406000	It felt like a really positive experience
1406000	1408000	although like the one photo I saw of you is really derpy.
1408000	1412000	I was in mid-explanation like bleh.
1412000	1416000	We went to a private celebration party Saturday night
1416000	1418000	and that is where the Jenga-thon continued.
1418000	1420000	I don't know how it started,
1420000	1425000	but all us little podcast sisters were playing Jenga like hardcore.
1425000	1427000	And I don't mean like just lighthearted fun Jenga.
1427000	1430000	I'm talking like this is serious business here with Jenga.
1430000	1434000	And then also in the board game room somebody had brought Don't Break the Ice.
1434000	1437000	So somewhere it changed from Jenga to playing Don't Break the Ice.
1437000	1440000	Meanwhile the other group of us was playing Cards Against Humanity.
1440000	1442000	Yes, yes.
1442000	1446000	Which wasn't it, I think it was Eddie's first time playing it.
1446000	1447000	Oh yeah.
1447000	1451000	So that was pretty, I love when you get Cards Against Humanity virgins.
1451000	1453000	And they did give out new decks at GamerX.
1453000	1454000	I didn't get anything.
1454000	1456000	They were hidden.
1456000	1459000	Do you know how they had the big candy bowls out that had candy in them?
1459000	1460000	Yeah.
1460000	1462000	The decks were underneath the candy.
1462000	1465000	So if you went into the bowl to pick the candy there were decks in there.
1465000	1466000	Oh God.
1466000	1472000	So yeah, somebody like Grandpa or somebody got Reject decks.
1472000	1474000	But I don't think it's unique to GamerX.
1474000	1476000	I think they've been at other cons too.
1476000	1477000	But the Reject decks were there.
1477000	1478000	That was pretty cool.
1478000	1480000	I did get some League of Legends skins.
1480000	1484000	Which, since I'm going to start playing it, it was kind of an incentive to start playing it again.
1484000	1485000	There you go.
1485000	1488000	Yeah, the cosplayers actually got some goodies.
1488000	1491000	If you were cosplaying you had access to the Cospetality Lounge.
1491000	1496000	And they were giving out, because League of Legends was also a sponsor of the convention,
1496000	1500000	they had two different skin cards.
1500000	1505000	And then you got a pin that has a mask on it.
1505000	1508000	You know, the old style Harlequin masks.
1508000	1509000	Oh nice.
1509000	1511000	That said Cosplay 2014.
1511000	1513000	A nice, legit pin.
1513000	1515000	So it was really, really nice.
1515000	1516000	That's really cool.
1516000	1518000	And that's a lot of the craftspeople too.
1518000	1522000	We just, you know, basically just hung out shooting the shit about art.
1522000	1526000	About, you know, commissions and laws and that type of thing.
1526000	1530000	And the one lady was like, oh yeah, I totally recycled Disney pins into stopwatches.
1530000	1532000	So it was actually really cool.
1532000	1534000	I was really admiring her work.
1534000	1537000	I was really happy for that gal that won the audience favorite.
1537000	1540000	Because she said it was her first time ever doing cosplay.
1540000	1541000	Right?
1541000	1542000	The loth.
1542000	1546000	Like, she was legit, like, choking on stage and starting to cry.
1546000	1548000	And I got a little verklempt sitting in the audience.
1548000	1550000	Because she was an older lady, right?
1550000	1552000	She was like late 40s or something, she said?
1552000	1554000	A little older than me, yeah.
1554000	1557000	But she and I were talking before the costume contest,
1557000	1561000	and we were actually talking about making teeth.
1561000	1565000	Because her fangs were fitting her a little bit badly.
1565000	1568000	And we were just talking about, you know, making your own teeth
1568000	1570000	versus ordering acrylic teeth versus having them made.
1570000	1572000	And so that was the other thing, too.
1572000	1575000	I love just hanging out when you're in a casual.
1575000	1580000	And it was a contest, but there was no competition, if you know what I mean.
1580000	1582000	There were no real major egos involved.
1582000	1584000	Everyone was hanging out, having a good time.
1584000	1589000	I ran into a good Cecil cosplayer for Welcome to the Night Vale.
1589000	1591000	And he and I hung out after the OLR panel.
1591000	1592000	He was in there.
1592000	1593000	Oh yeah, yeah.
1593000	1596000	And we were just hanging out there chatting, and then we chatted before the thing.
1596000	1600000	And I hung out with a couple of Assassin's Creed cosplayers,
1600000	1605000	and my friend Caitlin, who I met through school.
1605000	1608000	She was cosplaying Link, the one with the good chain mail.
1608000	1610000	Oh, yeah, yeah. Nice.
1610000	1613000	And so she's just running into people I hadn't seen in a while.
1613000	1615000	We could talk on and on and on about the con.
1615000	1617000	I do want to get to this week in gaming.
1617000	1619000	But real quick, just one other question.
1619000	1623000	If they do do something next year, I mean, obviously it won't be Gamer X3.
1623000	1624000	You said doo-doo.
1624000	1625000	Oh, stop.
1625000	1629000	If they do decide to do a con next year under another name, will you go?
1629000	1630000	Sure.
1630000	1632000	Yeah, me too. Absolutely.
1632000	1633000	I'm really rooting for those guys.
1633000	1636000	I hope they broke even, at least if not made a tiny profit.
1636000	1639000	And I hope they can pull it out for next year.
1639000	1642000	I just think that it needs to be somewhere other than in the city.
1642000	1646000	I think they might want to look at to save on expense.
1646000	1650000	I know they really, really want to keep it in the city, and I know what that means.
1651000	1654000	But maybe move it out towards SFO?
1654000	1661000	See, I honestly, honestly think that maybe in the same place that YowieCon's been a few years,
1661000	1665000	because that was a really, really good con site.
1665000	1671000	It's a little hard when you have to travel between multiple floors to get to your panels and your rooms.
1671000	1673000	That was really the biggest complaint I had.
1673000	1676000	Don't count San Jose out either. San Jose is a great town.
1676000	1683000	I'm not saying San Jose out, but I'm saying be close enough to the city, but not be limited by being in the city.
1683000	1688000	Because that was one of the hotels outside Barlingame.
1688000	1692000	Great location, good view of the bay, everything was nice.
1692000	1699000	But the big thing is that I think it really needs to be opened up to younger people and not be 18 and up.
1700000	1705000	While it was fine to have it not be so completely overrun,
1705000	1712000	I think that having it open to younger people is definitely going to give more encouragement to people who are struggling.
1712000	1715000	I've been hearing that feedback a lot, so good, good.
1715000	1718000	Alright, well, let's move on. More on GamerX to come to vognetwork.com.
1718000	1723000	We have that video, the VOG vlog will be coming soon, and some interviews I did there will be coming soon as well.
1723000	1725000	So, excited about that.
1725000	1730000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks. On to the video games and the types of games that we have been playing this week.
1730000	1733000	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with how was your gaming week?
1733000	1740000	I played Final Fantasy XIV a little bit, finished up more quests that I still had open.
1740000	1744000	Back into Bravely Default a little bit, I've just been really slacking off on playing.
1744000	1754000	And I actually downloaded Bejeweled 3 on Steam, just because I have this weird stupid addiction to puzzle games like that.
1754000	1762000	And I think I played Bejeweled 3 for like two hours one night when my brain was completely non-functional.
1762000	1767000	It was, I don't even know why I did that.
1767000	1775000	And then I have the Adventure Time game and finally decided to hook up my controller, so I'm going to be playing a little bit more of that.
1775000	1782000	Other than that, I've, I don't know, I really haven't been doing much gaming this past week,
1782000	1788000	just because I was so tired after the convention. So, I don't know, what are you playing, Loki?
1788000	1794000	I am playing nothing, because I've been working on my game.
1794000	1795000	Because of baby plagues?
1795000	1800000	No, because I'm working on my game and yeah, I'm mostly just not having time.
1800000	1810000	I did download the Destiny beta, but didn't get a chance to actually play it, so hopefully when it launches back up again next Wednesday,
1810000	1817000	I'll get to actually try that a little bit. Maybe I'll take some time off to actually play some games.
1817000	1824000	Just not really, I don't know, I didn't really want to get back into my Steam backlog right now, because it's so big.
1824000	1832000	But I'll have to figure something out. That and Minecraft need to really do some updates on the Minecraft stuff,
1832000	1837000	just because it's poor and desolate right now.
1837000	1839000	We need to weed.
1839000	1844000	Well, I don't know, hopefully no one's gone in there and destroyed everything, because...
1844000	1847000	We had a whitelist server, so I doubt that's happened.
1847000	1851000	Yeah, so I don't know, I'm just trying to figure out a way to get more people to play.
1851000	1859000	It's almost like I kind of wish we would have joined another server that already had an established base there, but it's just...
1859000	1861000	I'll play more this week.
1861000	1862000	We'll see, I don't know.
1862000	1864000	If you set a day, we can try and all be on.
1864000	1873000	I just have to update it again, and just get all the updates in place, and then kind of go through.
1873000	1883000	I was going to update the arena, but I was developing weapons and stuff in there, and I just didn't get a chance.
1883000	1886000	I kind of got distracted, so we'll see.
1886000	1892000	I forgot, because we weren't here last week as well, to the other games that I played.
1892000	1896000	Other than the indie games there, there was Borderlands, the pre-sequel.
1896000	1897000	Isn't that what it was called?
1897000	1898000	Yeah.
1898000	1899000	That was fun.
1899000	1905000	I suck playing it on a controller, because I've been playing it on PC, but it was really, really super fun.
1905000	1913000	I really wanted to ask them about the fact that most of the characters are robots, so the fact that running out of air wouldn't really affect them...
1913000	1915000	It'd only be, I think, if you were playing Claptrap.
1915000	1922000	Well, Claptrap... Oh, that's right. The other guy that became a robot, he's actually human, but yeah.
1922000	1926000	But yeah, the other three playables were human.
1926000	1931000	I was very happy, because my favorite character in Borderlands 2 is asexual.
1931000	1932000	Maya.
1932000	1933000	Oh.
1933000	1934000	The siren.
1934000	1935000	Interesting.
1935000	1936000	I didn't know that they...
1936000	1938000	That's why they came out on one of the panels, didn't it?
1938000	1940000	I asked the question. They gave me the answer.
1940000	1941000	Interesting.
1941000	1943000	So, yes.
1943000	1944000	Official.
1944000	1946000	There it is. Official.
1946000	1950000	Alright, my gaming week, then. I will talk a little bit about what I've been playing this week.
1950000	1954000	So, I mentioned the Destiny beta earlier, and I've played it enough where I've hit max level, which isn't...
1954000	1960000	Yeah, it's only level 8. It's not like I have to play a lot a lot, but it means I'm playing it enough where I enjoy it.
1960000	1967000	So, here's what I actually kind of compared Destiny to, and I know a lot of you guys have been playing it, so I'm kind of curious what you guys think of this comparison.
1967000	1975000	I kind of think Destiny is Halo, obviously, mixed with, you ready for it? Fantasy Star Online, I think is the best way to describe Destiny.
1975000	1984000	And the reason why I say that is because obviously it has those kind of like MMO components where you pick up quests and things, which I think makes it really easy to compare it to World of Warcraft.
1984000	1994000	But I actually think the way it's designed feels a little more like Fantasy Star Online, because you have that centralized hub that has all your shops where you get all the upgrades, and then you have the different places that you visit in that hub.
1994000	1999000	But then you go out into the world, and you're going to the same zone over and over again.
1999000	2005000	And it's not as repetitive as necessarily as it was in Fantasy Star Online, where it was like Forest, Forest 2, Forest 3.
2005000	2012000	But you're certainly going to the old Russia map, and okay, this time you land here, and you're going into this building and exploring.
2012000	2021000	Or this time you're going to go onto the other side of the map beyond this hill, and you're going on your mount, on your rocket over here, because you've got to go find some people over here.
2021000	2029000	So it's like you're going to different portions of the map, and then eventually you open up an explore mode where it's just, okay, now you're on the map, and you do pretty much whatever you want.
2029000	2034000	Kill whatever you want for experience, and if you see these beacons, you can pick up these quests and do that too.
2034000	2044000	So in that way, and not only that, but you can put together your parties of one to three people to take on this content together.
2044000	2052000	So in that regard, it felt a lot like PSO to me, because PSO, you can do it by yourself, or you can do it with other people, and that whole thing.
2052000	2064000	I did try to do the PvP a little bit. There's a section of Destiny called the Crucible, which is essentially what you would be looking for in what the makers of Halo are going to do next.
2064000	2069000	There was a little capture the flag type game in the beta, where you basically hold three points.
2069000	2078000	I am awful at it, which I expected, because I'm really bad at first person shooters. So in that regard, it kind of takes the fun out of it when you're playing against really, really good people, and it's like you just die, die, die.
2078000	2085000	And even though I couldn't hear anybody, that's probably for the best, because I was probably getting called all sorts of names in the book, and it's just, you know.
2085000	2092000	I did notice though, and to Destiny's credit, it seemed like after I had died for the fifth time, a little thing popped up and said stat boost.
2092000	2102000	So I think it actually does start to take pity on you if it realizes you really, really suck, and it actually boosts your stats, which I'm thankful for that, because I need some boosted stats.
2102000	2115000	But the cool thing is, I didn't even really have to touch that. I did that because I wanted to check it out so I could say something about it if I'm going to do a quote, quote review of the beta, although you really shouldn't review betas.
2115000	2120000	But y'all, everybody's playing it, and y'all making impressions on the game from it anyway. I'm doing the same thing.
2120000	2129000	And in a positive way, I think with this game, I don't know if I necessarily would have been like totally wanting to buy it day one, but now after this beta, I'm like, yeah, I'll buy it day one.
2129000	2133000	Because there's enough single player and co-op material to make it really interesting.
2134000	2149000	I did a dungeon, I'm using my quotey fingers, a dungeon, although they call it a strike team mission. It's all the tropes of a World of Warcraft dungeon where it's like you go in an instance and you get a few mobs and then you have these boss monsters that you kill and so forth.
2149000	2156000	It doesn't seem like everybody plays a unique role yet, but I bet they will later, where like the warlock can do certain things, the titan can do certain things.
2156000	2165000	But I ran one of those dungeons with Ian from Koopa Club, who's pretty good at Destiny and was helping me out and reviving me a lot, and that was actually a lot, a lot of fun.
2165000	2178000	We had a random guy that joined the party too, who had to revive me like all the time, but we got through it without completely dying and having to start from the beginning, so I was really happy with that progress. I got a ton of XP from it too.
2179000	2187000	Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetworld.com. Fifth Dream says, I ran around and died in Quake for many hours. I probably got two kills.
2187000	2193000	Sjo100Matt says, Aren't there buffs in some MMOs that do the same thing? If you fail to raid a few times, you get a special buff?
2193000	2206000	Yes and no, Sjo100Matt. They do that for usually PvE content, but not PvP that I've seen. I'm sure some of the MMOs out there have it, but just not one that I can think of off the top of my head.
2207000	2214000	Brad from Paw Culture agrees with my assessment. That's exactly what I thought, and that's like peanut butter and chocolate for me. Very good.
2214000	2225000	That sounds like, well, they do that for like, I know Call of Duty does that. They have death streaks where if you die, you know, five times or four times in a row without getting a kill, you get a perk.
2225000	2226000	There you go.
2226000	2229000	It's usually something really minor just to help you out a little bit.
2230000	2240000	Alan Alchemy says, Unreal Tournament is the only competitive arena FPS where I still have a good time even when I got juiced to respawn every two seconds and sucked out loud. I'll probably have more fun with it when I play with friends.
2240000	2251000	I think if I could do PvP with friends, it would be more fun. And to be fair, my buddy Justin tried to invite me to a game last night, but I wasn't a high enough level yet. So he tried to get me into PvP, but I couldn't do it.
2251000	2266000	So, there's that. Yeah, I liked Destiny enough where I'm going to for sure buy the full game day one. I'm on board now. Like, I didn't think I'd like it that much because I suck at first person shooters, but I loved the Phantasy Star Online element of it.
2266000	2272000	Made it so that if I wanted to play an easier level over and over to try and level up a little bit, like, I really like that.
2272000	2278000	The one thing I am going to razz Destiny on is kind of the same thing a lot of people are picking on, but it really is a problem.
2278000	2288000	The story and the voice acting are not at the same level as the rest of the game. And I am going to pick on the same thing a lot of people are picking on.
2288000	2295000	The voice of Ghost in particular and Peter Dinklage's acting is not up to par with the rest of the game.
2295000	2302000	And I know that sounds like a pretty shitty thing to say about a great actor, but the reality is some lines are laughably bad.
2302000	2306000	Like when you're fighting a boss and the ghost suddenly pipes up and says,
2306000	2311000	It's coming through the wall! Like, it's just really awkward.
2311000	2315000	Like, I'm just like, okay, turn him off. Shut him up. Can we change the ghost or whatever?
2315000	2322000	I don't necessarily blame Peter Dinklage for that. I worry part of that is in the direction of the game.
2322000	2326000	And maybe just that the ghost character is very bland.
2326000	2335000	And if you think about it, we've had some really strong support characters with you in other games of a similar nature.
2335000	2342000	Borderlands, right? Another which I didn't even invoke Borderlands necessarily with Destiny, but obviously a lot of similarities there too.
2342000	2346000	But Claptrap, come on, awesome character, awesome support, right?
2346000	2350000	Look at Portal, GLaDOS always taunting you.
2350000	2351000	Or Wheatley.
2351000	2353000	Or Wheatley, right? Great characters.
2353000	2360000	You know, Ghost is not that, is nowhere near that same level. Ghost is bland.
2360000	2363000	And that I think is one of the worst possible things you can do.
2363000	2366000	Or even like, was it the Arbiter or whatever?
2366000	2370000	There's this random cutscene too that was just really uninteresting that I wanted to skip.
2370000	2376000	So, again, it's a beta, so I'm not going to say this is the way the game is, period.
2376000	2382000	I realize there's parts of the story I probably haven't seen, more layers of the onion to peel back and so forth.
2382000	2386000	Well, isn't this something that they're talking about stretching out for like ten years or something?
2386000	2388000	You know, like, Destiny?
2388000	2396000	Yeah, I don't know if it's through DLC or what that is, but I am a little concerned that Ghost may not be fixable at this point.
2396000	2404000	The game will survive on its strong gameplay, but that is going to be a detraction from the game, unfortunately.
2404000	2409000	It would be great if you can switch Ghost with a different Ghost at some point.
2409000	2415000	It could seem like that's something you could do by looking at the inventory, but we'll see what happens with that later on.
2415000	2418000	So, let's see.
2418000	2427000	Fifth Dream says, well, he's a robot drone thing, so I get that maybe it's supposed to be the mood he's supposed to be,
2427000	2431000	but if he's a motionless drone, then he shouldn't also be going,
2431000	2434000	It's coming through the wall!
2434000	2438000	Go for A or B, but not this weird, awkward point in between.
2438000	2442000	Just make him completely Tyrion Lannister, that's all you need to do.
2442000	2446000	Fuck this trying to act like a robot, just Lannister all the way.
2446000	2448000	That would be perfect.
2448000	2453000	Alan Alchemy says, a motionless robot without empathy isn't a very good mood to set in an action game.
2453000	2455000	Maybe that's the direction he got.
2455000	2459000	You're a robot, so you don't actually give a fuck about anything. Talk like that, perhaps.
2459000	2463000	Brad from PodCulture says, everything is fixable, just a matter of how much work you want to do on it.
2463000	2467000	And Fifth Dream says, I don't know, I liked Ghost, maybe I'm weird.
2467000	2469000	I also hate Sailor Moon Crystal, so maybe I'm weird.
2469000	2474000	Hey, it's the show where every gamer has a voice. Every weird gamer gets a voice in Fifth Dream.
2474000	2481000	Alright, again, I don't want to harp on that too much, because that's one minor little blip on what otherwise is going to be a fantastic game.
2481000	2485000	So, yeah, looking forward to that on, what is it, 9-9 that that's out?
2485000	2489000	I know it's one of those dates that plays the numerology, so very cool.
2489000	2492000	Otherwise, I've just been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV.
2492000	2499000	I got my Scholar to level 50, woohoo, and we took down Good King Mooglemawg Extreme this week, so that was neat.
2499000	2509000	We tried to do some pulls on Ramu on Extreme mode, and wow, that was a clusterfuck, but I felt progress, so that was a good place to be.
2509000	2517000	And also, I want to shout out this, because Alan finally linked his Steam library in mine, so I can play all the games he has that I don't.
2517000	2524000	And one of those games I spent a little time with the other night was Pac-Man Championship Edition, or Championship Edition Deluxe, excuse me,
2524000	2530000	which I've played to death on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but come on, I had to play it on the PC as well,
2530000	2537000	and it was weird seeing the little arrows by Pac-Man where you could actually see what direction you've punched in to go next.
2537000	2542000	I don't remember that being in the other versions, but it actually kind of, especially when you're going slower speeds,
2542000	2546000	it enhances things a little bit, because it's like, oh, now I can see what direction I'm going in.
2546000	2551000	When you're at speed level 40 or 50, though, things are moving too fast, you can't even look at that arrow.
2551000	2555000	But yeah, a strong, fun game as it was before.
2555000	2559000	Alright, that's it for our gaming weeks. Let's do some quick plugs. Housekeeping.
2559000	2565000	We will be here for the next several weeks. The next week we will not be here is Labor Day weekend.
2565000	2570000	We will not be here Labor Day weekend, as I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.
2570000	2575000	And being that it is Labor Day weekend, a lot of people here in the States have other plans and go off and do other things,
2575000	2579000	which would likely include Loki and Dark Soccer and many of you that are listening.
2579000	2583000	So we will not be here Labor Day weekend. I think Dark Soccer, you said you're going to SAC Anime, right?
2583000	2584000	I might.
2584000	2587000	Yeah, so you got that. So we will not be here Labor Day weekend.
2587000	2591000	If you are in the Atlanta area, or really anywhere within a 500 mile radius of Atlanta,
2591000	2598000	I do hope you come to check out Dragon Con. Lots of VOG personalities will be there.
2598000	2603000	I don't have the entire list memorized, but I know at least myself, Travis from Understation Live,
2603000	2607000	Bobby from Bobby Black Wolf, I'm pretty sure John from Critical Miss is going to be there,
2607000	2611000	and other guys from Network. I think Brian from British Invaders is there this year.
2611000	2617000	Lots of people will be there, and we do have a panel on Monday to talk about networking.
2617000	2621000	And then Bobby and I will be on some other panels throughout the weekend. Very excited about that.
2621000	2627000	So Dragon Con 2014 is only like six weeks away. But sadly, OLR will not be here that weekend.
2627000	2629000	That is Labor Day weekend.
2629000	2631000	That's that.

2662000	2665000	That's it for plugs. How about gaming news?
2665000	2668000	45 minutes into the show, it's time to get to some gaming news. Let's do it.
2668000	2674000	Yes. So Microsoft, they have put out the word that, hey, guess what?
2674000	2679000	You know, when you take $100 off of a console, it's going to sell better.
2679000	2683000	And that's the case with the Connectless Xbox One.
2683000	2689000	It's actually double the monthly sales of the Xbox One console, so not bad.
2689000	2693000	They haven't said exactly how many systems were sold during that time, but they have shipped,
2693000	2700000	I guess in April they said they have shipped 5 million systems, so I don't know where they're at exactly yet.
2700000	2705000	We'll have to wait until the MPD numbers come out, I guess, in a few more weeks, I want to say.
2705000	2708000	So yeah, that's pretty cool.
2708000	2717000	And see, my question though still is, they don't have the Kinect available separately yet,
2717000	2723000	except I know they have the Kinect 2.0 for PC, which is $200, and that makes absolutely no sense to me.
2723000	2729000	And I think that's mainly for developers, but they don't have the Kinect sold separately.
2729000	2739000	And on top of that, the games that do require Kinect don't have the labeling on them like they do on the Xbox 360.
2739000	2744000	So for example, when Fantasia comes out, if you're a consumer and you don't know what you're doing,
2744000	2749000	and you buy an Xbox One without Kinect, and you buy that game, you're fucked.
2749000	2752000	Because you didn't know that it required Kinect, because it doesn't say on it.
2752000	2756000	So I'm surprised they haven't figured that out yet.
2756000	2763000	So yeah. If I were to buy an Xbox One, I probably would get the Kinect version.
2763000	2768000	Just because you never know what they're going to use that for later on.
2768000	2773000	Like if that's going to tie in with their VR stuff or who knows.
2773000	2778000	But I'd still want it for $399.
2778000	2785000	Do you think this is the beginning of a trend for Microsoft that's in some ways badly needed?
2785000	2788000	The backpedaling? No, they've done that for a long time.
2788000	2791000	I'm talking about the actual sales and all this.
2791000	2798000	Yeah, I mean that definitely helps. I think more of the strong lineup that they've got coming third party and first party is more going to help them.
2798000	2802000	Sorry, let me rephrase. Are more sales a good thing? Yes, stupid. Of course they are.
2802000	2810000	What I really mean by that is, is this a good sign that this could continue this inertia through the very important holiday season?
2811000	2818000	I think so. I think both systems are going to see a pretty decent boost in sales because there's a lot of good games coming out.
2818000	2826000	That being said though, there's still on PlayStation 4, there's not a lot of first party games that I really want to sell me that system.
2826000	2832000	That's kind of the thing. I really want a PlayStation 4 more than I want an Xbox One.
2832000	2837000	Just because I like the PlayStation Plus stuff and all that.
2837000	2843000	But I can't see myself getting a PlayStation 4 right now because there's actually more Xbox One games I want to play.
2843000	2847000	Well, really only one Xbox One game I want to play right now. Forza Horizon 2.
2847000	2857000	There's just not enough exclusives right now. I wish half those 2015 games were coming out fourth quarter because that would really sell me a system.
2857000	2865000	And that's the other thing too, is by 2015 fourth quarter, I need to have both systems. All three systems because there's so many great games.
2865000	2872000	I'm pretty sure the Halo collection and the fact that I can play Halo 2 with my friends all over again is going to be the thing that pushes me over the edge on Xbox.
2872000	2878000	I don't know. I like Halo, but I don't know if I'd want to buy that.
2878000	2885000	Well, I mean, that's the thing that's pushing me over the edge. I still want also Sunset Overdrive. I'd like to try it.
2885000	2887000	Oh yeah, Sunset Overdrive definitely is going to be awesome.
2887000	2892000	There's other things that are sweetening the pot too, but that's the thing where it's like, alright, you broke me, that's the one.
2892000	2900000	But that's the thing, they don't really have a whole lot, like first party stuff for Playstation 4, they don't really have a ton. They have LittleBigPlanet 3.
2900000	2907000	And that's not even really, I mean, I don't think that's going to sell anyone's systems. Especially since it's on Playstation 3 as well.
2907000	2916000	And that's Drive Club, but that was supposed to have been out last year anyways. That's not really, it's really third party stuff that's kind of pushing, but that's both systems.
2916000	2925000	I mean, you can, I don't need the buy, but that's the other thing too. A lot of games do play slightly better on the Playstation 4 versus the Xbox ones.
2925000	2933000	I'm pretty sure come holiday, Sony's going to sweeten the pot on the Playstation 4 by keeping the same price for the system.
2933000	2941000	So $3.99, but they're going to start to include games with it, or download codes for games, or free Playstation Plus or something with it.
2941000	2948000	Like some of their, at this point, aging games like Knack, these things can just be thrown in.
2948000	2951000	I mean, those copies aren't flying off the shelves anymore.
2951000	2952000	Yeah, they're not worth anything though.
2952000	2960000	To somebody who might be sitting there going, Xbox One looks cool, but Playstation 4 also cool and comes with two games.
2960000	2967000	But see, yeah, and I understand that they can do that, but they're even kind of doing that already with the Xbox One.
2967000	2977000	I mean, they had, was it for a while there, they were giving out Titanfall with stuff, and they were also doing Forza 5, and it was still the same price.
2977000	2986000	I want to say, I have to look it up though, because I can't remember, but I want to say that the Destiny bundle that they have coming out in September
2986000	2990000	is not the same price as just the standalone system.
2990000	2995000	I want to say it's actually more, so I don't know if you're really saving any money there.
2995000	2998000	Let's see here, if you know it's for Destiny.
2998000	3003000	But, I don't know, I wouldn't necessarily want to buy the system for Destiny.
3003000	3011000	Yeah, $4.49, so it's $50 more, so you're saving a little bit of money, and I mean, what are you really getting?
3011000	3019000	The system looks a little bit different, and you get, you know, a trial to, you know, a 30-day trial to PlayStation Plus, which is woohoo, I mean.
3019000	3024000	But, that doesn't seem like much of a deal, you're really only saving about like $10 there.
3024000	3027000	Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
3027000	3033000	Sky, Sony should keep the price and include the cameras, kind of an FU to Xbox.
3033000	3040000	You know, during E3 this year, there was a point where Bobby and I looked at each other, and if he's in chat right now and listening, he'll tell you this is true.
3040000	3043000	We looked at each other going, they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it.
3043000	3050000	Because it was the way they were talking or whatever, we're like, they're gonna fucking do it, they're gonna include the camera, this is gonna be the kick em in the balls moment.
3050000	3052000	You know, like, oh my god, oh my god.
3052000	3055000	And then it ended up being something else, and we were like, oh.
3055000	3057000	That could've been such a moment.
3057000	3062000	But like, I know we're gonna be talking about it a little bit later, but they're still not utilizing that camera for anything.
3062000	3064000	Like, they're not.
3064000	3067000	There's not, outside of Just Dance and so forth, there's not.
3067000	3074000	The fair thing is, to be fair, at least Sony was never trying to kind of go out there and going, this is an essential part of the system.
3074000	3077000	You need, you know, it was always like, okay, yeah, it's there if you want it.
3077000	3080000	And you can stream with it, and you can play Just Dance, we have the playroom and all that.
3080000	3083000	You know, it's a fun little thing, but, you know, it's not required.
3083000	3087000	And yet that thing was still flying off of shelves because of the streaming component alone.
3087000	3089000	People really wanted that camera for the live streaming.
3089000	3093000	So, I don't know. I still, I want these systems.
3093000	3098000	I mean, ironically, you know, the Wii U has more games for it right now.
3098000	3099000	They're coming out fourth quarter.
3099000	3105000	I mean, Smash Brothers and Mario Kart, I could see myself playing that stuff, but it's just, you know, I don't know.
3105000	3108000	It's hard to decide what system I'd want to get.
3108000	3113000	I guess I'd have to wait until the fourth quarter, see if there's gonna be any more price drops or anything like that.
3113000	3116000	I don't think there's gonna be any price drops, but bundles or something.
3116000	3118000	It's always good to wait.
3118000	3123000	I forgot about this. Bobby just linked to a picture from the E3 wrap-up this year in one of the galleries.
3123000	3126000	And he linked to a picture, and that was me.
3126000	3132000	He had his camera out ready to take a picture of me at the moment that they announced that the camera was gonna be included.
3132000	3135000	Like, to get my big, like, ah face, you know.
3135000	3139000	But then it ended up being something else, so my picture's a little more reserved, where I'm like, hmm.
3139000	3143000	But he had his camera out ready to go. That was funny.
3143000	3145000	Alright, let's move on.
3145000	3149000	Something that you can play probably on your One and your PlayStation 4.
3149000	3153000	Tekken 7. Tekken 7, it's happening.
3153000	3158000	IGN, I guess, kind of spoiled things a little bit, talking that Tekken 7 was coming.
3158000	3161000	And this was before the developer actually announced it.
3161000	3165000	Of course, the EVO was going on last week while we weren't here, and this is where Tekken 7 was finally unveiled.
3165000	3168000	Tekken 7 will be running on Unreal Engine 4.
3168000	3171000	It's in development for the PS4 and the Xbox One.
3171000	3174000	No word about the Wii U, but don't count on it.
3174000	3177000	If it's Unreal Engine 4, it's definitely not coming to the Wii U.
3177000	3179000	Yep. Unless they get some type of downgraded version.
3179000	3181000	Coming on the GameCube!
3181000	3183000	Now, this is what's also interesting.
3183000	3189000	Producer Katsuhiro Harada announced this at EVO 2014 to officially announce the game.
3189000	3194000	However, this was not the game they were originally planning to announce.
3194000	3198000	There was no trailer prepared for Tekken 7 because of this.
3198000	3201000	They had to do one very quickly in his hotel room.
3201000	3203000	They put the Tekken trailer together quickly.
3203000	3215000	And they asked fans to show excitement for the video to overcome the difficulties of having to explain to his boss at Namco Bandai when he gets back to Japan.
3215000	3218000	Because, again, that was not the game that they were supposed to reveal.
3218000	3221000	What was the game they were supposed to reveal?
3221000	3222000	Don't know.
3222000	3226000	Now, more information to come at San Diego Comic-Con on this game.
3226000	3229000	Apparently, that was the place where they were going to reveal this.
3229000	3233000	Interesting that a lot of gaming news is going to come out of San Diego Comic-Con this year.
3233000	3237000	Well, gee. What other game could they possibly be talking about?
3237000	3241000	Probably either, I'm guessing, Tekken Cross Street Fighter?
3241000	3244000	Maybe. I mean, what the hell ever happened to that, right?
3244000	3249000	Because, I mean, obviously if they have an engine now built for Tekken 7, that's going to be the engine that that's running on.
3249000	3250000	Right.
3250000	3253000	So, I'd be willing to, but that's probably what it is.
3253000	3256000	Or who knows? It could also be a new Soul Calibur game.
3256000	3258000	Or something, you know, one of their other franchises.
3258000	3261000	Because it's been Soul Calibur 5.
3261000	3262000	That was a while ago.
3262000	3264000	It was a while ago now, so it could be due for that too.
3264000	3266000	So, we'll see. We'll see.
3266000	3268000	But, yeah, Tekken Cross Street Fighter is more likely.
3268000	3271000	But, I'm sure there will be plenty more news to come out of San Diego Comic-Con.
3271000	3274000	Among other things is what Nintendo is going to be there.
3274000	3277000	I just didn't mean to interrupt you.
3277000	3278000	Oh, that's okay.
3278000	3279000	It's Evo.
3279000	3280000	Evo. Sorry.
3280000	3281000	Evolution.
3281000	3282000	Oh, okay.
3282000	3284000	Did you hear about the guy who wasn't...
3284000	3288000	Sorry, before you all make fun of me, ask me how good I am at fighting games.
3288000	3289000	I'm not. Sorry.
3289000	3291000	By the way, did you hear about the guy who just...
3291000	3295000	Street Fighter wasn't even his game and he went in and just won the whole thing.
3295000	3297000	Oh, really? Was that the guy who won on the PlayStation 1 controller?
3297000	3299000	Yeah, it was the PlayStation controller.
3299000	3300000	It was awesome.
3300000	3302000	We were watching him play as Rose.
3302000	3304000	You know why I call it Evo?
3304000	3306000	Because I think of that song from 2DX Red.
3306000	3310000	E-V-O-66.
3310000	3311000	You remember that song?
3311000	3312000	Anybody?
3312000	3316000	Hello? Dark Tetsuya has to know what I'm talking about. Somebody.
3316000	3317000	Alright, anyway.
3317000	3320000	Fine then, Dark Soccer. Why don't you take the floor with another story?
3320000	3323000	Well, maybe I will then. Geez, Rob.
3323000	3326000	Well, how about some crappy news?
3326000	3328000	Everyone likes crap, don't they?
3328000	3336000	Microsoft is laying off 18,000 employees and closing Xbox Entertainment Studios.
3336000	3340000	Basically coming from Phil Spencer is saying that...
3340000	3344000	Well, he says he expects to close Xbox Entertainment Studios.
3344000	3349000	And then says, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of the entire team.
3349000	3352000	Even though we're laying you off.
3352000	3354000	But yeah.
3354000	3359000	It's basically, they're going to be letting a lot of people go.
3359000	3363000	Which of course means that a whole lot of people are going to be jobless.
3363000	3373000	Which, again, I could say certain things about that, but I'm not going to get political.
3373000	3375000	Yeah, that sucks. Bad news.
3375000	3380000	So that means, hey, there's a bunch of Microsoft people who are going to be looking for jobs.
3380000	3382000	Good video game companies.
3382000	3385000	We should probably throw out some job fairs.
3388000	3391000	That's a bummer. It's never easy to talk about layoffs.
3391000	3401000	I mean, I heard it was mostly the Nokia side of things, but it's definitely impacting the entertainment and Xbox side too.
3401000	3409000	Actually, it says that the total is $12,500 for them at Nokia.
3409000	3413000	Which was from an April acquisition.
3413000	3416000	But they're talking about doing other layoffs.
3416000	3422000	And they're not saying specifically what divisions, but the biggest one is Xbox Entertainment Studios.
3424000	3427000	And now, Loki, I think you have a little more on this layoff stuff, right?
3427000	3437000	Yeah, so basically one of the things that they were talking about, of course, that the Xbox Entertainment Studios would be affected.
3437000	3441000	But this does not affect Quantum Break.
3441000	3447000	Remember, Quantum Break also had kind of the live TV show portion of the game.
3447000	3452000	But that apparently is still on track, according to Microsoft.
3452000	3459000	And also, they're still committed to Halo Nightfall and the Halo TV series.
3461000	3463000	So I guess we'll see what other stuff comes out of that.
3463000	3473000	And then also, it's apparently affecting some of the other country teams, including Europe, Middle Eastern, and Asian Territory Xbox teams.
3473000	3485000	And they're saying that, I guess, 75% of the full-time positions available on Xbox EMEA would be axed.
3485000	3490000	And your employees would have to reapply for the remaining open roles.
3490000	3493000	That kind of sucks. That's a lot of cuts.
3493000	3501000	A lot of this is really surprising how fast that Xbox Entertainment thing just fizzled.
3501000	3509000	I'm really kind of, I mean, it's not like we haven't teased Microsoft before about pulling the plug on things way before they should have.
3509000	3515000	I.e. Game Room, I.e. 1 vs. 100, I.e. the Xbox Vision Camera, I.e.
3516000	3522000	Yeah, the Entertainment Division was gone before it really started. That's kind of weird.
3522000	3523000	This is Murica.
3523000	3526000	It's still weird.
3526000	3528000	If we don't get instant results, we can't.
3528000	3537000	Well, it's more of they're playing it safe, because this is a lot of a big gamble on whether it's going to take off for them.
3537000	3546000	And I think that they're figuring it's just not, that they're not able to do this exclusive TV service that they're playing on.
3546000	3548000	Maybe they're going to go to a different route.
3548000	3551000	Well, could a lot of that, though, I mean, the fact that they pulled the plug this quick,
3551000	3557000	Dark Soccer, come from the fact that they got such negative feedback when they did that very first unveiling of the Xbox One.
3557000	3563000	And the internet blew up with movies, movies, movies, sports, sports, sports, no one cur.
3563000	3567000	Like, do you think that Microsoft kind of went, oh, crap, nobody cares about this.
3567000	3570000	So I guess that's pretty knee jerk.
3570000	3577000	Yeah. It was weird that like just last month they were hyping up this whole that they dug up the eat is they dug up the garbage in the desert.
3577000	3581000	Right. They're going to do this movie about digging up people's garbage in the desert.
3581000	3584000	And by garbage, I mean, copies of E.T., the extraterrestrial. Right.
3584000	3587000	They're they're going to do this whole movie about digging up garbage in the desert.
3588000	3594000	And like it was this big thing. And now it's just I mean, I can't imagine that movie isn't still happening or is it.
3594000	3596000	No, I would imagine that's being finished.
3596000	3601000	But still, I mean, that wasn't even had a chance to see how many viewers that would get.
3601000	3605000	But to be fair, though, what have they really announced that they're canceling?
3605000	3613000	Because the only shows they even talked about that they were going to have were the Halo one and break and quantum break.
3613000	3617000	And those are still happening. So, well, I mean, I don't even know what's canceled.
3617000	3621000	Other than who there might have been a show on Fable, which I totally wouldn't have given a shit about.
3621000	3624000	They have a deal with Sarah Silverman comedy, something with her.
3624000	3629000	Oh, God, I thought I read. Oh, she's funny. I think I know she's funny, but it's like, I don't know.
3629000	3632000	Don't get me wrong. I love the Sarah Silverman program.
3632000	3637000	Yeah. And I'm sad that that is off the air, but she'll find another place.
3637000	3648000	I just I don't know. I think I think you'll even need like these kind of outlets anymore because you can just do your own thing on YouTube or make your own website and have your own streaming thing.
3648000	3653000	And people don't really need that. They're not going to be like, oh, I'm not going to watch it because it's on the Internet.
3653000	3661000	Right. There's tons of shows that the Web series and stuff that they have that are quite successful on YouTube and other streaming sites.
3661000	3668000	So maybe that's the problem is there's so much competition out there with that kind of stuff that no one really does care about.
3668000	3672000	Microsoft put now, hey, look, we've got TV show. Cool. So is everybody else?
3672000	3682000	Yeah, I think that's a big part of the problem, too, is how fragmented the distribution, digital distribution of TV is getting like it's it's getting really bad, you know.
3682000	3688000	And when Netflix got really big and everybody wanted a piece of that, I was just talking Hulu, but I'm talking HBO has their own thing.
3688000	3696000	Comcast has their own thing is like everybody wants their own digital TV thing. It's like there may not be room for for Microsoft in that picture.
3696000	3704000	You know, and unless Microsoft is going to get the next orange is the new black, you know, they're not necessarily going to sign up all these people interested in the in the TV thing.
3704000	3711000	So I guess they never took the took the financial chance to find out. I guess Microsoft is not in a place where they can take that risk.
3711000	3723000	I do remember now they had was it that there is one show that I read or one thing that I know that they announced that they are probably not going to do, which was was it Powers or something like that?
3723000	3729000	Oh, yeah. That was that was Sony. Oh, that was Sony. Yes. Oh, OK. I still don't care about that.
3729000	3735000	Yeah, it was Sony. You know, it was Sony. OK, well, whatever. I thought that was another show.
3735000	3742000	But I guess Sony already has an entertainment division. Sony has a music division. Sony is a big company besides just PlayStation.
3742000	3753000	They're making movies. Also, keep in mind, you know, the difference between laws versus a U.S. based companies and Japanese based companies.
3753000	3759000	They can get into much broader ventures over there a lot more easily than we can because of trust.
3759000	3764000	And I think Microsoft would be in a good position to maybe team up with somebody else for that.
3764000	3770000	And maybe that's ultimately what's going to happen. Maybe Xbox Entertainment's being closed because there's going to be a deal coming with.
3770000	3775000	I don't know. Like, what what what TV network is is Halo supposed to end up on?
3775000	3780000	Wasn't it the thing with CBS, like maybe Showtime or something? I don't know where I'm getting that.
3780000	3785000	They still have a. No, I'm thinking that because the lady that was the head of she came from CBS.
3785000	3791000	Do they still have like a share like NBC or something? You know, because I know they have MSNBC.
3791000	3797000	I don't believe Microsoft actually has a stake in MSNBC anymore. I don't think. Don't quote me on that.
3797000	3803000	But I remember they were trying to get rid of it. So. But anyway, it'll be a.
3803000	3809000	Why wouldn't they just like I mean, so what? Just like. Oh, why wouldn't they just partner up?
3809000	3814000	I guess because they want people to be drawn to the Xbox platform, but I don't know.
3814000	3819000	Put in Netflix or something. So what? So you can watch a Halo show on a Sony platform.
3819000	3824000	Oh, you're making more money. Who gives a shit? You know, I don't understand what the problem is.
3824000	3829000	People aren't going up. OK, let's be real. Here's Microsoft. Nobody.
3829000	3836000	Let's say that you have a new orange is the new black, whatever. Nobody is buying a fucking console for a show.
3836000	3842000	Nobody. I'm sorry. Even if it was like Game of Thrones, I don't think anyone would fucking buy a console.
3842000	3846000	No, I would agree with a show. I would agree with that. And so who cares?
3846000	3851000	Just put it on Hulu, put it on whatever. It's it's although I will say this.
3851000	3857000	It's not necessarily about making it, you know, that you have to buy the console for the one show.
3857000	3865000	But it's about enhancing the value of the console when it sits next to this self next to Nintendo's console and Sony's console for the whole family.
3865000	3876000	And maybe mom is making the purchase or mom and dad together or mom and mom, whatever the family is, are making the decision together that day to get the console.
3876000	3881000	If it says, oh, my kids will enjoy it because it has sunset overdrive.
3881000	3886000	Oh, but I'm going to enjoy it because it has orange is the new blacks creators next project or whatever.
3886000	3892000	I keep you reference. Red is the new blue. Red is the new blue. Yes.
3892000	3895000	Red versus the new blue is available here on I would watch that.
3895000	3900000	Yeah, I think I would do as long as it has donut and text.
3900000	3906000	It's available here on the Xbox one. And so I'm going to buy this because Sony doesn't have that and Nintendo doesn't have that.
3906000	3909000	I would totally watch a red versus blue movie. That would be fantastic.
3909000	3914000	Like in theaters. But no, seriously, though, I think it's even less of just looking at the console thing.
3914000	3921000	It's even more of like they're just they're online services justifying the cost of paying for Xbox Live.
3921000	3930000	Because, I mean, they're trying with the free games and stuff, but it's just not quite what Sony is offering.
3930000	3933000	Real quick comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
3933000	3937000	Rama says Sony has many divisions, but on the computing entertainment one is profitable.
3937000	3941000	Lol. Samsung is the new Sony when it comes to TVs. That's true.
3941000	3948000	I have heard Sony has not been the PlayStation has been something that's been keeping them afloat, which is interesting.
3948000	3953000	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I wonder if just before the NFL season there will be a rise in Xbox one sales.
3953000	3959000	Madden usually offers an NFL Sunday ticket subscription if you buy the game. Word is they're offering it on the Xbox one.
3959000	3969000	BSingle40 in chat says didn't NPD report come out Friday saying PlayStation 4 won June despite the Microsoft price cut?
3969000	3971000	Loki, you're the expert on the sales stuff.
3971000	3975000	I didn't remember looking at the numbers. I don't know.
3976000	3977000	That wouldn't surprise me.
3977000	3983000	I think they were both up. I'm not sure. And I think I remember seeing that. I just don't remember.
3983000	3987000	Because, I don't know. Because they would have, let's put it this way.
3987000	3993000	They would have said we outsold the PlayStation if they outsold the PlayStation because that's something they're rubbing.
3993000	3998000	They're going to try to bend it however, you know, sounds the best for them.
3998000	4003000	Tigerclaw in chat says you think Nintendo will ever join with an entertainment network?
4003000	4009000	No. Very much no. It's not the business they're in and I don't think it's something they want to do.
4009000	4010000	It's about how they do things.
4010000	4014000	Nintendo wants to keep their hands on the reins.
4014000	4021000	Keep in mind, and nobody talks about this on the Wii U, nobody talks about it, but it's there and it is kind of neat.
4021000	4026000	They have a TV experience that enhances the TV you already have.
4026000	4028000	That just proves that Nintendo is not interested.
4029000	4031000	They have built something that enhances the TV you already have.
4031000	4038000	Where you can watch American Idol or big sports games and actually chat along with other viewers in a Miiverse style environment.
4038000	4041000	If you own a Wii U, check it out because you probably didn't even know it was there.
4041000	4044000	And they've actually been adding to it and enhancing it.
4044000	4047000	I bet Drag Race is fun to watch with that.
4047000	4050000	I don't think they have it for Drag Race but they ought to.
4050000	4051000	That would be funny.
4051000	4053000	They ought to. I'm going to petition Nintendo.
4054000	4058000	Wait a minute. I have a business card from Nintendo PR. I'm going to email him tomorrow.
4058000	4059000	You know what's funny?
4059000	4062000	Tiara and I used to do that for books.
4062000	4067000	When the Harry Potter books would come out, we'd just sit online and comment back and forth about where we were.
4067000	4069000	OMG. OMG. OMG.
4069000	4072000	What the fuck is he thinking?
4072000	4074000	It was pretty funny.
4074000	4075000	Book chat.
4075000	4077000	That's what we need. We need ebook chat.
4077000	4078000	Ebook chat.
4079000	4081000	I'm going to patent that.
4081000	4087000	You have ebook chat on the iBook store or on Kindle or whatever.
4087000	4089000	Better check and see if that's been reserved.
4089000	4094000	You can leave comments and books so that people in your book community can read the comments they left on sections of books.
4094000	4095000	That'd be great.
4095000	4096000	You could be a millionaire.
4096000	4098000	Alright, well here's something that now let's hope.
4098000	4104000	I know this game isn't coming to Wii U but let's hope that there's a way that my mother can participate in the chat for this next game we're going to talk about.
4104000	4106000	Mortal Kombat X.
4106000	4108000	Because you know my mom's a big Mortal Kombat fan.
4108000	4109000	Rab.
4109000	4110000	Rab.
4110000	4112000	That's so gross.
4112000	4113000	I haven't shown her the new trailer.
4113000	4115000	I really need to get a reaction video.
4115000	4118000	You know how people film reaction videos on YouTube to Two Girls One Cup?
4118000	4122000	I need to get a reaction video to my mother watching the new Mortal Kombat trailer.
4122000	4126000	And especially the announcement for Raiden is going to be in the game.
4126000	4129000	Classic Mortal Kombat character.
4129000	4130000	How could they do that?
4130000	4132000	Has Raiden ever not been in a Mortal Kombat game?
4132000	4134000	He wasn't in IV, was he?
4134000	4138000	It would be so weird to have a Mortal Kombat game without Raiden.
4138000	4140000	So of course he is in the game.
4140000	4141000	Of course the Thunder.
4141000	4144000	Or Christopher Lambert, if you remember the movie.
4144000	4146000	So that is that.
4146000	4149000	Now also interesting about Mortal Kombat X.
4149000	4151000	And yes that's X not X. That's how they're marketing it.
4151000	4160000	Mortal Kombat X is going to have at least one guest character from an outside franchise because Freddy Krueger did so well.
4160000	4165000	They're not confirming that Freddy Krueger will be said character.
4165000	4170000	But they're going to add some type of guest character into the game.
4170000	4172000	Which of course begs the question.
4172000	4174000	Who do you think that character should be?
4174000	4178000	Did you know we actually did a list list on this a long time ago?
4178000	4183000	What character should be in Mortal Kombat as a franchise character?
4183000	4184000	We did this some time ago.
4184000	4185000	Who won? I can't remember.
4185000	4188000	I'm actually pulling it up right now because Dark Tetsuya compiled it.
4188000	4191000	I do remember on the list was the Bride from Kill Bill.
4191000	4193000	Was one of the characters.
4193000	4195000	Which is still an answer I really like.
4195000	4197000	That's for sure.
4197000	4200000	I believe the winner was Ash from Evil Dead.
4200000	4204000	Which actually seems plausible.
4204000	4205000	Why not? Why not?
4205000	4208000	I guess getting the Bruce Campbell likeness would be the trickiest part unless they did like a...
4208000	4209000	The chin.
4209000	4210000	Yeah I don't know.
4210000	4211000	I would think...
4211000	4213000	He'd probably do it.
4213000	4215000	I would think Jason and Michael Myers.
4215000	4217000	I mean if Freddy Krueger is going to be in it.
4217000	4220000	Jason seems like a really logical step.
4220000	4221000	I know they do like...
4221000	4224000	Because there's also Jason X right?
4224000	4226000	Or Friday the 13th X with Jason in space.
4226000	4227000	I mean come on.
4227000	4228000	Anyway.
4228000	4229000	Number 3 by the way.
4229000	4230000	So in that list list.
4230000	4232000	Number 1 was Ash from Evil Dead.
4232000	4234000	Number 2 was the Bride from Kill Bill.
4234000	4236000	Number 3 was Mr. Rogers.
4238000	4240000	I don't know how that happened but it's really funny.
4240000	4244000	So that was from an old list list we did some time ago.
4244000	4245000	Awesome.
4245000	4247000	That's so like insensitive now.
4247000	4249000	You know what?
4249000	4254000	Just the Mortal Kombat people should just license the engine and do nothing but horror
4254000	4255000	film bad guys the fighting game.
4255000	4256000	You know they do have that.
4256000	4257000	Why not?
4257000	4259000	There's a fan made game that's like that.
4259000	4261000	And Ash is actually in that.
4261000	4263000	I just don't remember what it's called.
4263000	4264000	Alright.
4264000	4270000	But like they should also have like the people who like the sole survivor out of horror flicks.
4270000	4272000	Like Alice from the two Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
4272000	4276000	Sydney from Scream and Gale Weathers.
4276000	4281000	And the psychic kid from Friday the 13th.
4281000	4282000	Was it 3 or 4?
4282000	4283000	Yes.
4283000	4284000	The title of the game.
4284000	4285000	Wasn't that Corey Feldman?
4285000	4291000	How about as a playable character in Mortal Kombat X, Carrie's mom.
4291000	4293000	She could use like psychic powers.
4293000	4295000	You can see your dirty pillows.
4296000	4301000	When she does a fatality on Sonya she can be like, I can see your dirty pillows.
4303000	4305000	They're all gonna laugh at you.
4305000	4307000	And smothers her with a pillow.
4307000	4308000	I like that.
4308000	4310000	That wasn't even on the original list list.
4310000	4312000	Can we go back and amend it with Carrie's mom?
4312000	4313000	Part B, Rob.
4313000	4314000	Part B.
4314000	4315000	Part B. List list the sequel.
4315000	4316000	Have we ever done that?
4316000	4317000	No.
4317000	4318000	Let's make that a thing.
4318000	4319000	An unprecedented moment in all our history.
4320000	4323000	Was it the aunt or whatever from Sleep Boy Camp?
4325000	4329000	How about, what was, oh my God, Angela.
4329000	4331000	How about just straight up Angela from Sleep Boy Camp?
4331000	4336000	Anyway, did you know, I'm sorry, I have to just do a tangent while we're talking about bad horror movies.
4336000	4341000	Because if my buddy Rene from Killer Queens from Outer Space is out there listening, he'll appreciate this.
4341000	4342000	And I learned this on the show I was on.
4342000	4349000	Did you know that the little boy who played Angela's brother who dies in the opening moments of Sleep Boy Camp,
4349000	4356000	and I won't spoil anything, the little kid who plays her brother is actually the situation's brother.
4356000	4357000	No fucking joke.
4357000	4363000	Like the situation from Jersey Shore, that's his brother in that movie, Sleep Boy Camp.
4363000	4365000	Only douchebags call themselves the situation.
4365000	4367000	I learned that when I guessed it on that show.
4367000	4369000	And I was like, get the hell out of here.
4369000	4370000	What a small world.
4370000	4372000	Anyways, the game I was telling you about-
4372000	4374000	You've never seen Sleep Boy Camp, right?
4374000	4376000	Is, uh, was it-
4376000	4378000	Okay, mandatory this has to happen.
4378000	4379000	We have to watch Sleep Boy Camp.
4379000	4380000	Well, I also didn't see Mean Girls, so-
4380000	4382000	Oh my God, Jamie, you're killing me.
4382000	4383000	Alright.
4383000	4385000	Yeah, even though I know lines from the movie, go thig.
4385000	4386000	You can't sit here!
4387000	4389000	You just can't ask people why they're white.
4389000	4392000	You know enough about Mean Girls, you just need to watch the damn movie.
4392000	4393000	Yeah, I know.
4393000	4400000	Terrordrome, the game Rise of the Boogeyman is actually the horror game, fighting game that's actually free to play.
4400000	4407000	If you want to check it out, it's free to download at www.terrordrome-thegame.com.
4407000	4410000	Ooh, I like the suggestion from Fifth Dream in chat.
4410000	4412000	American McGee's Alice in Mortal Kombat.
4412000	4416000	Well, might be too young, though. I don't want to see all that yucky violence on kids.
4416000	4417000	Is Alice an adult?
4417000	4418000	Yes.
4418000	4421000	Well, then I guess maybe it will work, but I don't know, it's a little weird.
4421000	4422000	Little weird.
4423000	4425000	In theory, it sounds good, but I don't know.
4425000	4428000	What about, like, um, wasn't...
4428000	4433000	I think Lollipop Chainsaw was, um, Warner.
4433000	4434000	Oh!
4435000	4438000	That game was almost embarrassingly bad and hilarious.
4438000	4442000	We keep thinking movies, but maybe another character from another big gaming franchise.
4442000	4446000	Because they were trying to get something exclusive to...
4446000	4450000	Because Kratos was in Mortal Kombat 8, or whatever it was, on PlayStation,
4450000	4453000	there was talk that they were trying to get a similar character.
4453000	4455000	Everybody assumed he was Master Chief.
4455000	4458000	But something like that on Xbox, it never happened.
4458000	4463000	It needs to be Coco Tapioca from Space Channel 5 Part 2.
4463000	4464000	No.
4464000	4465000	What?
4465000	4471000	If they really want to go crazy, you know, maybe a little bit bonkers, or conquerors...
4471000	4474000	Stop. Stop right there. I'm not even going to let you finish that.
4474000	4477000	We're going to move on. More news. Dark Saga.
4477000	4483000	Okay, well, we've heard of it happening before, where the news will just say,
4483000	4487000	Oh, look! We'll use whatever picture this is to describe whatever,
4487000	4490000	and no one can get on us because we have money.
4490000	4493000	Ha ha ha ha. Copyright, blah blah.
4493000	4496000	Except that, um, they really kind of fucked up here.
4496000	4503000	So, basically, it was, um, a news station that was doing a discussion about, um,
4503000	4506000	children, you know, being used as soldiers.
4506000	4511000	And, um, and this was on ITV, um, uh, well, actually, one of them,
4511000	4517000	the first time it happened was, um, on ITV, where, uh, they used clips from Arma 2.
4517000	4522000	Well, now we have another, uh, company that's, uh,
4522000	4528000	and I believe it's Fox and Friends, that, you know, had their Bioshock Infinite logo thing.
4528000	4533000	Now we have, uh, screen caps from Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain,
4533000	4535000	to talk about child warriors.
4535000	4540000	And this was, uh, on, uh, news channel Russia Today.
4540000	4544000	Yeah, I saw the clip. It was really awkward kind of seeing that.
4544000	4548000	It's like, you know, stock footage amongst all this other, you know,
4548000	4552000	which is, which is really the horrific topic, if you think about it.
4552000	4556000	To, to see this just really made the whole thing even more awkward.
4557000	4558000	This is stupid.
4558000	4560000	Yeah, I mean, do your research interns.
4562000	4564000	Either that or, you know, wouldn't it be funny if, like,
4564000	4570000	there were stealth interns placed to get major companies in trouble by exposing?
4570000	4575000	Don't you feel like, though, how this happens is that some intern just went to Google image search
4575000	4581000	and put child soldier and thought that picture and didn't even, like, fact check it
4581000	4585000	or do a backwards image search to see where it came from or any of that stuff?
4585000	4591000	Exactly that. I mean, the big thing is that, and I've learned this, my teachers taught me well.
4591000	4597000	If you are going to find an image, there are certain things that you're going to have to put in your search
4597000	4604000	when you're looking for it, including stock image, royalty free, or public domain, you know.
4604000	4607000	If you're trying to use something you're not going to have to freaking pay for.
4607000	4614000	Then again, I've seen quite a bit of, and I'm not going to say that it's Russian media in particular,
4614000	4620000	but I've seen it mostly out of Russian media where it's like, well, like my friend in Australia,
4620000	4629000	her Homestuck fan art being used on the cover of a Russian publication about a story about the American justice system
4629000	4634000	and it's a troll holding, you know, it's Terezi.
4634000	4639000	That's one thing, but specifically the news. I think the news is exempt from some of that stuff because it's the news.
4639000	4646000	This is supposed to be an unused publication, you know, and then we're seeing it,
4646000	4655000	but it's just really more or less a matter of either lazy searching or disregard for copyright or a combination of all of the above.
4655000	4661000	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming out soon
4661000	4667000	in a game store near you that perhaps will have artwork that will soon be on the local news. Loki.
4667000	4673000	This might be on the local news just because it was, you know, a popular game a long time ago.
4673000	4681000	Well, it's still pretty popular, I guess, but for the Wii U, the disc version of Wii Sports Club will be coming out on Friday on the Wii U.
4681000	4683000	And that's literally it.
4683000	4684000	That's it?
4684000	4687000	That's it. That's it.
4687000	4689000	Alright, I guess this is a slow week.
4689000	4693000	Let's see, going to Japan and checking out some of the releases over there.
4693000	4697000	I don't see anything on the PlayStation 4 this week. I'm wondering if it's a slow week over there, too.
4697000	4704000	On the PlayStation 3, Dead Island and Sengoku Basara 4 are getting, like, remastered.
4704000	4708000	They're not new, they're just re-price reductions, re-bundlings of the game, essentially.
4708000	4716000	There is another new game, though, called Under Night in Birth Exe Late, which is an Arc System Works game that's out on PlayStation 3.
4716000	4722000	You can also check out a Monster Hunter Frontier G5 premium package, also out on PlayStation 3 this week.
4722000	4725000	So lots of redos in Japan this week.
4725000	4730000	Same thing on the Xbox 360, that same Monster Hunter Frontier package is on the 360 as well.
4730000	4734000	A 10,000 point Xbox gift card, branded for Monster Hunter.
4734000	4738000	10,000 points? And they still have point cards?
4738000	4739000	I guess.
4739000	4742000	I guess maybe in Japan they do. There must be some type of difference going on there.
4742000	4747000	On the Wii U, that same Monster Hunter Frontier package is out as well.
4747000	4751000	That might explain the slow release dates in Japan this week, because you know it's Monster Hunter.
4751000	4761000	But hey, on the Vita, things are a little more hopping with Corpse Party Blood Drive, and Re-Vice-D comes out there as well.
4761000	4767000	And Tokyo Shin Seiroku Operation Abyss is out on the PlayStation Vita as well.
4767000	4771000	That's your Japanese release dates? Oh, wait, 3DS. Sorry.
4771000	4775000	3DS Yoshi's New Island is out in Japan this week. That's a pretty big one.
4775000	4777000	Dark Sakura?
4777000	4778000	Jack shit?
4778000	4780000	In the UK?
4780000	4781000	Yep, nothing.
4781000	4787000	Alright, matches what's going on over here. I guess it's that part of summer where you need to catch up on your Steam backlog.
4787000	4789000	It's when they say, go outside.
4789000	4790000	Or that.
4790000	4791000	Play.
4791000	4792000	Or that.
4792000	4797000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, which you could also play this week if you wanted. Loki.
4797000	4801000	Alright. Let's see.
4801000	4810000	There's always these Kickstarter stories about how things kind of go awry, and a game that's promised never comes out.
4810000	4820000	Well, this one is kind of the case. This was a game based off of the web series Yoggcast, or I think it starts actually a podcast.
4820000	4824000	But Yoggcast's Yoggventure game.
4824000	4831000	I believe, and I know this is going to take people by surprise, I'm not super familiar with that group, but I believe they're big on YouTube.
4831000	4839000	Well yeah, I know they do Minecraft videos and stuff like that, but I know it's a YouTube channel, but I thought they had a podcast too, but whatever.
4839000	4849000	But anyways, Yoggventures. They actually Kickstarted this. It had made, or went way above what they had originally asked for.
4849000	4856000	I want to say that they were originally asking for $250,000 and ended up with $560,000 in pledges.
4856000	4865000	However, now development has ceased on the game. Apparently, they just ran out of money.
4865000	4877000	And, you know, it's kind of surprising. They're basically saying that they worked on the game, it was an amazing experience, blah blah blah.
4877000	4887000	They really wanted to achieve some lofty goals set out, but they didn't have enough experience in planning and management and that kind of thing.
4887000	4897000	And I guess he had put some of his own money into it and just couldn't quite get the game finished.
4897000	4904000	And so, because of that, I think they're giving people copies of a game called TUG instead.
4904000	4913000	But, you know, there's a little bit, some more details on that, talking about the mismanagement and stuff and just kind of maybe inexperience.
4913000	4928000	For example, there was an artist they had paid to do some in-game artwork for them and I guess they paid him, or paid them $35,000 for two weeks of work that produced, or two weeks that produced no work.
4928000	4940000	Apparently, the artist signed the contract, got the $35,000 payment, put two weeks worth of time in, and then accepted full-time employment with LucasArts.
4940000	4948000	But because of the way the contract was poorly written, he had no obligation to do anything, so he got the money and just kind of left.
4948000	4958000	So, and just like there's a lot of drama with just, you know, being uncomfortable with how it was being managed and stuff like that.
4958000	4964000	It just goes to show you, but like, I remember one of the comments, you know, when he's, they're explaining to...
4964000	4969000	Sorry, I'm laughing because Rama in chat says, Rama brings in the ball pit.
4969000	4971000	Sorry.
4971000	4975000	That's a good zinger, Rama. I like that. Sorry. I don't mean to kick this while it's down.
4975000	4982000	You guys know I've had my own concerns about Kickstarter and obviously this news story exacerbates a lot of those issues.
4982000	4991000	However, I mean, for the people that backed this and supported it, especially coming from, you know, a production that is indie like we are and has really kind of worked from the ground up.
4991000	4997000	It is, it's not an easy thing to see. I think it's just one of those, it's a caution for everybody.
4997000	5001000	Well, I think also it was, it was, when they...
5001000	5003000	It needed an adult, I hate to say it.
5003000	5008000	It really sounds like a lot of the way contracts were written and this guy could get no money.
5008000	5014000	They even broke it down though, like, and they spent money on legal, you know, legal fees and stuff.
5014000	5017000	Why didn't they have someone write up a good contract?
5017000	5026000	I mean, you would think that you would write up a contract that doesn't have a fucking out where I could just take the money, come up with nothing and then fucking leave.
5026000	5028000	Damn, I want to sign one of those contracts.
5028000	5032000	You know, I mean, it's just, it sounds ridiculous.
5032000	5037000	And also I haven't really, you know, not too familiar, I kind of looked at the Kickstarter thing.
5037000	5044000	They didn't really have any playable or I want to say that they didn't really have a lot of footage from the game right away.
5044000	5051000	I think they showed a little bit, not too, you know, they had some footage, but I think it was after the Kickstarter thing was done.
5051000	5055000	So it was all off of concept art and that's always really wary to me.
5055000	5061000	If you don't have anything to show of your game and you're trying to sell your game, that just seems like a stretch.
5061000	5067000	And I mean, granted, yeah, it's probably based off good faith, you know, because it's a channel you might like and stuff.
5067000	5075000	But I don't know, especially I'd be kind of leery, but I guess I wouldn't.
5075000	5084000	Once again, you know, I want to say this should sour everybody for, you know, any Kickstarter project because there's been plenty of projects that have gone through Kickstarter and been just fine.
5084000	5088000	I mean, look at the John's sister's twisted dreams. Look at, you know, Shovel Knight.
5088000	5098000	There's Among the Sleep and, you know, a lot of other successful campaigns that you don't really hear a lot about because there's no drama in there.
5098000	5102000	No one wants to report on like, oh, this campaign was successful. The game came out OK.
5102000	5106000	Yay. Hoping Kickstarter is, you know, come back.
5106000	5109000	It's just, I don't know, everyone seems to focus on the negative.
5109000	5115000	But yes, there are a lot of projects out there. You just have to really be careful with what you're you're backing.
5115000	5123000	And remember that, you know, if you're backing like 15 bucks, you're probably not going to be able to have any sort of recourse if they don't come back and do anything.
5123000	5127000	Because obviously, if you want to file legal fees and stuff, it'd be more than your fifteen dollars.
5127000	5131000	So it's not worth it. Just be careful, I guess. And do your research.
5131000	5138000	And also only back projects, I would say that actually show something, you know.
5138000	5144000	Going to a chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, sadly, it's not the only project to suffer this kind of problem.
5144000	5148000	Too many high level goals, not enough experience and planning to ground it in reality.
5148000	5153000	Some guy recently wanted to make a Naruto MMO without actually having the license, experience or technical planning.
5153000	5156000	Just a page of text professing his awe at starting something like it.
5156000	5160000	Shadowrun returns divinity, Original Sin, Wasteland 2, etc.
5160000	5162000	Yeah, some good points.
5162000	5169000	And as Joe and Hunter Matt says, this is what happens when you use Kickstarter to avoid going through a publisher or someone who could oversee your project to make sure stuff gets done.
5169000	5173000	Same person can deal with all the legal stuff. Some people can pull it off, others can't.
5173000	5178000	But, I mean, that's not saying that you can't go through Kickstarter and do all that stuff.
5178000	5185000	You can just, you know, the problem with inner experience is you don't know how much money you're going to need for, like, legal and stuff.
5185000	5192000	And that's kind of the problem I think they ran into is, like, they tried to cut corners, I want to say, with how much they spent on that.
5192000	5201000	And if you spend a lot of money on legal, you can actually get somebody, like, for example, on Reddit a lot, there's the video game lawyer.
5201000	5206000	They have services where he'll write up contracts for you and do that kind of thing.
5206000	5209000	And he has experience with indie game developers.
5210000	5217000	You know, it's not that expensive and you just have to know what, you're going to have to spend some of your own money on that stuff.
5217000	5224000	And even just starting your own company, you're going to have to spend some money, you know, trademarking your product and all that stuff.
5224000	5234000	So it just, you have to know that you're doing that and you also have to be smart about it because, yeah, I mean, there's, you know, you could get sued by somebody else for, you know,
5234000	5240000	if you're, you know, copyright infringement or if it's too close to some other thing, like in the Naruto case.
5240000	5243000	You can't fucking kickstart something you don't have the rights to.
5243000	5245000	I mean, maybe they're naive and think that.
5245000	5252000	Like, for example, there was one I saw that was a really shitty looking game, but they called it, was it Grand Theft Pizza delivery or something like that.
5252000	5255000	I'm like, that's going to fucking get sued if it didn't look like complete shit.
5255000	5264000	I'm sure that they don't give a shit about it. But, you know, the fact that it, they raised like a few thousand dollars for a really shitty game.
5264000	5270000	But the name Grand Theft, whatever, and it looks like a Grand Theft Auto type, you know, over a head game, except just drawn at them as paint.
5270000	5274000	But still, it's, you know, you got to be careful.
5274000	5278000	Fifth Dream in chat says, just stick to potato salad.
5278000	5281000	Don't get me started on that. Do not get me started on that.
5282000	5288000	That's one of those things where everyone thinks that they're, you know, oh, I'm going to back money this because that's silly.
5288000	5290000	He, you know, the only one that's laughing is the person.
5290000	5291000	You're the problem.
5291000	5292000	Fifty thousand dollars.
5292000	5293000	You're the problem.
5293000	5298000	Right. Moving on. You spend your money on what you want, but I'm just saying.
5298000	5303000	All right. Moving on to one more story here about money.
5304000	5312000	Would you be surprised if I told you that some of your favorite YouTubers are getting paid to cover games by publishers?
5312000	5314000	Publishers are paying them to cover certain games.
5314000	5319000	Well, if you're shocked to hear that news, welcome to the internet. Enjoy your stay.
5319000	5325000	Gamasutra actually did a survey of YouTubers and Let's Players with over five thousand subscribers.
5325000	5330000	And according to the numbers, twenty-one percent of them participated in Paola.
5330000	5334000	Five percent of them, when a dev offers money, sixty-nine percent saying no.
5334000	5338000	The other five percent prefers not to say, so you can assume that that's a yes.
5338000	5341000	Very, very interesting.
5341000	5345000	Do you believe that this stuff should be disclosed whenever it happens?
5345000	5348000	What do you guys think about this?
5348000	5351000	I mean, is this news like, oh my God, this needs to stop?
5351000	5353000	Or is this like, oh, I'm surprised there's not more of them?
5353000	5354000	Pay me.
5354000	5355000	Pay me.
5355000	5357000	Well, we kind of knew that this kind of stuff was going on.
5357000	5362000	Because remember a while back, that whole thing leaked out back when the Xbox One was launching.
5362000	5364000	And there was like, oh, these incentive programs.
5364000	5373000	If you're on certain networks and stuff that you would get, you know, more ad revenue if you covered a certain game during a certain time period and that kind of thing.
5373000	5375000	So I'm not surprised that this is happening.
5375000	5384000	I do think that they should disclose it because I think if you're not disclosing that it's like an advertisement or, you know, an advertorial, I guess they call it.
5384000	5388000	That it's kind of disingenuous.
5388000	5395000	I don't know. I just I think that they need to disclose that kind of stuff.
5395000	5405000	Because, I mean, really, I wouldn't think any I wouldn't think poorly of somebody that does that as long as they're disclosing it.
5405000	5410000	Because let's be honest, you're not making a ton of money on a lot of people aren't making a ton of money on YouTube.
5410000	5417000	And if you're going to do that as a full time thing, then you need to be open to any opportunities that may come your way.
5417000	5432000	Not necessarily, you know, you know, hurting your own, I guess, honesty, but just, you know, taking an opportunity to say, hey, you know what?
5432000	5437000	You know, it's like Deep Silver or whatever paid us to show off some footage of Saints Row.
5437000	5441000	So here's some, you know, check it out or I don't know.
5441000	5448000	I think you'd want to be a little clever in how you say that. You just want to say, hey, I got paid, y'all. I got paid to do this.
5448000	5458000	You know, maybe Deep Silver, who has sponsored some brand new microphones and soundboards for our show, has asked us to talk about this particular game.
5458000	5461000	You know, that might be another way to do it. I don't know.
5461000	5474000	Maybe that just kind of look at it going, how would I do it? Because I would think any money, you know, I'm not just going to take it to the bank because I've never made, I don't, if you, if y'all think we make money off of OLR or VoG network, you're high because we don't.
5474000	5482000	But if we did, if somebody wanted to pay us to cover a certain thing, I think I would feel like, okay, it's not going to be a lot of money.
5482000	5487000	It's probably something that would just get put right back into the show. So it would also buy us new webcam.
5487000	5499000	It'd also have to depend on what it is because I remember like back in the day, you know, even with like some of the all game stuff, you know, we had opportunities to, you know, look at like certain accessories and stuff.
5499000	5501000	And it was just kind of like, nah.
5501000	5502000	I think it happened one time.
5502000	5508000	Yeah, one time, whatever. But, you know, I was like kind of like, nah, we're not going to do that.
5509000	5512000	All right. Anyhow, let's, let's go to a time when things were simpler.
5512000	5515000	Things were a lot simpler and you didn't have to worry about it.
5515000	5520000	People couldn't even stream this game online. You know that? But they do now. I think they do.
5520000	5522000	It is the classic game of the week.
5522000	5528000	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game.
5528000	5530000	Although many of you have probably already played this game.
5530000	5534000	But if you haven't played this game, then play it again.
5534000	5536000	Play it for the first time.
5536000	5538000	Do it. Do the thing.
5538000	5542000	Do the thing. Here it is, your classic game of the week.
5542000	5545000	Final Fantasy.
5545000	5551000	So, yes, I picked Final Fantasy, which I've done a bunch of other Final Fantasy games, but I have not yet done Final Fantasy.
5551000	5561000	So it is a role playing game that was created by Sakaguchi Hironobu, done by Square, which is now, of course, Squeenix.
5561000	5565000	It came out in 1987 and, of course, it was the first.
5565000	5573000	It came out on the Famicom slash Nintendo Entertainment System and has been remade for other consoles since then.
5573000	5579000	More recently, it was packaged with Final Fantasy II, the original II, and not Final Fantasy IV.
5579000	5590000	Basically, you play as the Light Warriors, who each have an elemental orb that have been darkened by various Fiends.
5590000	5595000	And so you have to go defeat the evil forces, restore lights of the orbs, and save the world.
5595000	5603000	It is one of the early games to do random battle encounters for experience.
5603000	5612000	At least do it in, I would probably say, a way that's become an accepted method of doing it.
5612000	5619000	It's turned into a norm because it really set a precedent for how encounters are going to work in a game.
5619000	5624000	So basically, it's an overworld map, a town and dungeon map, a battle screen, and a menu screen.
5624000	5633000	The overworld is, of course, scaled down so you can walk all over it, your little guy being the avatar that you're following through.
5633000	5642000	And you get, of course, different classes. You start off with a fighter, thief, black belt, red mage, white mage, and black mage.
5642000	5651000	Of course, we know the way they look because we know them very well. We also probably have all read 8-bit theater.
5651000	5663000	And then you get class upgrades, so you can go up to, of course, stronger character classes.
5663000	5669000	You have some magical weapons and armor that when you use them in combat, they'll cast spells.
5669000	5678000	You have artifacts for protection from spells. You can buy items. You can get tents and cabins to regenerate while you save.
5678000	5685000	Aethers are always fucking expensive. And you do different quests to gain special items.
5685000	5692000	You do have your magic, white magic, which is your defensive inhaling, and black, which is destructive magic.
5692000	5706000	And red mages use a combination of the two. But you can only carry, the spells are actually classified by level 1-8 with 4 white and 4 black spells per level.
5706000	5718000	And you only learn 3 spells per level. And the other ones that can cast, besides the red mages, would be the ninja and the knight. Of course, depending on their class.
5718000	5727000	So, basically, the game was... Sakaguchi wanted to make the game for a long time, but Square refused.
5727000	5737000	And then when Dragon Quest came out and became such a hit, they're like, okay, here, make a game! Get us Dragon Quest money.
5738000	5748000	So, basically, it was done by a group that Square called the A-Team, which was Koichi Ishii Akitoshi Kawazu.
5748000	5756000	And, of course, he was the one responsible for the battle systems and the sequences that he based off of D&D.
5756000	5759000	And the game Wizardry. Do you remember Wizardry?
5759000	5763000	Oh god, yes. That's old school.
5763000	5768000	But the basic heart of it was, it's an RPG that begins when you create the character.
5768000	5777000	So, it really is strong for the storyline. Of course, we have Uematsu doing the music.
5777000	5784000	And they got an Iranian-American programmer named Nasir Gebelli to code the game.
5785000	5800000	And so, as far as the graphics, they were designed by Shibuya Kazuko, and then also Ito Hiryoku as the debugger.
5800000	5810000	So, basically, it just started with, they had the development ROM, they took it to the Famicom magazine,
5810000	5814000	and they wouldn't review it, but Famitsu did it and gave it exclusive coverage.
5814000	5818000	And they originally were only going to make 200,000 copies to ship.
5818000	5824000	And he begged them to do 400,000, which they agreed to.
5824000	5831000	And once it was localized in North America, it really, really took on.
5831000	5838000	There is no version of the game that was marketed for the PAL region until Final Fantasy Origins in 2003.
5838000	5840000	Oh wow, I didn't realize that.
5840000	5845000	So, in 1987 and 1990, there was the original Final Fantasy.
5845000	5855000	In 1989, they did an MSX2 version that had some graphic upgrades, expanded music and sound effects, and it had loading times.
5855000	5861000	There's the Final Fantasy I-II version that was in 1994 for the Famicom.
5861000	5865000	Final Fantasy came out in 2000 for Wonderswan Color, which is the one I have.
5865000	5869000	That was actually what led me to get my first Wonderswan, was that version.
5869000	5878000	There was Final Fantasy I and II, Dawn of Souls, which was for Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Origins for PlayStation,
5878000	5885000	Final Fantasy for Mobile Phone, which was better than the 8-bit version, but less advanced than more recent versions.
5885000	5888000	There was the PSP, sorry, PSP version.
5888000	5894000	There was the full motion video sequences, remixed soundtrack, extra dungeons, script from Dawn of Souls,
5894000	5897000	virtual console release, which was the NES version.
5897000	5904000	There was an iOS version based off the PSP version, one for Windows Phone, and one for Android.
5904000	5911000	That last one, the Android one, was based off the PSP version, but did not have the bonus dungeons.
5911000	5920000	And the very first re-release was the one done for the MSX2 that was published by Microcabin in Japan in June 1989.
5920000	5925000	Switching to some of the music from one of the remakes since you're talking about them.
5925000	5934000	But it also had almost three times as much storage space as the Famicom, but the big problem it had, loading time.
5934000	5938000	But it did look and sound a lot better.
5938000	5943000	So, and of course we've got, like I said, all those other various versions that were released for various different reasons.
5943000	5949000	So if you haven't played it, why the hell not? And go ahead and get it.
5949000	5954000	There are also, keep in mind, nods to the original ones we had.
5954000	5958000	The soundtrack was released with the score for Final Fantasy II in 1989.
5958000	5970000	And there was a track that became the big one that has been in every Final Fantasy game ever called the Prelude, which you played right at the start.
5970000	5974000	And I mean, even in Final Fantasy XIV, the game starts off with that.
5974000	5980000	So, of course there have been other adaptations.
5980000	5985000	There was, in Captain N, the Game Master, there was the Fractured Fantasy of Captain N.
5985000	5989000	Of course we had 8-bit theater, like I mentioned before.
5989000	6000000	And don't forget the Dead Ale Wives parody that they would play on Dr. Demento has been done in 8-bit theater style as well.
6000000	6006000	I said I wanted blue eyes, but I decided gray. Okay, whatever. Cast Magic Missile.
6006000	6010000	So basically, that's it for Final Fantasy.
6010000	6017000	There's a whole lot more we could go into on this one, but I'd say at this point, look for it yourselves.
6017000	6020000	If you haven't already played it at this point, my gosh.
6020000	6026000	The remakes are out there everywhere on the mobile phone and everything. You can find this somewhere. For sure.
6026000	6028000	So yeah, check that out.
6028000	6034000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week. Final Fantasy, as in the original Final Fantasy.
6035000	6038000	Again, one of those games when she says it's the game of the week, I go,
6038000	6044000	you mean it hasn't been the game of the week before? In the past 250 plus times we've done this segment.
6044000	6047000	It's never been the classic game. Nope, it hasn't. So there it is.
6047000	6051000	A classic classic game without which we wouldn't have had a lot of games.
6051000	6061000	Well, and honestly, it's a really deep story for something that came out when I was a preteen.
6061000	6066000	I remember playing this on Nintendo Entertainment System, like staying up all night with my friend to play Final Fantasy.
6066000	6071000	You know what's funny though? I never beat it. We got all the way to Tiamat and couldn't beat him.
6071000	6078000	Dan and I were doing a playthrough together and we actually had the airship and then decided we got bored.
6078000	6079000	Bored now.
6082000	6088000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, history.
6088000	6094000	Alright, let's take a break. We've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come here on this week back after a week off.
6094000	6097000	We have your food question of the week. We're going to talk about more playroom news.
6097000	6103000	There's things coming to that that sound exciting. Net neutrality talk and maybe some Power Rangers chat.
6103000	6110000	I wonder if Shane's going to run into the room when he hears that. We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6110000	6126000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live on this Sunday evening, July the 20th of 2014 with episode number 560 already in progress.
6126000	6134000	I hope you guys had a good week last week even though we weren't here. I know some of you guys rely on us to help you get through your Monday at work.
6135000	6142000	But we're back and I hope you guys found another great indie show to maybe add to your rotation in the time we were away.
6142000	6147000	Because you know we always say here at Orange Lounge Radio, support independent podcasting. There's so many great shows out there, hardworking.
6147000	6159000	Obviously we're always going to pimp our pals at vognetwork.com. I always like to promote with the guys I was doing stuff with at GamerX like Koopa Club and Video Game Realness even though they weren't there.
6159000	6165000	But in spirit they were Game Bar, Game Buoy.org and so on and so on. So many great shows.
6165000	6175000	But even if none of those, none of the above appeals to you, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there hardworking doing shows for guys like you to discover.
6175000	6184000	So go and seek them out, the independent podcast of the world. In the meantime we will resume with our independent podcast and some rapid fire news. Loki.
6184000	6195000	Yes, I'm kind of happy to see that there's actually one of the D3 games I like. Onichambara Z2 Chaos is coming to Japan.
6195000	6202000	Now if you may not be familiar with the Onichambara series, it's basically like a bikini samurai game.
6202000	6209000	A very scantily clad woman with samurai swords and a cowboy hat fighting zombies.
6209000	6220000	It's been around since PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 4 version is going to feature 1080p and 60 frames per second.
6220000	6230000	Also I guess they're saying it's going to have new features like a cross-merge combination element, multi-character combo attacks and a quick time kill mode.
6231000	6240000	And I guess players will be able to trace lines on the DualShock 4 touchpad to deliver critical blows to enemies and stuff.
6240000	6247000	It's supposed to be out in Japan in October. Hopefully that means it's also going to be out in North America, which is very likely.
6247000	6251000	And the fact that it's also region free, also a good hope.
6252000	6261000	And I'm very excited because if a game like this is on the PlayStation 4, then that means that eventually Earth Defense Force will be on PlayStation 4 as well.
6261000	6270000	Speaking of which, man, that is a game I need to go back and finish playing because I started that back in February and I just kind of gave up on it.
6270000	6274000	Some positive notes in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com. Brad from PodCulture says,
6274000	6280000	Boy, talk about a guilty pleasure game. Fifth Dream says, finally, on a system I have. I'm going to totally get this.
6280000	6288000	I wish it would bring more of the simple series stuff over there like, we need an HD remake of Ambulance vs. Zombies.
6288000	6298000	Or they had one that was also with like little maids vs. zombies. They had a lot of things versus zombie games. I'd love to see that.
6299000	6301000	Alright, people love zombies it seems.
6301000	6311000	Yes. So, on top of that, there is a brand new rhythm game that's coming out on I believe IOS as well.
6311000	6323000	It's a game called Alpha Beats. And what makes Alpha Beats a little different than your standard kind of tap to the music type game is it's also kind of mixing in like Scrabble in there.
6323000	6329000	So you have to tap on the letters to the beat and you create words with them and you score points that way.
6329000	6330000	That sounds kind of fun.
6330000	6340000	Yeah, and apparently the game does have some pretty good music in it. It's only $1.99 so you can check that out on the IOS.
6340000	6343000	Are we talking licensed music when you say pretty good music or just originals?
6343000	6350000	It's like indie stuff. Like they've got a disaster piece. It's the composer that did Fez.
6350000	6351000	Oh, okay.
6351000	6353000	They've got some music from...
6353000	6356000	Kind of like the direction the new amplitude is going in a little bit.
6356000	6357000	Yeah, yeah.
6357000	6364000	And also if you want additional music they have in-app purchases for that. So you can get some additional music that way.
6364000	6377000	And then last but not least, a really strange looking game that kind of reminded me a whole ton of Noby Noby Boy or seriously like something that you would see from like the developers of Katamari.
6378000	6385000	But it's a game called Push Me, Pull You. And it's basically a two versus two local multiplayer game.
6385000	6390000	And it's coming out I guess sometime in 2014 on PC, Mac, and Linux.
6390000	6402000	But it involves almost like, not like a human centipede, but like you know, I don't know if you remember the cartoon Catdog where you know you have a cat on one end and a dog on the other end.
6402000	6405000	Well it's two torsos of humans attached to...
6405000	6407000	I remember that show. That's How Does It Take a Crap?
6407000	6413000	Yes. It's two torsos that are kind of attached to each other in the middle.
6413000	6419000	And it makes like those Noby Noby Boy type thing. And you have to move a ball around with that.
6419000	6428000	And so you're fighting against other, you know, other players that way. And so you kind of have to like, you know, ride around each other and get the ball around.
6428000	6432000	I don't know. It looks silly. And should be coming out later this year.
6432000	6436000	But yeah, totally getting the Noby Noby vibe from that.
6436000	6446000	Very cool. How'd you check that out? Lots of neat sounding games there. Guilty pleasure to music puzzle to genres I like to okay whatever. I'll try it.
6446000	6453000	Alright, moving on. Let's talk Virtual Console for a minute. We haven't seen a lot a lot of activity on Wii U Virtual Console lately.
6453000	6458000	And Sega was a big big supporter of Virtual Console. Like all the Sega classics out there and all sorts of forums.
6458000	6466000	But apparently no current plans for Wii U Virtual Console games from Sega. And this was in response to a Twitter.
6466000	6473000	Now Sega did clarify these comments a little bit in a statement saying quote Sega would like to clarify a statement that was issued over Twitter.
6473000	6483000	All options are currently on the table concerning development for the Wii U Virtual Console. Although there are no immediate plans, this does not negate the possibility and exploration of creating for this platform.
6483000	6491000	So in other words, nothing now and nothing on the table for the near future but they're not pulling like an EA or something where they're like we're done with you, bye.
6491000	6497000	Sega loves the Wii U. I mean they have their own, the Sonic games are coming exclusive to the Wii U and 3DS.
6497000	6505000	So I would think that they're in a pretty good, you know, standing. And I don't even think, they probably just maybe they're just not making a lot of money off of those.
6505000	6510000	And the fact that they'd be reissuing probably games that have been on there before that it's just almost not worth it to put the effort in.
6510000	6517000	And let's be real, if you're trying to play a classic Sega game, there's an abundance of places available to play said games.
6517000	6521000	Including what the Sonic collection, Mega Sonic Genesis, I don't know.
6521000	6527000	Yeah, I want to say that they're probably making a ton of money off of that stuff on Steam because that's where it's at.
6527000	6538000	You can get like 40 games for like 5 bucks. So Virtual Console is kind of hard to justify paying $6 a game when they're so readily available at other places.
6538000	6546000	It really is, it really is. Maybe the portability of the 3DS. And the 3D remakes are something. That's, you know, a little different.
6546000	6556000	But, yeah. Alright, anyway, speaking of Nintendo, a little bit of rabble rabble going on right now over the Club Nintendo Elite rewards which were unveiled this week.
6556000	6567000	The North America rewards were unveiled and, you know, in years past they've given away like, you know, they'll send you things in the mail like calendars and sometimes even like little collectibles and really cool little things.
6567000	6573000	Well, this year, none of that. All the rewards are downloadable games.
6573000	6588000	If you are Platinum, you can get, you can choose from Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Dylan's Rolling Western, Dr. Luigi, Earthbound, Fluidity Spin Cycle, Game & Wario, Mario & Donkey Kong Minis on the Move, and NES Remix.
6588000	6591000	Some of those games, by the way, are 3DS games, not just Wii U games in there.
6591000	6603000	If you are a Gold status, you can get Donkey Kong 3, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Metroid, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Land 2, 6 Golden Coins, Wario Land 2, and Zelda 2 The Adventures of Link.
6603000	6607000	So, some people not happy that they went all DLC.
6607000	6608000	So you only get to pick one of those?
6608000	6609000	Yeah, you get to pick one of those.
6609000	6611000	That's like 5 bucks for the Gold set.
6611000	6612000	For the Gold level, yeah.
6612000	6614000	And so, some people not happy about that.
6614000	6619000	I understand why people are a little irritated because they went and did those surveys.
6619000	6623000	Because, you know, in the past, the rewards have been very lucrative, and I get that.
6623000	6626000	But at the same time, reality check, you guys.
6626000	6630000	Nintendo hasn't exactly been bringing in the cash this year.
6630000	6633000	So they have to make some cutbacks some places, and this is one of them.
6633000	6636000	You know, so at least there's something being given away here.
6636000	6639000	And probably next year's going to be a lot better because they're going to have the Amiibo figures.
6639000	6640000	Yeah.
6640000	6641000	So you'll see something like that.
6641000	6642000	Yeah, perhaps.
6642000	6646000	But, yeah, I just, you know, take it with a grain of salt, you guys.
6646000	6647000	Nintendo hasn't had the best year.
6647000	6648000	This is where they had to make some cutbacks.
6648000	6653000	They can't exactly afford to buy everybody these little minifigures and, you know, send them all to people's houses this year.
6653000	6661000	I'm a little, like, you know, I'm like, well, I'm Gold status on Club Nintendo.
6661000	6664000	And I pretty much have every single one of those games that I wanted.
6664000	6670000	I guess I'm going to end up getting Donkey Kong 3 on 3DS because it's like the one thing I don't have.
6670000	6673000	You know, so all right, I guess I'll get that.
6673000	6675000	But I'm not, like, mad.
6675000	6678000	I'm a little bit like, oh, man, I was hoping for something a little better.
6678000	6688000	But I also kind of think, like, I've gotten way more bang for my buck out of the whole 10% back on the Wii U when you buy the games digitally.
6688000	6691000	I've gotten way better perks from that than this.
6691000	6693000	So you win some, you lose some.
6693000	6696000	I'm just still thinking about the statue we got from Club Nintendo.
6696000	6697000	Right.
6697000	6701000	And it was just a really nice, you know, Super Mario Brothers cast.
6701000	6705000	Well, that was when Nintendo was making buku bucks.
6705000	6706000	They're not now.
6706000	6708000	So this is what happens.
6708000	6710000	You want the perks, buy more Nintendo.
6710000	6711000	Exactly.
6711000	6715000	Maybe, I mean, if Mario Kart 8 keeps selling, maybe there'll be more of that next year.
6715000	6717000	Who knows? Who knows?
6717000	6718000	All right.
6718000	6719000	Let's see.
6719000	6720000	One more story for you guys.
6720000	6723000	This is a game that was actually unveiled at GamerX.
6723000	6726000	I believe I was at the panel where they talked about this game for the first time.
6726000	6731000	It is a game from Atari, of all folks, called Pride Fest.
6731000	6740000	Pride Fest is a game coming from Atari where you will be creating and launching your first gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender pride parade.
6740000	6747000	The game will allow players to design and customize floats, solve challenges to unlock new festival and parade supplies,
6747000	6753000	and each building has a fun capacity, and once it's filled, the building upgrades and draws even more city folk to the party.
6753000	6756000	No further details at this time, no images or anything like that.
6756000	6761000	But I need to know if they have t-shirt cannons, because that's really the most important thing.
6764000	6765000	Yeah.
6765000	6767000	As long as I get to make my asexual float, I'm happy.
6767000	6781000	I think it's, you know, on one hand, I'm kind of like, all right, this is just going to be another one of those dippy management, tiny tower-esque iPhone games, you know, whatever, whatever.
6781000	6790000	But at the same time, it is really cool that Atari, which has a lot of history behind it, is doing a, like, pride game.
6790000	6795000	Let's just hope, and I'm glad that they're doing that, let's just hope that it's done tastefully as well.
6795000	6797000	Yeah, there's a lot of room for error with that in there.
6797000	6802000	Fifth Dream says gay pride tycoon, and then gay pride simulator 2015.
6802000	6809000	Yeah, and sometimes these pride events can be pretty commercial, so I'm curious to see how they pull it off. We'll see.
6809000	6817000	I'm trying not to be a cynic about it. I'm really not. I think it's really cool that Atari went to GamerX. I think it's really cool that they were kind of feeling out the con.
6817000	6820000	I think it's really cool that Atari has a game coming out.
6820000	6826000	There's that too. And it's great. What are you laughing about?
6826000	6827000	SSG100 Matt.
6827000	6833000	SSG100 Matt in chat says, is there a Mama Tits expansion where you can beat down protesters?
6833000	6835000	I love Mama Tits.
6835000	6847000	Oh my god. You know what's funny? A friend of mine I've known online for years. A friend of mine online dates back to Life Journal, is now a drag queen in Seattle, and like knows Mama Tits, and actually wrote the article about that that went viral.
6847000	6850000	So it was really funny to kind of watch it from his perspective on Facebook.
6850000	6851000	That's cool.
6851000	6867000	Yeah, all these people are like seeing that video. So, anyway, um, yeah, that would actually be really awesome. You know, but the game that's not talked about in this story is that they also confirmed that RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis 2 is in the making for iPhone.
6867000	6869000	Work! Yes!
6869000	6872000	And they go, woooo!
6872000	6876000	Have you ever played, I'm sure, Loki, have you ever played RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis?
6876000	6877000	No, I have not.
6877000	6878000	I haven't either.
6878000	6882000	It's, you know, it's one of those things where it's like you have to try it if you're a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race.
6882000	6884000	Is that like the Kim Kardashian game?
6884000	6892000	No, it's a little better than that, but like, it's all these quotes, because RuPaul actually recorded dialogue, and they got like Pandora Box, a bunch of people to do dialogue.
6892000	6902000	So it's like as you're running through it, you know, you hear a character, yes! Woo! You better work! Amen! You know, it's just like all the little catchphrases from the show.
6902000	6905000	It's fun for five minutes, and then you're like, turn the volume down.
6905000	6908000	Okay, I have to ask, is Drag U still running?
6908000	6911000	No, Drag U was cancelled a year or two ago.
6911000	6914000	I'd never watched Drag Race, but I watched Drag U.
6914000	6919000	Yeah, RuPaul cancelled it. Well, he didn't cancel it, but confirmed it was cancelled a couple years ago.
6919000	6925000	That was just such a cool show, because I know that's not what we're talking about.
6925000	6931000	It's fine. You know what, if we want to have a Drag Race side conversation, we will. God damn it.
6931000	6941000	Just because I thought that it was good that it was, you know, sort of in the theme of the whole glamour of drag, but something that was for women who were feeling drab.
6941000	6943000	Yeah, it was great.
6943000	6949000	I thought that, because there's a lot that women can learn about just glamour and letting loose from drag queens.
6949000	6955000	It was a very new version of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. You remember that show? It was very, you know...
6955000	6956000	Love that show.
6956000	6957000	But on top of that, it was...
6957000	6959000	I don't know why I love that show.
6959000	6962000	Loki loved that show more than I did, like seriously.
6962000	6969000	Except the first, was it the pilot episode or the pilot season or whatever, what the fuck was going on there?
6969000	6971000	Because the cast was like, eh.
6971000	6972000	It was different.
6972000	6975000	Yeah, I didn't like different. I don't like different.
6975000	6977000	You bought the soundtrack, even. I remember that.
6977000	6979000	I downloaded the soundtrack.
6979000	6985000	No, Rob, I bought the soundtrack. At least three tracks out of it made it into my spin class that I was in.
6986000	6988000	It had like, was it the...
6988000	6990000	It had Basement Jackson in it.
6990000	6994000	Oh god. Where's Basement Jackson? Have they released a new album?
6994000	6997000	That's something you need to look into, because I fucking love Basement Jax.
6997000	7001000	In the basement. At the Alamo.
7001000	7002000	At any rate...
7002000	7004000	I gotta look that up right now.
7004000	7008000	It's not, you know, dressing up in things that someone would wear every day.
7008000	7013000	But it was a really, you know, just interesting, fun thing to do.
7013000	7018000	And I don't know if you've also heard of the women who dress quote in drag.
7018000	7020000	Who basically go from...
7020000	7021000	Both queens.
7021000	7022000	Yeah. But I think...
7022000	7027000	Which is, and I mean no disrespect with this comment. Absolutely none.
7027000	7032000	But when Victoria shows me all this burlesque stuff she's doing, I'm like, so that's basically being a drag queen.
7032000	7034000	But like taking your clothes off.
7034000	7036000	Oh my god, there's so many albums I've missed!
7036000	7038000	What the hell?
7039000	7040000	I didn't...
7042000	7043000	Alright, anyway, anyway.
7043000	7044000	Yeah.
7044000	7045000	Alright, we can talk about...
7045000	7047000	So how about this, how about I start watching Drag Race next season?
7047000	7050000	Fantastic, we should have a viewing party or something, it would be fun.
7050000	7055000	Alright, anyway, from drag queens to a very similar subject, Star Wars, right?
7055000	7056000	Dark Saga?
7056000	7057000	Oh yeah.
7057000	7058000	I mean...
7058000	7061000	Because there were lots of queens in the Old Republic.
7061000	7063000	Did you see what Queen Amidala's wearing?
7063000	7065000	Have you ever seen Travis doing his Queen Amidala?
7065000	7067000	With the bra on his head.
7067000	7068000	Yes.
7068000	7074000	Which actually is funny, I miss taking a picture of my cat with my bra on her head.
7074000	7081000	Because I just left it on the bed and next thing I know I see the cat's head peeking out from under the middle bit.
7081000	7082000	I'm like...
7082000	7086000	And the first thing I thought is, my cat is Queen Amidala, thanks Travis.
7086000	7088000	So anyway.
7088000	7093000	Star Wars The Old Republic generated 165 million last year.
7093000	7095000	But guess what's still on top?
7095000	7096000	Wow.
7096000	7097000	Wow.
7097000	7098000	Wow.
7098000	7103000	And I actually went and looked at the list and worldwide MMO titles in 2013.
7103000	7105000	Top was World of Warcraft, followed by Lineage.
7105000	7111000	And then Terra Online, followed by Star Wars The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, which I played for a little bit.
7111000	7112000	It was pretty.
7112000	7117000	Eve Online, Ion, Blade and Soul, Lineage 2, and Rift.
7117000	7121000	I'm kind of surprised that Terra's as high up on that list.
7121000	7123000	I guess it's bigger in Korea and stuff though, isn't it?
7123000	7125000	Yeah, and this is a worldwide list.
7125000	7126000	Yeah, okay.
7126000	7130000	Well, yeah, Lineage wouldn't even be in the top 10 if it was just America.
7130000	7132000	I mean, no offense, Lineage is fine.
7132000	7136000	It's just that that game has its huge following in Asia.
7136000	7138000	I still have my Lineage Coke can.
7138000	7139000	Oh, right.
7139000	7141000	Yeah, not a bad game.
7141000	7142000	Not shading the game, I'm just saying.
7142000	7146000	I'm still incredibly jealous that China has Call of Duty Online.
7146000	7151000	I would be very curious what would happen to that list if you threw the MOBAs into the mix.
7151000	7158000	Because, you know, something we're not talking a lot about tonight, but is very much going on, is like, you know, the International for Dota 2, and it's on frickin' ESPN3.
7158000	7160000	I've still not tried a MOBA at all.
7160000	7162000	You really? Just try it for fun.
7162000	7173000	The problem is, I think the easiest one to pick up and learn is Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm, but it's still in its super special secret club invite phase.
7173000	7177000	So you have to, you know, get an invite in order to play it.
7177000	7179000	But League of Legends has a decent tutorial.
7179000	7182000	Dota has a really good tutorial, too. I just think, or Dota 2.
7182000	7186000	I just think the problem with Dota 2 is that there's a lot more micromanagement in that game.
7186000	7191000	Like, when you look at the management in that game versus Heroes of the Storm, it's a lot.
7191000	7194000	And that doesn't make it bad, people. I'm not saying that makes Dota 2 bad.
7194000	7195000	I enjoyed my time with Dota 2.
7195000	7199000	What about the DC one that they have? Don't they have, like, a DC or Marvel one or something?
7199000	7201000	Oh, I'm sure everybody's going for that now.
7201000	7204000	By the way, Alan's made quite a bit of commentary about Queer Eye.
7204000	7205000	Oh, please.
7205000	7206000	In the chat.
7206000	7207000	Oh, I'll read it here.
7207000	7208000	Yeah, you read it.
7209000	7213000	Okay, so fine. If the chatters want to talk about Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, I don't have a problem with that.
7213000	7214000	Alan Huckabee says,
7214000	7219000	Queer Eye for the Straight Guy sucked after the third season because the guys they made over just got hotter and hotter and hotter.
7219000	7223000	The dudes in Season 1 and Season 2 were real trolls, so the turnaround was incredibly impressive.
7223000	7227000	In later seasons, it was like, okay, this dude is not having trouble getting laid.
7227000	7231000	We're just giving him some hot bro 25k of new shit for his apartment and a haircut.
7231000	7232000	This isn't interesting anymore.
7233000	7234000	True that.
7234000	7240000	It kind of just jumped the shark at some point, especially when they started having the Queer Eye for the Straight Girl and all that.
7240000	7242000	It wasn't the same thing.
7242000	7248000	So, anyway, more news. We have Pinball FX2 coming out for Xbox One on July 31st.
7248000	7250000	The circle is complete.
7250000	7256000	And it will include, basically, the entire Pinball FX2 library, or nearly all.
7256000	7262000	Including the Star Wars packs, the Marvel Pinball Tables, Plants vs. Zombies, and the original Zen Tables.
7262000	7273000	And it is going to be, the tables will be 1080p, 60 frames per second, and they will range between $249 and $299 with packs at $999.
7273000	7276000	So, and that's in American dollars.
7276000	7284000	And then last, but not least, we have a game that's now called Game Journal Simulator.
7284000	7293000	Basically, you are playing as a journalist for a video game company.
7293000	7300000	And so, basically, it's just, it's something more inspired by Goat Simulator and Rock Simulator 2014.
7300000	7305000	A collaborative project between, I guess, Evangelho.
7305000	7310000	So, are there two buttons in the simulator? One for copy and one for paste?
7311000	7314000	It's a fair question. He's laughing.
7314000	7323000	Oh, no, because you have to have the action menu button for find inappropriately copyrighted material to use as your source.
7323000	7325000	Repost, repost, repost, repost.
7325000	7330000	Let's make Podcast Simulator.
7330000	7332000	Podcast Simulator.
7332000	7334000	Clickbait headline, clickbait headline.
7334000	7335000	That's right.
7335000	7339000	You won't believe the things that they're doing in this generation of gaming.
7339000	7341000	Here's ten reasons.
7341000	7344000	Let's talk all about Kickstarter, picture of giant breasts.
7344000	7346000	You know, it's like, what?
7346000	7348000	I got to see this picture.
7348000	7351000	Oh, that's not even, doesn't have anything to do with it.
7351000	7354000	Alright, that was some rapid fire news.
7354000	7356000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week.
7356000	7361000	Because every week on this show, we go to our Facebook community and we go to our Google Plus community.
7361000	7365000	And when you put those words together, you get foogle.
7365000	7371000	And because of my playlist reset during the show earlier, I don't have my music for this.
7371000	7375000	Foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y, foogle-y.
7375000	7377000	I kind of want a new theme song.
7377000	7380000	We have foogle-y, we have foogle-y, I don't know.
7380000	7383000	Oh, my God. Can somebody put that through auto-tune?
7383000	7386000	No, it wasn't out of tune, was it?
7386000	7388000	No, no, put it in auto-tune.
7388000	7390000	Alright, forget it. I found it.
7390000	7392000	It's not here, foogle.
7401000	7404000	Alright, here it is, the foogle question of the week.
7404000	7409000	As technology improves, the graphics in games gets more and more real.
7409000	7414000	In fact, a news station used a screenshot from Metal Gear Solid 5 in a report on Child Soldiers.
7414000	7415000	So we talked about this earlier in the show.
7415000	7416000	Womp, womp.
7416000	7421000	When was a point from you in video game graphics history where you said,
7421000	7424000	wow, these graphics look so real.
7424000	7426000	Come on, we've all done it, right?
7426000	7429000	Like, they can't get more real than they are now, right?
7429000	7431000	I could actually tell you an example.
7431000	7432000	You've got to get away till the end.
7432000	7436000	Admit it, was it Mode 7, or was it the PlayStation 2 or even 3 era
7436000	7439000	for you to believe a Final Fantasy cut scene looked way too good?
7439000	7440000	What is it?
7440000	7441000	So let's go to some of the comments.
7441000	7443000	We're going to start over on Facebook.
7443000	7448000	From AZHP who said, when the PlayStation 2 was being revealed to E3
7448000	7453000	and they showed that it could render Final Fantasy VIII's ballroom scene in real time,
7453000	7457000	I was blown away, I wanted the PlayStation 2 right then and there.
7457000	7459000	And they never did do that, of course.
7459000	7462000	That was like the PlayStation 3 and the Final Fantasy VII pages.
7462000	7463000	It's just concept only.
7463000	7465000	They like to do that a lot.
7465000	7471000	Robert K says, it wasn't until the Dreamcast and Shenmue that I was left absolutely gobsmacked.
7471000	7475000	For the time, the realism was nothing short of astounding to me.
7475000	7478000	Characters that didn't look like you'd lose an eye if you bumped into them
7478000	7481000	in a true living lifelike world and a kitten.
7481000	7486000	Tech 2030 says, Grand Theft Auto 3 was the first game that blew me away with its graphics.
7486000	7489000	I was a Nintendo kid up until that point, but after playing it at a friend's house,
7489000	7491000	I went out and bought a PlayStation 2 for it.
7491000	7494000	SHJ100Matt says, I don't remember the specific game,
7494000	7497000	but I do remember family members being blown away at times.
7497000	7501000	My father was blown away by Star Wars Shadows of the Empire on the N64,
7501000	7504000	and my older brother thought I was watching a live NBA game
7504000	7507000	when he caught me playing NBA 2K1 on Dreamcast.
7507000	7510000	Rod L replies and says, I'm going to show my age now.
7510000	7514000	The 1990 hit on Commodore 64, Creatures.
7514000	7518000	I love this answer, and I must be showing my age too.
7518000	7522000	The art style was very much in the vein of the kids' TV show Trap Door,
7522000	7524000	but with a bloody-minded sense of humor.
7524000	7526000	It was the quality of the animation that blew me away.
7526000	7529000	I remember thinking, this is like watching a TV show.
7529000	7531000	That's an awesome answer.
7531000	7534000	And Rod is over in the UK where the Commodore 64 was even bigger than it was here,
7534000	7538000	so I'm sure that's where that kind of comes from a little bit.
7538000	7540000	Because I don't remember that game over here,
7540000	7543000	but by 1990, we had a Nintendo in the house,
7543000	7546000	and I wasn't playing as many games on Commodore 64 at that point.
7546000	7548000	I miss Commodore.
7548000	7549000	Sniff. All right.
7549000	7550000	I'll find you one.
7550000	7551000	Huh?
7551000	7552000	I'll find you one.
7552000	7553000	My parents have one to give me if it still works.
7553000	7554000	It's in their garage.
7554000	7555000	Get it.
7555000	7557000	I know. I don't even know what to play on it.
7557000	7558000	I don't have discs.
7558000	7562000	Where am I going to find five and a quarter floppies to put Commodore games on?
7562000	7564000	I'll get back to you on that.
7564000	7565000	Okay. Good.
7565000	7569000	Renee, if you guys want to donate something to push the show forward,
7569000	7573000	you want to say a nice thank you or something for the past few years,
7573000	7575000	get me a Commodore 64.
7575000	7579000	Not that I'm not above begging when it comes to a Commodore 64.
7579000	7581000	Don't they have those newer ones?
7581000	7583000	Yeah, I really thought about getting one of those.
7583000	7584000	They were kind of overpriced.
7584000	7586000	They did an MSX too, so if somebody wants to.
7586000	7588000	No, actually, if anyone wants to donate anything to the show,
7588000	7590000	it'll be a Duo RX for Jamie.
7590000	7592000	Just send us classic games.
7592000	7593000	That's it.
7593000	7595000	Send Jamie a Duo RX.
7595000	7597000	And some chicken.
7597000	7598000	And some chicken.
7598000	7599000	All right.
7599000	7601000	Renee replies and says,
7601000	7603000	It took me a little while to think of when exactly this happened,
7603000	7606000	but I pinpointed to when Virtua Fighter came out in the arcades
7606000	7608000	and then onto the Sega Saturn.
7608000	7611000	That game and that console really opened my eyes
7611000	7614000	and made me realize that this was what was to come in the future of video games.
7614000	7615000	Alan Alchemy says,
7615000	7616000	Here are my biggest three.
7616000	7619000	The Mode 7 used in the opening minutes of Secret of Mana.
7619000	7622000	The pre-rendered opening cinematics of Resident Evil 2.
7622000	7623000	Ooh, that's a good one.
7623000	7629000	And the graphics of the launch title Soul Calibur HD remake for the Dreamcast.
7629000	7630000	Joe G says,
7630000	7633000	I'd have to say the opening cut scene from Final Fantasy VII.
7633000	7634000	It was so gorgeous.
7634000	7636000	I'd say Final Fantasy X, but I played.
7636000	7637000	Oh, sorry.
7637000	7638000	It was XII, not VII.
7638000	7639000	Sorry, guys.
7639000	7642000	And that was Haseo Sumeruogawa who said that.
7642000	7644000	Final Fantasy XII.
7644000	7645000	I misread.
7645000	7646000	I just saw the II.
7646000	7649000	But, yeah, the opening scene to XII was pretty kick butt.
7649000	7651000	Pretty kick butt.
7651000	7652000	All right.
7652000	7654000	Let's go over to our Google Plus page
7654000	7656000	because I know we got a couple answers over there.
7656000	7660000	I don't want to make sure we read those too.
7660000	7662000	Let's see.
7662000	7663000	I think there's just a couple.
7663000	7665000	Three.
7665000	7666000	Act Def says,
7666000	7669000	I think it was during the PlayStation 2, Xbox GameCube generations
7669000	7672000	that actually got me to say this almost looks real.
7672000	7675000	Granted, in comparison to what we have now, they kind of suck.
7675000	7678000	But it was pretty cool to see some realistic graphics back in the day
7678000	7682000	and just be amazed at how much video games have improved in that sense.
7682000	7683000	Ronnie B says,
7683000	7685000	When I played Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
7685000	7687000	That's a really good answer.
7687000	7688000	Redertainment says,
7688000	7691000	I was playing NBA 2K13 and my mom saw me playing it,
7691000	7693000	thinking it was an actual live game.
7693000	7696000	My mom asked me why I was watching a basketball game from earlier in the year.
7696000	7699000	I simply told her that it was a video game and not a real one.
7699000	7702000	I've never had a problem telling the difference between video games and reality
7702000	7704000	because reality bites.
7704000	7705000	There you go.
7705000	7708000	Thank you for those answers from our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
7708000	7710000	Dark Soccer, I know you were waiting to answer this yourself.
7710000	7712000	When did video games, when did it get too real?
7712000	7715000	It wasn't necessarily a thing for me.
7715000	7719000	Just because, I mean, if you put a CG thing next to you,
7719000	7720000	I can almost always pick it out.
7720000	7722000	But then again, I know things to look for.
7722000	7724000	I can't turn that off.
7724000	7728000	My boss, when I worked at Aladdin's Castle, his name was Anthony.
7728000	7729000	I would love to find him again.
7729000	7731000	He was a great guy.
7731000	7733000	But we had Tekken 3 there.
7733000	7735000	And this was before any other place had Tekken 3.
7735000	7737000	They were only at Namco Arcades.
7737000	7742000	And he was looking at the intro to Tekken 3 and he's like,
7742000	7744000	he's like, I promise you 10 years from now,
7744000	7747000	no one's going to be able to tell the difference.
7747000	7749000	And it was just like,
7749000	7750000	and in that case, yeah,
7750000	7752000	there were some games you really could not tell the difference.
7752000	7753000	Yeah.
7753000	7756000	So, and I think my response was,
7756000	7758000	no, they're always going to be too pretty to be real.
7758000	7763000	Strangely accurate.
7763000	7767000	That was during my Jinx obsession,
7767000	7770000	because I was vaguely obsessed with Jinx Kazama.
7770000	7772000	Loki, do you have an answer for this?
7772000	7774000	There's never really been a thing where I've said,
7774000	7776000	oh, this is going to be like the best it's ever going to be,
7776000	7779000	but the graphics and graphics of the five are pretty damn impressive.
7779000	7780000	Yeah.
7780000	7785000	Even just the current gen, or last gen stuff, I guess, is pretty nice.
7785000	7789000	I mean, as a game, I guess you got to get it on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
7789000	7790000	Whatever, right?
7790000	7792000	Add that to the list.
7792000	7795000	But yeah, I mean, I think that's really impressive.
7795000	7799000	I want to say there was probably a time like PlayStation 2 or something,
7799000	7804000	probably one of the intro videos or something that looked really good.
7804000	7805000	I don't know.
7806000	7808000	I remember being really impressed with Twisted Metal Black
7808000	7812000	when that first came out, and that's even pretty basic.
7812000	7813000	I really wish they'd do another.
7813000	7815000	I know they did Twisted Metal, but that was all fucked up.
7815000	7819000	I really wish they'd do more of a Twisted Metal Black type game.
7819000	7821000	It'd be amazing.
7821000	7822000	All right.
7822000	7826000	I would say my answer would be, honestly,
7826000	7831000	I would go way back to the Nintendo Entertainment System
7831000	7835000	and a game that, when it came out, I was like, this is like a cartoon.
7835000	7839000	I'm playing a cartoon, and it looks just like a TV cartoon.
7839000	7842000	Mega Man 2 was the game, and I was like, the graphics are so freaking good.
7842000	7843000	It's like I'm playing a cartoon.
7843000	7844000	It really is.
7844000	7851000	And then probably, honestly, I remember playing on the Super Nintendo Pilot Wings
7851000	7853000	and just being blown away by the Mode 7 stuff.
7853000	7855000	Like, how cool was that the first time you saw that?
7855000	7857000	I mean, you go back at it and look at it now, and you're like,
7857000	7859000	God, it's so pixely and blocky.
7859000	7862000	But at the time, being a kid, especially,
7862000	7865000	and taking that big step up from the Nintendo Entertainment System
7865000	7866000	just blew my mind.
7866000	7869000	The Rocket Belt stuff was so much fun.
7869000	7872000	I remember, like, arcade game-wise, I mean,
7872000	7874000	I used to love some of the driving cabinets and stuff,
7874000	7879000	but one of the most fun driving cabinets I had would probably have been
7879000	7882000	the F-Zero GX cabinet.
7882000	7883000	Oh, yes.
7883000	7885000	That was just awesome.
7885000	7886000	It's awesome.
7886000	7889000	It's really just kind of the sense of speed,
7889000	7892000	especially when you get those fancy cabinets that tilt and everything.
7892000	7893000	Oh, that was awesome.
7893000	7895000	Good times. Good times.
7895000	7896000	All right, great answers.
7896000	7899000	Thanks, you guys, for another successful FUGO Question of the Week.
7899000	7902000	Let's get back onto some other gaming news.
7902000	7904000	We'll run through this pretty quick because I know we have a few emails
7904000	7906000	because we weren't here last week.
7906000	7907000	We've got to catch up on some emails.
7907000	7908000	So, Loki.
7908000	7909000	So this is kind of neat.
7909000	7912000	Sony kind of picking up the, hey, you know what?
7912000	7914000	People are actually using Playroom to do things other than just play Playroom.
7914000	7918000	They're actually doing shows and all sorts of stuff.
7918000	7921000	Of course, not necessarily bringing light to the porn stuff,
7921000	7923000	but, yeah, they're doing shows.
7923000	7924000	So guess what?
7924000	7926000	There's going to be a brand new update that's coming called Set Maker,
7926000	7930000	and it adds a bunch of new functionality to it to aid in production of hosted shows.
7930000	7933000	You can use a tablet as a production suite.
7933000	7937000	You'd be able to add all sorts of different virtual objects and effects,
7937000	7940000	studio lights, digital banners.
7940000	7942000	This is really cool.
7942000	7946000	They can even interact with Twitch and put polls up where they can,
7946000	7949000	you know, who's your favorite character?
7949000	7953000	And they list some stuff, and you're able to vote in real time on there
7953000	7954000	and that kind of thing.
7954000	7957000	So really cool stuff.
7957000	7961000	I'm glad to see they're kind of embracing what people are doing in game room,
7961000	7965000	and maybe we'll actually see some more shows out of this.
7965000	7966000	It'd be pretty cool.
7966000	7969000	Yeah, you know, I'm all for indie broadcasting,
7969000	7971000	and I think it's really cool.
7971000	7975000	Do you think this is something we should – I'm going to pose this to the chatters.
7975000	7978000	I know that Dark Soccer is not interested in doing video,
7978000	7981000	and she doesn't have to because, you know, even when we were doing the Justin TV thing,
7981000	7982000	we found a way around it.
7982000	7985000	But is video something you guys are seriously interested in?
7985000	7988000	Because if so, we have a space for it.
7988000	7990000	I can plop a PlayStation 4 over there.
7990000	7993000	We can maneuver Jamie so that maybe just her shoes are on camera or something
7993000	7996000	and do the show that way again.
7996000	7998000	I'll make sure to wear funny socks.
7998000	7999000	I think you should do that.
7999000	8000000	I'll be Nanny.
8000000	8003000	Yes, you're like Nanny from Muppet Babies.
8003000	8005000	I'll speak with a trombone or I'll wear a mask.
8005000	8008000	Although I just want to say I think you're a very pretty gal,
8008000	8011000	and you should have nothing to worry about with a camera.
8011000	8014000	I respect that it is your right to choose who you'd like to do it or not.
8014000	8015000	I don't want it to steal my soul.
8015000	8017000	Fair enough, fair enough.
8017000	8021000	But yeah, maybe that's something we're going to have to look into.
8021000	8023000	I don't know. Would you guys be interested in that?
8023000	8024000	Rob, I'm like Daft Punk.
8024000	8025000	Huh?
8025000	8026000	I'm like Daft Punk.
8026000	8027000	Are you?
8027000	8028000	I'll have an Android outfit for –
8028000	8031000	I would have to see how it affects, stream wise,
8031000	8038000	if you can stream that to Twitch and it might be hard watching the chat room for Twitch.
8038000	8042000	I don't know how it even displays on TV as far as showing what's on there.
8042000	8043000	I don't know if it's –
8043000	8047000	That's a very good point, especially on nights when we have a lot of people here
8047000	8051000	and we have guests, especially when Jason's here as well,
8051000	8052000	and then we have another guest on top of that.
8052000	8054000	Everybody's got their computers.
8054000	8055000	We've got to be very careful with the bandwidth.
8055000	8059000	That's a very good point and something we have to take into consideration is that audio gets priority.
8059000	8062000	The show is called Orange Lawns Radio and that is always going to be the priority.
8062000	8066000	I never got the thrill of watching it because I kind of –
8066000	8070000	but at the same time, I realize some of our listeners want to see that
8070000	8074000	and we do have these things that happen occasionally where it's like it is a visual reference.
8074000	8078000	Like something falls over or something funny happens or I'm saying look at that
8078000	8081000	and it just inevitably happens even though it's a radio show.
8081000	8083000	So I can respect that.
8083000	8087000	But I love the idea, so we'll see. We will see.
8087000	8091000	All right. Yeah, sg100matt says, I don't see why not.
8091000	8094000	Sounds like something that could be cool, but I would block the chat room on there.
8094000	8095000	Too much venom.
8095000	8096000	Oh, I would too.
8096000	8101000	I wouldn't even have it on the screen and I would have some type of sign that said to join chat,
8101000	8104000	go to live that – or we could actually moderate it.
8104000	8108000	And then if you don't even pay attention to the comments in there, it won't even be an issue
8108000	8112000	because yeah, I'm not going to have people trolling for the sake of trolling.
8112000	8119000	Anybody who has something intelligent to say is intelligent enough to go to another website to do it, right?
8119000	8120000	There you go.
8120000	8125000	All right, let's talk about Super Smash Brothers Wii U, which is – is that its real name?
8125000	8126000	That's the name they're going to release it as?
8126000	8131000	It's actually – the box art says Super Smash Brothers for Wii U.
8131000	8132000	That's so weird that –
8132000	8134000	It's so stupid is what it is.
8134000	8137000	I'm not a fan of the name. I'm really not. I mean, I understand –
8137000	8140000	Yeah, the other one's Super Smash Brothers for 3DS.
8140000	8144000	I don't like that. I don't know what they were thinking with that, but whatever. So it is what it is.
8144000	8146000	It's worth their thinking that we don't want to come up with a name.
8146000	8149000	This is the company that thought Wii was a good name?
8149000	8153000	But it ended up working. But anyway, anyway.
8153000	8159000	So apparently there is a rumor out there, thanks to a GameStop manager, so to tell you with a big grain of salt,
8159000	8166000	that every copy of Smash Brothers that comes out for the Wii U is going to come with a free amiibo figure
8166000	8169000	and that the street date for this will be November 21st when this comes out.
8169000	8173000	I wouldn't doubt this at all, actually. This makes a lot of sense.
8173000	8181000	The date makes sense. The amiibo figure being thrown in there makes a lot of sense to kind of get people started with that.
8181000	8189000	I wouldn't doubt that there might be two SKUs, one with a figure and one without, or that, you know, this being GameStop,
8189000	8195000	the figure is a pre-order exclusive at GameStop. Maybe they get one figure. Amazon gets another figure.
8195000	8201000	Target gets another. Who knows? Something along those lines. I really hope it doesn't go that way.
8201000	8209000	But Nintendo has done something that I really hated. The Xenoblade thing when they released that only at GameStop
8209000	8213000	and online on Nintendo's website. That was like the worst thing they ever did.
8213000	8219000	So it could be a possibility. But yeah, we'll see.
8219000	8223000	Also, in the Smash Brothers universe, there were some new characters confirmed this week.
8223000	8229000	A couple of folks from Fire Emblem, Lucina and Robin, and Captain Falcon officially added to the Smash Brothers roster.
8229000	8231000	And Lady Robin.
8231000	8233000	That is right.
8233000	8236000	Because Nintendo has no problem rendering a woman.
8236000	8239000	Rendering female characters is very easy for Nintendo.
8239000	8241000	It is a little weird to see.
8241000	8244000	The Wii U is simpler hardware, Dark Soccer. Is that the issue?
8244000	8247000	It's a little strange that they're gender swapping just that one character.
8247000	8249000	I mean, are they gonna...
8249000	8251000	Oh yeah, Wii Fit Trainer can gender swap male and female.
8251000	8255000	Yeah, but that's two different characters though. I don't think there's a female Robin in Fire Emblem.
8255000	8259000	I think it's just that they created this new character. Does that increase the roster?
8259000	8263000	Although, maybe Lucinda will have a swap with...
8263000	8267000	Can we get a male Samus, but just call it Justin Bailey?
8267000	8270000	That'd just be Sam.
8270000	8272000	And he is Justin Bailey.
8272000	8274000	Alright.
8274000	8276000	Yeah, so that's pretty cool that that's out there.
8276000	8280000	However, the only downside to that is that I still have not had Nests confirmed for me.
8280000	8283000	Look, I've given up hope that Luc... I don't care that Lucas doesn't come back.
8283000	8285000	I've given up on that a long time ago.
8285000	8286000	PK Fire!
8286000	8288000	Where the fuck is Ness? Where is he?
8288000	8290000	Do not piss me off, Nintendo.
8290000	8291000	Do not piss me off.
8291000	8294000	Well, they have Gamescom, they have Comic-Con.
8294000	8296000	They've gotta save their announcements.
8296000	8298000	They're gonna slowly... they're slow burning this.
8298000	8299000	True.
8299000	8305000	Shane's texting me from the other room saying that in Fire Emblem, when you pick your gender, you can be female Robin.
8305000	8306000	So it is...
8306000	8308000	Okay, so it's a legit character thing.
8308000	8310000	Thanks, Shane. Who's too lazy.
8310000	8311000	Thank you, Shane.
8311000	8313000	She's screaming from the bedroom. Welcome!
8313000	8314000	He's in the living room.
8314000	8315000	Where's your living room?
8315000	8316000	I saw him just in there.
8316000	8318000	You texted me from the living room?
8318000	8320000	He said he was lazy.
8320000	8324000	Do I need to go put a condenser mic in there?
8324000	8326000	He said, no, what's that?
8326000	8328000	What's a condenser mic?
8328000	8330000	Alright. Moving on.
8330000	8333000	That kind of makes me think of the weird conversation I had with Dan the other day.
8333000	8334000	What's that?
8334000	8336000	Mopar. Mostly old parts and rust.
8336000	8338000	And then he had to go look it up.
8340000	8342000	I know mocap. Alright.
8342000	8344000	No, it's Dan got filters for my car.
8344000	8346000	Dark Sakura. Let's move on. Another story.
8346000	8350000	Well, people don't like this bullshit about the net neutrality changes.
8350000	8352000	They really don't like it.
8352000	8358000	Like, you heard about the guy who went in and tested the throttling.
8358000	8361000	And then posted that up for everyone to get pissed off about.
8361000	8370000	Well, there's also now over 1 million comments to the FCC about the net neutrality changes.
8370000	8379000	In fact, according to Gigi Sohn with the FCC, as of noon, and this was on the 17th of July,
8379000	8386000	1,300,000 net neutrality comments had been filed with the FCC.
8386000	8395000	And we had a lot of this put out, a comment put out by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee
8395000	8401000	that runs a site called No Slow Lane saying, and I'll just read the quote on here.
8401000	8408000	This is an extraordinary outcry from over 1 million Americans, forcing the FCC to extend its deadline to handle the deluge, make it clear.
8408000	8412000	The American public demands that the FCC side with them on net neutrality.
8412000	8416000	Not big telecom companies like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Time Warner.
8416000	8421000	And that's a quote coming from Keith Rota, the PCCC organizer.
8421000	8425000	Whoo! Keep making your voices heard. They're listening.
8425000	8432000	That's great. Yeah, definitely. If you don't let your voice be heard in this government stuff,
8432000	8436000	then they're just going to do what the companies are paying them to do.
8436000	8441000	And your politicians will keep voting the way that their lobbyists pay them to.
8441000	8446000	Until they know that they won't get reelected if they continue to do so. So, very important.
8446000	8449000	All right, just a few more stories and then the mailbag. Loki.
8449000	8455000	So, in Europe, there was this whole thing about the free-to-play games and, you know,
8455000	8465000	they basically forcing some, or they wanted some better restrictions regarding in-app, accidental in-app purchases made on different devices.
8465000	8470000	And they're actually pretty happy with how Google's handled everything.
8470000	8474000	Apple, on the other hand, hasn't really stepped up yet.
8474000	8476000	And now, what exactly has Google done?
8476000	8485000	Well, they have decided in the European regions to actually not mark games that are free-to-play, if you will,
8485000	8489000	that have in-app purchases as actually free.
8489000	8491000	You can download them.
8491000	8498000	You know, the advertising, I guess, might be, I'm not sure how they actually have them listed right now.
8498000	8504000	They don't really have them listed as free, but you can just download the games even though they are free-to-play, but you have in-app purchases or something.
8504000	8509000	They should have, like, a thing that says in-app purchases or something. I think it would be pretty good.
8509000	8514000	If maybe not free or something. Or free with in-app purchases.
8514000	8517000	Why can't they do that? That doesn't seem that hard to say.
8517000	8519000	And this, I think...
8519000	8524000	Well, on the app store on the iPhone, it does say right under the album art, it says,
8524000	8529000	this app may contain in-app purchases or it says this app contains in-app purchases.
8529000	8534000	And you can even see what the top in-app purchases are to get a sense of what's in the app.
8534000	8538000	I know. I think, once again, it's just people not taking responsibility.
8538000	8545000	And a lot of this comes from, you know, the complaints filed against EA for Dungeon Keeper, which, you know, they advertise that as free,
8545000	8549000	but it's definitely, you know, forcing...
8549000	8556000	They're doing whatever they can to persuade you to buy in-app purchases by crippling the game so badly.
8556000	8564000	I don't know. I think that they should maybe have a few more, you know, safeguards in place,
8564000	8568000	but I think they're almost getting to the point where it's all they can really do,
8568000	8573000	and it's time for the users to be responsible for what they're purchasing.
8573000	8581000	And if they're giving their kid their tablet and their kid is running in-app purchases because they forgot to put...
8581000	8587000	They didn't put on parental settings or something like that, then I think it's really their own fault
8587000	8589000	and they should be responsible for those purchases and can't say,
8589000	8596000	oh, I didn't know that my child ran up $2,000 in purchases or something.
8596000	8601000	I don't know. Or maybe, well, they're not going to limit them to how much they can purchase per day,
8601000	8604000	but, you know, maybe that might be a good option or something.
8604000	8606000	By default or something, no.
8606000	8612000	Oh, they'll never do that because they don't want to inhibit you from spending money on their storefronts.
8612000	8619000	Alright, well, going to another story, and I bet this is one that Shane might actually get up and come into the room for.
8619000	8621000	We'll see because it has to do with Power Rangers.
8621000	8623000	What's that?
8623000	8625000	Yes, it's about the Power Rangers.
8625000	8627000	I'm going to screw something up. Just wait.
8627000	8628000	Alright, here's the deal.
8628000	8631000	And this even came up earlier when we were talking about Kickstarter stuff.
8631000	8635000	So Chroma Squad is this game that was on Kickstarter some time ago,
8635000	8639000	and the developer, Behold Games, has put an update on their Kickstarter page
8639000	8647000	saying that there is a royalty share deal being negotiated right now with the Power Rangers owner, Saban,
8647000	8650000	who actually owns the rights to the Power Rangers right now.
8650000	8655000	But here's the thing is that Chroma Squad isn't supposed to be about the Power Rangers.
8655000	8657000	It's about the Sentai.
8657000	8665000	And they actually say in the response that Behold Games wrote it to Joystiq, who is doing an article on this,
8665000	8670000	said, quote, Sentai is a genre that is not a creation of Saban.
8670000	8674000	So if we're negotiating a win-win partnership, we won't change anything in the game,
8674000	8679000	and we'll make it in a way that we can get some advertisement from them and use some direct references of their show.
8679000	8681000	I know some of the players will like it.
8681000	8685000	But it's not a genre. It's actually, it's a franchise.
8685000	8686000	It's owned by Toei.
8686000	8687000	Yeah.
8688000	8690000	So they're wrong again.
8690000	8696000	Well, they still earned $97,000 plus on Kickstarter back in 2013.
8696000	8700000	The early access beta version of the game was up in April for their backers.
8700000	8705000	And, yep, there's still some updates going on on Kickstarter about all that thing.
8705000	8709000	And, by the way, Behold Games has agreed to discuss terms with Saban.
8709000	8712000	They have not actually partnered with them yet.
8712000	8715000	That is not something, like, they're not actually...
8715000	8717000	But Saban doesn't, whatever.
8717000	8719000	It's complicated, right?
8721000	8722000	Stupid.
8723000	8725000	So, did I get everything, Shane?
8726000	8727000	Yeah.
8727000	8728000	Yeah, he said, eh.
8729000	8730000	Are you playing...
8730000	8731000	For the record...
8731000	8732000	Are you playing Chroma Squad?
8732000	8733000	For the record...
8733000	8734000	I can't even hear him.
8734000	8736000	Sentai is a genre.
8736000	8738000	Super Sentai is a copyright owned by...
8739000	8740000	I think it is Toei.
8740000	8741000	Yes.
8742000	8745000	And, for the record, the first Sentai series was Gachamon.
8747000	8749000	Wait, Shane, are you playing Chroma Squad?
8750000	8751000	No, I'm playing Pokemon.
8751000	8753000	He said, no, I'm playing Pokemon.
8753000	8754000	Let's be honest.
8754000	8760000	Okay, Ramus' little thing is tokusatsu, but the Super Sentai is a copyrighted title.
8760000	8764000	But, looking at, seriously, the looking at the pictures, you're like,
8764000	8768000	okay, that's, you know, Power Rangers.
8768000	8773000	I understand that, you know, Sentai is a genre, but it looks like Power Rangers.
8773000	8777000	The other issue is there's a lot of people in this country who don't know better,
8777000	8780000	who look at it and go, oh, it's a Power Rangers game.
8780000	8783000	And, sometimes, that can be very tricky with the law.
8783000	8785000	Uh-oh, Shane came in to talk.
8785000	8787000	He's got something very important to add to this.
8787000	8790000	No, I was just going to say that I don't think Saban had a problem
8790000	8793000	when Mario RPG had to ax some Rangers.
8793000	8796000	That was a rip-off of Sentai stuff.
8796000	8798000	That can be parody at that point.
8798000	8800000	Yeah, and this is parody, too, isn't it?
8800000	8805000	I mean, there's nothing on here that Saban needs to touch and ruin, so.
8806000	8809000	Does Saban like to touch and ruin things?
8809000	8813000	Yes, the last four seasons of Power Rangers have been god-awful.
8814000	8819000	Allegedly, just because I don't want to get sued by him, too.
8819000	8820000	It's true.
8821000	8822000	All right.
8824000	8826000	All right, there you go.
8826000	8828000	The word from Shane himself there.
8828000	8831000	Well, the thing is, though, is they're not going to be able to,
8831000	8833000	I mean, they don't have the money to fight that,
8833000	8836000	so they kind of have to take whatever deal they're going to get.
8838000	8842000	But, yes, they should have really made them not look like Power Rangers,
8842000	8846000	because it seriously looks very close, and it gets down to that,
8846000	8848000	oh, well, it's parody or something like that.
8848000	8853000	But if it fits to the point where just Joe Blow on the street or whatever
8853000	8857000	looks at your product and they think that it's this,
8857000	8860000	even if it's not Power Rangers, but they think it is,
8860000	8866000	then you have a copyright case or, I guess, a trademark case.
8866000	8868000	I don't know what you'd call it.
8868000	8870000	It looks too close to Pokemon.
8870000	8872000	It looks too close to Power Rangers.
8872000	8874000	And nothing like Pokemon.
8874000	8876000	What about NB Rangers and DJ?
8877000	8879000	We can't hear you. We can't hear you at all.
8880000	8882000	What about NB Rangers and DJ Max?
8883000	8885000	They look more like Power Rangers.
8888000	8892000	I feel like that boyshoe here over the guy in Japanese talking,
8892000	8893000	yet it's just the same thing.
8893000	8897000	I'm just repeating it in the mic because Shane is too lazy to get his own translator.
8897000	8899000	Anyway, look, we're moving on to the mailbag,
8899000	8901000	but I want to say some things in the chat room,
8901000	8904000	although I don't know because I don't want to inflate Shane's ego either.
8904000	8907000	But Act F says, see, Shane knows. Shane is the man.
8907000	8910000	And Rama says, thank you, base Shane.
8910000	8912000	And Pop Coffee says, Shane with the real talk.
8912000	8914000	Well, there you go. All right.
8914000	8916000	Well, here's our Power Rangers liaison.
8916000	8919000	Power Rangers and Pokemon liaison here at OLR.
8919000	8921000	And maybe Destiny.
8921000	8923000	Hey, who hit max level in Destiny, Shane?
8923000	8924000	Not me.
8924000	8925000	Not you.
8925000	8926000	I had to go to sleep.
8926000	8928000	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Excuses, excuses.
8928000	8932000	Hey, hey, nobody can hear you, so what you're saying doesn't matter.
8932000	8934000	Let's move on to the mailbag.
8934000	8936000	And what does matter are emailers.
8936000	8939000	When you guys email us every week at participate at orangelawnsradio.com.
8939000	8942000	Again, that's participate at orangelawnsradio.com.
8942000	8946000	You guys participate with our program and send us emails.
8946000	8949000	Witch Dark Sakura dives into this participate mailbag
8949000	8952000	and reads her favorites here on air.
8952000	8955000	Hold on real quick before I got to totally derail everything.
8955000	8956000	God damn it.
8956000	8957000	Because I just had a wonderful thought.
8957000	8958000	Stop the music. Stop the music.
8958000	8961000	No, I was just thinking, you know, because...
8961000	8964000	I don't know why the word genocide made me think of Betty White,
8964000	8967000	but wouldn't it be hilarious if they couldn't get Peter Dinklage
8967000	8970000	to do his lines in Destiny, you know, well enough
8970000	8973000	that they should just get Betty White to do the voice of Ghost?
8973000	8976000	It would probably be better than Peter Dinklage.
8976000	8978000	Shane also said that.
8978000	8981000	Show of hands, who would prefer Betty White to Peter Dinklage?
8981000	8982000	Show of hands.
8982000	8984000	I have no point of comparison.
8984000	8985000	Alright, show of hands.
8985000	8987000	Well, Betty White is always better than anything,
8987000	8989000	so that's the only comparison you need.
8989000	8991000	Back to the mailbag.
8991000	8993000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8993000	8996000	Betty White, if you're out there, email us.
8998000	8999000	First email.
8999000	9002000	And of course we've got two weeks worth of them to go through.
9002000	9004000	So, um...
9004000	9005000	Excuse me.
9005000	9007000	I agree with that depth in our chat room.
9007000	9008000	What the fuck, Loki?
9008000	9010000	I don't know.
9010000	9011000	Alright.
9011000	9013000	Happy Sunday, Orange Lounge.
9013000	9016000	In today's gaming scene, stuff like YouTube and Twitch are thriving.
9016000	9021000	With so many gamers and media nuts upping their video and audio editing skills,
9021000	9024000	what do you think it takes to stand out amongst the crowd
9024000	9026000	and turn this into a career one day?
9026000	9030000	Along with the music I'm making, I do fishing, hunting, and gaming videos,
9030000	9031000	and I could use the advice.
9031000	9033000	Much love, Orange Lounge.
9033000	9034000	EA skeezy.
9034000	9036000	Be entertaining.
9036000	9038000	Passion.
9038000	9039000	Proper spelling.
9039000	9041000	Drive.
9041000	9044000	I think enthusiasm goes a long way.
9044000	9045000	Grammar.
9045000	9049000	And I realize there's a lot of cynicism out there in the gaming community
9049000	9053000	that does very, very well, but I also think that's kind of like a landmine.
9053000	9057000	I think there's a far greater audience that want to listen to people
9057000	9060000	that genuinely love what it is that they're talking about.
9060000	9063000	And I think if you love what you're doing,
9063000	9065000	then that ends up being infectious,
9065000	9068000	and people want to be a part of what it is you're doing.
9068000	9071000	Then again, we might be the wrong people to be asking
9071000	9074000	because we don't make money off of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network,
9074000	9078000	but I can tell you these are the things I like to see in other productions.
9078000	9082000	It does help to have very clean presentation.
9082000	9086000	Because coming from a design standpoint,
9086000	9088000	if you're going to be putting out a visual product,
9088000	9091000	the first thing people are going to see is whatever introduction you have
9091000	9093000	to said product.
9093000	9097000	That's going to be the cover to your book, pretty much.
9097000	9100000	And people do judge a book by its cover.
9100000	9102000	I'm not saying content isn't important.
9102000	9105000	I'm saying you want to have something that well represents the content
9105000	9109000	and gives a person an idea to what they can expect.
9109000	9113000	Don't burn your fucking bridges.
9113000	9116000	Networking is so, so important in this industry.
9116000	9120000	Never burn your bridges and piss somebody off
9120000	9123000	because you never know when that's going to come back to haunt you.
9123000	9126000	I think that is very, very, very important because,
9126000	9128000	and I say this all the time in any podcasting,
9128000	9134000	I have zero tolerance for when a podcast decides to shade another,
9134000	9137000	hardworking any podcast, talk shit about each other on air,
9137000	9139000	just for ratings or whatever it is.
9139000	9141000	I think that's trashy.
9141000	9143000	And nobody wants to hear that.
9143000	9145000	And it just makes everybody involved look stupid.
9145000	9147000	And I want to be known.
9147000	9149000	I don't know if anybody out there talks natively about OLR.
9149000	9151000	I don't think so anymore.
9151000	9153000	But if that's happening, I don't want to be.
9153000	9155000	We've had them all eliminated.
9155000	9157000	Well, we've outlived them all.
9157000	9159000	Longest running. Hey.
9159000	9162000	What if I piss the bridge and burn somebody?
9162000	9165000	But I'm just saying, don't ever burn the bridges
9165000	9167000	because that will come back to get you.
9167000	9168000	Like I'm telling you.
9168000	9170000	You're going to have to learn to swim.
9170000	9172000	From what I just told you, the whole don't shade other people,
9172000	9175000	there's people on my little black list I've got.
9175000	9177000	And yes, I have one.
9177000	9180000	And I've never told you who's on it because, again, I'm not in that business.
9180000	9184000	But these are people who were talking negatively about our show
9184000	9186000	or on a forum or something else.
9186000	9189000	We're saying things that I don't think were very cool.
9189000	9191000	And I will never work with those people.
9191000	9193000	They're all gone by now because they couldn't make it.
9193000	9194000	I wonder why.
9194000	9197000	But these shows I would never work with ever.
9197000	9200000	Yeah, I wonder where those guys on Digg are now.
9200000	9203000	The ones that were trolling you some time ago?
9203000	9204000	Whatever.
9204000	9206000	On Reddit, I guess.
9206000	9208000	No, it was Digg.
9208000	9210000	No, no. That's the joke. Where are they now?
9210000	9211000	On Reddit.
9211000	9213000	And they're probably on Fortran.
9213000	9214000	Maybe.
9214000	9216000	They're on slash B.
9216000	9218000	So, anyway.
9218000	9220000	There you go. That was my long-winded answer to the question
9220000	9222000	that I hope was what you were looking for.
9224000	9227000	I do think that good design goes a long way.
9229000	9232000	This one, this is kind of a long one. This is from the 10th.
9232000	9233000	So, it was before.
9233000	9234000	Okay.
9234000	9235000	All right.
9235000	9236000	Hey, OLR Crew, AZHP here.
9236000	9238000	I've been behind on the podcast lately.
9238000	9240000	That's okay because we've been behind doing them.
9240000	9243000	But you guys talked about a topic a few weeks ago that's been on my mind.
9243000	9247000	Universities offering scholarships for people who are talented at League of Legends.
9247000	9252000	You guys mainly talked about it from the standpoint of our video games support.
9252000	9254000	I wanted to cover it from a different angle.
9254000	9256000	The school's angle.
9256000	9258000	If you're a school trying to recruit talent,
9258000	9261000	you want to provide scholarships that attract talented people.
9261000	9264000	High school kids nowadays are playing League because it costs nothing
9264000	9266000	and they're super invested in it.
9266000	9270000	You're going to attract more attention if you're catering to their interests.
9270000	9274000	The school gets eyes on its people who are the right age to be applying for their gaming.
9276000	9278000	Hold on. I lost my place.
9280000	9282000	Who are the right age to be applying to their schools.
9282000	9288000	If you're offering a scholarship to something as ubiquitous in the gaming world as League,
9288000	9290000	it's going to get competitive.
9290000	9293000	You're going to get applicants who are prodigies at the game.
9293000	9297000	People who are extremely talented and not just from a pure Twitch gaming perspective,
9297000	9302000	but also are proven to have great tactical thinking and work well with others.
9302000	9305000	These are great qualities that schools look for.
9305000	9307000	And if the programs become very successful,
9307000	9310000	the school's League ends up competing in international and big tournaments.
9310000	9313000	And that's promotion for the school every single time.
9313000	9316000	I can think of tons of people who would love to go to a school that has a talented team,
9316000	9318000	a League team playing at it.
9318000	9321000	In short, from the school's perspective,
9321000	9325000	getting with the times and offering scholarships to people who play a majorly popular game
9325000	9328000	is extremely forward-thinking and proactive.
9328000	9330000	I think that if they play their cards right,
9330000	9334000	it will end up making their school much more palatable to the next generation of kids
9334000	9336000	applying to college and in the next few years.
9336000	9340000	Of course, this hinges on Riot maintaining the popularity of League,
9340000	9344000	but if all things remain on the same trajectory over the next few years,
9344000	9346000	League is just going to get bigger and bigger.
9346000	9348000	Sorry for the long email, but I wanted to provide another perspective
9348000	9351000	that seems to have gone unaddressed in your guys' discussion.
9351000	9353000	Keep up the great work, AZHP.
9353000	9357000	I think that was a very well-thought-out email with some very good points.
9357000	9359000	And it was well-written. It was spelled right.
9359000	9361000	As AZHP tends to do.
9361000	9364000	So, another one for his gold file.
9364000	9366000	I really have nothing to say in response to that.
9366000	9368000	I think those are all very good points.
9371000	9375000	Again, it's been a couple weeks, so I can't remember exactly what we were saying about it on the show.
9375000	9377000	It was about the...
9377000	9379000	I know we were talking about the whole sport and all that.
9379000	9382000	You know, is it really sport? And that's kind of the direction we went in with it.
9382000	9383000	But I think he does make a good point.
9383000	9385000	I get sweaty playing League.
9385000	9389000	I think he does make a good point that it's just like, you know, kids today think League is cool
9389000	9391000	and might want to go to a school with that.
9391000	9396000	And, you know, people that are good at League are probably going to, you know,
9396000	9401000	again, making some generalizations, but probably going to excel in these particular areas.
9401000	9404000	Actually, SSJ100, Matt has a good comment.
9404000	9405000	Sure.
9405000	9408000	My problem with this is my problem with college sports in general.
9408000	9412000	These kids will bring in a lot of money for their school, but none of that will trickle down to the students
9412000	9416000	who have to pay for a lot in terms of room, board, and living expenses.
9418000	9420000	So, basically, they're bringing them in as revenue generators.
9420000	9421000	Right.
9422000	9423000	All right.
9423000	9425000	Well, very good response email.
9425000	9427000	All right. Last email.
9427000	9428000	Yep.
9428000	9432000	It says Jell-O, and then this subject was a typo on my iPhone. I refuse to correct it.
9432000	9433000	Okay.
9433000	9434000	Fair enough.
9434000	9436000	I thought it was about Jell-O, and Jell-O is pretty fucking good.
9436000	9438000	There's always room for Jell-O.
9438000	9440000	Especially with whipped cream.
9440000	9446000	Hey, OLR crew. Just listened to episode 559 and super excited that you guys are making it out to DragonCon.
9446000	9448000	I'm going to be traveling down from New York City.
9448000	9451000	I grew up in Alabama. Shout out to DS. Woohoo!
9451000	9453000	So, it's just like going back home.
9453000	9459000	Sadly, it is just, unless DarkSakuraLoki pulls something out last minute, it is just me going.
9459000	9462000	It's not the whole OLR's crew, but a lot of diverse-
9462000	9464000	I'm probably going to Disneyland instead.
9464000	9468000	A lot of diverse people at VoG are going to be there, so excited to meet you.
9468000	9470000	Two questions first.
9470000	9477000	When you guys go to conventions, especially multi-fandom, multi-genre conventions, what do you make and aim to spend the most time on?
9477000	9482000	Panels, game room, dealer's room, parties, or exploring something unfamiliar.
9482000	9490000	I haven't been to a real convention in several years, and now that I'm an adult and I'm needing to take time before I can interrupt my life for a week to do this,
9490000	9495000	it makes me think cons are vacations for nerds, so I'm looking forward to the party fun and mostly stress-free weekend.
9495000	9502000	I will tell you one thing. Any con you go to is scheduled an entire day after your travel to sleep.
9502000	9504000	Yes. I do that with DragonCon.
9504000	9510000	And so, I say look at the schedule, plot your time wisely.
9511000	9521000	I'd say that if you plan on going to the same convention for multiple years, do like some of the big events over different years.
9521000	9530000	I don't go to masquerades anymore. While I want to support the cosplay community, after Anime Expo, I don't go to masquerades at big cons anymore. I just don't do it.
9530000	9536000	I like the way that Bobby and his friends did it at DragonCon, where they watched the masquerade on the TV, because DragonCon's big enough.
9536000	9538000	Yeah, AX started doing that.
9538000	9544000	And then everybody just orders the pizza and just watches it on the TV. I thought that was a really cool way of doing it.
9544000	9552000	So you kind of have that private viewing with the convention people, but you don't have to fight the crowds to get in the real room and all that stuff.
9552000	9559000	As far as what I like to do most at the convention, I like to do the parties honestly. I'm not going to lie, that's my favorite thing. I like the parties.
9559000	9563000	I almost hate the parties.
9563000	9565000	Well, you and I are different in that regard though.
9565000	9567000	I like ghosting parties.
9567000	9568000	What's that?
9568000	9577000	Meaning you find out what parties all of your friends are having, and then you go get free drinks at each party, hang out with your friends until you get completely sick of how loud it is.
9577000	9582000	Then you have quiet time in the elevator going to the next floor to the next party, and then you ghost that one too.
9582000	9591000	And not really bringing free drinks. What I like to do is I would have the medium-sized bottles of liquor and make my contribution to little parties.
9591000	9592000	That works.
9592000	9602000	But for the most time, the biggest thing that we did, our parties just consisted of finding some way to hook up a Super Nintendo to the TV and playing Super Mario World all night.
9602000	9608000	That was the one stupid thing I didn't do at GamerX was bring my own gaming console to hook up to the TV to invite people to the room.
9608000	9614000	You guys were hardly in there at all. Every time I went back up there to get my quiet time, you guys just weren't there.
9614000	9620000	Well, that's good because you want a quiet time. And you know me, I would have been like, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
9620000	9627000	Basically all of my times up there were take off the shoes, let the feet rest, switch into costume.
9627000	9637000	I would say to this emailer, not to drag this out too much longer, but just plan on the panels you want to do and decide is this a must-see or a would-like-to-see.
9637000	9642000	So for example, you're going to put the VOG Network panel on Monday on your must-see list.
9642000	9645000	That way you make sure and come to the thing at all costs.
9645000	9651000	But then on your kind of want-to-see list is that, okay, if I miss these, I'm not going to be upset about it.
9651000	9654000	But at the same time, if I'm not really doing anything, I'm going to try to make these panels.
9654000	9658000	But with DragonCon, you have to line up for a lot of them like way in advance.
9658000	9662000	Not ours, certainly, but a lot of the big ones with stars, you're going to have to line up way in advance.
9662000	9670000	Also, if there are any particular movie showings or anything going on, big events, if they don't interest you, use that as your dealer's time room.
9670000	9673000	Have fun, and if you're not having fun, change what you're doing.
9673000	9677000	Also, if you're cosplaying things with big wings, don't wear them into the dealer's room.
9677000	9679000	I learned that the hard way.
9679000	9680000	Fair enough.
9680000	9684000	I thought, I'll go in the dealer's room. Good photo ops. No.
9684000	9689000	Because they actually had a photo section on the corner of the dealer's room that year at AX.
9689000	9691000	And I was like, I'll just go in there and do that. No.
9691000	9693000	Because you still have to navigate through the crowd together.
9693000	9696000	Okay, oh, there's one more. Okay.
9696000	9702000	And lastly, dark soccer, this is for me. I have one cosplay already, but I feel like I need another.
9702000	9707000	Who should I cosplay? I can't decide. No homestuck, please. I'd only want to do a troll and a thank you to body paint.
9707000	9713000	Well, I was going to say, if you were going to do homestuck, I think that, and this is from Duchok.
9713000	9722000	I would say anyone who cosplays Dave Strider with the turntables gets cool points in my book.
9722000	9725000	I'm just saying, that would be the homestuck I'd like to see.
9726000	9729000	I don't really know what you're into.
9729000	9734000	Yeah, I have no idea what you look like. Not that, I mean, you can certainly cosplay anything you want.
9734000	9738000	Different gender, different whatever. But sometimes that's a good place to start.
9738000	9744000	Like, I probably am going to do Joker for Dragon Con because you know what, with a red beard I kind of look like him.
9744000	9749000	So that's a good place for me to start. So that might be a good place for you to start.
9749000	9753000	But yeah, I think it really depends on what you're into. What are you into? What do you love?
9753000	9759000	Yeah, I mean, the whole reason I picked a homestuck cosplay is because I needed something quick and easy.
9759000	9764000	I didn't have time to plan. And so, the Jane costume was quick and easy.
9764000	9768000	I mean, the prop took me weeks to make, but other than that, you know.
9770000	9778000	And I just want to make crystal clear that I'm saying that do what you love and it doesn't matter if you do or don't look like them.
9779000	9784000	I'm only saying if you have no idea where to begin, that could be a starting place for you.
9784000	9791000	But I will tell you what I do. The first thing that I do is I decide if this is something I'm going to make from scratch or if it's something I'm going to thrift.
9791000	9802000	Because most of the time my thrift costumes are my, you know, wear throughout the day and then I save my better ones for, you know, actual gatherings and photo op times.
9802000	9810000	But, like, my King of Fighters Leona costume was part from a thrift store and part from an Army-Navy store.
9810000	9817000	Where we just modified an already existing double-breasted jacket into the top for my Leona costume.
9817000	9821000	And then used all the leftover straps for the rest of the material.
9821000	9832000	If you are going to wear an outfit that requires combat boots, make sure they fit you before you wear them.
9832000	9840000	Make sure they're not molded to somebody else's freakin' feet. Mold them to your damn feet. It takes a month.
9840000	9849000	I made that mistake and I played DDR in my Jill costume. I had, you wouldn't believe, oh my God, my feet were a nightmare.
9850000	9855000	And by the way, that comes from, I think I said it came from Duchac.
9855000	9870000	But the other thing, too, that I would like to say is that if you're going to, the other thing that I do with my costumes is that I find, first of all, as many references from whatever it is I'm doing it from.
9870000	9877000	And easy if you're doing it from a 3D video game that you have fly cam controls in, like in Mass Effect, easy.
9878000	9885000	If it's a game you can also rip the textures from, do that, because then you can get a really good idea for the patterns of the material.
9885000	9891000	And then find other cosplayers. Learn from other people. See what they've done. Look for patterns.
9891000	9899000	Tumblr will almost always have cosplay tutorials up. And then plot your time wisely. That's the big thing.
9899000	9900000	Alright.
9900000	9903000	And if Ron has got anything else to add, let me know.
9903000	9906000	Big response to that email. Any other emails? I thought you said one more.
9906000	9909000	No, I said the one more was that lost a little bit to the email.
9909000	9914000	Well, then there you go. Well, you should send us more emails. Participate at orangelandrada.com is the place to send us emails.
9914000	9916000	Learn to sew.
9916000	9919000	And I'll meet you, like any good drag queen would do.
9919000	9922000	I need to, I need to, I would need a sewing machine.
9922000	9931000	Alright. I believe now we are going to get into the FUs of the week. In fact, I don't believe it. I know it. We're going to get into the FUs of the week right now.
9936000	9952000	I have to actually add what Rama just posted in chat. Cosplayblogwiththebrain.wordpress.com.
9953000	9966000	Okay. So, um, FU to just how intensely tired I've been and how hard it's been to go back to, um, my, uh, uh, sort of paleo-y regimen.
9966000	9972000	Because work has metallopurkeys. I love metallopurkeys.
9972000	9979000	Um, so I'm really, this week I got to buckle down and I'm going to go through, uh, what's called the carb flu.
9979000	9989000	The first thing that happens after cheating at all is that when you go back to just eating regularly, you just start getting tired and tired and tired.
9989000	9995000	And I know that's part of what's happening to me. So, just, ugh.
9995000	9997000	I accidentally whipped the mic.
9997000	9998000	Yuck.
9998000	10000000	Yucko.
10000000	10002000	Uh, Loki.
10002000	10011000	Um, all I can say is also FU to being tired and then, um, FU to texturing because god dammit it's fucking hard.
10011000	10019000	Trying to make like texture map that, or texture atlas that works with a bunch of stuff and just trying to lay out how the hell that's going to be done.
10019000	10028000	And, I mean, I designed my primitive models in a certain way that I didn't want to texture anything.
10028000	10035000	And then here I am now with texturing stuff. So it's just because I changed everything and it's taking so long.
10035000	10042000	But I just have to figure out a way to texture stuff. It's just difficult.
10042000	10047000	I may just put something together temporarily and just keep moving on. I really think that's probably what I should do.
10047000	10050000	That's it.
10050000	10062000	Alright, um, my FU of the week goes to the fact, speaking of drag queens and all that, my FU of the week goes to the fact that Bianca Del Rio is here in Sacramento tonight.
10062000	10067000	And I'm here with you lovely people. Don't get me wrong. I love you guys and doing the show and everything.
10067000	10070000	But god dammit I'm missing drag queens to be here.
10070000	10076000	Not just any drag queens. Bianca Del Rio people. Winner of Rudolph's Drag Race Season 6.
10076000	10078000	Alright, anyhow.
10079000	10082000	Let's move on. Because I do love you guys. We've got some more gaming news for you.
10082000	10086000	And then your turn to call into the show. 1877 Game O.L.R.
10086000	10091000	Or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. But first, a couple more stories.
10091000	10101000	In a world where PC games are not the only things to receive day one patches. In fact, more often than not, console games receive day one patches.
10101000	10108000	And all sorts of bug fixes from launch. And even sometimes it's still broken way after launch.
10108000	10114000	But you know what they want to bring to consoles instead that is on PC? Early access.
10114000	10121000	That's right. Games that are not yet done that are in a beta or alpha state that you would purchase.
10121000	10126000	And you would receive updates as they finish the game to help the development of said titles.
10126000	10134000	Now yes, I understand that they do this on Steam with indie games. And you know what? I'm kind of cool with that for most cases.
10134000	10141000	Some people kind of abuse that and now of course there's the stuff in place where gaming may never be finished.
10142000	10152000	So they're trying to do that both on the Playstation 4 according to Adam Boyz.
10152000	10166000	And basically saying, you know, we're figuring... That's one massive conversation we're having internally at what point does a game meet standards of release?
10166000	10173000	We're still at some point... We still at some point ensure that we're being mindful to the consumer.
10173000	10179000	We don't want somebody to stumble across a title and expect a full product that have a negative effect.
10179000	10185000	We're figuring out what's okay. We obviously have tech requirements, checklists that people have to adhere to.
10185000	10191000	So we're internally discussing what does that list look like and where the caveat is stuff like this.
10191000	10202000	So it's still a project with lots of minds are considering. No details yet, but perhaps something in the future.
10202000	10209000	And then of course, you know, Microsoft are thinking the same thing.
10209000	10217000	Of course, I guess the director of the ID at Xbox program, Chris Charla, is basically saying,
10217000	10222000	you know, it's something developers have been asking for and we are listening really closely to developers.
10222000	10227000	There's lots of heavy deep thinkers, experts, PhDs working on whatever.
10227000	10235000	Basically, they know it's a way that they can make some money. So they're going to be possibly thinking about having these available.
10235000	10241000	I worry because especially when companies like EA said, hey, you know what, we should put out games in early access.
10242000	10248000	OK, your games are already fucking early access based on some of the problems that people have been having with networking.
10248000	10258000	And just I don't know, I I'm worried that it's going to be abused because as it is, yes, it's already kind of abused.
10258000	10266000	And now it's just kind of giving, you know, like EA and out or something like, oh, it's beta or like, hey, you want to get in that beta for destiny?
10266000	10275000	I mean, guess what? You can pay for the beta access, you know, the early access. It's going to cost you $60 and it gets upgraded later on or something like that.
10275000	10282000	What's next? Are you going to kickstart that shit? Are you going to fucking have crowdfunding to get, you know, pre-orders in the game?
10282000	10285000	You pay, you know, $10 and you get this and whatever.
10285000	10293000	Well, didn't they have that with Ni No Kuni? I remember something like that. They had done a little, I mean, I didn't take it too seriously, but they had something like that.
10293000	10294000	Yeah.
10294000	10299000	But then Nintendo had the Wario or game and Wario fart starter, whatever it was.
10299000	10305000	That was social media sharing. Like that wasn't really it, but it was, it was funny to see that whole like tongue in cheekiness of it.
10305000	10310000	Butt in cheek.
10310000	10311000	All right.
10311000	10316000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vogniteware.com says, I won't support this. It's already being abused on Steam.
10317000	10322000	It is a very slippery slope. Like indie developers who need a little extra push on their first game. Yes.
10322000	10324000	EA, not so much.
10324000	10333000	I think there's a lot of indie developers out there that are just like, let's see what kind of, what I can scramble together real quick and then put it on there and get some money.
10333000	10344000	And maybe they legitimately want to make a good game, but I think there's a lot of people out there that are legitimately just doing it very quickly so that they can get some money and they're never going to touch it again.
10345000	10358000	Well, what an interesting little tie in as we move into our last story tonight about EA and Maxis and The Sims 4, which I'm sure you can just imagine the money that is set to be made by EA with this game.
10358000	10363000	The Sims 4 in a new trailer, it was a 20 minute gameplay walkthrough that they had posted.
10363000	10373000	There was an image, one little frame got caught that said in the screen cap, quote, The Sims 4 Premium, save on new packs with early access and exclusive items.
10373000	10382000	Become a premium member to get early access to three new packs with exclusive items. Your Sims can throw a spooky costume party, camp in the great outdoors, and toast to the new year in style.
10382000	10388000	I'm surprised they didn't know about this. They have a premium edition of Sims. I mean, what do you think that is?
10388000	10390000	All the sale information is on site anyway.
10391000	10401000	And it's not new for EA either because Battlefield had premium memberships and so on. Is anyone really surprised by this information? Anyone?
10401000	10409000	I'll be more surprised if the game works day one. Sorry about it, but that's where I'm at with, you know, after the whole SimCity debacle and that whole mess.
10409000	10411000	Well, at least this one is offline.
10413000	10414000	So that's good.
10414000	10420000	But I do like how the premium edition is not a season pass. You don't get free content. I mean, you get some content, but it's discounts.
10420000	10433000	Because as someone pointed out, you know, regarding The Sims 3, hey, if you pay $19.99 for the base Sims 3, it's going to cost you almost the same price as an Xbox One to get all the content in the game.
10433000	10441000	Dar Sakura, any interest for Sims 4 over there? Because I know you used to play The Sims like pretty hardcore, at least more than anyone else I knew.
10441000	10447000	Yeah. I mean, I've been thinking about buying the premium, honestly. Just because I...
10447000	10449000	So this news doesn't phase you. You're like, alright, par for the course.
10449000	10454000	But even like with the stuff that they took out, like there's no swimming pools or babies anymore. I mean...
10454000	10460000	I'm thinking about it. Either that or I'm just going to go just reinstall all The Sims 2 stuff and put a high res mod on it.
10460000	10470000	Well, funny that you should mention Sims 2, because there is an expansion, a new little upgrade that they just did to Sims 2 to basically say goodbye.
10470000	10480000	Origin registered owners of Sims 2 will get a free copy of the most up-to-date version, The Ultimate Collection, before the support ends on July 22nd.
10480000	10488000	It includes all the expansions. I guess players are able to transfer their save files from whatever it is they have into this game.
10488000	10496000	So anyone who purchased or registered a digital copy of The Sims 2 on Origin will automatically receive The Ultimate Collection. So that's kind of neat.
10496000	10502000	So then I could actually just go buy it on Origin and get every damn thing.
10502000	10504000	They don't sell it on Origin.
10504000	10507000	Or I could just buy... find one of my old copies.
10507000	10512000	You have to find your old copy and you have to actually call it in to register, because there's no way to register it through Origin.
10512000	10513000	There's no keys or anything?
10513000	10514000	No.
10514000	10517000	I'll just get it for free later. I mean, I'll just get it eventually.
10517000	10518000	So now...
10518000	10519000	I know, I know. I don't really care.
10519000	10521000	Just wait for another Humble Bundle that EA puts out.
10521000	10525000	I don't want to have to run it through fucking Origin anyway, so whatever.
10525000	10529000	Origin isn't as awful as it was a couple years ago.
10529000	10533000	I still don't want to run it through Origin anyway, because I run like a...
10533000	10537000	Sims 3, thankfully, didn't have to go through Origin for a lot of its stuff.
10537000	10540000	And I could run my mods, except Sims 3 kind of ran like crap.
10540000	10543000	See, that's what's holding me back, actually, about Sims 4.
10543000	10549000	The fact that Sims 3 ran so unbelievably horribly, that...
10549000	10553000	Sims 4 is probably not... and Sims 4 is going to require Origin, I'm sure.
10553000	10554000	So...
10554000	10557000	Which is interesting, because it's offline, but not really.
10557000	10558000	So...
10558000	10559000	Alright.
10559000	10563000	We've got to connect online to purchase all those fucking packs now, don't you?
10564000	10566000	Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line.
10566000	10570000	1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, the Skype...
10570000	10571000	L1 word.
10571000	10573000	The Skype line is now open for your calls.
10573000	10578000	You can talk to us on any topic that we've covered tonight, or maybe something that we missed.
10578000	10581000	Anything from last week, even, would be fine as well.
10581000	10585000	Which I totally realize that I neglected to in the opening, because we went so long,
10585000	10587000	I never did a last week's music set to Holic...
10587000	10590000	Or, excuse me, last week's news set to Holic, so I apologize for the oversight.
10590000	10594000	But, yeah, we're running too long, so sorry about that.
10594000	10597000	Sorry to the fans that were waiting for that segment.
10597000	10600000	But, you know, we have to talk more about GamerX and other stuff anyway.
10600000	10602000	We do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
10602000	10604000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10604000	10607000	The one and only Rama. You know what to do with the fastest internet in the chat room.
10607000	10610000	Hey, Rama, you're coming through really quiet for some reason.
10610000	10613000	Is your mic in its usual place?
10613000	10615000	Hold on one second...
10615000	10617000	There you go. You're already better.
10617000	10621000	I had to turn up the mixer for a little bit.
10621000	10623000	You're much better. What's on your mind, buddy?
10623000	10626000	I just want to kind of break down the whole Tokusai thing real quick,
10626000	10629000	so everyone have a brief explanation of what it is.
10629000	10630000	Please.
10630000	10635000	Sure. I mean, Tokusai is a genre. It's live-action special effects.
10635000	10643000	Under that is the Super Sentai series, Ultraman, Godzilla, all that type of stuff.
10643000	10646000	Gotcha?
10646000	10651000	Yeah. And, you know, from that article, I think those guys at Crozna,
10651000	10657000	they could get away with it, provided that they say this is the series
10657000	10661000	and it has no direct correlation to what Saban is doing.
10661000	10664000	I mean, it'll be similar, but there's no direct correlation,
10664000	10667000	as in the American changes and stuff like that,
10667000	10672000	because they have gotten away with stuff like this in the comic books and, you know.
10672000	10677000	Do you think that Saban, should they go down this path of taking legal action against the game?
10677000	10679000	You know, that's a big if, but should they?
10679000	10684000	Do you think they might try to attack, though, saying that the average user,
10684000	10689000	let's be real, the average computer game player probably doesn't follow this stuff as closely as you do,
10689000	10694000	but the average user would think it's Power Rangers?
10694000	10697000	Pretty much, because to be perfectly honest,
10697000	10702000	if you were to get about ten Power Ranger fans in a room,
10702000	10706000	maybe one or two of them would know what the original Japanese series is.
10706000	10708000	Good point.
10708000	10712000	You know, there's like a Power Morphicon or something's happening here in, what, August?
10712000	10714000	Because Shane kept telling me he wanted to go,
10714000	10716000	but that's something that's happening in SoCal in August,
10716000	10719000	and I wonder if this is going to be a part of the conversation there a little bit,
10719000	10721000	show up in a panel or something.
10721000	10727000	Possibly because Power Morphicon, it's a celebration of the original Japanese Super Sentai series
10727000	10733000	and other series like Masked Rider, Ultraman, and the American series just Power Rangers,
10733000	10737000	Masked Rider, Kamen Rider, Beetleborgs, all that cool stuff.
10737000	10741000	Yeah, like the actors from different series and stuff.
10741000	10744000	You know, I don't really watch the Power Rangers especially as much as Shane does,
10744000	10748000	but he forced me pretty much at gunpoint to watch one of the episodes from Japan
10748000	10752000	with the Train Rangers or whatever they are, and that was actually pretty cute.
10752000	10757000	Yeah, I mean, honestly, if you watch the American series,
10757000	10761000	you'll eventually will find your way to the original Japanese.
10761000	10764000	Just watch Mega Ranger, that's all you need.
10764000	10768000	Yeah, Jamie makes a valid point, because not for nothing,
10768000	10773000	and I'll swear on a stack of Holy Bibles before you go up in flames,
10774000	10780000	99% of the Sailor Moon fandom started out on the dubbed series,
10780000	10782000	before they found the original Japanese.
10782000	10790000	Or there was a magazine called An America that had a full spread about Sailor Moon
10790000	10795000	while they were still in negotiations, and some of us found our way to fan subs. Just saying.
10795000	10800000	Yeah, but when Rama talks about the 99%, you are probably in the 1%, just saying.
10800000	10804000	You are the 1% Dark Sakura of anime fandom.
10804000	10806000	Whatever.
10808000	10812000	I just wanted a chance to say that to Dark Sakura and call her the 1%.
10812000	10816000	Alright, anyway, Rama, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
10816000	10822000	Can I just quickly plug the GoFundMe with the banner that's rotating on the vlog network real quick?
10822000	10824000	Yes, of course you may.
10824000	10828000	Okay, in case you haven't heard, one of our staff members, Avalon Cosplay,
10828000	10832000	when she was coming back from a convention, she found out her house burnt down.
10832000	10838000	Fortunately, insurance is covering everything, but as of right now, they're just trying to make ends meet
10838000	10843000	with a new place to stay, food, work, all that stuff, until the house is built.
10843000	10848000	If you go to animejamsession.com, there is a banner, there's a button on the site
10848000	10853000	with information and where you can go to donate, and there is also a rotating banner on vlognetwork.com.
10853000	10857000	Excellent, and yes, if you are listening live right now, you can see that banner right at the top of the screen,
10857000	10861000	live.vognetwork.com, a great thing you guys are doing.
10861000	10868000	Those are the types of ads I like, ads to help people out during times of crisis, so best of luck to that.
10868000	10874000	Before I let you go, on a lighter note, Rama, while I have you on the line, I have to ask you this,
10874000	10878000	and I know I could go listen to Anime Jam Session for even more in-depth discussion,
10878000	10884000	Rama, I just need to, in like one sentence here, I'm just going to put this word out there,
10884000	10888000	and I just want to hear your thoughts, I'm going to put that word on the table and walk away.
10888000	10889000	Dashcon.
10897000	10898000	I need a moment.
10900000	10901000	Okay.
10901000	10904000	Did you just take a hit? Was that what that was?
10904000	10906000	No, well, that too.
10907000	10909000	Or were you inflating a ball pit?
10911000	10914000	Do I have to bring another ball pit to the chat room?
10915000	10916000	Perhaps.
10916000	10922000	Now, I feel like it's mandatory that every convention from here on out has a ball pit.
10924000	10929000	The con I'm staffing, we already said it, ball pit confirmed for DerpyCon.
10929000	10933000	There you go, there you go. Alright, but seriously though, Dashcon.
10937000	10942000	There isn't a word that can describe this because it went mainstream.
10942000	10948000	This was in papers, it went beyond mainstream.
10948000	10951000	It got very real. It got real. Balls got real, yo.
10951000	10952000	Denny's.
10952000	10958000	Yeah, with Denny's is fucking making a reference to like, what did they say on their Twitter?
10958000	10960000	Oh, well, yeah.
10960000	10964000	Sorry your food took so long, you can have an extra hour in the ball pit.
10964000	10965000	One of my favorite-
10965000	10968000	I swear to God, Denny's is so fucking funny on social media.
10968000	10975000	One of my favorite actors, Ostrick Chow, he even took a picture of himself in a ball pit and said that he got an extra hour.
10975000	10977000	Amazing. Amazing.
10977000	10983000	Alright, Fifth Dream says, Sky, Sky, Sky, let's have a ball pit at Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival.
10983000	10988000	Okay, look, gay orgy is not the ball pit you're thinking of that we're talking about here.
10988000	10989000	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
10989000	10990000	Alright.
10990000	10992000	Okay, this was on Denny's Twitter.
10993000	10997000	Welcome to DenCon. On your birthday, you get an extra hour in the pit.
11000000	11003000	Once again, horrific food, but hilarious sentiment.
11003000	11007000	I almost want to eat at Denny's just to support their social media team.
11007000	11010000	Alright, Rahm, I gotta let you go to try and get another call, but take care.
11010000	11012000	No problem, you take care, bro.
11012000	11013000	Alright, bye.
11013000	11017000	Sorry to let Rahm go early, but he will get an extra hour in the ball pit for his troubles.
11017000	11023000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
11023000	11024000	Give us a call.
11024000	11027000	Did they also have a bouncy house?
11027000	11029000	Yes, there was a bouncy house.
11029000	11033000	There's like a deflated bouncy house in there for adults.
11033000	11034000	It's pretty amazing.
11034000	11037000	Well, what would have been the average age at DashCon?
11037000	11039000	I think 17, probably.
11039000	11040000	I don't know.
11040000	11042000	I don't know why I'm looking at you, Loki.
11042000	11044000	Like, you'd know the answer of all things DashCon.
11044000	11048000	Well, I just saw the picture of the ball pit, that's about it.
11048000	11053000	I saw, being that I am a Tumblr user, I mean, I see a lot of dumb shit on Tumblr.
11053000	11057000	But I see a lot of really funny GIFs sometimes, and I see a lot of really hot things, too.
11057000	11063000	But I also see lots of reports on DashCon and that sort of thing, and it's just been...
11063000	11068000	It made me appreciate GamerX, too, that much more.
11068000	11073000	Because GamerX, especially for the first year they ran, they were a very well-run con for the first year.
11073000	11075000	And a very well-run con in their second year.
11075000	11078000	And so it just kind of goes to show you that, wow, it could have been a lot worse.
11078000	11080000	Wow.
11080000	11081000	All right.
11081000	11086000	I'm going to go to Twitter real quick, because I did see some tweets come in.
11086000	11089000	Dartatouille had sent us a tweet saying, just two quick things.
11089000	11093000	One, will there be more Mortal Kombat 8 tournaments a la Cross Zones in the future?
11093000	11096000	Yes, that is something we have wanted to do.
11096000	11102000	I would think that the time that Nintendo inevitably puts out DLC, we'll want to get on that pretty fast.
11102000	11105000	But I can't see why there wouldn't be a tournament before then.
11105000	11108000	I'm sure in the next month or two we'll do another tournament.
11108000	11113000	Just, we were all busy with the whole going to the con and preparing for our panel and all that stuff,
11113000	11115000	which hopefully you guys will get to see the panel, too.
11115000	11120000	Tigerclaw tweets us saying that Akiva Goldsman is producing the Space Invaders movie.
11120000	11122000	I forgot that that was a thing.
11122000	11125000	They are making a Space Invaders movie.
11125000	11126000	Why?
11126000	11128000	Because they made a Battleship movie.
11128000	11129000	Why not?
11129000	11130000	Yeah, that was so...
11130000	11132000	One last call for calls.
11132000	11136000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11136000	11141000	Akdeft tweets us saying, here's a really great video game music bundle and you can pay what you want
11141000	11143000	and for a good cause, too.
11143000	11149000	And it's groupies.com, G-R-O-U-P-E-E-S dot com slash GMG.
11149000	11153000	And I'm trying to look at this link real quick here, but I'm trying to do it on my phone
11153000	11155000	to see of what it is you get.
11155000	11159000	Oh, you get the Rogue Legacy soundtrack and Kernel 2
11159000	11163000	and the Banner Saga by Austin Wintory, Hotline Miami.
11163000	11165000	Oh, that's a really good soundtrack.
11165000	11167000	That's very cool. I like that.
11167000	11170000	So for a minimum of a dollar, you get all those soundtracks
11170000	11175000	and once they reach $2500 in sales, they're going to do another...
11175000	11179000	VidBoy and Lifeform do a collaboration for the bundle.
11179000	11180000	That's kind of neat, actually.
11180000	11183000	I like that idea that they get all the...
11183000	11187000	It's like a Kickstarter, but with actual product you're just getting right out the gate.
11187000	11190000	Groupies is kind of neat because sometimes they'll do different things.
11190000	11193000	There's one I did that had...
11193000	11198000	There was games in there and soundtracks and all sorts of random stuff.
11198000	11201000	It's usually a mix of things.
11201000	11204000	That's really neat. I like that.
11204000	11206000	Thank you for the FYI on that.
11206000	11209000	Tigerclaw says there's a Ouija board movie coming out, but they already did one.
11209000	11210000	It was called The Exorcist.
11210000	11212000	Wasn't there a Witch Board?
11212000	11214000	Yeah, there was a Witch Board.
11214000	11218000	I saw the trailer for the Ouija board movie and it looks very generic.
11218000	11226000	Yeah, I guess just to cash in on all the board game movie craze and scary movies and all that.
11226000	11230000	Alright, well, our phone isn't lighting up.
11230000	11234000	I guess that means no one else wants to call in, but that's okay because we're 20 past 9 o'clock.
11234000	11237000	I knew the show would run a little long tonight since we had to catch up for a week.
11237000	11240000	If you have more things you want to say after the fact, Twitter.
11241000	11243000	You can also send us an email at any time.
11243000	11246000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to do that.
11246000	11250000	Thank you guys for showing up tonight.
11250000	11252000	Thank you guys for listening to us on the podcast feed.
11252000	11254000	Thanks for your support of the show.
11254000	11257000	We always say here at Orange Lawns Radio, if you like what you heard here at the show,
11257000	11259000	tell one or two friends about the show.
11259000	11263000	Help spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
11263000	11264000	We really appreciate it.
11264000	11267000	We don't ask for your money and we don't have a ball pit, I'm sorry to say.
11267000	11274000	But when we do get money someday from selling shirts or something, we'll have a ball pit for you.
11274000	11277000	I never checked in with Loki for last minute stories, so I'll do that real quick.
11277000	11278000	There's not a ton.
11278000	11283000	There was this really cool mod that they have for Grand Theft Auto 3 called Liberty City Nights.
11283000	11289000	It's actually on ModDB and it adds some enhanced graphics to Grand Theft Auto 3
11289000	11296000	as well as improved car models and lighting to make it all very glowy and looks like midnight club almost.
11296000	11303000	So you can check that out on moddb.com slash mod slash GTA LCN.
11303000	11305000	Alright.
11305000	11308000	And then I also wanted to say, I actually posted about this.
11308000	11314000	I'm kind of looking forward to see what kind of games we get out of it, but apparently this month,
11314000	11322000	there is a game jam going on called Katamari Jam, which looks pretty awesome.
11322000	11324000	Yeah, I heard about that. That sounds awesome.
11324000	11326000	So I want to check that out.
11326000	11327000	Very cool.
11327000	11329000	Alright, well thanks again everybody for listening.
11329000	11330000	It's time to wrap up the show.
11330000	11334000	Before we do that, we're going to get around, go around and get everybody's final thought.
11334000	11336000	Um, Darcy, I'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.
11336000	11338000	I want poutine.
11338000	11339000	That sounds good.
11339000	11348000	I think I'm just going to go to the KFC A&W place and get fries and curds and then order a side of gravy.
11348000	11349000	There you go.
11349000	11350000	I'm going to have poutine tonight.
11350000	11354000	Make your own little like hack, A&W hack poutine.
11354000	11360000	My final thought tonight is now that you've talked about poutine, I want to take a trip to Canada.
11360000	11361000	I seriously do.
11361000	11364000	It's not like just now I want to go to Canada, but I've wanted to go back for some time.
11364000	11365000	I miss it.
11365000	11367000	I have friends in Toronto now, thanks to the podcast sister.
11367000	11370000	I have friends there, but I also really love Vancouver.
11370000	11371000	I got to go back there too.
11371000	11373000	Shout out to all our Canadian listeners.
11373000	11375000	I miss you.
11375000	11377000	Low key, your final thought.
11378000	11380000	They already have one game for Katamari Jam.
11380000	11383000	It's called Dama Cube and it looks pretty cool.
11383000	11384000	It's a puzzle game.
11384000	11388000	We roll stuff up as a cube.
11388000	11389000	I don't know.
11389000	11390000	It'd be fun to make like a Katamari game.
11390000	11398000	Our buddy Jason's in chat right now, which by the way, nobody asked why he wasn't in the intro tonight, but Jason was traveling tonight.
11398000	11400000	So he wasn't able to get the intro done for us.
11400000	11401000	So Jason's just fine.
11401000	11405000	He's in our chat room right now and says, I was in Canada for a week and I didn't have poutine.
11405000	11407000	Well, Jason, now you got to go back.
11410000	11411000	Now you got to go back.
11411000	11412000	All right.
11412000	11414000	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11414000	11417000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight and listening to the program.
11417000	11421000	We really appreciate it and hope you guys have a great week.
11421000	11424000	Be good to each other.
11424000	11426000	Don't be jerks to each other.
11426000	11427000	Nobody likes a jerk.
11427000	11428000	That's very important.
11428000	11431000	And do I have anything else to say?
11431000	11433000	I don't think so.
11433000	11434000	I think we're done.
11434000	11435000	We'll see you next week, guys.
11435000	11436000	Have a good one.
11436000	11437000	Goodbye.
11464000	11466000	They were all still true.
11468000	11470000	See you next week.
11494000	11497000	Thank you.
