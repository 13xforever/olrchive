00:00.000 --> 00:17.400
This week gamers may hate everything, but that list includes gender inequality.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.480
Feedback convinced the IESF to open a gender neutral division for their esports competitions.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.280
Also, ClickDB returned, hooray!

00:23.280 --> 00:25.240
Gears of War 4 did not confirm.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.720
We'll explain on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.720 --> 00:34.980
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.980 --> 00:36.600
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.600 --> 00:45.240
It is Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday July 6th of 2014 with the 559th episode of

00:45.240 --> 00:46.640
our show.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.200
We are here over the next few hours to talk about video games with you guys in our chat

00:51.200 --> 00:56.040
room live.voggenetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

00:56.040 --> 00:59.120
at 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:59.120 --> 01:04.120
In studio, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
Summers.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
Uh-uh.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Uh-huh, uh-huh, you're here.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.120
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.560
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

01:10.560 --> 01:11.560
You kind of tired.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.560
You're tired.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.320
You were very peppy during the Bobby Black Wolf call a little earlier though.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.280
Yeah, the caffeine's already starting to wear off.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.280
I see, you had your cup of coffee.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.040
I had orange chicken tonight and it makes me dead inside.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.720
Are you excited to go to convention with Rob and Alan this weekend, GamerX?

01:25.720 --> 01:32.760
I'm too busy to be excited because of cosplay props and the fact that I had a moment of

01:32.760 --> 01:39.280
stupid and forgot that, um, spray paint dissolves styrofoam, so I'm having to make a new skaia

01:39.280 --> 01:40.520
for my giant fork.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
Oh no.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.800
Are you going to tell us a little bit about your cosplay or is this a surprise?

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
It's not a surprise.

01:45.800 --> 01:52.040
I'm cosplaying as, uh, the crocoteer Jane from, uh, uh, Homestuck.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.360
Which is why I had to, when you said the character, my eyes glazed over.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.400
I totally cleared it up.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
Oh, hi, Techmaster Loki.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.400
How are you?

01:58.400 --> 01:59.400
I'm fine.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
Hey, I'll come back to you in a minute.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.800
Now, Dark Sucker, who is this character for those that don't know?

02:02.800 --> 02:11.320
Jane Crocker is the heir to the Betty Crocker, uh, uh, corporate monopoly of the universe.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.880
Like the people that make cakes?

02:12.880 --> 02:16.760
Yes, except it's really a troll who is the Batter Witch.

02:16.760 --> 02:17.760
Okay.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.760
The Batter Witch.

02:18.760 --> 02:19.760
Okay.

02:19.760 --> 02:23.240
So anyway, there's your fandoms are so strange, but all right, you know what?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
I watch Big Brother.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
It's totally trash.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.480
So she has this, her, she doesn't have a laptop.

02:28.480 --> 02:34.180
She has a tiara top and she gets taken over after she's already got here, which makes

02:34.180 --> 02:37.320
her kind of evil.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.480
I don't know why, but Homestuck sounds like that.

02:39.480 --> 02:43.400
It sounds like that game that you play where like you have a folded piece of paper and

02:43.400 --> 02:47.340
somebody writes one line of a story and then you fold it and somebody writes the next line

02:47.340 --> 02:50.080
of a story and you fold it and somebody writes the next line.

02:50.080 --> 02:55.160
And then you have like this total like mishmash hodgepodge, like random crap story that comes

02:55.160 --> 02:56.160
out of it.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.320
And somebody, if you'll follow the story, it makes sense.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
I understand.

03:00.320 --> 03:05.080
It's especially when you go back and go, Oh, that's what that weirdness was from.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.080
I'm not a hater.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.760
I'm just, just saying it's, well, this is the time to get into it because we're at the

03:09.760 --> 03:10.760
gigapause.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.760
Okay.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.460
Do I, should I even ask?

03:14.460 --> 03:16.640
Because the Homestuck game is under production right now.

03:16.640 --> 03:23.240
So put the final, uh, arc of the story on pause until the game is done because people

03:23.240 --> 03:26.160
paid $2 million for it through Kickstarter.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.080
Oh, so that's a little bit of an obligation to make the game.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.080
I see.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.320
So yeah, we're getting Homestuck game.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.320
All right.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.960
And no expanded universe for you.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.360
Oh, there's also, um, there's actually a new comic series.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.560
That's like little mini comics that expand on different things going on in the Homestuck

03:42.560 --> 03:44.720
universe called paradox space.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.720
All right.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
You know what?

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
We all have our fandoms.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
We all do.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
All right.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
I am looking forward to seeing your cosplay.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.280
I'm sad the animal crossing villager thing never panned out.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.240
I was, I could still hit you with a bug net.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.240
Oh yay.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.240
All right.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.240
Really?

03:58.240 --> 04:02.000
All I have to do is wear clothes and carry a bug net.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.760
Maybe, maybe we can hit up a fabric store really quick and try to try to figure out

04:06.760 --> 04:09.880
how to make that caught like one of those really funny hats they wear in the game.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.880
Okay.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.880
We'll figure something out.

04:11.880 --> 04:12.880
All right.

04:12.880 --> 04:13.880
Anyway, uh, tech master Loki's here as well.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
Of course.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.880
Cause you heard him earlier.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.880
How you doing Loki?

04:16.880 --> 04:17.880
Doing fine.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.040
Which fandoms do you have that other people probably wouldn't get?

04:21.040 --> 04:24.000
Um, I don't think I have any.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
No.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yes you do.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yes you do.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Before the show, before the show, you were talking about that you're going to take a

04:28.000 --> 04:32.680
day off of work in August to go see, that's not weird.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.600
I think I would do it.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.760
There's a lot of people that are looking at that new movie going, eh, I don't know.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.220
I guess, I guess it is looking a little better the more that comes out about it.

04:41.220 --> 04:45.640
It doesn't look as horrible as some of the ideas first thought, but I don't know.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.440
So you're like super into Ninja Turtles though.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm not super into it.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.560
I mean, I haven't watched any of the stuff that Nickelodeon's really done.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.760
Um, I'll just go see the movie.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
I liked the last movie.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.960
I was just kind of sad they didn't really continue on with that.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.960
Everyone hated it.

04:59.960 --> 05:03.880
I don't understand why I thought it was, it had the perfect vibe to it.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.120
I thought to use me in Ninja Turtles always made pretty good video games.

05:06.120 --> 05:13.120
I used to love the cartoon when I was a kid, um, it could be worse than some of these other

05:13.120 --> 05:14.120
movies.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.720
Like I just watched, um, was it World War Z?

05:17.120 --> 05:23.200
Yes, the zombie movie where they kill the, or they cure the apocalypse with meningitis.

05:23.200 --> 05:27.240
I heard they totally changed the movie version from the book though or something.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.640
It was so stupid, but whatever.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.160
Um, so I don't know.

05:32.160 --> 05:37.680
I don't really care that it's Michael Bay doing the movie and stuff as long as it doesn't

05:37.680 --> 05:39.240
seem too cheesy to me.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.960
You know, like the Transformers movies were just kind of retarded.

05:41.960 --> 05:42.960
I don't know.

05:42.960 --> 05:43.960
Mm hmm.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.360
So I, and painting game was good.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.680
I mean he did that.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.680
So bad boys was supposed to be pretty good.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.480
So was he Independence Day?

05:52.480 --> 05:56.800
Oh no, that was the, that was the Emmert guys who did Stargate and stuff.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.800
Yeah.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.720
No, they have, was it that Pompeii or some bullshit, I don't even know if that's come

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
out.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
No one, no one cared about that.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
Yeah.

06:04.720 --> 06:11.120
It's like, no, I think after, what was it, what's the last movie that they had the last

06:11.120 --> 06:15.520
disaster movie with, uh, what the hell was that?

06:15.520 --> 06:19.920
Uh, the Mayan apocalypse apocalypse or I don't even know what the fuck it was called.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.680
Was that the one where like they're trying to take out, yeah, 2012 and they're trying

06:22.680 --> 06:24.560
to take off from the airport.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.480
They outrun an earthquake like three times in an airplane is like, okay, this is such

06:28.480 --> 06:29.720
filler right now.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
It's ridiculous.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.840
But okay, whatever.

06:31.840 --> 06:38.240
Um, I just, but see that movie though, those kinds of movies are just, you know what to

06:38.240 --> 06:39.240
expect in the end.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.240
You know what?

06:40.240 --> 06:41.720
I am totally psyched for independence day too.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.720
Who gives a shit?

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
Is that actually happening?

06:43.720 --> 06:44.720
That's actually happening.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.720
Who gives a crap?

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
Who cares?

06:47.720 --> 06:48.720
I don't care.

06:48.720 --> 06:49.720
All right.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
I will see that.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.720
I'm, I'm really sad though because Harvey Firstine, his character died in the first

06:53.720 --> 06:55.040
one, or at least it's implied.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.040
Maybe he somehow survived, you know, because that was, that was the character to root for

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
the full bonkers.

07:00.040 --> 07:04.360
I mean, it's in the future now, maybe they've rebuilt him to cybernetic, you know, Harvey

07:04.360 --> 07:05.780
Finds.

07:05.780 --> 07:06.780
Maybe it involves his mother.

07:06.780 --> 07:08.920
Cause you know, in the first movie, I got to call my mother.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
Yes.

07:09.920 --> 07:14.520
And he can be dressing in drag as his mother.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.520
And better.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.520
Yes.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.520
Was there a video game for independence day?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.520
Oh yeah.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.520
It was terrible.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.520
It was PlayStation one.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.240
There's always like interesting movie game tie-ins.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.560
We'll talk about that in a minute here, but I got to go to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com

07:26.560 --> 07:31.000
because of course we do tape live at Sunday nights at the voice of the East network, voggenetwork.com.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.720
Blender's a fan of world war Z, the book saying the book is awesome.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.720
Let's see.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.400
Tigerclaw would like you to know Loki, Michael Bay is not directing it, but act after saying

07:40.400 --> 07:42.680
Michael Bay is involved and that's enough.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.680
It doesn't.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.280
I see even that I don't really care.

07:45.280 --> 07:51.360
I mean, it's just like eventually it's statistically possible that M Night Shyamalan will make

07:51.360 --> 07:52.360
a good movie again.

07:52.360 --> 07:58.240
I mean, so that will happen someday, but it's just like Michael Bay, you know, I don't hate

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240
everything that he does.

07:59.240 --> 08:03.520
I just hate the transformers movies, like the last few of them, cause they've been really

08:03.520 --> 08:08.920
just kind of stretching that franchise then it's just not really about the transformers

08:08.920 --> 08:09.920
anymore.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.420
It's just kind of this thing that they spun it into.

08:12.420 --> 08:16.000
That's what I don't like about Michael Bay, but his movies are fine.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.300
I know going into it, I expect a very low intelligent, lots of explosions action movie

08:24.300 --> 08:25.380
and that's what I get.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.780
So I'm not let down by Michael Bay.

08:28.780 --> 08:34.820
It's just when they start making testicle jokes in transformers 2 that's a little kind

08:34.820 --> 08:39.020
of like, okay, this is a little weird.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.020
Let's see.

08:40.020 --> 08:49.820
I did not realize, well, Jack Bauer is soon going to be, soon going to be solid snake.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.700
So you know, that guy's everywhere.

08:51.700 --> 08:52.700
Even soon.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.700
He already is.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.700
Yeah, it's true.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.700
He is.

08:55.700 --> 08:56.700
So, uh, let's see.

08:56.700 --> 09:01.420
A dark to Tia says, I don't think the Bay TMNT will top the 1990 original, but I don't

09:01.420 --> 09:03.260
think it'd be any worse than TMNT three.

09:03.260 --> 09:08.940
Hey, I am a little TMT three kind of had like camp value because I had a little bit of that.

09:08.940 --> 09:09.940
It's so bad.

09:09.940 --> 09:10.940
It's kind of good going on.

09:10.940 --> 09:11.940
A little disappointed.

09:11.940 --> 09:13.180
Casey Jones isn't going to be in the movie.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.180
Oh really?

09:14.180 --> 09:17.700
Um, but I guess they have to save stuff for sequel and I know they were talking already

09:17.700 --> 09:19.740
for the sequel, like Bebop and Roxy.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.740
So I'm, I'm down with that.

09:21.740 --> 09:22.740
There you go.

09:22.740 --> 09:26.540
Um, so we're talking a little bit about, uh, you know, games based on movies of, or that

09:26.540 --> 09:30.560
we bring up this topic once in a while, but I think it's good as we get a lot, we get

09:30.560 --> 09:34.180
into the big summer movie season to kind of revisit this once in a while.

09:34.180 --> 09:38.780
Like what are the big movies that are out there that you're really surprised don't have

09:38.780 --> 09:41.020
like a video game behind it?

09:41.020 --> 09:43.900
Because for me, like whenever I think about that question, especially now, like these

09:43.900 --> 09:47.540
past couple of years, I'm always surprised there's not really a video game for the hunger

09:47.540 --> 09:48.540
games.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.340
And yeah, I know there are some, there's the iPhone games.

09:51.340 --> 09:56.300
I do know there's that, but I don't, I mean like those really just seem like totally different

09:56.300 --> 09:57.300
ideas.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.740
I mean, essentially who's the target audience.

09:59.740 --> 10:00.740
That's the thing.

10:00.740 --> 10:01.740
I know, I know.

10:01.740 --> 10:05.580
But the one hunger games game that I can think of was basically a two D temple run that just

10:05.580 --> 10:08.620
had a hunger game stuff slapped all over it.

10:08.620 --> 10:09.620
You know what I mean?

10:09.620 --> 10:14.380
Like I would like to see like a legit, like multiplayer you're in the arena type of thing.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.580
Closest thing you're gonna get to that is the Minecraft mods where you can play hunger

10:17.580 --> 10:18.580
games in that.

10:18.580 --> 10:19.580
Yeah.

10:19.580 --> 10:20.580
And that's actually pretty cool.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.140
You know why they won't do one, right?

10:23.140 --> 10:28.340
Because it's because kids, why wouldn't there be a battle royale video game?

10:28.340 --> 10:29.460
Yeah, that's true.

10:29.460 --> 10:33.220
I realized that kind of subject matters a little iffy, but I mean, catching fire, I

10:33.220 --> 10:34.220
hope this isn't spoiler.

10:34.220 --> 10:35.220
I don't think it is.

10:35.220 --> 10:41.580
The catching fire does involve adults, not kids still, you know, fairly young, still

10:41.580 --> 10:42.580
teenagers.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.580
Hmm.

10:43.580 --> 10:46.460
They could, they could find a way to work into the video game to make it less controversial.

10:46.460 --> 10:47.460
I don't know.

10:47.460 --> 10:51.220
I mean, it worked in the movie without being like, you know, those movies aren't like offensive

10:51.220 --> 10:52.220
or whatever.

10:52.220 --> 10:55.440
Remember people categorize movies and video games differently in this country.

10:55.440 --> 10:59.300
And those people are dumb, which is, you know, which is always a little weird to me, always

10:59.300 --> 11:03.860
a little weird to me, um, dungeon buster in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

11:03.860 --> 11:08.640
says X-Men days of future past should have gotten an X-Men legends or Marvel Alliance

11:08.640 --> 11:10.140
kind of game.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.140
Yeah.

11:11.140 --> 11:15.700
There hasn't there, has there been a new X-Men game to support this, these, this new movie?

11:15.700 --> 11:16.700
I don't think there has been.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.700
Activision used to do the licensed movies for the Marvel properties and stuff.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.700
Yeah.

11:20.700 --> 11:24.600
Now they aren't, um, cause they used to do all the sorts of movie tie-ins and even their

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
own things.

11:25.600 --> 11:30.580
And they tried rebooting like the X-Men with, uh, I remember the last X-Men game was, but

11:30.580 --> 11:32.100
it wasn't very good.

11:32.100 --> 11:37.060
Um, and I think they've just kind of given up on that, although they will, they occasionally

11:37.060 --> 11:42.980
will do the quick cash-in on movie franchises, like the walking dead, which was terrible

11:42.980 --> 11:46.860
or, um, the fast and the furious, which was also terrible.

11:46.860 --> 11:50.740
That walking dead one in particular was always so weird to me because you had two walking

11:50.740 --> 11:51.740
dead games.

11:51.740 --> 11:57.300
And I think I get it because Telltale licensed the, the original comics, right.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.260
And then Activision licensed the show and that's why you had the two walking dead games.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.700
One of them, fantastic.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.140
The other one, absolutely awful.

12:05.140 --> 12:06.140
Yeah.

12:06.140 --> 12:09.580
It's in the fast and the furious game was just ridiculous.

12:09.580 --> 12:10.580
It was just stupid.

12:10.580 --> 12:13.300
Um, and, and Activision will do that.

12:13.300 --> 12:17.380
They will, you know, make a quick buck on some of these, you know, licenses and stuff,

12:17.380 --> 12:20.460
but they just haven't done that recently.

12:20.460 --> 12:24.920
I think the closest that you've gotten to new superhero games recently is probably the

12:24.920 --> 12:27.100
Lego Marvel superhero stuff.

12:27.100 --> 12:30.620
That's really, I mean, those are actually not bad.

12:30.620 --> 12:34.700
It's just all the Lego games start to kind of blend together eventually cause it's all

12:34.700 --> 12:35.840
kind of the same form.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.840
It's a formula that works.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
Yeah.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.840
They have the same sense of humor.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.100
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.420
Um, let's see some comments in our chat room.

12:42.420 --> 12:45.320
Tiger class as most movie tie in games were mobile games.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.320
That's that is true.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.320
That's true.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.320
The X-Men had a mobile game.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.420
I want a Pacific rim fighting game.

12:50.420 --> 12:56.460
There they had won a Pacific rim game, but it's X-Box live arcade and PlayStation network.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.460
It's shit.

12:57.460 --> 12:58.460
Oh, sorry.

12:58.460 --> 12:59.460
That's too bad.

12:59.460 --> 13:00.460
Yeah.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.940
It's like street fighter two, the movie, the game.

13:02.940 --> 13:07.220
I think it, at least I think it was those platforms and not just, um, I could be confusing

13:07.220 --> 13:08.660
it with real steel.

13:08.660 --> 13:13.500
Um, but it was both of those games are actually very similar and it was just not very good

13:13.500 --> 13:14.580
at all.

13:14.580 --> 13:18.920
Um, going into current events, uh, something we were talking about briefly last week, act

13:18.920 --> 13:24.140
deaf in our chat room says Activision is why I'm weary of platinum's legend of Corey game.

13:24.140 --> 13:25.140
Hmm.

13:25.140 --> 13:26.140
Uh, let's see.

13:26.140 --> 13:29.980
It's some, there was some talk in chat about, uh, let's see, Blender says, Pulp Fiction,

13:29.980 --> 13:35.140
the game, bring out the gimp bonus around, uh, blueberry responded and said, isn't basically

13:35.140 --> 13:37.940
saints row Pulp Fiction, the game.

13:37.940 --> 13:41.300
It used to be, um, now it's just fucking nuts.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.300
That's the thing.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.100
I mean, seriously, no, it's saints row five.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.100
It's fucking nuts.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.100
It's no seriously there.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.100
You go and play.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.740
I mean, do yourself a favor and go play.

13:50.740 --> 13:55.820
I think one of the best in the series was saints row to at least best when it was kind

13:55.820 --> 14:00.660
of still hinges around the fact that it's a gang, then they're, you know, fighting to

14:00.660 --> 14:05.500
get their territory back and that kind of stuff, um, with, you know, the wacky kind

14:05.500 --> 14:12.020
of mini games and stuff and just the humor and see the part of, I think the saints row

14:12.020 --> 14:16.380
series that they've lost in three and four was the brutality of like, cause it's a true

14:16.380 --> 14:18.780
to you fucked up.

14:18.780 --> 14:23.020
Like those gang leaders, like when they got revenge, they got revenge in the most fucked

14:23.020 --> 14:24.020
up ways.

14:24.020 --> 14:27.060
And then there was one where this guy ends up killing one of your crew members.

14:27.060 --> 14:31.380
So we do you kidnap his girlfriend cause he's a monster truck, you know, um, monster truck

14:31.380 --> 14:37.020
driver and you, you, uh, stuffer in the trunk of one of the cars that he's going to crush

14:37.020 --> 14:38.220
and he kills her.

14:38.220 --> 14:42.340
He forces the gang member to kill his girlfriend for people.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.340
See that was just like brutal.

14:44.340 --> 14:49.780
But in, you know, three, it's just like, it's just got ridiculous.

14:49.780 --> 14:53.980
And in four was just, it's not even, I don't even see that as part of the series.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.220
Any more ridiculousness is what appealed to me though.

14:56.220 --> 14:59.220
Because like that's, that's all I ever played the grand theft auto games for.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.220
Yeah.

15:00.220 --> 15:05.420
But like two was it, two had a good balance of ridiculous and like still kind of grounded.

15:05.420 --> 15:11.340
I mean it wasn't, it was, I mean you had the septic Avenger where you'd spray poop on people,

15:11.340 --> 15:13.180
you know, with, uh, with a septic truck.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.180
And that was awesome.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.540
That was absolutely awesome.

15:16.540 --> 15:20.340
And they had, you know, the ability where for no apparent reason whatsoever, you're

15:20.340 --> 15:24.900
going to have the ability to, you know, uproot things off the, you know, the street and

15:24.900 --> 15:25.900
use them as weapons.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.220
So, Oh hey, look at that, you know, fire hydrant, I'm just gonna rip it out of the ground and

15:29.220 --> 15:30.220
hit people with it.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.820
That was, that was awesome.

15:31.820 --> 15:34.140
It just made no sense, but it was awesome.

15:34.140 --> 15:40.880
But being a, you know, uh, the president of the United States and being trapped in a virtual

15:40.880 --> 15:46.040
matrix world and stuff and being a superhero, it's just so ridiculous that it's just kind

15:46.040 --> 15:49.900
of, I don't know, it's like, it's like they wanted to make a different type of game, but

15:49.900 --> 15:51.180
they had to make a saints row game.

15:51.180 --> 15:55.580
It's like, Oh, well we have to make a saints row, you know, sequel, but I really want to

15:55.580 --> 15:56.580
make crackdown.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.580
It's, that's what it seemed like to me.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.580
All right.

15:59.580 --> 16:01.740
Let me read a few more comments here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and then

16:01.740 --> 16:04.540
we'll get into our gaming weeks and tonight's gaming news.

16:04.540 --> 16:09.740
Um, let's see, uh, Blender says, surprise, nobody mentioned Firefly.

16:09.740 --> 16:15.220
Now it usually does come up in these types of conversations about what, you know, movies,

16:15.220 --> 16:18.940
which I guess technically the movie was serenity, but y'all know what we're talking about.

16:18.980 --> 16:23.180
Uh, what usually that's that whole universe comes up as something that could be ported

16:23.180 --> 16:24.180
to games.

16:24.180 --> 16:27.820
And it does seem very surprising, you know, because it's very clear at this point, not

16:27.820 --> 16:33.180
even Netflix and Hulu and Yahoo, not even Yahoo screen or whatever saved community.

16:33.180 --> 16:34.940
Not even that is going to say Firefly at this point.

16:34.940 --> 16:37.000
I mean, all of those actors have moved on to other projects.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.220
It's getting older and older.

16:38.220 --> 16:39.220
Right.

16:39.220 --> 16:43.060
But I'm really surprised that like the story couldn't continue in a tell tale esque kind

16:43.060 --> 16:46.980
of episodic game, you know, classic point and click adventure type of thing.

16:46.980 --> 16:47.980
There were comics.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.380
Yeah, I guess that's true.

16:49.380 --> 16:52.340
There were a lot of the weed and stuff has been continued in comics, hasn't it?

16:52.340 --> 16:53.340
Yes.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.340
Sadly for Buffy.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.340
Yeah.

16:55.340 --> 16:58.580
You know what would make a really awesome movie, I think is Borderlands.

16:58.580 --> 17:03.700
Borderlands has a really good kind of, uh, you know, environment and characters and just

17:03.700 --> 17:04.700
that humor to it.

17:04.700 --> 17:05.700
I think that'd be really good.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.740
I got to see a little bit of the tales from the Borderlands at E3.

17:08.740 --> 17:12.020
We, we were lucky enough to go to a telltale presentation for that where they played through

17:12.020 --> 17:13.700
the first 20 minutes of the game.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.420
And I must admit my knowledge of the borderland bland universe is not very deep.

17:17.460 --> 17:21.460
I have familiarity with both games, but I just never got like sucked into them the way

17:21.460 --> 17:25.260
a lot of other people have, but I was still able to follow the game that they were playing

17:25.260 --> 17:26.260
well enough.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.260
And it was amusing.

17:27.260 --> 17:28.260
It had its parts.

17:28.260 --> 17:32.820
And I, I was very, um, kind of taken aback how the art style worked so well and the way

17:32.820 --> 17:36.460
the game looks in this completely different type of game.

17:36.460 --> 17:40.980
So there's that, you know, the tales from the borderlands is shaping up to be pretty

17:40.980 --> 17:41.980
interesting.

17:42.020 --> 17:46.620
Um, anyway, uh, also go to our chat room over at live.vog network.com.

17:46.620 --> 17:52.620
Um, Kaijudo said most video game movies are bad, so I'm glad they seem to be making less

17:52.620 --> 17:53.620
of them.

17:53.620 --> 17:57.660
And blueberry jumped in saying, I agree with Kaijudo, I don't miss the console movie games.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.620
They had zero ambition, negative ambition level.

18:00.620 --> 18:05.500
See they didn't use to like, I remember back in the day, like what the Batman game on the

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
NES was awesome.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.500
Oh yeah.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.820
Uh, the star Wars, super star Wars on super Nintendo was like some of the best platformers.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.180
Both had a claim to these.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.180
Yeah.

18:15.180 --> 18:16.180
I knew their shit.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.180
Yeah.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.180
They did.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.180
When it came to those games.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.180
I mean, those games are on point actually.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.620
Now that I think of it, claiming a ton of fucking awesome use all the Simpsons games.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.860
I mean, those are just fantastic.

18:24.860 --> 18:25.860
Yeah.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.300
Some of those Simpsons games really weren't bad.

18:28.300 --> 18:33.380
Like they seriously knew how to take a franchise or your license and make a decent game out

18:33.380 --> 18:34.380
of it.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.380
But they had a few stinkers too.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.580
I mean, they, they didn't, they didn't bat a hundred.

18:37.580 --> 18:47.060
He did do a, the Barbie games, which, all right, um, all right, let's get into, uh,

18:47.060 --> 18:48.060
our gaming weeks.

18:48.060 --> 18:52.200
Cause we always like to, uh, towards the top of the show, establish our frame of reference

18:52.200 --> 18:56.060
and where our heads are at this week by talking about what we have been playing this week

18:56.060 --> 18:57.060
in video games.

18:57.060 --> 18:58.060
Dark soccer.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.060
How was your gaming week?

18:59.060 --> 19:04.660
Well, um, I, I've actually hardly touched my DS except to do puzzles, you know, for

19:04.660 --> 19:05.660
shoot pass.

19:05.660 --> 19:12.700
Um, I played some final fantasy 14 yesterday, finally finished the rescue quest.

19:12.700 --> 19:23.060
Now I don't get another quest until 49, which sucks cause I'm almost a 47, um, there, uh,

19:23.060 --> 19:28.580
drew was at my, uh, uh, July 4th party.

19:28.580 --> 19:33.060
I was like trying to say Friday something, but it was Friday, but it was also July 4th,

19:33.060 --> 19:38.060
um, and brought over the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure game for PS3, which was pretty cool and about

19:38.060 --> 19:40.340
as over the top as I expected.

19:40.340 --> 19:43.860
Um, and you guys are kicking some classics on the 4th of July too.

19:43.860 --> 19:51.420
We had some super Mario world going on and Julian was introduced to children's in time

19:51.420 --> 19:56.460
and got frustrated in through the controller, which meant no more super Nintendo for him.

19:56.460 --> 19:57.460
Right.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.740
At least, at least they used to build the controllers to take a beating back then who,

20:00.740 --> 20:03.700
which one of us didn't throw a super Nintendo controller back in the day?

20:03.700 --> 20:04.700
He said it slipped.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.700
Of course.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.700
Of course.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.780
I said slipped with a lot of force.

20:08.780 --> 20:09.780
No.

20:09.780 --> 20:15.420
So anyway, um, but yeah, he got introduced to turtles in time, which is like one of the

20:15.420 --> 20:16.740
best games ever.

20:16.740 --> 20:22.860
And I, uh, excuse me, I got, then you took a nap.

20:22.860 --> 20:23.860
No, I'm sorry.

20:23.860 --> 20:28.860
I got that adventure time game, the, because I don't know, oh, the, why are we in the dungeon?

20:29.380 --> 20:30.380
How is that?

20:30.380 --> 20:32.620
Let's do the dungeon because I don't know.

20:32.620 --> 20:35.940
Um, I actually need to have my controller hooked up to play it.

20:35.940 --> 20:37.940
Let's explore the dungeon because I don't know.

20:37.940 --> 20:38.940
Oh, okay.

20:38.940 --> 20:39.940
Whatever.

20:39.940 --> 20:43.220
Anyway, I've heard very mixed things on it and mostly negative, I gotta say.

20:43.220 --> 20:47.420
It looks cute, but I haven't really gotten to play much of it.

20:47.420 --> 20:52.180
Um, I, I have, I just found the controller to hook up to it.

20:52.180 --> 20:56.940
I'm gonna try to play a little bit, but I have cosplays to work on, so no.

20:56.940 --> 20:57.940
Fair enough.

20:57.980 --> 21:01.620
I have blue balls on my desk.

21:01.620 --> 21:02.620
Okay.

21:02.620 --> 21:03.620
Hemispheres.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.620
I have blue half balls.

21:04.620 --> 21:08.340
You're going to have some vog balls next week at, or this coming weekend at GamerX to give

21:08.340 --> 21:09.340
out.

21:09.340 --> 21:13.980
I will, I will, uh, keep them close to my heart and then throw them out.

21:13.980 --> 21:14.980
Sounds good.

21:14.980 --> 21:15.980
All right.

21:15.980 --> 21:18.500
If that's it for your gaming week, let's check on Loki.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.500
How was your gaming week?

21:19.500 --> 21:21.220
Um, I didn't play a whole ton.

21:21.220 --> 21:27.300
I did play, um, Mario Kart Wii because I did borrow that from you and, um, I tried to get

21:27.300 --> 21:28.300
my son to play it.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.420
Of course, he wanted to watch.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.420
I did.

21:30.420 --> 21:31.420
Actually, he played it a little bit.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.180
And to be clear, you're not talking Mario Kart 8, the newest one you're talking about

21:34.180 --> 21:35.180
last year.

21:35.180 --> 21:36.180
Mario Kart Wii, yeah.

21:36.180 --> 21:43.540
And, um, I tried using that Wii wheel, you know, like, I, at least I had him using it

21:43.540 --> 21:44.540
and stuff.

21:44.540 --> 21:45.820
That thing is fucking terrible.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.700
I don't know why they'd ever try to do that control scheme.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.380
It was just, it's god awful.

21:50.380 --> 21:54.260
It's a little hokey, but they try, I guess, you know, kids really get into it.

21:54.260 --> 21:55.260
Like, they really get into it.

21:55.260 --> 21:57.700
I understand that, but, like, it's super hard to play it that way.

21:57.700 --> 22:02.340
Did you know that Mario Kart 8 will let you use, like, the Wii controller in the same

22:02.340 --> 22:03.340
way?

22:03.340 --> 22:06.220
Like, you can still use the wheel in Mario Kart 8, and you can use the gamepad screen

22:06.220 --> 22:08.260
as, like, a giant controller, basically.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.260
Yeah, no thanks.

22:09.260 --> 22:13.780
I don't need gyro controls for, you know, that type of game.

22:13.780 --> 22:16.540
Again, I think it's kids versus adults.

22:16.540 --> 22:21.060
Like, you and me, we want that precision that comes with the more, like, you know, tactile

22:21.060 --> 22:22.700
response and feedback.

22:22.700 --> 22:26.820
But I think for a kid, you know, who just spins the wheel everywhere and just watches

22:26.820 --> 22:28.660
their car drive in circles, it's fine.

22:28.660 --> 22:34.060
I'm actually interested in trying to, now that I've, you know, have that, since my system's

22:34.060 --> 22:39.300
still modded, I'm trying to actually, to load in the custom tracks that people have made.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.500
I've actually watched some videos of it, although a lot of those custom tracks aren't very good

22:42.500 --> 22:46.640
that people have made, but it's still interesting that you can do that.

22:46.640 --> 22:50.940
And there's even tracks in there that I forgot were in there, and so it was, I don't know,

22:50.940 --> 22:55.100
it was kind of fun.

22:55.100 --> 22:59.100
I don't know, I still like, I do like how they had the Mii integration stuff in there,

22:59.100 --> 23:02.660
where your Miis are in the background, so I kept pointing out to them, like, well look,

23:02.660 --> 23:06.420
see, you know, there's mommy in the background right there, you know, she's driving that

23:06.420 --> 23:09.500
car and, you know, there I am right there.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.980
So that was kind of fun.

23:12.980 --> 23:17.060
And then really, that was, that's all I played this week, because I was, you know, working

23:17.060 --> 23:20.180
on game stuff.

23:20.180 --> 23:23.860
Once again, now I'm trying to still skim by with, you know, just learning a few things,

23:23.860 --> 23:25.980
but it's like forcing me not to.

23:25.980 --> 23:32.840
So I started learning how to write shaders, which, you know, that's basically the language

23:32.840 --> 23:40.180
that you use for telling how to draw stuff on the screen, so you can have, like, reflections

23:40.180 --> 23:41.180
and all that fun stuff.

23:41.180 --> 23:45.240
And when I hear, like, shaders, it makes me think about, like, drawing the shade and those

23:45.240 --> 23:46.860
sorts of, like, yeah.

23:46.860 --> 23:52.220
It's working with, like, you know, lighting and stuff like that, so I'm making a really

23:52.220 --> 23:56.180
custom shader for what I need it to do.

23:56.180 --> 23:59.480
So I've been trying to figure that out, and originally I was gonna, you know, cut corners

23:59.480 --> 24:04.740
and do it as a surface shader, because that's, the language is very, it's high level, so

24:04.740 --> 24:05.740
it's really easy.

24:05.740 --> 24:09.780
You just put, like, you know, lighting on, diffuse, yes, you know, and that, you know,

24:09.780 --> 24:10.780
just really simple stuff.

24:10.780 --> 24:16.280
But I can't, I have to do it as a vertex and fragment shader.

24:16.280 --> 24:23.560
So I have to learn everything to actually do it instead of just skimming, you know.

24:23.560 --> 24:28.720
So once again, I went through the whole surface thing, and I kind of learned how to do that,

24:28.720 --> 24:32.480
and then I went back, because I had actually started doing the vertex fragment stuff first,

24:32.480 --> 24:34.040
and I was like, I don't get this.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.560
And then I went back to it, and I kind of understand it a little bit more now.

24:37.560 --> 24:42.040
And now I'm actually trying to write it as I'm kind of watching the tutorial series,

24:42.040 --> 24:43.960
and it's helping.

24:43.960 --> 24:49.020
So I kind of understand why things are being done in certain ways and stuff.

24:49.020 --> 24:54.780
So I'm hopefully gonna get that done, and then, once again, the goal is to create assets

24:54.780 --> 24:56.480
so I can keep moving on with the game.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.800
But at the same time, I'm kind of learning how to do interesting things, and once again,

25:00.800 --> 25:05.880
I came up with some really high concept, you know, idea of something I could implement

25:05.880 --> 25:06.880
in there.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.080
I'm like, I don't really need to do this, but that would be so cool if I could.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.440
And so, we'll see, I don't know.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.280
Well good for you for still sticking with it.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.280
Yeah.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.440
Have more time, so.

25:16.440 --> 25:20.040
I imagine at some point we should probably address something you've been tweeting about

25:20.040 --> 25:21.980
this week as well.

25:21.980 --> 25:27.240
You found out this week that a lot of your news and information you've talked about on

25:27.240 --> 25:28.360
this show has come through.

25:28.360 --> 25:33.680
You know, your work, you work in gaming distribution and so forth, but this week.

25:33.680 --> 25:40.860
This week, we found out, see, here's the thing, it's funny, because we were told one thing,

25:40.860 --> 25:44.820
they put out a press release saying another thing, and you know, I think they were trying

25:44.820 --> 25:50.820
to spin it so that it wouldn't seem so bad on the one company, but basically what happened

25:50.820 --> 25:53.940
is the owner of the company, he wants to get out.

25:53.940 --> 26:00.380
He's been doing it for 30 plus years, and he's not young, you know, and he wants to

26:00.380 --> 26:04.660
sell the company and just kind of move on, and the company's not as profitable as it

26:04.660 --> 26:09.540
used to be, and it's kind of just like treading water, so he's gonna get out.

26:09.540 --> 26:14.800
So he sold it to the next biggest competitor, which is Ingram Entertainment.

26:14.800 --> 26:20.500
So they're gonna buy it, but they're doing it as an assets person, which means that they're

26:20.500 --> 26:21.980
buying the assets of the company.

26:21.980 --> 26:29.580
They're buying the customer lists, and they're buying the inventory and whatever else, you

26:29.580 --> 26:30.740
know, that kind of stuff.

26:30.740 --> 26:36.560
So not the employees, but they're having everybody stay on until the end of September to help

26:36.560 --> 26:41.000
transition all the customers over to the, you know, the new company and just to kind

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
of smooth that stuff around.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.760
So you can quit now if you want, but you don't get a severance, and if you stay on, you get

26:48.760 --> 26:54.220
a severance, and the way they spent the press releases, they're like, yeah, you know, there

26:54.220 --> 26:59.640
may be some layoffs, but you know, or there may be some layoffs, they said, but it's really

26:59.640 --> 27:04.460
from what we were told, it's everybody, maybe there might be a few people.

27:04.460 --> 27:07.900
It sounds like if you wanted to stay, you'd have to relocate to Tennessee or wherever

27:07.900 --> 27:08.900
these guys are located.

27:08.900 --> 27:09.900
I don't even know.

27:09.900 --> 27:10.900
Yeah.

27:10.900 --> 27:15.580
And they have, like, their main business, Ingram, is beer distribution.

27:15.580 --> 27:18.780
That's where they make a lot of their money, is alcohol distribution stuff, because they

27:18.780 --> 27:21.480
do a lot more than just entertainment stuff.

27:21.480 --> 27:27.580
They do, you know, alcohol, I think they do music, books, you know, all sorts of stuff.

27:27.580 --> 27:28.580
Alcohol.

27:28.580 --> 27:29.580
Tell me more.

27:30.100 --> 27:34.140
And they also do, like, they sell to different customers than we did.

27:34.140 --> 27:38.360
Like, they do grocery store, which, you know, usually has high returns, and we didn't mess

27:38.360 --> 27:39.700
with it.

27:39.700 --> 27:45.700
So I don't know, it's like, so, you know, I was kind of looking to get out of the company

27:45.700 --> 27:51.180
anyways, because it was kind of just a dead end, it seemed like, and now kind of just

27:51.180 --> 27:55.180
have more motivation to do that, because I have really no choice in three months.

27:55.180 --> 27:59.420
But at the same time, it's a little bit of a relief, you know, and but for everybody

27:59.420 --> 28:04.260
else, so they're, like, really bummed out and crying, but I'm just like, for me, it's

28:04.260 --> 28:07.180
like a whole lot less stress, because I'm like, wow, I actually don't need to worry

28:07.180 --> 28:11.340
about order forms that are in December, because I'm never gonna, I don't have to do that,

28:11.340 --> 28:14.740
you know, I don't have to worry about getting this done, because it's not.

28:14.740 --> 28:18.260
I'm glad you're spinning what can kind of be a crappy thing, like layoffs kind of into

28:18.260 --> 28:22.660
the positive, and yeah, you're a smart guy, you're gonna turn out just fine.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.180
If anybody out there listening might have some leads for Loki, email the show.

28:26.180 --> 28:28.860
Well, it's just gonna be tough, because I haven't interviewed, I mean, I've been there

28:28.860 --> 28:34.820
for 14 and a half years, so I haven't interviewed in 14 and a half years, so, you know.

28:34.820 --> 28:39.980
Now's the time to start researching with that and all that, so practice, practice, practice.

28:39.980 --> 28:42.660
All right, well, good luck to you, Loki.

28:42.660 --> 28:45.100
I'm sure you will be just fine.

28:45.100 --> 28:48.280
Which means, though, in the meantime, though, I will be bringing that cabinet over at some

28:48.280 --> 28:50.820
point, because I can't stay there.

28:50.820 --> 28:51.820
I can't stay there now.

28:51.820 --> 28:59.100
You wouldn't happen to want a framed poster of True Crime New York that's signed by the

28:59.100 --> 29:01.100
entire cast.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.940
I don't know where we could give it away.

29:03.940 --> 29:04.940
Maybe a listener wants it.

29:04.940 --> 29:05.940
We can give it away.

29:05.940 --> 29:06.940
There you go.

29:06.940 --> 29:07.940
All right.

29:07.940 --> 29:12.940
And a lot of kind words there from our chat over at live.vognetware.com.

29:12.940 --> 29:15.880
Dungeon Buster says, good luck, I'm sure you'll land on your feet somewhere.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.880
So you will.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
All right.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.860
On to my gaming week, and the types of games I've been playing this week.

29:20.900 --> 29:22.460
I've kind of been all over the map.

29:22.460 --> 29:27.580
For MMOs, I've still been continuing on both Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, which

29:27.580 --> 29:31.340
I talked already about XI a little bit and my resurgence with that last week.

29:31.340 --> 29:36.980
I got my Corsair up to level 37, I think, and I'm doing my rank commissions right now.

29:36.980 --> 29:39.580
So if you've ever played the game, you know that at one point in the game, you have to

29:39.580 --> 29:46.460
travel to all the different cities and kill a dragon boss is the big thing to do.

29:46.460 --> 29:47.460
That's kind of where I'm at.

29:47.460 --> 29:48.460
I forgot about that.

29:48.460 --> 29:52.060
It's so much easier now though, because once you go to a city, once you activate the telepoint

29:52.060 --> 29:55.580
and now you can work to that telepoint, whatever you want for 500 gil.

29:55.580 --> 29:58.060
It works like it doesn't.

29:58.060 --> 30:01.980
So I made the trek to Windhurst on the boat and everything one time, and now I don't ever

30:01.980 --> 30:04.420
have to do it again because I can just work on the telepoint.

30:04.420 --> 30:05.420
Aw man.

30:05.420 --> 30:06.420
Aw man.

30:06.420 --> 30:07.420
Aw man.

30:07.420 --> 30:08.420
Aw man.

30:08.420 --> 30:09.420
Aw man.

30:09.420 --> 30:10.420
Aw man.

30:10.420 --> 30:11.420
Aw man.

30:11.420 --> 30:12.420
Aw man.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.420
Aw man.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.420
Aw man.

30:14.420 --> 30:15.420
Aw man.

30:15.420 --> 30:16.420
Aw man.

30:16.420 --> 30:17.420
Aw man.

30:17.420 --> 30:18.420
Aw man.

30:18.580 --> 30:19.580
ig

30:34.740 --> 30:38.520
just gonna live in the guild house forever our guild house is pretty sweet i gotta say

30:38.520 --> 30:42.780
if you happened to be on uh midgar summer on virus c14 you should look us up have fun

30:42.780 --> 30:46.520
with us darn what do you do in the guild house can you actually arrange stuff in there and

30:46.720 --> 30:48.240
parties

30:48.240 --> 30:55.340
guild officers and and the like shane is the guild leader he can designate people who can rearrange the furniture and i know i'm

30:55.340 --> 30:57.000
Allen and this guy zach

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
that plays with us have both been very big on like

31:00.100 --> 31:06.200
arranging the house and putting everything in and you can actually build a lot of the furniture through crafting and some of it takes rare

31:06.280 --> 31:12.920
materials that you can only get from certain bosses they're like rare drops from bosses for example crystal tower which is the big 24 man raid

31:12.920 --> 31:17.600
in the game right now has a chance to drop an item that you turn into these glowing sword

31:17.600 --> 31:21.680
arches that you put out in front of your house so i think that's a really clever little way

31:21.680 --> 31:25.920
to incorporate the housing with the rest of the game is that you know the better you are

31:25.920 --> 31:29.960
at farming certain items that can actually go into your house i'm really looking forward

31:29.960 --> 31:33.920
to some of the pvp they're building it in the new patch because right now the only pvp

31:33.920 --> 31:37.580
they have in the game is called wolves den which is just an arena style pvp it's four

31:37.580 --> 31:42.380
versus four kill or be killed that's it just straight up you know arena play but now what

31:42.380 --> 31:47.060
they're putting in in the patch they're gonna put front lines is what it's called and for

31:47.060 --> 31:51.260
those that have played wow it sounds a lot like arathi basin and it's basically king

31:51.260 --> 31:56.200
of the hill with the several different hills like you try to control the nodes for as long

31:56.200 --> 32:02.560
as you can but here's the thing because there's no factions in 14 you know world of warcraft

32:02.560 --> 32:08.420
has horde versus alliance star wars the old republic has you know the force and you know

32:08.420 --> 32:13.060
the dark side and all that you know it has all the most games they don't do it like they

32:13.060 --> 32:18.060
did in 11 where it's the starting you well there is that but keep in mind that in final

32:18.060 --> 32:22.660
fantasy 14 that doesn't mean like usually in games you can't talk to people on the other

32:22.660 --> 32:26.260
faction you can't party with them you can't work with them but in final fantasy 11 and

32:26.260 --> 32:32.360
final fantasy 14 you can you do pledge allegiance to a nation um but you you aren't like like

32:32.360 --> 32:36.380
bound to them for all your interactions and things you can still do things with other

32:36.380 --> 32:41.540
people but it does sound like in this battlegrounds it is gonna be representing the nation they

32:41.540 --> 32:45.780
haven't really said yet if you can rally for another nation or how you're gonna play with

32:45.780 --> 32:49.100
your friends i guess we'll know more about that on tuesday when the patch hits but it's

32:49.100 --> 32:57.260
going to be 24 versus 24 versus 24 72 player battlegrounds it's gonna be a cluster fuck

32:57.260 --> 33:03.020
i can't wait i'm surprised you haven't tried to put was it ballista in there i don't even

33:03.020 --> 33:06.140
remember what the point of that was ballista was the whole thing where you were trying

33:06.900 --> 33:10.820
when you would kill things you'd get the rooks or something you get the the feathers that you

33:10.820 --> 33:15.340
throw at the roof i don't know it's weird anyway uh okay enough mmos because there's been other

33:15.340 --> 33:19.780
stuff as well um okay so steam had a big sale this weekend i'm not talking about the summer

33:19.780 --> 33:23.580
sale man i know that was a big deal but this weekend i'm supposing in the honor of fourth

33:23.580 --> 33:27.620
of july which by the way i hope you all had a happy fourth uh in the honor of fourth of july

33:27.620 --> 33:34.900
they had duke nukem 3d the remake on sale for like 250 so i was like sold i gotta get this so

33:34.980 --> 33:40.420
i played some duke nukem 3d i was playing through the first um and it's it they did they redid the

33:40.420 --> 33:45.660
textures and it's so it's a little more hd but it still has that look and you can play the classic

33:45.660 --> 33:49.220
like if you don't want to play the new one you can play the classic but i think the new one retains

33:49.220 --> 33:55.740
that feel of the classic but yet you know works right and widescreen looks a little sharper and

33:55.740 --> 34:00.180
on my computer which you guys know i upgraded my computer like four months ago blazing frames a

34:00.180 --> 34:09.180
second boy i love it so it's just fast fast fast so much fun i need the um they need to get it so

34:09.180 --> 34:14.620
i have somebody to play more i do have it i have it already we've got to set up a multiplayer night

34:14.620 --> 34:18.780
because i i got it for the whole reason i got it is because they're saying that eventually they

34:18.780 --> 34:24.500
were gonna have multiplayer there and then they added it yeah so i do have it in fact i'm checking

34:24.500 --> 34:29.140
right now just to make sure um this has got to happen because i i want to play multiplayer so

34:29.140 --> 34:36.100
bad and like i could play with strangers and the lobbies and stuff but um it's been a long time

34:36.100 --> 34:40.820
i haven't played since high school that was my that was my college that was freshman year in

34:40.820 --> 34:47.780
college in the dorms that was my game like i used to i used to build the crap out of those um let's

34:47.780 --> 34:52.860
see duke nukem forever duke nukem 3d megaton edition so yes i do have that all right awesome

34:52.860 --> 34:56.820
and then now one other game i'll give a quick shout out to is an iphone game believe it or not

34:57.140 --> 35:02.260
but uh you know these guys nimblebit they make a lot of the really addicting iphone games like

35:02.260 --> 35:08.820
tiny tower and oh god what else did they make the um uh airplane the pocket planes is that what it

35:08.820 --> 35:15.300
is so they have a new one out it's called disco zoo oh my god and uh this is something one of my

35:15.300 --> 35:20.740
friends was visiting this weekend and and she told me you've got to check out disco zoo and so i i

35:20.740 --> 35:26.100
downloaded and checked it out and it's got you know unfortunately it has all the tropes of your

35:26.100 --> 35:32.180
classic free to play iphone game like you try to find the hidden animals in a little puzzle

35:32.180 --> 35:36.980
so like you have like 10 clicks in the puzzle to find the animals but let's say you don't totally

35:36.980 --> 35:41.700
reveal the animal you get like three fourths of it a little thing will come up and say if you want

35:41.700 --> 35:47.460
five more guesses you can either pay the one real world dollar or you can watch a quick video for

35:47.460 --> 35:52.820
15 seconds and i'm just like ah but the game itself is really addicting and it has all that

35:52.820 --> 35:58.260
cute stuff or like the you know the art style is very you know retro and the little people in the

35:58.260 --> 36:02.660
zoo say things that are really funny if you look out for them like a bunch of memes everywhere

36:02.660 --> 36:08.980
like in the pig pig exhibit there's a little guy that'll say that'll do pig and let's be honest

36:08.980 --> 36:17.220
here you know given that's yeah i understand it's monetization but that's not so bad 15 seconds of

36:17.220 --> 36:21.380
my time it is i i hit the button and i put the phone down and go do something else real quick

36:21.380 --> 36:27.380
and then come back and yeah that's that's doable yeah it's it's totally doable so you know a nimble

36:27.380 --> 36:32.100
bit does a really interesting job of kind of walking the line there on the it is free so i

36:32.100 --> 36:38.340
mean you know whatever it is um but you know it's so easy to spend 99 cents to get your disco bucks

36:38.340 --> 36:43.700
so so why is it called disco zoo this is the most so the big trick you know how in tiny tower you

36:43.700 --> 36:49.940
have to like restock your stores so in the zoo you have to wake up your animals so you like your

36:49.940 --> 36:53.940
animals will be awake for 20 minutes or whatever then you have to go wake them up but if you want

36:53.940 --> 37:00.020
to get them to stay awake you can spend your disco dollar to throw a disco party and the disco party

37:00.020 --> 37:05.700
will keep them awake and then of course it plays this really stupid eight-bit retro disco music

37:05.700 --> 37:11.460
but then all the lights light up and if you have like uh trophies in your uh zoo pen or whatever

37:11.460 --> 37:17.940
they'll light up and use all the animals start dancing it's really ridiculous but like who

37:17.940 --> 37:25.380
doesn't love the idea of a disco zoo hello so anyway who doesn't like it rob the animals

37:26.420 --> 37:32.340
let the cows sleep oh oh i can't i and that's the best part i can't wait for peta's response

37:34.500 --> 37:39.060
i will say though you know it's the game does have like unicorns and shit in it that you can

37:39.060 --> 37:44.340
have your zoo so you know there's is the unicorn shit rainbow i haven't checked yet but the

37:44.340 --> 37:52.500
unicorns can wear fezzes you can get your animals i guess anyway all right look i'm gonna stop

37:52.500 --> 37:56.580
pimping a game that they're not paying me to promote i just will say as far as mobile phone

37:56.580 --> 38:00.900
games goes nimblebit tends to put out pretty quality stuff and this is just another one in

38:00.900 --> 38:06.660
their little uh archive but beware of the temptation of monetization uh because that is

38:06.660 --> 38:13.860
what it is all about right all right uh that's it for my gaming week let's do uh quick housekeeping

38:13.860 --> 38:18.740
and then we'll get to the news tonight housekeeping very important update there will be no live orange

38:18.740 --> 38:24.500
lounge radio next week we will not be here live in seven days very sorry guys but as you probably

38:24.500 --> 38:30.980
heard uh dark sakura and i will be on our way back from san francisco and gamer x we will be

38:30.980 --> 38:35.860

way but anyway uh dark stalker and i will be there um friday saturday sunday and uh if you would like

38:55.460 --> 39:02.340

39:02.340 --> 39:08.500
i realize we're up against the bio wear guy and uh uh i'm gonna butcher her name because i don't

39:08.500 --> 39:13.540
have it memorized but she does all the videos um the very um the ones that make you think anita

39:13.540 --> 39:19.620
sarkeesian is that her name yeah the tropes versus women yes yes yes she her panels at the same time

39:19.620 --> 39:24.340
so i will hope though that you will strongly consider uh visiting us we'll be one of the

39:24.340 --> 39:33.060
little smaller side rooms podcast cross zone uh ourselves uh game bar uh game buoy dot org

39:33.060 --> 39:38.260
koopa club a horde house um i always feel like i'm leaving somebody out in this segment

39:38.260 --> 39:42.500
a video game realness is there in spirit sadly they couldn't send anybody from canada

39:42.500 --> 39:47.460
uh to come to the show uh but yeah we will all god why i always have the sinking feeling i'm

39:47.460 --> 39:52.660
leaving somebody out i i am i apologize because i'm doing this off spur of the moment but um

39:53.460 --> 39:58.020
we will all be there uh and uh talking about podcasting so if you want to come say hi and

39:58.020 --> 40:02.420
learn a little bit about the art of podcasting how we do it the tech end of things uh come say

40:02.420 --> 40:09.780
hi saturday at two o'clock if you're not able to come to gamer x um look for the uh archive of the

40:09.780 --> 40:14.580
panel i'm sure will be on some of the feeds of the shows i just mentioned uh it'll also be up on

40:14.580 --> 40:23.300
youtube eventually if last year is any indication so uh wait for that um also uh i should speaking

40:23.300 --> 40:29.700
of panels and the like uh dragon con 2014 is happening uh and vog will have another panel

40:30.340 --> 40:35.460
tentatively monday morning is uh when the vog panel will be uh more information to come on

40:35.460 --> 40:40.580
that later but uh uh bobby and i making at least the two of us making appearances on a couple other

40:40.580 --> 40:46.340
panels throughout the show i know travis donovan is going i believe john from critical myths said

40:46.340 --> 40:51.700
he's going and i know some of his co-hosts also go to the show uh i think this is the year the

40:51.700 --> 40:55.540
guys from British invaders make it out too so there'll be quite a representation from the voice

40:55.540 --> 41:01.460
geez network at dragon con this year um so we will definitely think of a meetup something

41:01.460 --> 41:05.140
something especially if some of you guys are going to be there in atlanta over labor day weekend so

41:05.140 --> 41:10.260
a couple chances to catch us at various conventions um but sadly that means no olr this weekend and no

41:10.260 --> 41:16.900
olr labor day weekend because you know conventions will uh take precedence uh on the podcast feed we

41:16.900 --> 41:22.100
may or may not have something i would hope that maybe we can tape a little something something at

41:22.100 --> 41:28.260
gamer x with maybe some of our friends so you may see something on the feed uh a little later

41:28.260 --> 41:32.580
than usual i just hate to go a whole week without content on the feed i know it happens sometimes

41:32.580 --> 41:36.740
though but i know some of your monday morning listeners really rely on us to get you through

41:36.740 --> 41:40.340
your work day or your commute so we're gonna we're gonna try and have something for you even if the

41:40.340 --> 41:45.940
best of but uh please forgive us if we do take the week off completely use the opportunity to visit

41:45.940 --> 41:50.740
another fantastic independent podcast um because you know all these indie producers they work hard

41:50.740 --> 41:56.820
at what they do so if you can't listen to us this next week listen to somebody else uh that uh that

41:56.820 --> 42:03.300
loves to uh do this for free every week all right um let's get into some gaming news shall we

42:03.940 --> 42:08.020
it's that time loki start us off all right let's uh let's talk a little bit about

42:08.740 --> 42:16.340
um this is kind of interesting now we talked about this before lindsay lohan and had some

42:16.340 --> 42:20.980
issues with certain characters or a certain character in grand theft five she thought hey

42:20.980 --> 42:27.540
it's based off me i mean the character lazy jones is kind of i wouldn't say it's based exactly on

42:27.540 --> 42:34.260
lindsay lohan but it's like you know the typical hollywood you know actress that's kind of

42:35.220 --> 42:39.860
falling off the deep end you know getting into drugs and all the scandals and that kind of stuff

42:39.860 --> 42:44.260
but now she's taking it further besides saying that this character is based off her she's

42:44.260 --> 42:52.500
actually suing rockstar games saying that this character is you know basically just a complete

42:52.500 --> 42:59.460
rip off of you know her personality her persona and she feels that she should be compensated for

42:59.460 --> 43:07.700
it which it's parody stupid so i don't think she's gonna get any money but hey it's free advertising

43:07.700 --> 43:13.220
there's a lot of people like uh this story by the way so here's a fun fact about me i bet you

43:13.220 --> 43:20.340
would never guess i listen to conservative talk radio i do i do i i like to listen to how the

43:20.340 --> 43:25.060
other side thinks that's kind of like you know i'm all about educating and listening to all

43:25.060 --> 43:28.740
different angles right so and in this town there's really no other choice if you're going to listen

43:28.740 --> 43:33.060
to talk radio on the drive to work if you want to hear how the traffic's going to be the reason why

43:33.060 --> 43:38.500
i bring that up they do the news while i'm on my way to work you know all morning long this came up

43:38.500 --> 43:43.540
on the drive to work and on the drive home they mentioned it that lindsey low hand was suing

43:43.540 --> 43:49.140
grand theft auto 5 and i was just like okay so if this you know radio station is talking about it

43:49.140 --> 43:55.460
then everybody's talking about this well she's basically saying okay that you know the character

43:55.460 --> 44:02.900
in the game uh depicts her voice image and person personal style also that you know it's an in-game

44:02.900 --> 44:08.500
they have an in-game spoof of the chateau mamont in west hollywood i guess where she lived for

44:08.500 --> 44:14.260
several months and basically saying that lacy jones is a reference to low hand and the suit

44:14.260 --> 44:18.820
claiming you know they want unspecified damages more like that they know that the game you know

44:18.820 --> 44:25.620
made a billion dollars yeah 11 billion dollars they want some of that money it's good luck i

44:25.620 --> 44:32.580
mean but i i just don't see how um you know they didn't call her lindsey low hand she doesn't look

44:32.580 --> 44:38.820
like lindsey low hand it's just i don't know it good luck i just don't think that they're gonna

44:38.820 --> 44:44.260
win i mean better people have tried guys you don't our chat room over at live.vog network.com says i

44:44.260 --> 44:49.060
thought you could parody a person as long as you don't use their real or show name and complete

44:49.060 --> 44:54.980
likeness well even in some cases though you can like remember in uh mba jam uh way back in the

44:54.980 --> 44:59.300
day you had the codes where you could unlock like political figures in the game but i believe i

44:59.300 --> 45:02.820
believe it's different when it comes to political parody and things like that like i think you can

45:02.820 --> 45:08.980
use likeness and so forth but i'm just saying like the whole parody of real people is certainly not

45:08.980 --> 45:14.180
new to video games it's in the same stuff happens on tv shows where you know you have like you know

45:14.180 --> 45:18.660
your criminal you know dramas and stuff like that like law and order and stuff they'll parody

45:18.660 --> 45:24.980
news um you know events and stuff like that to come up with their plot lines for certain shows

45:24.980 --> 45:29.460
and you know the characters you'll see oh okay that that's supposed to be like a michael jackson

45:29.460 --> 45:34.740
type character or oh that's supposed to be you know this type of person but it's not really them

45:34.740 --> 45:39.940
it's different in this it's a similar scenario so you kind of catch the reference but it's not

45:40.980 --> 45:47.220
it's not like directly saying you know oh this is lindsey this is uh minzy mohan and you know

45:47.860 --> 45:54.500
uh you know it's not that you know direct i guess do you know what this reminds me of do you remember

45:54.580 --> 45:58.500
a few years ago and i know we brought this up on olr because we were talking exclusively about

45:58.500 --> 46:03.300
music games for a while but do you remember when the uh lead singer of delight the band that did

46:03.300 --> 46:08.020
grooves in the heart like the epic 90s dance anthem right remember lady miscure who fronted

46:08.020 --> 46:15.060
that band she sued sega for space channel five because of ullala's likeness to her or whatever

46:15.060 --> 46:19.460
it was but there it was a little more rooted i don't know why like my mind goes to that but i

46:19.460 --> 46:24.260
believe they settled i think she did get money out of that like i don't think they approached

46:24.260 --> 46:28.980
her first for the role yeah that was that was the big difference too is that sega had actually

46:28.980 --> 46:34.020
gone to her but i don't they obviously they approached lindsey lohan for anything and i

46:34.660 --> 46:42.500
i just don't see to see them doing anything that she's not gonna get any money no but but yet now

46:42.500 --> 46:48.260
every talk radio and you know buzz station in america is talking about lindsey lohan again it's

46:48.260 --> 46:52.980
great it's great publicity since they have you know with the pc and uh you know ps4 xbox one

46:52.980 --> 46:58.580
versions coming out i knew okay i knew he would show up the minute i invoked her name because

46:58.580 --> 47:04.820
my partner alan huge fan of lady miscure right yes so what do you i know you got to say something

47:04.820 --> 47:09.220
on this what happened set me straight the thing that gave miss lady cure the edge is that sega

47:09.220 --> 47:12.580
had approached her about making a game and they pitched the game to her and she turned it down

47:12.580 --> 47:19.140
and they made the game anyway so they talked to her like she had receipts to be fair jamie brought

47:19.140 --> 47:22.660
that point up but you might not have heard it before you stormed in here yeah i'm sorry

47:22.660 --> 47:31.780
it's the feed delay that's all right but yet you you still used to do you think that ullala was

47:31.780 --> 47:36.580
i mean knowing because i think most people look at lady miscure and go you know they don't really

47:36.580 --> 47:40.660
know her because they only know her from the one song but you followed her a little more in that

47:40.660 --> 47:47.940
era uh so do you think that she had a point like was ullala a lot like her so all i'm gonna say

47:47.940 --> 47:53.700
is that i imported that game from japan the week it came out for my modded dreamcast and i think

47:53.700 --> 47:59.780
it was egm or one of the big gaming mags at the time that showed a preview of it of coming out

47:59.780 --> 48:07.220
in on the dreamcast in japan and this this was what 90 99 2000 so ign looked like a really nice

48:07.220 --> 48:11.860
geo city site there was the internet wasn't what it was and you couldn't like stream gameplay

48:11.860 --> 48:18.020
videos and all that when i saw that game i was like they made a delight game that's lady

48:18.020 --> 48:22.660
miscare without any i had no idea about that sega approached her i i just thought this was this

48:22.660 --> 48:27.060
random thing that they put out i got that game because i thought it was a lady miscare game i'm

48:27.060 --> 48:31.540
not even kidding that is so funny because i remember when this story came up on olr

48:31.540 --> 48:36.500
five years ago or whenever it was that she sued we all looked at looked at it and went this bitch

48:36.500 --> 48:41.060
crazy she don't have a case but yet we didn't know at that time that angle that that sega had

48:41.060 --> 48:45.860
actually approached her or whatever you know and so so it ended up that they did have a point so

48:45.860 --> 48:51.140
the the fact that it was a music game and i was really into para and all that and the whole 60s

48:51.140 --> 48:58.900
mod sort of laughing gogo dancer futuristic um that style looked really interesting but when i

48:58.900 --> 49:03.940
saw the character and how she danced i was like that this is delight the video game this is a

49:03.940 --> 49:09.380
groove groove is in the heart video or music video the video game and that was just something that i

49:09.380 --> 49:16.660
came up with from looking at the magazine footage there was ironic that yet in despite that lawsuit

49:16.660 --> 49:21.780
then michael jackson really did turn up in space channel 5 part 2 space michael because he loves

49:21.780 --> 49:25.780
sega he had a relationship with sega with sonic 3 the music but he just took his name off of it

49:25.780 --> 49:30.980
because he didn't like how the synth sounded yeah yeah uh really quick before you go um what do you

49:30.980 --> 49:34.740
think you know that this all being said revisiting the hot stories from five years ago what do you

49:34.740 --> 49:39.540
think of this whole lindsay lohan versus grand theft auto 5 thing i know that she hasn't been

49:39.540 --> 49:44.900
able to work much in hollywood because she's uninsurable and apparently she's been clean for

49:44.900 --> 49:50.020
a couple years like one or two years i think well but even in our chat room live.vogniteware.com

49:50.020 --> 49:55.300
nemesis 47 saying lindsay's show on oprah canceled because she couldn't stay away from the booze or

49:55.300 --> 50:01.380
the drugs yeah i heard that the reality show was rough so she okay i was gonna say that being the

50:01.460 --> 50:05.860
overly litigants to try to get money for the work that you're not getting because you're

50:06.580 --> 50:10.100
an addict is something that an addict would do and i would think that if she

50:10.100 --> 50:16.100
was clean and had good people around her they would maybe say um maybe you shouldn't do this

50:16.100 --> 50:20.260
but the fact that she's suing is a weird sign because i think if you go back her and her mom

50:20.260 --> 50:24.260
used to try to sue everybody because they needed money she's broke because she can't she can't work

50:24.980 --> 50:31.620
so it's unfortunate if that's what happened all right well thanks for storming in here bye hey

50:31.620 --> 50:35.860
wait wait before you run any any other thoughts for the listeners excited for gamer acts next

50:35.860 --> 50:41.300
week anything you wanna say no just excited for the con and take lots of pictures i don't have a

50:41.300 --> 50:44.740
3ds so i don't know what i'm gonna do in the lobby when we're waiting for people because everyone's

50:44.740 --> 50:49.540
everyone's doing street passing and on their 3ds maybe you can borrow shane's yeah try to borrow

50:49.540 --> 50:56.180
one of shane's there you go that works all right thank you alan for jumping in appreciate it uh

50:56.180 --> 51:01.540
go to our chat i'm over at live dot vog network dot com uh kai judo says ullala looks nothing like

51:01.540 --> 51:06.820
delight uh delight didn't invent the dance every e trip and chick was doing those dances back then

51:06.820 --> 51:11.620
keep in mind though a big difference between delight the band and uh lady miss cure who

51:11.620 --> 51:15.620
fronted it some of the members of delight went on to do other things too from what i recall like

51:15.620 --> 51:20.820
tawa tay was one of the members of delight and he he does like or at least he did in the late 90s

51:20.820 --> 51:26.100
early 2000s like he remixed every big pop song had like a tawa tay remix so i know uh i know that was

51:26.100 --> 51:30.420
part of it uh dungeon buster says when the lawsuit broke i still didn't see her in the game and fifth

51:30.420 --> 51:34.980
dream says i thought of her when i saw ullala long ago before i ever knew about a lawsuit very

51:34.980 --> 51:39.780
interesting how some people see it some people don't and i guess to bring it back to current news

51:39.780 --> 51:43.540
the same could be said about this whole lindsey lohan thing some people see it but they didn't

51:43.540 --> 51:49.060
i don't think they approached her about anything i mean no because clearly parody yeah so good luck

51:49.060 --> 51:54.820
well and grand theft auto kind of does a lot of parody the whole thing is parody yeah yeah i just

51:56.580 --> 52:02.500
she's just great it's it's just a you know an attempt to get money and here we are she's she

52:02.500 --> 52:07.620
knows she doesn't have a case she's hoping for a settlement all right lindsey you're just never

52:07.620 --> 52:15.140
gonna be better than mean girls and it makes me so sad you know who will ensure probably for work

52:15.140 --> 52:25.540
the porn industry anyway all right uh let's move on with some more news oops except i was very

52:25.540 --> 52:30.340
ill-prepared and i don't have my story up jamie can we go to your story next sorry yeah there was

52:30.340 --> 52:38.660
some um i would like to say that this is a a good turnaround i was very happy with this but there

52:38.660 --> 52:44.500
was something going on with the iesf the international e-sports foundation or sorry federation where

52:44.500 --> 52:50.180
there was a hearthstone tournament that they were going to have um be male only there was and they

52:50.180 --> 52:55.460
had male only and female only divisions but there hadn't had anything planned for the female only and

52:55.460 --> 53:01.060
weren't going to include anything for the male only they have sensed um and i know that everybody

53:01.060 --> 53:06.340
knows about this bobby talked about it it's been all over the the facebooks and the the medias of

53:06.340 --> 53:13.860
socialness but they've turned around this decision and are having an all-inclusive uh a division and

53:13.860 --> 53:21.460
a women's division so basically um it's open for all they're going to be letting uh anyone of any

53:21.460 --> 53:26.900
gender participate in the hearthstone competition and it sounds like anything uh going forward

53:28.900 --> 53:34.820
i had remembered seeing something about that they were maintaining it as male only so that

53:36.180 --> 53:41.140
and this i don't know if this was something just from one of the feminist forums i read or what

53:41.700 --> 53:46.100
but that they didn't want a conflict when a man got defeated by a woman

53:46.100 --> 53:55.060
and i'm like dude suck it up she's better than you deal with it i'm not saying this excuses it

53:55.060 --> 54:00.580
but could it possibly explain it dark sakura because when i first saw this story i was like

54:00.580 --> 54:05.540
this is a cultural thing right there's there's there's you know because obviously feminism

54:05.540 --> 54:10.500
although we we have a way to go in this country we're still more progressed than a lot of other

54:10.500 --> 54:14.580
places and so when i first saw this article i thought maybe cultural differences were coming

54:14.580 --> 54:19.060
into play do you think that that was part of it it doesn't really matter misogyny is misogyny well

54:19.060 --> 54:26.020
no no i understand that but i mean it's also kind of i don't know like uh how do i word this

54:26.660 --> 54:33.940
it might be really hard to tell an entire country to change their culture overnight even though we

54:33.940 --> 54:40.820
all look at it and we say this needs to happen the reality is change doesn't happen overnight

54:40.820 --> 54:45.540
change doesn't happen overnight unfortunately so then what about the olympics in russia

54:47.220 --> 54:53.380
were they supposed to make everybody adhere to strict uh you know cisgender

54:54.500 --> 54:57.620
you know heterosexual relationships in public

55:00.340 --> 55:04.260
were they supposed to enforce that on everybody else again it's very important i'm not saying

55:04.260 --> 55:10.100
i support their culture i think this is silly that's how i'm equating it yeah you know okay

55:10.100 --> 55:16.260
you have an international event you're supposed to accommodate all cultures yeah and the biggest

55:16.260 --> 55:23.380
thing is basically being inclusive for everybody especially since they were like oh well we we

55:23.380 --> 55:29.860
support this we you know we support women in games we need more than act like it you know

55:30.580 --> 55:35.060
screw those guys i don't care if they you know me this is me saying this on a personal level

55:35.620 --> 55:42.100
okay so what if a guy loses to a woman boo freaking who yeah no i agree with that women are

55:42.100 --> 55:47.220
better than some you know it doesn't even matter it's not all women are better than this than guys

55:47.220 --> 55:52.180
or all guys are better than women this it's some women are better the thing that i had a hard time

55:52.180 --> 55:55.940
wrapping my head around and it's just again and again it kind of made me go is this like a cultural

55:55.940 --> 56:02.180
thing i don't get or whatever is that they had this separate contest for women in like like only

56:02.180 --> 56:06.500
women were able to do the tech and tag tournament contest and like that even wasn't something that

56:06.500 --> 56:11.460
was open to men and i thought that was weird because i was just like well but it that's a

56:11.460 --> 56:16.420
fighting game and this is a fighting game why does it have to be i mean it just it didn't make

56:16.420 --> 56:21.140
any sense to me and i was like is there like a cultural thing where women play more tekken than

56:21.140 --> 56:31.380
guys and i'm like totally missing it i i think that for um some some cases having the the

56:31.380 --> 56:37.220
women's division and this is what my thought was with this that it was more like throwing a bone

56:37.220 --> 56:42.980
you know basically oh here's something to keep you quiet because i mean how many different male

56:42.980 --> 56:49.540
dominated fighting game tournaments have there been across the world as opposed you know how

56:49.540 --> 56:57.220
many women show up to some of these events and report on being harassed yeah or you know flat out

56:57.220 --> 57:06.020
being um assaulted at some of these events what can we understanding that it's going to be very

57:06.020 --> 57:10.500
difficult to make something change overnight because a lot of rights issues unfortunately

57:10.500 --> 57:17.940
take generations to change i mean like look begins at home it okay so excellent where we're how do we

57:17.940 --> 57:25.460
how do we fix this how do we stop this crap where i mean i i think it is ridiculous that women get

57:25.460 --> 57:30.740
harassed at these things and there needs to be more of a social check and balance where there

57:30.740 --> 57:36.020
needs to be more guys out there that are willing to step up and say hey not okay to like another

57:36.020 --> 57:40.740
guy because guys do this usually to impress other guys at least that was always a feeling i get

57:40.740 --> 57:44.580
growing up when i'm being bullied or whatever is that people would bully me because they're trying

57:44.580 --> 57:50.420
to impress their friends well it's also the infliction of of particular gender roles and

57:50.420 --> 57:57.060
gender behaviors on people that you know if a guy shows weakness or you know any type of emotional

57:57.060 --> 58:03.780
vulnerability then he's you know a quote a sissy or there's something wrong with him for you know

58:03.780 --> 58:10.580
being having emotions for being human right or that if a guy doesn't you know pursue you know

58:10.580 --> 58:17.860
pursue and get the woman that there's something wrong with him you know meanwhile women are taught

58:17.860 --> 58:22.660
you know from a young age if you get a compliment you don't say thank you you go oh no no no you're

58:22.660 --> 58:27.220
you're supposed to dismiss it like you're not worthy or that you've been given a great favor

58:27.220 --> 58:34.340
by some person thinking that you're pretty you know forget that you know i might be a great

58:34.340 --> 58:42.740
writer or that i have all these skills no it's pretty i don't want someone i would rather be

58:42.740 --> 58:49.780
called smart and thoughtful than be told i'm pretty i would rather be told i'm strong or that

58:49.780 --> 58:55.620
i can go to the gym and lift weights in the guys section and not be a novelty then be told i'm

58:55.620 --> 59:04.900
pretty you know i think you're pretty pretty awesome thank you i know thanks but i mean the

59:04.900 --> 59:12.660
same thing is that the the and and i mean this is yeah i'm going outside of the whole uh you know

59:12.660 --> 59:20.820
video game tournament thing you soapboxing on this show never what go for it but i mean i think that

59:21.140 --> 59:26.900
the tournament's just a symptom the the fact well yeah i mean that's why i was saying it was

59:26.900 --> 59:31.380
this is this is something this is a bigger cultural issue the fact that the press had

59:31.380 --> 59:35.780
to check them on this to get them to change their mind is what was sad it shouldn't have

59:35.780 --> 59:41.620
been an issue to begin with it should have not even occurred to them that they would have

59:41.620 --> 59:48.660
anything that was un-inclusive but again i mean i i hate to harp on this but again that is is that

59:48.660 --> 59:53.060
a finland way of life versus i don't know i don't live in finland i don't

59:53.060 --> 01:00:00.020
no i'm not i'm not saying it's okay but it is interesting how you know this cultural thing over

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:06.340
here goes viral over here and blizzard has to step in and be the ones that fixes it which i

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:10.340
will say in this situation i think blizzard deserves the kudos because they're the ones

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.940
that put their foot down and said hey i don't care who you are or where you're from if you're

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:19.220
gonna use our game this is not okay well like i was saying before i don't think it really matters

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:24.500
so much that it's finland that the decision was coming out of finland i think it's if you know

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:31.540
you have an international community you go by international standards meaning you be inclusive

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:38.660
you don't do things that are gonna offend the people that you are hosting okay i have to play

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.340
devil's advocate here though just just just to be fair because when we talk about international

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:45.940
you brought up the olympics earlier and doesn't the olympics separate every sport in men's and

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:56.340
women's not every i think i think that they're i mean there are they there's definitely some that

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:04.020
are co-op but i think that they um there was some drama coming up about that because i honestly

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:10.340
i believe that if you're gonna segregate those it should be by like weight class

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:17.860
yeah i i mean i kind of get the separation a little more when it's i don't know it's

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:22.660
it's a tough issue because like i kind of get it from a like olympic sport style standpoint

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:28.100
because it's just the fact of the matter is men are statistically going to be this average women

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:33.380
are statistically going to be this average so i from a physical but hearthstone is overthinking

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.860
this is hearthstone yeah exactly hearthstone isn't that that's my point at the end of the day

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:42.660
hearthstone and esports in general are not physical competitions in those way and you

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.540
could argue me and say oh but it's physical because the hand-eye coordination or it's

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:52.980
physical okay whatever so what if some guy gets butt hurt i don't care it's not physical in the

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:58.660
way that you know agility average or weight average but but you know you're also right

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:05.540
there's that there's a lot of women built like men a lot of men look like women here's one of

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:11.060
my examples and i know this is stupid but look back to wrestling in the 90s when you had china

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.820
did she wrestle in the women's category no she wrestled with the men because she was built like

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:23.300
one of the guys i mean she did take testosterone for a while for weightlifting i mean she well i

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:30.340
mean not testosterone she was taking just the the anabolic steroids but still um i know that's

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:34.420
a dumb example but that's one of them but you know and at the same time with me saying that

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:39.620
i don't care if you know some guy gets butt hurt if a girl beats him on the same token i think that

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:43.300
if a girl is beaten by a guy she needs to be gracious and just acknowledge that he beat her

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.940
fair and square has nothing to do with their gender uh bobby blackwolf in our chatter live

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.660
dog network com says there are some mixed competitions pairs figure skating for instance

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:57.540
uh and there are mixed doubles tennis but i can't think of where you have just a man competing

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:03.780
against just a woman in the olympics uh ballroom dancing was once an olympic event too a test event

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.500
that never went anywhere well you know and i don't i think on our our little podcast we're not

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:12.500
going to be able to solve this issue very easily this is something that you know this is obviously

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:19.380
a much bigger issue but i think this is something that is going to be a generation as we shift into

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.980
another you know this this generation where you have a lot of like moms and dads like you know

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:30.180
folks like loki right raising his kids loki was raised on video games and so that's going to be

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:35.460
a part of the culture that he hands down to his kids and what i mean with that is that e-sports

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:41.140
as it becomes more and more mainstream that's going to become a part of culture too and i think

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:46.740
as these stuff mature as these things get more social acceptance then i think a lot more of these

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:52.580
bigger difficult questions are going to have to be tackled as to why do we separate these genders

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.340
should we separate these genders is this a good idea my other thought is that i

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:02.580
in the realm of public sports like actual physical sports i would still like to see things divided by

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:10.260
weight class or by ability class or by a particular level like that because and um because not only do

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:16.260
you have the genders that people are born with but you have people sure who are transgender sure

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:24.020
meaning or even identify as gender neutral or true or z or and and this is going to be kind

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:29.540
of touchy for me to say it this way but there are still physical there are physical difference

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:35.300
differences in the type of muscle that women and men build i'm studying this learning anatomy and

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:41.620
my own weightlifting right and even if you have a trans woman she's still going to have some of the

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:47.860
the male musculature physically i'm just talking physically only right you know so that in and of

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:53.060
itself where you have someone identifying as a woman she's going to be eligible to go in the

01:04:53.060 --> 01:05:01.300
women except that there's that touchy part of how her body is built so i honestly would like to see

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:07.380
you know in the realm of sports just have the categories completely wiped away like that have

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.220
it all be based on physical ability and the same thing goes with these tournaments like that i'd

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:18.180
like to see it based off of personal ability rather than be some boys club all right well to

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:24.100
be continued um yeah again not not an easy topic that uh society is going to solve uh with just

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:28.260
this i i think this is something that's going to continue but i will say kudos to blizzard

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:32.260
for kind of going okay when it comes to and i hope you all know that sometimes i just want to present

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:38.260
devil's advocate opinion on this show i i do feel that uh you know blizzard stepping in and saying

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:43.780
who cares if you are a guy or a girl it is all the same it's all even when it comes to hearthstone i

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:48.740
think that was a great great thing um and i also you know what else i think is also a great thing

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:55.540
that pretty much everybody i saw on twitter in response like you know people that regularly speak

01:05:55.540 --> 01:06:00.020
up on feminist issues and people that don't it seems like everybody out there on twitter was

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:05.380
kind of you know of the mindset of this is not right this is not the way it should be and so

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:10.420
maybe the positive at the end of the story is maybe that is a sign that things are getting

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:19.300
better if not at a snail's pace okay anyway let's move on speaking of uh things that are moving

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:24.660
along very very very slowly uh the playstation vita you know a lot of people are wondering if

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:30.500
sony's given up on the playstation vita because they haven't really been pushing any games for it

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.940
they're relying on third parties and thought i heard that they weren't doing any first party

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:39.460
games but then again they have um they do have one game coming out from sony japan later this year

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:46.420
but that's it well uh here's the thing uh sony in a recent interview said that uh there's uh

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:50.500
the new slimmed down model of the playstation vita of course you know we've heard about that

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:56.100
especially over in japan and so forth um it has spurred quote strong interest among gamers and

01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.740
that there will be more stock coming quote to ensure continued momentum leading into the

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:06.020
holidays um the numbers for the playstation vita they've noted have been picking up towards the

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:11.620
play or as the playstation 4 is launched but we haven't seen the exact numbers for the playstation

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:17.380
vita in some time right now the vita is unable to be purchased from sony at least as far as i'm

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.060
concerned do you think that company do you think that could be because they're trying to put a lot

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.420
of stock and one thing that isn't mentioned in this interview or in this article or in this

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:30.020
discussion is the fact that there's a momentum shift coming towards this playstation tv which

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:38.260
will be able to handle the vita well um i know right now that it's um they've it's unavailable

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.980
um not i didn't think it was selling that fast in the beginning anyways and even with the redesign

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.580
i don't think that really pushed that many extra systems out there maybe it did but um right now

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:54.580
it's a temporary it's temporarily unavailable to be purchased so whether that means that they're

01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:01.700
allocating those systems to other retailers or that kind of thing but the fact that nobody it

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.540
seems like from when i was reading like a neo gaff and stuff that people aren't finding them at

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:14.100
retail that kind of makes me scratch my head a little bit like why so maybe they are my guess

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:19.620
is that they're scaling down the production on those systems just because they are thinking that

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:24.340
the playstation tv is going to take a bigger chunk out of the market over here maybe and

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:29.940
they don't want to be left with a bunch of extra hardware that they can't sell um maybe that's the

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.820
thought um i don't know i do think though that it might pick up a little bit because i know

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:40.980
was it with uh they just would have they just added support for unity for playstation mobile

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:46.340
so like if i wanted to now i could publish a game to playstation mobile and what's kind of

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:51.540
cool about it is i can actually test it on a retail um a retail system just like i can you

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:57.300
know an android or iphone game all right go to our chat room over at live.vog network.com fifth

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:03.940
dream says i buy more games for vita than anything ionotropic says so many free vita games via

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:09.460
playstation plus had to buy a 64 gigabyte memory card kai judo on the other side says they need

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:15.220
to stop this vita thing it's a waste of their time and money no one is buying that crap well i i

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:19.620
bought that crap but i also bought it based on you know the launch titles and some of the things

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.700
that were out then and it is a little bit disappointing to see sony not really putting

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.980
out a lot of new stuff themselves but you know like the the chatter who said that they do seem

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:34.900
to still support it through playstation plus an awful lot and it is kind of cool that you have

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:40.900
the whole uh streaming through the playstation 4 is is is a pretty neat feature that i do use

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:45.380
i think though that unfortunately that the failure of some of their big temple titles

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:49.940
that they had like the call of duty you know black ops game yeah that was supposed to be fantastic

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:54.660
but then it was done by the same guys that did the resistance game which was not good and then

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:59.060
that game was not good and it's just very underwhelming like if that had like actually

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:04.580
turned out to be a really good game i think that could have really helped you know push the system

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.580
on a side note um i don't have the story in front of me or anything i'm just going kind of going off

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:12.900
of memory but i thought i saw something where ea officially dropped support for vita in this past

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:20.580
week which not true because they have well not exactly they have the legacy version of uh fifa

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:27.700
oh roster update yeah roster update reskin of fifa you know um so that's technically coming but um

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:33.860
yeah they don't have anything coming to um that system and ironically they do have a wii version

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:41.060
of fifa coming as well but um nothing for the wii u uh rama says just price cut the darn vita to 149

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:45.460
and watch it sell like fucking hotcakes that comment live dot vog network.com probably will

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:51.380
well it the playstation tv 99 that's why i'm saying the playstation tv is going to be the

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:57.620
thing that cannibalizes the already very very tiny vita sales it could drop that system down

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:02.260
99 dollars that'd be really interesting to see that happen it would if they could get if they

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.020
could get it under the ds's price but i can't imagine the hardware i mean they'd have to sell

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.100
that thing at a loss i can't imagine the hardware is only 99 bucks to build those things no not with

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.740
that screen on it unless they're well they could consider dropping the touchscreen or something

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:21.300
dropping the touchpad in the back who knows um you know i honestly think the back touchpad thing is

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:27.220
kind of dumb the beginning but i don't know it's just i think it's that screen that's really costing

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:34.020
them all right well let's move on loki all right so amazon is right now fighting against the ftc

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:40.900
because they're trying to get them to restrict um add-on purchases within their mobile apps

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:45.540
so basically what they're trying to do right now which i don't know i'm kind of on the fence with

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.660
both of the stuff like they're trying to require password entry for in-app purchases which i think

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:56.980
i'm okay with um overhaul their refund process to aid parents seeking um you know

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:02.420
recompensation for unwanted purchases made by children okay that i have a problem with

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:09.060
because they should be limiting what they should have a limit of how you know their children

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:14.420
shouldn't be able to access in-app purchases i think the best way around it would be to say

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:20.020
create a second password maybe like a pin like you had for like it you know an atm card or

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.260
something like that where you just have like a four or five digit pin that you enter in

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.540
to authorize those purchases instead of you know having to remember your whole password if you know

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.780
if the whole point is oh well we want to make sure that's streamlined enough so people don't

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:37.860
go oh well i don't want to log in to buy this i don't remember what my password is or something

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.940
and so i'm just not going to do that um and they're thinking that that's going to cut into

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:45.940
sales but at the same time i think parents need to be responsible for their children's purchases

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:52.980
in these games also it should be on amazon and even you know apple or um you know google to

01:12:52.980 --> 01:13:00.340
be policing these games or apps that are on their services that are just blatantly trying to trick

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:05.940
people into making in-app purchases i think that needs to be a little bit more um policed but

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:11.460
i think both they need to kind of meet in the middle a little bit i only i think it's a little

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:17.860
ridiculous to you know make it so that it's easier for them to get uh refunds on the stuff

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:22.180
one it should really be up to the parents i mean we've got to put some responsibility on these

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:27.380
parents here you know that oh well i didn't know my my my children you know were playing with this

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:32.260
and i logged it you know logged in for this well why are you logged in first off for purchases made

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:38.980
on this stuff um it's i don't know it's like if you leave your credit card out and you're you know

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:43.220
kids run up a bill on something like that are you gonna you know call the credit card company

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:48.660
and go well can you give me a refund because i didn't know doing my kids are making purchases

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:56.660
on this stuff i mean i don't know so they're fighting it right now and apparently um they have

01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:04.580
not uh the fcc has not responded to amazon's latest statement which is you know uh that they're

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:14.500
already doing enough i don't know it is a very interesting issue the whole uh kids making these

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:20.260
purchases on the devices and you know as it gets easier and easier to do that you know just touch

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:25.780
here to buy you know there's it's so easy for kids to do that but yeah i mean i believe on the

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.660
iphone you have the whole you have to put your password in again yeah they have they have the

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:34.100
or at least you can enable iphone i think you can enable that and they even said you know when

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.780
customers told us kids have been purchases they didn't want we refunded those purchases

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:43.460
and they're also saying that you know uh they have you know currently implemented a prominent

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:47.940
notice of in-app purchasing effective parental controls and real-time notice of every in-app

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:53.860
purchase and i think if i remember correctly and i'm not sure how amazon's you know stuff is forked

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:59.140
as far as android goes or even i know they have that amazon os or whatever for their phone or fire

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:05.460
os and stuff but they've got you know in google i think they've got support now for multiple user

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:10.820
profiles for these things and i think you can assign stuff to children assign stuff to parents

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:15.700
where you can maybe have it where you know the parents have to authorize those purchases or

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:19.940
even just not give them the option to be able to purchase anything you know what i think they just

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.100
need to do is they need to turn on some of those parental controls by default i think that would

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.540
be the right thing to do is that the whole requiring the password every day that should

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.220
be on by default of course then what happens when the kid finds out your password but

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.940
well that's that's another on top of that also or or the fact that you know

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:40.820
um if what they need to do is they need to override it for free purchases because i know

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:45.860
even still like on um the apple store and stuff you still have to put in your password for free to

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:50.820
download so let's just get rid of that for free purchases that way your kid isn't bothering you

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.540
for stuff i'm laughing because i know how they're going to stop it is because we're talking about

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.860
iphone what did they just put in those newest iphones they have the whole thumbprint sensor

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.140
so it's only going to be a matter of time before it's like okay you want to buy this put your thumb

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:07.860
on the thing and then now a kid is kids not going to be able to do that what do you cut off daddy's

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.820
they they want they want as little little resistance to make those in-app purchases

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:16.660
because i know that this is why the government's pushing back but that's why i'm saying do the you

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:20.820
do the pin do the pin so it's real easy it's just like the security on your phone just put in the

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:25.140
pin and be done with it and then that way you don't have to remember a big long password if

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:29.620
that's what you really want to do have that option in there um because i think they have it

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:33.780
like on the xbox and stuff where you can put a pin in for like parental controls very interesting

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:38.180
comments in our chat room over at live.vog network.com kai judo says i remember in the 80s

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:41.700
we used to call the 900 numbers and run up the phone bill parents would tell the phone company

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:46.980
their kid ran up the bill that sounds like this all over again um s2100 matt says those same

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:51.620
parents complaining are the same people that were once kids that ran up their own parents phone bill

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:56.580
via dial-up gaming and porn phone lines that's a very interesting sort of generational perspective

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:02.740
there that this isn't necessarily a new issue yeah exactly but like when i ran up the phone bill

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:06.500
because i connected to a phone number that happened to be long distance for you know

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.860
prodigy or whatever because i didn't know you know i didn't i didn't know that this was going

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:16.260
to be even though it's within my area code that this is going to be a toll call or whatever

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:20.660
you know that kind of crap because the phone company does weird shit like that um because

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:24.180
i didn't know that my parents didn't go oh we need to call the phone company tell them that

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:28.180
it was my kid connecting we got to get a refund fucking take some responsibility they they took

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:33.300
responsibility and said okay this was your fault because you didn't know this don't do it again

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:37.060
but we still have to pay this and because you know it was our fault that you did

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:44.260
take responsibility for your actions or your kids actions take responsibility yeah oh i know i it's

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:48.100
funny when you brought up prodigy because i i guess it the whole generational thing i did do

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.820
that remember when they used to charge by the minute for chat rooms oh my god one month i ran

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:58.740
up a very big bill and by using like chat rooms or whatever and oh i felt the wrath of my mother

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.900
oh yeah oh yeah and i got restricted from that stuff and it got to the point where like

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:10.820
she would intentionally pick up the phone to screw up my my uh my modem connections if she

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.260
knew i was on the computer when i wasn't supposed to be like on the modem or something she'd just

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:20.980
pick up the phone she knew it would kick me off and leave it off the hook nice

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:28.740
oh boy and uh bobby blackwolf in our chat room live.vognetwork.com similar story i ran up the

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:34.340
bill for quantum link or q link since it was 30 cents a minute or something i ran up a 400

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:42.500
bill one month and it was never on it again very interesting generational shift there all right uh

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:47.700
moving on some unfortunately sad news to follow up those stories but we have news of another

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:54.420
developer closure airtight games unfortunately shutting down their redman office no announcement

01:18:54.420 --> 01:19:00.260
uh the studio just kind of disappeared and uh it disappeared less than a month after their

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:05.940
big game murdered soul suspect had just come out this was confirmed on twitter through tweets from

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:11.940
the company thanking those who quote supported us and made the last 10 years possible that's

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:16.900
never a fun thing to report on i mean luckily redmond is is also the home of you know huge

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:21.540
mother ships for nintendo and microsoft so hopefully those folks can find gameful employment

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:27.220
somewhere else but never fun to report on that i will say though i did not hear a lot about

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:31.540
murdered soul suspect um i've only heard of this like through other people that are like oh yeah

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.620
i wanted to check that out it was okay i just don't think it was what they're expecting it to

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:40.740
be i mean i didn't really have high hopes for it anyways it seemed like kind of a supernatural la

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:48.180
noir um and i just don't know if it was it wasn't that big of a title i think and it just unfortunately

01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:53.860
just didn't you know get the reviews or anything that they're hoping it didn't kind of get the buzz

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:58.740
yeah i think a game really well it's being really marketed too much either so i mean i don't know

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:03.380
maybe the maybe the publisher didn't really uh believe in it i don't know all right well that's

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:11.060
unfortunate uh moving on before we get to uh release dates dark sakura lol lol a lot um

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:18.180
basically uh and i i don't know how many people listening believe any of that crap that displayed

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:24.260
on fox news but there's a show called fox and friends or a segment that has rick perry the

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:31.060
asshole um inviting in this particular segment invited uh president obama to the texas border

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:38.980
to see the uh quote immigration crisis ooh um the banner that they used for this for

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:47.380
defending the homeland looks quite a bit like the bioshock infinite uh you know logo

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:54.020
which is funny because basically isn't the point of bioshock infinite fighting the right wing and

01:20:54.020 --> 01:21:03.700
winning kind of the ultra right wing doesn't it involve that sorta yeah yeah so um basically

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:10.660
ken levine got a wind of this and he said glad to help fox glad to help and then my favorite thing

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:16.020
is it's not the irony of that fox news thing that bothers me so much it's the type setting

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:23.620
it really is bad because that n and d are too close together it's just awful do you think fire

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:28.020
your designer do you think they really like lifted it from a bioshock game or is there

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:36.500
something their designer did yeah yeah i mean we we sample other we we quote other people's work

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:40.420
from time to time and doing it

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:48.820
in this blatant way means their designer is not no especially since the typography is actually

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:55.700
kind of bad um yeah i think that they ran out of ideas um you have uh some comments in the chat

01:21:55.700 --> 01:22:00.900
room there that i think define this a little better uh act f saying with your uh what bioshock

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:07.140
it's all about kind of but not exactly is what i said but the point was comparing it to fox news

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:13.220
alan alchemy makes a great one though here it's mostly a parable about jingoism segregation

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:21.060
nationalism uh is a better way to describe it and eugenics is a huge one so i know i think

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:28.180
i don't know that's not as funny when you say it that way but my point was it was basically

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:34.500
the the worst of conservatism yeah of that era right and fox is the worst of conservative well

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:40.580
not the worst but the uh the the about as far worse as you can get that and still remain public

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:49.220
uh uh what's the word i'm thinking of socially acceptable on air yes all right

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.620
uh loki were you gonna jump in with something real quick i just think that i don't i don't know

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:58.660
if they i'm sure that they don't even know what bioshock infinite is and most likely that they

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:03.140
just probably drew from the same sort and same inspiration that bioshock infinite that's what

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:08.500
i was wondering is that maybe is it it's not fox news it's whoever they hired as their designer i

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:13.940
i can't i could see though jamie's idea of like a rogue granted the banner shape is the same but

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:19.620
it's it's kind of a stretch i mean it's aside from it having kind of the same theme to it it's just

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:24.420
it's not like they you know it's not like the daily show where they they take you know an

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:28.340
actual logo for something they kind of rearrange the words so they like to do really bad photoshop

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:37.380
all right anyway that's that's not how basically the way the way having a designer works is that

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:44.900
the designer said okay wage slave do this so that we'll pay you for something okay you haven't you

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:52.740
have until five minutes to make it ah okay designer presents work can you do it in comic sans

01:23:53.460 --> 01:24:01.860
fuck you fine and some person who has absolutely no idea about what design or good typography is

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:08.580
approves it and it goes on air i want this to look a little more friendly and whimsical maybe uh

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:12.020
there's this font on my computer comic sans have you thought about trying that one

01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:17.700
i would like to print out everything i would like to print out the phone book in comic sans

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.940
turn it into a giant spike and shove it up your ass

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:30.820
hey that's mean and then i'm gonna take papyrus and print the bible in that and shove it up your nose

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:36.100
or maybe just an unabridged dictionary that's a little bit longer

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:43.940
oh oh oh i'm going to lock you in a prison where all the walls are printed in helvetica

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:48.980
i was gonna say if i if i say you will learn what good type looks like if i say three hail

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:57.220
helvetica's will i be forgiven we need three hail helvetica's and a myriad pro all right moving on

01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:02.340
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates okay nemesis wingdings is

01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:09.060
still better than comic sans i kind of love those wingdings but wingdings will never be

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:14.100
as good as the emoji set that is now uh on all the phones and that's ridiculous

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:22.340
it's ridiculous well you don't like emoji no emoji emoji is my favorite way to respond to

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:27.300
facebook posts now because you know extrovert is on this big trip in europe and he keeps tagging

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:32.420
all this like really dumb shit he sees look it's rob on money look it's rob on money and it's like

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:37.140
i don't know like why it's supposed to be funny but i'll just reply with that emoji that just

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:42.420
has like the like look on its face like i hate you so much you know which one i'm talking about

01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:46.900
if you look at all the faces there's one that has like the eyes pointed to the side the you know

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:53.300
the slyly judging you i hate you candy look at that face all right anyway uh let's travel

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:57.220
around the world and check out release dates there's nothing coming out this week what nothing

01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:02.740
coming out this week nothing coming out this week yeah it's absolutely dead not a single thing well

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:07.860
that was a short release date say yeah exactly yeah nothing nothing coming out oh i'm sorry i

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:17.060
take it back there was the uh 3ds uh was it scooby-doo and looney tunes cartoon explosion

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:21.060
or something like that i don't know so basically there's a no one cur coming out it's scooby-doo

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:28.020
and looney tunes worlds combined you know it's like it's like space jam but less jam well now

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:33.780
see and before you said space jam i was gonna say well which of our listeners have actually pre-ordered

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:39.700
that but then you go and say space jam and i'm like oh space jam was a pretty rad movie

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:46.100
come on warner brothers you've got midway now so i mean you could you could technically make

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:53.780
a new nba jam game that's space jam space jam oh my god oh hey hey working on another space jam

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:58.260
they are working on another space jam movie so this could possibly happen it prison happening

01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:04.820
with lebron or something yeah oh man that would be amazing that would be cool michael jordan needs

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:09.300
to make a cameo until we get space jam 2 let's travel over to japan and check out some of the

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:14.020
releases that are coming out over there no space jam 2 to report but we do have on the playstation

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:22.580
3 this week on july the 10th uh sakio shogi geckie sashi 13 comes out this week uh this is some type

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:28.180
of board game series that is on the playstation um i don't know what much more of the game than

01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:33.540
that though you said it was shogi right yeah it's it's a classic game very very classic board game

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:39.060
that would be like strategy kind of like i think it follows a lot of the same principles of go

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:44.260
i would imagine it's kind of like how they release monopoly on every single console and handheld and

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:48.820
everything right it's like classic american board games get released on all that stuff wheel of

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:56.100
fortune too game shows anyhow uh on the xbox 360 this week in japan oh nothing nothing until the

01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:00.260
17th it looks like it's a pretty dry week in japan as well because there's nothing on the weu this

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:08.100
week either uh taking a look at the 3ds though there is some type of special pack a 3ds xl pack

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:14.020
uh it's called the yukai watch edition uh that i think just includes that game and it's a 3d that

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:19.220
has the little character there on it uh for those of you that need to import a japanese 3ds i suppose

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:26.660
there's that uh yukai watch 2 also comes out ganzo and hankei come out in um uh japan this

01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:31.540
week on july the 10th so kind of a slower week in japan as well how about uh how about the uk dark

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:40.420
sakura we actually do have a couple um on the 8th is cubit rebooted for the pc and on the 9th

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:47.620
mousecraft whatever that is is that like mousetrap the amazing board game for me it's on

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:56.900
ps everything i believe it's a puzzle game i believe it's falls in the don't care category

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:06.260
it's like okay compared to tetris and lemmings combined so boring to register participation

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:11.140
for this week's episode of orange andreja at vognetwork.com use the passphrase move all

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:16.340
right just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week but first loki all

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:27.300
right um so i don't know i mean i'm not too excited that he's back but cliff uh cliffy b

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:34.020
he uh tweeted i'm officially back making video games again because apparently he retired for

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:43.700
a while um so yeah and of course you know he was uh the main developer behind uh or main i should

01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:51.860
say the lead behind uh the gears of war series and um kind of with that you know it's not surprising

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:57.540
since everyone's expecting a next gen gears war game uh one of the voice actors uh who did cold

01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:02.980
trains voice was contacted for the next gears war game so put two and two together cliffy's

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:11.540
probably working on a new gears war game i don't know if that's necessarily a given i don't know

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:18.900
but i mean i if i were cliffy b i might want to do something else too maybe he's going to go around

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:23.540
and form his own independent game company you know like he can he can kind of do the miyamoto thing

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:28.340
and oversee gears of war 4 but he doesn't necessarily have to be like actively involved

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:34.020
if that makes sense i guess i don't know all right well i think everybody might want to get

01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:40.500
involved with this because it involves food oh wait it's denny's food blah that's that's a

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:45.300
stretch of the word remember this red velvet pancake so we had at christmas i'm sorry they

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:51.060
weren't there died with blood denny's was awesome when i was 21 and like regularly went out to

01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:56.260
dinner at two in the morning but now that i'm in my mid-30s like i really three people splitting

01:30:56.260 --> 01:31:03.540
a sampler bam exactly where we have enough money to afford a sampler amongst the five of us yeah

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:10.420
i claim a cheese stick mozzarella sticks sound great now if i want gas we've been playing vampire

01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:16.500
live action for the last seven hours mozzarella sticks man you said see it used to be like this

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:23.460
here's the routine go to qsar do a half day pass playing qsar for five fucking hours get out of

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:30.580
there midnight go to denny's sampler well anyway is denny's a big thing nationwide or is that more

01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:33.620
of a west coast thing because i know we don't really have diners here in california like they

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:39.700
do the east coast they have denny's back east yes i don't know like i just said i used to finish

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:46.260
playing live action vampire i larped keep in mind go eat at denny's we don't have waffle house here

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:51.700
or you know dunkin donuts every denny's is everywhere rob all right fine and you know what

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:57.300
we don't have waffle house out here yes because the nine dollar minimum wage because assholes

01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:02.580
yeah all right anyway uh so why do i bring up denny's on our video game show because

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:10.180
uh denny's is doing a greatest hits remixed menu that involves working with atari to create video

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:17.620
game food remixes so there's classic atari games like asteroids centipede and breakout

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:26.900
so one of the games is hashteroids where you're delivering 40 tons of condiments to uh the fourth

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:32.340
planet in sector 7d whatever that means uh so i guess you're fighting giant hash browns instead

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:39.780
of the pixely asteroids uh sector 7d isn't that like the same isn't that where like homer simpson

01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:46.180
works and maybe maybe uh takeout instead of breakout is where denny's food is built up in

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:50.820
a wall and you have to take it down by feeding customers and then there's something called

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:56.100
centipup which i think is made out of uh those hush puppy little deep fried balls of dough or

01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:02.340
whatever those things are they sell so how would you feed customers um with that do you like bounce

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:06.900
them off of like a you know the wall i don't think that's actual this is not actual food that you

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:11.940
order in stores it's a promotion they're doing online uh through mobile app you can actually

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:18.180
play these three games on denny's mobile iphone app i will say this though it to denny's credit

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:25.620
as much as i think their food is is really really bad um i think denny's is a master at social

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:31.140
marketing because their twitter account is always on point and their tumblr i'm always seeing them

01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:35.940
on tumblr because they're saying hilarious things all the time so i will give them that so they are

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:41.620
pretty good at following the pulse and they did social media they did try to do that whole bacon

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:47.460
food menu and actually tried you know was it their bacon milkshake thing but it was not i thought

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:50.980
that was jack in the box did the bacon milkshake uh well okay i think that was everyone that did

01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:56.420
bacon everything uh jack in the box did the bacon milkshake but that was with a jack in the box they

01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:02.900
don't technically have any other milkshake other than just vanilla they just put different syrups

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:07.940
in there um and then denny's actually i think it was a bacon sunday is what it was and it was

01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:14.580
disappointing unfortunately all right well we are going to take a trip to simpler times but quick i

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:20.180
want to read this because this literally just came in on twitter from akuma jp uh who actually lives

01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:24.740
in japan and wants to kind of follow up on something that i was saying during the japanese

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:30.900
releases uh saying that it's not a slow week because yokai watch is the biggest game in japan

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:35.300
right now and people don't and who wants to compete against that even pokemon needs to think

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:39.380
twice interesting i guess that's one of those games that hasn't crossed the cultural barrier

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:44.420
yet because i don't do you even yokai watch i don't know that game i i know of it i haven't

01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:48.020
like the name sounds familiar but it's not something that's really crossed over here yet

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:52.340
as far as i know and to go back real quick about mouse craft because now i just found the

01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.740
screenshots that remind me of myself what it was it's like a cross between lemmings and tetris you

01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:03.300
drop like tetris pieces to help the mice get through like a maze of all sorts of things and

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:11.380
you have a cat that's kind of crazy it looks cool oh yokai watch is a cute cute cute thing

01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:19.460
uh it's a 3ds the original game was out in july of 2013 and uh it is not something that's been

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:22.740
released here it's only in japan so maybe it's something like bravely default well they'll bring

01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:27.540
it over eventually uh there have been manga adaptations of the game uh that they've done

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:32.580
there's an anime tv series that they did that started in japan in january 2014 and they're

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:38.020
doing a movie at the end of this year so yeah wow this is a pretty big deal over there so uh

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:44.580
let's see uh the protagonist is searching for bugs in the world woods of sakura new town he

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:49.860
comes across a peculiar capsule machine next to a sacred tree uh when he opens the capsule it

01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:56.740
brings forth a yokai named whisper who gives uh kita ghost butler a device known as the yokai

01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:01.700
watch using this kita is available to identify and see various different yokai that are haunting

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:08.020
people and causing mischief so it sounds like ghost pokemon katai i've been dealing with that

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:12.180
kata his name is kata well then i'm surprised this isn't something they've tried to bring over here

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:19.700
yet maybe coming done by the same group responsible for professor latin and inazuma 11

01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.260
well this is why i like doing the show live because you know what i i know i don't think

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:31.060
any day i learned any human being cannot play everything so this is always nice to you know

01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:35.220
find out about things especially worldwide that are big elsewhere so thanks for the tweet

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:41.700
akuma jp appreciate it all right uh let's get to the classic game of the week let's go to a time

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:44.980
when there was a lot of stuff that came out in japan that i've never heard of that's for sure

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:51.780
but this game this game is definitely more than all of us in this room this game but this game

01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:58.900
is definitely oozes murica murica murica this is a this is an american game an all american game

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:04.500
how how appropriate for this uh long weekend thanks to the fourth of july all right so dark

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:11.940
sakura what is the classic game of the week the oregon trail i figured it was about time

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:17.460
this is a great selection i just want to point out the audio we're gonna hear tonight for the

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:22.180
oregon trail this comes from not like from the fifth edition yeah the apple 2e edition

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:28.580
like didn't have music like maybe like a really bad synthesized you know theme but that's it so

01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:33.780
we're gonna hear some uh digital fart yeah so slightly and and if uh j this music is appropriate

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:34.420
yeah jason's

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:45.300
it's really quiet but there it is anyway the oregon trail um was developed in 1971

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:51.860
by three school teachers in northfield minnesota uh the primary one being don

01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:59.620
rawich i guess that's how its name is pronounced raw it's um two of his buddies who are also

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:05.060
teachers helped develop the game and this was done using the hp time shared basic

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:11.540
running on an hp 2100 mini computer back when we actually categorized them as such

01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:18.980
um he had the game running for that semester when semester was over he deleted the program

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:25.140
but he printed the source code in 1974 the minnesota education computing consortium

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:31.780
uh was developing educational software and they hired him and so he basically uh

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:40.100
redid the oregon trail for them and it ended up being very very popular in 1978 mecc

01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:48.420
was trying to get more people to use the apple 2 computer and so the oregon trail was uh in

01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:54.740
creative computing's uh may through june 1978 issue written in basic 3.1 and then

01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:04.020
there was the apple pds disc series um oregon trail 2 that came out in 1978 as well um so

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:09.140
basically there have been a bunch of different versions of oregon trail come out since then

01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.900
but all of us here we have been you got a rough trip ahead of you partner we've known of this

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:18.580
game for a while the narration's a little louder than the music was sorry about that

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:25.220
well in in this case the game has been something that has existed as long as we've been alive

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:35.300
right so starting off with other editions outside the 70s versions there was uh the 1985 uh oregon

01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:40.900
trail for apple 2 1990 had the oregon trail classic edition for macintosh um there was

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:48.100
oregon trail deluxe 1992 for das and macintosh uh 1983 through 96 oregon trail version 1.2 for

01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:55.540
windows 1986 oregon trail 2 for windows 97 oregon trail third edition then we had fourth fifth there

01:39:55.540 --> 01:40:05.300
was a dsi where uh in 2009 uh oregon trail for we and 3ds uh the oregon trail american seller for uh

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:09.940
ios and android and then in 2012 there was the oregon trail for windows phone

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:16.820
so what was the big thing that we used to have to do in this game apart from you know forting

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:22.500
rivers and whatnot shooting buffalo shooting buffalo and only being able to carry 100 pounds

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:29.540
back to the wagon you had to hunt and basically i know loki was the type that tried to shoot up

01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:38.500
5 000 pounds of buffalo and i did everything died in the original version you had basically

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:44.500
no graphics and you were timed on how fast you could type bang wham or pow and misspelled

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:50.100
words were a failed hunt in the graphical version you had the little man with his rifle

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:57.620
um you could get bison they yielded the most food and were the slowest moving rabbits and squirrels

01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:06.500
were fast you could have uh deer and elk and bears and other bison and other type of animals

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.340
but you could like you said you can only carry 100 pounds in the early versions of the game

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:17.060
it uh in later versions as long as there were two members of the wagon party 200 pounds could be

01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:22.020
carried back and then later versions you could actually have different hunting environments

01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:28.660
so you could hunt in the snow or the grass and the overhunting of animals would result

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:34.020
in a scarcer game and it would reduce the number of animals that would appear later on in the game

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:38.500
so it did teach a bit of conservatism you know um you could die in the game well

01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:47.140
by you i mean all of your family uh they could die of various diseases like

01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:54.420
measles snakebite dysentery typhoid cholera and exhaustion and in later versions um

01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:59.780
you could have a funeral if the environment allowed you to have a funeral and you could

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:06.580
write a tombstone um but you still couldn't have a viking funeral which sucks but you could write

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:11.780
this person blew donkey goats or you know donkey balls or something on their tombstone and that

01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:20.020
was always great you could uh you actually had a score you had um an unscaled number of points

01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:27.380
that was for each remaining family member weighed by party health um your possessions and your cash

01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:36.420
on hand one point per dollar and then you would have a difficulty scaler so it was it was kind

01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:42.660
of interesting but you know now there's been of course all kinds of clones um mecc did uh the

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:48.820
yukon trail and the amazon trail and of course we know you have died of dysentery is on a number of

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:53.380
t-shirts and memorabilia i have a you have died of dysentery sure i have to say this real quick

01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:58.980
though because the whole tombstone thing one of the big features was that not only would you fill

01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:02.580
out your tombstone you know putting like pepperoni and sausage or whatever you want to put on your

01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:08.020
tombstone right that what would happen is that when other people play the game their wagon would

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:11.460
come through and it might say like there is a tombstone here do you want to stop and look

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:15.860
and you would see like you know the tombstone of whoever had played before you it was like

01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:22.420
that was me versus circa 1983 but then you know you know kids kids did all sorts of dumb shit

01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:26.020
right so like you know we would be there and we would walk up and we'd do you want to see the

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:30.020
tombstone yes and it would come up and it would say you know teacher name is a fag or whatever it

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:35.380
would say there because you know unfortunately uh years ago it was okay to say those things

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:42.020
but um you know that's that's that's what kids did in school play the oregon trail and write

01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:48.500
obscene things on the tombstones there were uh of course all different types of parodies that

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:53.460
were done for promotional tools there was uh the one that fool did in 20 what

01:43:53.540 --> 01:44:00.820
do you friend i'm new here nothing i'm making you sound like um mutley i'm reading a little bit

01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:06.260
okay because i find it funny the act deaf is like i've never played the oregon trail and then like

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:11.140
miss shame you know it's like act deaf dude well you know i know i know she said it with

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:14.420
tongue in cheek but i just laughing because i'm like well he's mexican of course he's

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:21.540
never played the oregon trail well they didn't play that in school for other uh uh different

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:26.740
types of uh alterations made in the game for marketing fallout boy did the fallout boy trail

01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:35.300
so um there was a game loft did the updated version for cell phones um for ipod uh touch

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:43.220
and iphone and those that were have been on the app store since march 11 2009 various other

01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:47.780
versions came out and basically the cell phone version is very similar but you have three

01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:54.020
different wagons you have the basic wagon a prairie schooner or a conestoga wagon and you

01:44:54.020 --> 01:45:00.740
can be a banker a carpenter or a farmer um of course there were there's a facebook version

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:07.220
uh then there's the oregon trail and it was released by the men who wear many hats

01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:15.940
and it's basically trying to uh survive the zombie apocalypse so uh there you go

01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:24.100
have you played the oregon trail no that game is funny i am not you have to check that out

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:31.380
so i i think that the the version that i found the video for is really funny because you start

01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:37.620
off as this enthusiastic girl narrating the story and i'm like bitch you're gonna die you're gonna

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:43.060
be the first to get dysentery or drink the cholera infested waters this version that we're looking

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:48.740
this version that we're looking at here is like one of those classic cheesy 90 cd-rom games

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:55.140
like classic like i'm expecting the sim city anchor woman to come up on screen any minute now

01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:01.060
those 90s uh cd-rom games are so cheesy that i like when people give me links in the chat room

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:07.620
that i cannot check on my phone there was there was also one it's not the oregon trail but it was

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:15.140
a um it was kind of like a mini game type version of the oregon trail that was on steam um i don't

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:18.820
remember the name that might be what they're linking to it's not the oregon trail but there's

01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:22.660
one that's pretty funny it's just like you know you're just shooting everything throughout the

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:27.220
whole thing nice just guns everywhere i just can't remember what it's called because i have 240 some

working on i mean i i probably will end up going to her parents house i wish i could stay home

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:58.900
maybe maybe i can convince her that i could stay home and nap because that would be nice but um

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.380
i don't know i'm gonna work on it during the week that's why i do my lunch nowadays because

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:10.260
there you go nobody that played games with me works with me anymore and uh our game room's gone

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:15.780
and uh it's kind of sad but i'm glad you're speaking of which i will be i will be ebaying

01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:22.420
most of my gaming related stuff uh from our game room on ebay so look for xbox 360 and playstation

01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:29.620
3 systems oh nice so i got playstation 3 160 gig systems that are they are pretty much brand new

01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:35.540
the box got beat up and that's it oh do you have any ps3s or ps2 compatible no damn that's just

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:40.580
my original one at home but no these are all 160 gig systems they're the first redesign all right

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:46.420
so uh so hopefully i'll be putting that up and then um whatever else i have i have a lot of

01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:52.340
crap at my desk and i need it it all needs to go so uh we'll see i'll be auctioning some of

01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:58.740
that stuff just to make some extra money because uh because i'm broke okay maybe maybe i see that's

01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:03.380
the other thing too is maybe i'll just trade that stuff in the game shop or something for uh

01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:09.940
playstation 4 and uh there you go xbox one or wii u or something um so there's that option too because

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:15.140
i know one time they were giving you 100 bucks for playstation 3 well be careful because it's

01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:19.380
gonna keep going down and down and down so you gotta figure out what you're gonna do yeah sorry

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:23.460
uh anyway quickly speaking of cons dark soccer i know you used to go to this comedy you haven't

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:27.540
been in a while but i think this past weekend i believe i heard anime expo had its big weekend it

01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:33.540
sounded like registration was a freaking mess when has it not been a freaking mess why can't

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:37.380
why can't conventions figure out their registration lines what is what is up with that

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:43.780
the understaff and overbook all right well the story fingers crossed the gamer x will not have

01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:49.060
that problem but i suppose just turned to crap last year it went very well the gamer x registration

01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:53.620
went very well last year but getting in on the thursday night really really helps with that so

01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:59.300
um let's see uh i want to quickly give a shout out to another program on the network as well

01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:04.500
the voice geeks network vog network.com uh saturday nights on the network is when understation

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:10.900
live can be heard understation live a very very very long running program because uh well travis

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:16.100
one of the hosts is very very very old just kidding love you travis uh they are going to be back

01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:19.780
after their short hiatus on july 12th so i just want to give them a shout out and encourage y'all

01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:26.020
to check them out if you uh if you like your uh very random sci-fi chatter that is very

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:32.100
it's the type of show that you can really only do in the internet environment that vog has and it's

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:36.660
it's a lot of fun and very kind of like family uh entertainment so check that out i don't mean

01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:42.660
family friendly dysfunctional family yes exactly i mean like dysfunctional family exactly exactly

01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:46.580
love it but that's where dark soccer and i got our starts so i just want to give them a shout out

01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:50.180
okay rapid fire news we got a lot of ground to cover we got to keep things moving so we have

01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:54.500
plenty of time for calls so let's get to it loki some rapid fire news okay so this is kind of neat

01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:59.620
because i didn't even know that this worked as it was wired now i guess wirelessly but apparently

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:04.500
the dualshock 4 controllers work with the playstation 3 which that's totally news to me

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:09.300
because i totally miss that um but yeah they have a brand new ps3 firmware update that now allows

01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:15.380
you to wirelessly sync your dualshock 4 controller with your playstation 3 so for me that's a good

01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:21.380
reason to get dualshock 4 because i only have a playstation 3 right now but i didn't know that

01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:27.380
that worked so that's pretty sweet um so yeah and i guess um if you do sync it to your playstation

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:32.500
remember you're gonna also have to re-sync it to your playstation 4 but that's just as easy as

01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:38.420
connecting it with a usb cable and pushing you know a button i'm excited about this i love the

01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:44.180
ps4 controller yeah so that's really cool it's great um they don't have it where you can use the

01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:49.300
playstation 3 controllers on the playstation 4 do they i don't believe so playstation 3 wouldn't

01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:53.700
have the touchpad either which is kind of an essential you actually have to click that that

01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:58.660
you actually have to click that that that replaces because there's the share button

01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:05.380
the uh the tapping the touchpad replaces like what used to be the back back or select button that

01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:09.380
replaces it well they could just emulate that they could have you know left side of that is

01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:14.900
starred or left side is you know back or whatever um we'll see i think oh they actually that's

01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:20.500
exactly what they do in a ps now so they do they do have a setup for it now that you mentioned so

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:24.740
that'd be kind of cool if they had that option but i i they wouldn't want to probably you know

01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:29.220
cannibalize their playstation controller sales but very true it would be nice you know if they

01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:37.620
had that um they had a special grand theft auto um patch this week that was a free update the

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:42.500
independence day special included a bunch of cool stuff including american fly t-shirts

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:48.500
uh mullet haircut for females and a fireworks launcher also um a giant monster truck that you

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:54.980
can buy um in game what's also cool is they have the option to buy fireworks and actually set up

01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:01.220
your own fireworks show you can actually set timers on each one and you know launch fireworks

01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:05.860
which was really cool um apparently though that's only going to be well at least the fireworks part

01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:11.060
is only going to be limited to this week um which is very disappointing because that sounds really

01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:15.940
cool i wish they would just open that back up but maybe they'll be just like there was snow at

01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:20.980
winter maybe that something they're gonna add each year or something just to kind of keep it

01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:28.820
fresh but uh that's really cool and you can download that for free so check it out and then

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:36.660
uh last but not least there's another oculus rift demo now for uh south park and it looks like

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:43.460
that they've just basically taken the south park stick of truth um environment and also uh just

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:48.980
threw like some characters in there and stuff but pretty cool looking you can wander around

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:55.620
south park and just kind of get the look there you can even go in the hell and um i don't know

01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:05.540
it's a neat idea although at least not as terrible as south park 64 there is that all right uh some

01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:10.180
other quick news uh this is unfortunate about mario kart 8 you know for such a stellar wii u

01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:15.620
game that has a pretty great online system it was really only a matter of time before as they say

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:20.820
hackers gonna hack and uh some youtube folks uh have published a youtube that show how to hack

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:25.140
mario kart 8 uh they're saying well i don't think it shows everything they're just saying it's a

01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:30.660
proof of concept for now but basically using a browser exploit they can make moo moo meadows

01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:36.580
play the final lap music immediately or make it play no music at all uh they can rename things

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:42.500
like they rename moo moo meadows to shitty luck course they can corrupt the font they can crash

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:47.300
the wii u and alter the wii u menu fonts unfortunately the the thing about this is that

01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:52.820
these exploits could lead to online cheats and i'm hearing that some of that is being spotted as well

01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:57.140
that folks are able to cheat online hopefully nintendo will patch it and put the ban hammer on

01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:01.540
this quick now that they have a system capable of patching uh because the wii u can do that for

01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:06.420
games hopefully they will clamp that down and uh fix that it's not even with the games though it's

01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:12.580
with the internet browser yes on the wii u so yeah but they could still patch out the exploit

01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:18.020
in the game yeah so all right and uh this was mentioned earlier during the release days dates

01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:23.380
but uh just to make sure we all know qbert rebooted is a thing and that is happening it's

01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:28.660
coming out on mobile and steam uh qbert hasn't been seen in a while unless you caught his cameo

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:33.940
in wreck it ralph but qbert was that little orange fuzzball with a very long nose that used

01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:39.940
to say a string of punctuation when he would fall to the bottom and little known thing back in the

01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:45.220
day those old arcade machines actually had a little like device that when qbert would hit the bottom

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:49.940
it would make a very loud thud it would actually make like this big clamp uh a sound of a sandbag

01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:54.020
hitting the bottom or something but anyway uh and then qbert would say a bunch of punctuation which

01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:59.300
we all know was just fuck you know like what i usually say when i die like really easy cheaply

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:04.660
in a game like that anyhow now you can say swear words all over again with qbert on steam and

01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:11.700
mobile devices it will have the isometric gameplay of the original arcade game uh in a 2d pixel style

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:19.140
and a 3d hd overhaul think kind of what pac-man and some other arcade remakes have had so uh

01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:24.820
should be interesting hopefully it's not too overpriced uh mighty number nine

01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:31.940
uh the company that was developing mighty number name cons concept usa which as you all know this

01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:36.980
is inafune's pet project that's basically mega man without saying mega man right this is the

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:42.100
whole like screw you for not bringing any regular mega man games here is what we're going to do uh

01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:48.980
anyway uh concept has announced now a new second paypal funding campaign to cover new stretch

01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:57.700
goals for mighty number nine uh a 100 000 target for english voice acting uh the update that

01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:02.100
concerns this whole drive is that anything collected in this new effort is only going to

01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:07.220
be used to address new features the original donation toll is still dedicated to the original

01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:13.860
game and the first round of stretch goals which um it's very interesting that english voice acting

01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:18.420
was not considered in the original but you know i suppose usually the english voice acting turns

01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:26.660
out terrible anyway so um not always uh anyhow um you can do that on paypal a 23 pre-order will

01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:32.660
basically be a digital pre-order but there are other bonuses as well uh there's also a animated

01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:38.980
series coming out of this there's lots and lots of lots of new stretch goals so there you go dark

01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:48.260
sakura we have some stuff um what's uh coming up for one thing is that namco bandai has uh

01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:55.780
going to be doing a uh a racing game called project cars that's uh actually done by slightly

01:58:55.780 --> 01:59:07.460
mad studios it's going to be um for xbox one ps4 pc and steam os and it's supposed to also uh

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:12.500
you know there's the same group that did need for speed shift so hopefully we should see this uh

01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:18.820
before too long so it's also going to be one of the first morpheus games that come out um one of

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:25.300
my stories didn't load it's also a kick-started game as well um and there was supposed to be a

01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:32.580
weu version as well of that um should be should be interesting because uh it looks fantastic

01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:36.340
um and the fact that they finally got a publisher because i know for a while there they didn't have

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:41.860
anybody um pretty exciting to see something like that come out since it's it looks to be

01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:49.940
the same caliber of like a gran turismo or forza um other uh good actually this uh

01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:56.980
is that a shovel knight is going to have butt mode yeah um basically will it friend your butt

01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:07.700
yeah well basically if you enter w s w w a e a w as your name then um you uh all mentions for

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:15.060
a bunch of recurring words shovel knight health magic are replaced with butt so and this is i

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:20.900
think supposed to be on all the versions so like of all heroes none shown broader than butt butt

02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:31.860
and shield butt butts that's funny yeah lol butts uh was that other thing able to come up if not

02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:37.060
i'll jump in here no it brought up a story from uh last week don't all right let me uh i'll jump

02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:40.020
in here real quick and mention because i definitely want to give a shout out to um

02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:44.340
good news and gamers doing good and i know we have a lot of fans of these summer games

02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:50.820
that was covered last week i think i think we talked about that it was going on but we didn't

02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:56.100
talk about their final tally all right for this so but i've got the story up then okay go for it

02:00:56.100 --> 02:01:02.100
i just thought it was old no um so basically uh the summer games done quick uh gaming marathon

02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:10.340
raised over 700 000 for doctors without borders uh last week so very good for them

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:19.380
that basically means that a combined total of more than 2.75 million were raised for charities

02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:24.660
all right and oh well if we covered that twice because that's it's good to cover it that's right

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:31.460
all right uh let's see and there will be a matter of time before the winter games or the official

02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:36.500
awesome games dumb quick uh happens and then we'll cover that one three times just to just

02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:45.140
to make up for it all right uh finally rob huh but lol but uh let's go to the frugal question

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:49.220
of the week you take facebook you take google plus you slam those words together you get frugal

02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:53.940
it's

02:01:56.980 --> 02:02:02.100
every week we ask a question of our social media communities and we read some of our favorite

02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:07.140
answers on the air and this week we asked uh have you seen this whole story about the Denny's and

02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:12.980
Atari thing and be honest has there been any of these video game commercials that you've actually

02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:19.380
enjoyed as a sort of guilty pleasure be honest we won't judge you even if it's yaris and then

02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:23.860
i put a little footnote we actually might judge you a little bit for yours so let's see what what

02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:30.740
commercial sponsored games will our fans admit to actually liking a little bit and starting right

02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:36.900
off tech 2030 says a little shame to admit i actually like the yaris video game on xbox 360

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:43.220
it was simple but addictive covers head with paper bag and you should feel ashamed

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.180
yeah well that that look of silence is you being judged right now

02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:54.580
thank you for your honesty i appreciate it all right um let's see becky m replies and said my

02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:59.380
guilty pleasure is yo noid the nintendo game that featured the noid character from dominos pizza

02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:05.220
commercials uh febreeze a replies and said the doritos games on xbox live were amazing

02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:11.620
dark tetsuya says i still have sneak king on the xbox which was fun albeit creepy as heck though

02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:17.380
i think my favorite of these was spot on the nes a puzzle or board game starring the old seven

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:21.540
up mascot i think he did that for a classic game of the week cool spot was awesome and sneak king

02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:27.060
the only game i can think of that actually was a hybrid game that both the xbox and xbox 360

02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:31.860
versions were on the same disc that's right played in both systems why they didn't do that more

02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:35.860
often especially with some of those games that were pretty close to each other yeah it was beyond

02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:40.180
me uh let's see critical myth also green sneak king was hilarious especially when you realize

02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:44.980
that the king was an uber stalker and that was supposed to be quote good advertising uh renee

02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:50.500
replies and says not just yo noid in the dominos tie-in but i also enjoyed mckids hell of a

02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:56.340
platformer despite the obvious tie-in andy r says motorstorm rc on the vita comes to mind

02:03:56.340 --> 02:04:03.300
i'd forgot about this one that was a that was like uh iron man off-road racing from the pizza

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.860
parlors back in the day that game was cool uh andy r also says the game wasn't great but it was free

02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:12.660
in the u.s thanks to the advertisement promotion which is a price i can get behind uh burr says

02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:17.860
cool spot was actually a pretty decent platformer with impressive graphics for its time i really

02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:22.740
enjoyed playing through that one of my amiga 500 ospher says remember when burger king gave us a

02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:28.100
code to let us unlock memories for ddr extreme on the playstation 2 us version it was a while

02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:32.980
after the game's release too that's right and that that was like a year after the game was that was

02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:37.140
crazy yeah it was one of those things where they knew that the song was in there but there was it

02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:41.860
was locked and they thought it was just like oh this is just something that they left on there

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:46.340
but they didn't really you know utilize it yeah and then come to find out oh there is actually a

02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:52.980
lock code there yep yep uh nemesis 47 replied and said there was the ronald mcdonald game on

02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:59.620
the sega genesis which was enjoyable and also sonic 3 fruit roll-ups anyone uh degener johnny

02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:03.300
says to be completely honest the one commercial game i keep close to my heart is the seven up

02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:07.220
spot game for the sega genesis to this day it still ranks as one of the most enjoyable

02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:11.940
platformers i've ever played by the way where is that little guy that's a good question whatever

02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:18.340
happened to spot i guess all the best advertising you know things go away after a while though it'll

02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:22.580
come back in 20 years it's just like no one remembers the california raisins and they had

02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:27.860
you know that game too i will always i will always remember the where's the beef lady i mean i

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:32.900
understand she probably died or something but you know a long time ago but where's the beef that was

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:39.220
the she was wondering where the beef was because only the beef would have saved her life the beef

02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:44.900
unfortunately contained the cure for her uh illness and she never found it so she died all

02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:50.420
right uh hitstun says yo noid was random and bad and i loved it everything everyone and everything

02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:55.140
are trying to kill the dominos pizza mascot or make them lose a card game the game requires

02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:59.380
throwing a yo-yo at random places to find invisible items that you needed to survive it would have

02:05:59.380 --> 02:06:05.220
been nearly as interesting if it starred a masked ninja with a bird all right and uh lastly going

02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:11.220
over to google plus and looking some of the answers over there appletainment replies and says

02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:16.580
to be honest as i sit here sit being my heineken while listening to the new coldplay cd i abhor

02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:22.100
product placement in all of its forms i avoid product placement similar to how i avoid the noid

02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:26.980
i can even think i can't even think of any good or bad product placement in games especially the

02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:32.900
new mirror's edge coming in time for the future that answer reminded me of that one scene from

02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:41.540
wayne's world that's exactly right i will not bow down to corporate sponsorship uh and lastly

02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:46.420
act dev says probably the burger king games and the doritos games on xbox though there are a few

02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:52.100
games on mobile devices that are fun enough as well uh quickly going around the room any um

02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:59.060
commercial based games that you enjoyed i like the burger king games i'm very sad they never came out

02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:04.260
with they're supposed to be doing more with connect yeah like what the hell um then they

02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:09.380
also checks quest because that was pretty awesome i just got a text message from our buddy jason who

02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:14.020
i believe is stuck in traffic in the bay area right now who said checks quest uh so that's

02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:20.660
awesome and then uh i did like cool spot cool spot was one of my favorite games uh dark sakura did you

02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:27.060
have a commercially sponsored game that you admit was a guilty pleasure not really i thought you

02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:33.620
liked the spot game no oh all right um yeah i actually really didn't have too many of the

02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:41.140
sponsored games i just i'm trying to think and no i don't really think i did i was a big fan

02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:45.540
of sneak king that would have been my answer but some of the chatters uh beat me to it alan's here

02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:50.100
hi alan hello what do you want to say just submit all right submit so does it have to be a game

02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:56.020
specifically put out by a product company or just can it be a real game with all that also

02:07:56.020 --> 02:08:00.580
had the sponsors sure a real game that has sponsors why not crazy taxi is an amazing game

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:07.540
and that had real stuff in it pizza hut kfc and what else that that was uh the the offspring

02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:12.580
yeah well no that was just licensed music but i mean like take me to p take me to pizza hut like

02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:18.100
the the people it was a part of the game yeah that's a good answer i could vote for um crazy

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:22.660
taxi didn't they take that out of some versions like later on they didn't they would just say take

02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:28.340
me to pizza or something or they'd just say take me to the hut yeah they were just generic

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:34.340
also take me to the shoe store because of when this happened and just how it was so weird but

02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:41.140
space quest 5 um which was only done by one of the two guys from andromeda the sierra online game

02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:46.740
space quest 5 had in it it was mostly a star trek parody uh because you were the captain of a junk

02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:51.300
ship and whenever you pulled up the comm screen like in star trek when they talked to the guy in

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:57.620
the window there would be a switch to sprint and the sprint logo for real like they paid for that

02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:04.020
placement and it's like and this was like 91 or 92 so this was i want to say it was groundbreaking

02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:09.140
but it was like what is going on wasn't that back when like murphy brown was doing sprint commercials

02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:14.180
yes and it was the weirdest thing and it's a perfectly good point and click adventure game but

02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:20.020
sprint the phone company was in space quest 5 whatever happened to candice bergen it was

02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:25.940
random thought and then in space quest 6 when they brought back the um announcer from laughing

02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:32.740
if you try to click on like the edge of a bridge that's broken um if you want to like try and jump

02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:38.500
across it it's like no no and uh you have to you have to do a walking jump because in this game

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:44.900
you can't switch to sprint so they referenced the previous that there was sprint sponsorship in five

02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:49.860
and six wow that's those are some good answers alan i'm glad you popped in here game you're welcome

02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:55.300

friend all right uh which also reminds me to say i not only i hope you all had a happy fourth but

02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:30.260
a happy canada day belated to all our canadian friends because that was what monday so all right

02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:36.020
uh that was day the first oh tuesday so i i got my calendar all made jeez rob i know it was the

02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:40.500
first one would think you didn't live in canada well actually i have a really funny story about

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:44.660
when i went to canada for the fourth of july yet we found ourselves there on canada day but i'll

02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:47.860
have to tell that another week because we're running long all right uh let's get back into

02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:57.220
some gaming news loki all right um so the oculus um they of course are been sending out dev kits

02:10:57.220 --> 02:11:02.580
and you know uh there's dev kit 2 coming right around the corner in fact i think they started

02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:09.220
shipping that but they had to suspend sales of dev kit 2 actually to china the reason being is

02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:17.620
that they've had an extreme reseller um purchasing problems in china and so they're just flipping the

02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:23.780
over there to make a quick buck and they're basically saying no we need to make sure that

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:28.580
we're doing what we can to make sure that um resellers that are looking to flip our product

02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:33.620
for profit are not taking stock away from legitimate developer purchases globally our

02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:38.580
product in its current form is development kit and meant for developers to develop vr content and

02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:43.700
we're looking into alternative ways to make sure that our development kits are gained to legitimate

02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:48.660
developer hands in china and because of that now we're forced to suspend an entire country

02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:55.860
from purchasing i'll let you put two and two togethers um so i don't know in other words

02:11:55.860 --> 02:12:00.740
we're gonna make sure that bobby blackwolf's uh oculus development kit does not end up in china

02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:07.060
on a shady street corner it is kind of lame that they're doing that um that sucks for the legit

02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:15.540
people but piracy is crazy in other countries well there's even people like just legit just

02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:19.940
reselling the original kits and i'm sure a lot more are going to be doing that now that

02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:24.100
you know the dev kit 2 is coming out but i'm sure there's going to be a lot of people just

02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:29.380
even all over the country buying that stuff but you know not in bulk i think that's a good

02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:32.500
question hey bobby i know he's in our chat room because bobby's commenting on this saying they

02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:36.580
haven't started chipping yet i'm in the first batch here this is a good question for bobby

02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:41.140
what are you going to do with your dev kit 1 when you get dev kit 2 i don't know well bobby's also

02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:45.300
the type he's probably keeping it he's like i'm gonna have them both um but i'd be curious what

02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:48.820
a lot of people out there are doing with their dev kit ones i wonder if those are the things

02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:53.220
that are going to end up you know it's it's got it's like how um uh you know like the biggest

02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:58.100
buyers of like used iphones are people in other countries where they don't have iphones officially

02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:02.180
you know so i wonder it would be kind of fun to have one just to mess around with but yeah

02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:08.180
i mean i don't know i don't want to spend that kind of money yet yeah you got you got you have

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:14.900
to finish your 2d game first before you can start on your technically in 3d yeah you have to finish

02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:19.540
that first before you get to your he says he's keeping it he said he said that in chat he's

02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:24.820
keeping it yeah all right i had a feeling knowing bobby he he likes to demo that stuff too so he

02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:27.940
would get used to having two of them but i bet there's a lot of people out there that are going

02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:35.380
to unload their dev kit ones so all right um going back to uh some more news and uh i know

02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:39.380
this is a game that uh loki loves a lot although i don't know if you play this version of it

02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:45.140
minecraft pocket edition i have pocket edition i just don't play it uh pocket edition is of course

02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:51.460
the one that's uh on the ios and android and uh i think they have it in some other places too

02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:56.580
uh did the uya get the pocket edition no they they advertised that they were going to be getting that

02:13:56.580 --> 02:14:01.300
but they never did they never did all right well anyway um a huge update coming for minecraft

02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:05.540
pocket edition it's going to be launching on thursday was that thursday this past week or

02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:12.660
this coming thursday i think that was uh this coming thursday minecraft pocket edition 0.9.0

02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:19.380
and this version will feature infinite worlds that's a big one caves new blocks and items

02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:25.460
including monster eggs and huge mushroom blocks wolves where you can tame a loyal companion loads

02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:32.660
of new flowers uh new mobs including endermen and mushrooms new biomes from the pc version mesas

02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:38.020
jungle swamps and extreme hills abandoned mine shafts villages and other cool places again that

02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:43.860
sounds like it's from pc uh an interaction button so you'll never accidentally punch a sheep again

02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:50.180
uh and there'll be a new new feature generation including lakes vines and monster rooms and of

02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:57.860
course the ever popular bug fixes so if you are uh and this thing still sells like crazy on the

02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:04.260
ios like the itunes yeah it's good that they're getting it up to that same level yeah and i mean

02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:13.300
if you buy one of these you know uh you google tv you know the android tv or i think you can

02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:18.420
sideload in newia but the version that they had available didn't have controller support so that's

02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:22.180
why i could never get it to work although that was supposed to be coming so i don't know if that

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:26.820
has been added in there at some point i hope it does because i can't play that game on the

02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:32.340
touch screen it just it's not fun at all yeah and they did they had a version with controller

02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:39.700
support for the um what was it the expiria play but they never ported that stuff over to the

02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:44.580
regular pocket edition which is kind of lame are they still planning on the whole uh playstation

02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:49.060
4 version will bring in the playstation 3 worlds yeah they're still doing that they just haven't

02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:54.500
released the play or have they released the playstation no i believe it's on deck for

02:15:54.500 --> 02:16:00.180
july or august so i think it's excuse me pick up it's soon it's around the corner yeah because

02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:04.420
they're going to have the via version coming out also in the xbox one version i'm sure they're

02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:09.460
going to disc based versions for all those as well um i'm interested to see what they do with it i

02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:14.740
it's been so long since i played minecraft and i feel bad about it because i'm still paying for

02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:20.500
the server and it's just like i understand you got yeah well it's just like you know i

02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:28.100
it's hard to get people playing all the time you know uh if i opened it up publicly maybe

02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:32.260
but then that then you have to maintain you have to deal with trolls and who knows what

02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:39.860
well there's ways around that but it's just yeah it's tough all right well let's move on

02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:44.420
with some more news dark sakura well we do actually have more news isn't that great

02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:50.740
yeah this one has to do with uh magic 2015 as in magic the gathering oh raginator will be happy

02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:57.540
which is why i picked this uh um basically wizard of the coast is uh getting together with 14

02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:04.340
different video game special people um to do magic 2015 duels of the plains walker

there's basically a bunch of them on here my favorite is goblin kaboomist

02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:41.060
because i used to have a goblin deck that makes me laugh sorry this whole story is making me

02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:45.700
snicker because i realized we just had a missed opportunity to do a list list here with card i

02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:53.140
would put in magic 2015 maybe in a future week because i was thinking oh they have all these

02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:59.300
celebrity designers but i don't see dark sakura doing a card for magic 2015 but mox mox prism what

02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:08.740
if she could tap to win the game bored yeah tap the wing game board uh wouldn't that be the

02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:12.420
wouldn't that be what the notch card would do is you tap this card to throw all the cards up in the

02:18:12.420 --> 02:18:20.420
air and quit table flip card to win game or to be done at least all right uh go to the chat room

02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:25.540
over at live.vog network.com dark tetsuya says i saw richard garriott's card it even references

02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:30.820
the avatar from the ultima series well that's pretty cool i like those little little references

02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:37.860
to a classic gaming's past especially a series as legendary as ultima all right loki oh thank

02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:45.140
god ubisoft is uh managed to uh come out victorious against a lawsuit a patent lawsuit against them

02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:53.060
you play apparently a company or a digital a company that held the patent digital regs

02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:58.660
of texas um which i'm trying to see what the patent actually was called you know because

02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:06.580
it's always something very generic uh i guess uh was it remotely tracking access to software after

02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:12.900
distribution post distribution security and other typical functions of digital rights management

02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:20.420
software um of course they had various numerous reasons among them that you know i guess an

02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:26.420
agreement between digital reg and valve covering third-party use drm or something whatever i'm just

02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:33.540
sad that it did actually end up going through because now uplay's gotta still be there and

02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:39.220
uplay sucks they do really try to shove that you play thing down people's throats stop trying to

02:19:39.220 --> 02:19:44.100
make it work no one wants you play it's not the worst thing in the world actually i like the fact

02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:47.860
that it kind of has the synergy between all the different games but the problem that ends up

02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:52.260
happening is that then every company wants that and things get so fragmented it's like what's

02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:57.220
starting to happen to netflix everybody's pulling their crap off netflix because hbo wants to do

02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:01.140
their own thing and you know these other companies want to do their own thing and it's like when

02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:06.100
things get super fragmented then it's just like oh fuck this this isn't worth it anymore i'm not

02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:10.340
going to sign up here here here there needs to be a centralized thing that's that's the only thing

02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:16.900
i i problem i have with uplay but i liked that you know i could get achievements or do things in one

02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:22.180
game and i could get a reward somewhere else like trying out assassin's creed and getting a few

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:25.940
points there could unlock a song and just dance or something like that that was i gotta think

02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:31.380
though that that could still be accomplished through like steam or something i mean there's

02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:36.900
gotta be the way to check to see if you have an achievement or something of another game true i

02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:40.980
would think i mean i at least there should be a way to do that but then they can't get your email

02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:49.780
address and track you and oh target ads all right uh hey a twitch app may be coming big rumor may

02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:54.340
be coming to the 3ds and the playstation vita hold on this doesn't mean you're going to be able to

02:20:54.340 --> 02:21:00.340
stream your games um but in a recent interview the co of twitch kevin lin said that the company

02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:06.100
would like to bring the twitch application to the 3ds and playstation vita however it would

02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:12.500
only be for viewing this by the way following comments from reggie fees may at e3 that twitch

02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:16.420
wouldn't come to the wii u because they don't think that streaming 30 minutes of gameplay by

02:21:16.420 --> 02:21:23.060
itself is a lot of fun so it's because the wii u can't handle it which we all know is really the

02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:28.580
case and we you can and he can't come up there and say yeah we'd love to do that bar systems

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:33.620
underpowered and we can't handle that he can't say that but he really should have just more stuck

02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:38.580
to the you know well we've chosen to go with youtube and we think that mario kart 8 looks

02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:42.820
great on youtube and people are having a lot of fun with this and and look at the angry luigi

02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:47.220
meme that meme that came out of this like that that like you don't have to dog what's happening

02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:56.580
with twitch because again like honestly ironically nintendo at e3 kind of mastered the twitch game

02:21:56.580 --> 02:22:02.340
like they got a lot of people really interested in their shit and a big part of that is because

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:07.300
of the twitch and you see a lot of people really commending them for hey you know what was awesome

02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:13.220
about nintendo nintendo like showed actual fucking games at e3 and the games that were in motion they

02:22:13.220 --> 02:22:18.260
didn't show cgi packaged things or these pre-packaged demos like they showed the real

02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:22.420
stuff and they put that out there so it's it's kind of weird that reggie would say something

02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:28.100
like that when like nintendo actually has a lot they can gain from twitch but i understand if the

02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:34.500
wii u technologically can't stream the whole twitch thing like the xbox 360 and the xbox one

02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:40.100
can well let's focus on what it can do the mario kart 8 stuff on youtube was was pretty cool you

02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:44.900
know and surprised the hell out of me honestly you guys all know when i first talked about mario kart

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:54.020
8 i was like welcome to online nintendo and it is good very very good so all right anyway um

02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:59.860
let's move on are we are we just about to the mailbag i think we are it's that time where we're

02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:04.900
going to open up the mailbag because you guys send us emails every week at mailbag at orange

02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:11.140

with my toe dipping a toe in participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send us an email

02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:27.620

02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:33.140
so that all of the spam going to the old one before hopefully it's it's all bounced now and

02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:49.380
with the show and dark soccer will read the emails right now hello lr while traveling to and from the

02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:54.900
too many games convention in the philly area last weekend i listened to last last week's show rob

02:23:54.900 --> 02:24:00.420
you're welcome if ever there's a sequel to bungee ferret toss uh tossing i will ask you and others

02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:07.700
for even more cat pictures oh this is cyyr speaking of bft i was hoping to port it to unity

02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:13.780
over the next year destination steam the hardest part will be figuring out a control configuration

02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:19.220
that matches the precision and flexibility of an xbox 360 controller but also works with a keyboard

02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:24.180
and mouse i do have a few ideas and i'll be working on it so wait do we just like kind of

02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:29.460
sort of get confirmation that bungee ferret tossing is planned for steam not that it's

02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:36.660
happening but it's planned hmm you guys were talking about the current dismal state of konami

02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:40.900
and there is one thing you guys missed bimani is still a significant portion of their business model

02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:48.580
they are still running 2dx ddr pop music and guitar alongside their newer releases

02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:57.140
jubit um reflect beat sound voltex booth and dance evolution arcade all of those games are current

02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:01.940
and regularly updated with new songs and unlocks true none of it is on home consoles and none of

02:25:01.940 --> 02:25:07.860
it is officially in america with the exception of some ios versions but neither of those markets

02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:12.980
seem viable right now so i don't blame them is this the majority of konami's business heck no

02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:18.260
but it's obviously significantly enough to be a measurable part of their bottom line and seriously

02:25:18.260 --> 02:25:22.500
if you haven't already you guys should take a day trip to sunnyvale and try out ddr 2013 it's pretty

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:27.940
fantastic i didn't realize they had that around here um i think they're getting that actually at

02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:32.500
scandia soon i want to say that they're i thought that they were upgrading to that it wouldn't

02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:38.820
surprise me because they have a lot of other stuff at scandia but um i i i do it's kind of one of

02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:42.500
those things where it's like okay i i get that point and i respect that viewpoint and everything

02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:47.860
but it's still it's very hard to sit here after we kind of had that whole peak of ddr in this

02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:53.780
hey you know what i was like disappeared i i will take a playstation 4 xbox one game

02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:59.140
that's in japan because you can import that shit and it's region free so that's fine i will take

02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:04.740
that but we're not gonna see it even like a dance evolution game or something i don't know it's very

02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:10.340
frustrating i just kind of feel like it still feels so small compared to what it could or

02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:14.500
should have been i don't know that's where my frustrations come from and i realize they're

02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:20.500
still making it but how big is it really but maybe bigger in japan than it is here

02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:25.220
and my perspective is screwed i don't know but i will say i still see more konami slot machines

02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:32.260
than i do you know ddr machines anymore i too limit the lack of any ridge racer developed by

02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:38.340
namco proper and i'm really disappointed that neither the xbox one nor the ps4 have a ridge

02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:44.020
racer game at lunch heck the ps4 is the first Sony console ever not to have one and that's

02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:49.940
counting both psp and vita i think that handling the franchise handing the franchise off to a third

02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:55.380
party was a mistake the vita version was poorly handled and i worried that ridge will join f0 as

02:26:55.380 --> 02:27:01.220
a prize he had ignored racing franchise i i hope it doesn't happen because six and seven were at

02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:06.260
least in my opinion absolutely the highest point of the series loaded to the brim with the amazing

02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:12.020
course design and lightning fast action namco does better than anyone else this goes out to loki as

02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:17.780
well as anyone who wants to to program anything ever i may not be a pro i may have only developed

02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:23.620
a handful of games but i wholeheartedly believe in the 80 20 rule you'll spend 80 of your programming

02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:30.420
time on 20 of the result and vice versa a lot of it is spent on the things your players won't see

02:27:30.420 --> 02:27:35.700
or fixing things or figuring out how to do things or just figuring out that everything really does

02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:40.820
take three times longer than you expected yep that's about right three times is actually a very

02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:47.060
accurate estimate and this really is the truth if you are seriously working on a game you don't

02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:52.260
really have time to actually play much of anything but it's all part of the game no pun intended and

02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:56.980
anyone passionate about creating green games will agree that's well worth it keep fighting that good

02:27:56.980 --> 02:28:03.060
fight aaron yyr thank you for the very good email lots and lots of points in that email and i agree

02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:08.260
with what he said about ridge racer i really hope it doesn't go the way of f0 and uh you know

02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:12.340
disappear although i guess we had word that bandai namco is developing something else in

02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:16.900
the racing area it's just they're not developing they're publishing oh yeah very good point you're

02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:21.460
right very important distinction and not the same thing it's a cool looking game i mean it's

02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:26.500
absolutely amazing dan's gonna probably have to pick it up because it looks fantastic but uh

02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:32.820
i don't know uh bobby blackwolf in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com says speaking of f0

02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:38.260
i did play an oculus rift demo full game on kickstarter which is an f0 slash wipeout style

02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:43.780
racer it was really good in vr mode oh my gosh i would think a game that fast would make me barf

02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:50.100
on oculus maybe not i mean maybe they've they've toned it down or it's not as bad as i think it is

02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:57.140
but uh that might be too much speed for vr it might be a bit much all right uh let us uh since

02:28:57.140 --> 02:29:01.700
that's it for emails sadly but you should email us participate at orangelandtrady.com if you want

02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:05.860
to be heard on a future week but now would be the time that we do the FUs of the week

02:29:05.860 --> 02:29:31.620
um fu 2 last minute prop making for cosplays and uh aerosol paint

02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:39.940
i've been there but it was costuming for stage shows so i feel your pain fu to the fact that

02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:44.100
i don't have any cosplay at all for gamer x i'm going to be so uncool i really need to fix that

02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:49.780
for game or for uh dragon con but fu to the fact that i'll probably need to lose about 20 pounds

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:55.300
first um and fu my my real real fu i wanted to do is if you did the fact that i slept wrong on my

02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:59.700
back or something earlier this week and like my back has been hurting for like a week straight

02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:04.100
it's getting better but it's just like one of those like oh it hurts it keeps me like somebody's

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:10.660
poking me poke poke poke poke poke stop it you're annoying stop poking me logan uh just after you've

02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:16.260
been tired because even when i slept today he's made me more tired now's a great time to start

02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:21.620
drinking coffee i oh yeah you got red bull all right yeah that's right you don't fuck around

02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:28.900
all right still doesn't help uh yeah i wouldn't be conscious if it wasn't for that so yeah it's

02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:34.260
it's uh it does help all right just a few more stories for you guys then we're going to take

02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:40.260
your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on skype orange lounge radio if you do want to call i'm

02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:44.500
going to warn you i'm not going to have it open for very very long so uh don't be shy make sure

02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:50.260
you get through um but but first we still have two stories before we get there so uh loki so

02:30:51.220 --> 02:30:55.380
when would you think they would announce the reveal the new doom game

02:30:55.380 --> 02:31:02.900
well everyone thought quake con and yeah it's gonna be a quake on so uh july 17th you'll see

02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:11.700
you'll get the first look at doom and um yeah is this like doom reboot this is the brand new doom

02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:17.060
game yeah it's you know the one that they have the beta test for in wolfenstein new order yeah

02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:28.100
yeah oh right right um i didn't pick up that game so so yeah cool i mean i don't know um

02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:33.540
hard to say much more until we actually see it right i mean yeah doom is gonna be doom

02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:40.420
um i'm curious to see who's actually doing it if it's actually id software or if they're kind of

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:44.900
outsourcing it like they did with uh wolfenstein newer because wolfenstein newer i hear is pretty

02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:52.340
good yeah so um it'd be interesting to kind of see what it looks like all right well it's a

02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:55.860
classic series that you know we've been waiting for a new title in for a very long time what there

02:31:55.860 --> 02:32:02.740
hasn't been one since this would be doom 4 right uh so what doom 3 was xbox era right so i remember

02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:09.460
owning that on xbox yeah it's xbox pc and then they did the hd remasters of those yeah um so

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:15.220
it's been a while all right well um i think this hopefully it's not as terrible as quake

02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:22.180
4 because quake 4 not so good this is very interesting because uh there's a game on

02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:29.140
uya called chess 2 and uh it will it does not have a synchronous multiplayer it used to

02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:35.620
but what happened is that microsoft issued a court order this recently uh that is levied against the

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:41.300
game's dns management service um this is interesting microsoft apparently seized

02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:48.900
22 of the domains from this no ip dns service that chest 2 ran because there was evidence of malware

02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:53.140
creators distributing harmful software from the subdomains yeah i think it's just they are just

02:32:53.140 --> 02:32:58.260
cutting the collateral damage of that it wasn't oh yeah i'm not saying chest 2 is the cause of this

02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:04.580
but it just because of what's going on over here chest 2 got impacted with this so uh very

02:33:04.580 --> 02:33:08.500
interesting but just in case you didn't know microsoft does have a cyber crime division and

02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:13.380
they do work with law enforcement when there's uh like botnet driven internet attacks that happen

02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:19.060
so yeah chess 2 did come out for the uya in january it is scheduled for a release on the ipad

02:33:19.060 --> 02:33:24.420
and pc versions via steam no word if this is going to set it back at all if they're going to have to

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:30.820
figure something out there so we'll see what happens with chess 2 and if they can get it

02:33:30.820 --> 02:33:35.220
back online now here's my question about chess 2 is it is it just chess or do they like actually

02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:42.020
like i think there's things i think there's some like tweaks to it um i've i looked at it briefly

02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:47.220
but i think there's actually tweaks to it that changed the way it's played very interesting uh

02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:51.860
tiger claw on chat says i use the no ip service they have a free domain service well you might

02:33:51.860 --> 02:33:56.820
want to look into this this might be a little bit a little bit alarming but i guess um i guess the

02:33:56.820 --> 02:34:00.980
ceo of no ip says quote we have been throwing everything we have at getting you back online

02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:05.220
with the light least possible delay for legal reasons we have been restricted from reaching

02:34:05.220 --> 02:34:09.220
out to you but we simply cannot stay quiet any longer we are very close to a resolution and

02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:15.380
we'll update you with more information as soon as we can like chess 2 the sequel is what it's called

02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:24.420
it says compare the chess chess 2 relies much less on memorizing openings and more on positional play

02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:30.100
there are fewer draws and uh the asymmetric gameplay with multiple matchups keeps the game

02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:34.420
fresh and interesting that's kind of cool that somebody although part of this kind of reminds

02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:38.900
me of what was that movie this is really cheesy comedy where they were putting on hamlet 2

02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:44.740
where the guy was like called hamlet 2 oh was that oh the movie was called hamlet 2 okay yeah

02:34:44.740 --> 02:34:50.180
i'm just thinking of demolition i'm not demolition man um last action hero and hamlet's taking out

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:57.780
the trash not to be uh hamlet 2 was one of those like really stupid funny movies where they had

02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:01.780
like rock me sexy jesus and all this i don't even remember like why jesus was in hamlet but he was

02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:09.460
anyway all right uh 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange launch radio the skype line is

02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:50.420

saying that um it's seeking to inspire his students uh dana undertakes to write and produce

02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:59.700
an original play a sequel to hamlet featuring time travel to avoid the deaths of the characters

02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:02.980

02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:02.900
game show what kind of gaming are you doing these cons if any um they actually had a uh a uh

02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:08.020
well here's the thing um one of the local game leagues he'll be here called the color the

02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:14.580
colorado cutthroat connection they had the destiny alpha available there and it is a pretty sweet

02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:20.260
game on the ps4 oh right because that was the weekend like because that whole con happened

02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:24.980
right after e3 so they got their hands on that and had it available for everyone to play that's smart

02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:28.500
because it was only up for a limited time yep i actually got to play it though it's actually a

02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:35.940
mixture of halo meets borderlands too so to speak minus the cortana crap of course i noticed the the

02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:39.700
borderland so i that surprised me because i was expecting destiny to just kind of like be another

02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:44.820
halo type of game but yeah definitely i felt some of that borderlands influence in it so i'm i'm

02:38:44.820 --> 02:38:48.900
excited to see what the final product is like but even the alpha i got killed in the alpha way too

02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:54.180
easy um i got killed like a couple times though but it's pretty it's it's pretty it's pretty

02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:15.220
tonight oh why not i mean that's what the show is for isn't it just you know just driving around

02:41:15.220 --> 02:41:19.540
and sick anyways did i in between dropouts and everything else that i've been dealing with and

02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:25.940
sell coverage and all the concepts did i hear you call superstar wars a good game yes you are

02:41:26.020 --> 02:41:30.980
fucking crazy sir what no you're fucking crazy wait are we thinking the super nintendo game

02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:39.060
yeah yeah super nintendo super star wars empire strike back those games are fucking

02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:45.620
terrible you you just sucked at them that's why you're mad i i'm i'm not i'm not gonna say like

02:41:45.620 --> 02:41:51.460
it's it's funny to make this argument because i played them i will play them again but put

02:41:51.460 --> 02:41:57.700
together those games are very very poorly put together they have a terrible engine they are

02:41:57.700 --> 02:42:03.300
fucking hard i only made any progress on those games because i was a habitual game genie user

02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:10.420
as a kid i remember renting the game i don't think i beat it but i had like a heck of a time with it

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:16.340
over you know uh yeah and then run it and that's the funny part is that that kind of a situation

02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:23.140
can happen but the game is terrible like go back and play it you will be frustrated out of your

02:42:23.140 --> 02:42:27.860
goddamn mind uh you can i'm looking i'm looking at the wiki right now because i wanted to see like

02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:31.940
what the reviews were not that reviewers are the end-all be-all but i wanted to see like where

02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:39.140
kind of opinion lied uh star wars was re-released on virtual console in 2009 uh which i don't know

02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:42.420
if that necessarily means it's still available and that doesn't mean we you that means you have

02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:48.260
to go into the we emulation and grab it out of that store uh but i will say superstar wars was

02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:54.820
awarded best action adventure game of 1992 by electronic gaming monthly as well as best movie

02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:59.220
to game but i don't know anything about like what their average review is but i thought this

02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:05.380
has been a pretty well-received game um and like i said it's not it's not that i it's it's truly

02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:11.780
not that i hate it because i played all three of them a number of times and like i said i will do

02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:17.540
so again but put together like there's something there's something about those games that looking

02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:25.460
at them in hindsight just doesn't really sit well with me um the and and at the same time it's even

02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:32.580
weirder because there was the old the old uh 3d arcade uh star wars where you just pointed at one

02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:39.300
direction of the screen and shot but it's like the good star wars games to me were x-wing x-wing

02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:44.020
versus tie fighter rebel alliance and all those kinds of things star wars empire strikes back

02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:49.940
superstar wars empire strikes back in return the jedi are really like monotonous mindless games

02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:55.060
and it would be it would be a really good idea for you to revisit those you're still going to

02:43:55.860 --> 02:44:01.860
like facets of the game but all told the game is just particularly strange

02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:08.180
well you're getting a very mixed bag in chat uh bobby's threatening to fire you

02:44:08.180 --> 02:44:13.860
from the voice of vog right now there's there's there's characters that aren't in the canon

02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:20.420
the all of the vehicle levels are not that good the game like i said if i did not cheat

02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:26.020
i would not have made any progress in many in large parts of those games i will have to revisit

02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:30.180
these games shortly and tell you if if i still think they hold up all these times later but i

02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:34.340
just remember really enjoying them when i was younger uh ssj100 mad i think kind of sums this

02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:39.540
up well saying a superstar wars was great and terrible at the same time terrible isn't hard

02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:44.020
yeah it it really is a huge conflict like that and i'll tell you what i don't know if you're

02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:48.180
going to have time for this but because i'm here all week depending on when you guys get in this

02:44:48.180 --> 02:44:56.260
weekend let's find an hour sit down and record the games and talk about it because i'm here you can

02:44:56.260 --> 02:45:00.500
come to the office we have ample everything to be able to do this kind of stuff let's sit down and

02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:05.220
play these games again you want because you want to do is a youtube series where we revisit these

02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:10.020
old games i i don't know about a series because i can't commit to that physically but to have the

02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:14.580
two of us in the same place all right revisiting what our memories are just seems like something

02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:18.660
that we can do to take advantage of the fact that i'm out here for the time being all right you're

02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:22.900
on you're on if we have time i would love to do that plus you need to see my office that i'm

02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:29.700
currently parked outside so you know we do we do all right well jason you thank you for sharing

02:45:29.700 --> 02:45:34.580
your opinion it is it is the show where every gamer has a voice even if they are using those

02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:41.620
voices incorrectly it's fine no i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding all right all right well you

02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:46.340
know i have to use my voice more than just 30 seconds of time of show i know i know all right

02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:53.060
act def says hey i'm jason grump i'm sky not so grump oh lord no no no we're doing our own thing

02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:58.420
all right i somehow i knew he was going to make reference to that but in my defense my thoughts

02:45:58.420 --> 02:46:02.660
on that game predates the the reference that he's making is that the game grumps played super

02:46:02.660 --> 02:46:07.540
empire strikes back and and i thought that they went a little overboard on the fact that it is a

02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:15.380
very hard game but my feelings on how the game works predates that by a fair amount so and we

02:46:15.380 --> 02:46:21.620
will have dark sakura with us who is the biggest grump of all we all know that i would don't make

02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:25.540
me get up from this chair welcome to come to i want to hear this deconstruction i want all

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:29.380
40 bucks to be there all right i would say four but i know what the plan already is yeah all

02:46:29.380 --> 02:46:32.900

02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:50.180
super nes and i will play those games yes they were hard but that was a fun kind of hard and

02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:56.020
that's a type of hard difficulty level where you go i bet you'll get one of those professional

02:47:56.020 --> 02:48:04.660
gamers who can play call of duty black ops 2 featuring carl winslow blindfolded one hand who

02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:08.580
can go through the entire game you sit the little bastard right here in front of the super nes with

02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:13.780
the game controller wouldn't know what the fuck to do rob didn't pick you up superstar wars now

02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:17.300
got you super return of the jedi yeah super return of the jedi it's sadly it's in a box

02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:23.220
somewhere but uh yeah we're definitely gonna have to uh uh go revisit the games but look look in in

02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:28.020
jason's defense and i'm gonna i'm gonna just leave jason alone i'm gonna i'm gonna do this whole

02:48:28.020 --> 02:48:35.540
thing there's always some game that everybody seems to like that sometimes we just don't get

02:48:35.540 --> 02:48:39.300
like for me for the longest time that was minecraft like i'm readily admit like all

02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:43.700
these people like going gaga over minecraft and i was like what's so fucking great about minecraft

02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:49.140
kind of gave it a second look and i i finally understood but you know it's it's i i understood

02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:53.860
what he was saying is that you know he's he's not dogging on the games for the present it's it's you

02:48:53.860 --> 02:48:59.220
know the difficulty was so crazy that a lot of people didn't even really get to see the entire

02:48:59.220 --> 02:49:05.060
games well i guess i was one of the lucky ones who did i tell you what i probably won't be able

02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:09.220
to go through the entire game and do it again but i'll sit there and give them my damndest to do it

02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:12.660
you you're you're hardcore my friend that's why

02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:19.780
no i'm not hardcore it's just that there are some games that are out there either they're

02:49:19.780 --> 02:49:25.300
so easy you'll play through all over multiple times where it's so hard that you you just won't

02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:29.380
give up you just play it right through and it's just fun and enjoyable now if you want to talk

02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:34.100
about a game that's a pain in the ass to complete uh the simpsons bark versus space mutants you

02:49:34.340 --> 02:49:39.460
mean to tell me i get through the two the entire level without getting hit twice come on son well

02:49:39.460 --> 02:49:45.780
how about you want like a hard game how about like battle toads or or uh ghosts and goblins or some

02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:51.940
of that insane shit or the fact that rygar didn't have a save feature or even a password feature

02:49:52.580 --> 02:49:58.740
like what the fuck whoops is all i have to say about that exactly exactly all right rama did

02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:03.300
you just call in to yell at jason actually no i wasn't actually going to call in at all because

02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:08.420
i was going to talk about something but since nemesis 47 opened the floodgates to turn the

02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:15.620

working on a little project on the side and i did a soft release on my uh facebook earlier today

02:50:43.780 --> 02:50:50.260
and i'd like to announce that i am working on a brand new podcast yay you're becoming a bigger

02:51:04.260 --> 02:51:09.300
saya yachting cow and my friend yosinex every other week when there's an episode we're going

02:51:09.300 --> 02:51:14.740
to sit down for about a good 45 minutes have some tea have some coffee some scones and we're just

02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:20.420
going to discuss the episode compare between the original anime the manga what we liked and what

02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:25.860
we didn't like pretty much nice so is this just going to be a limited run show while we have the

02:51:25.860 --> 02:51:32.580
new series on air yes it will be a limited run show for as long as the series is going gotcha

02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:37.300
so it's kind of like my side project reading is fundamental for drag race which all things

02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:43.940
considered drag race and sailor moon aren't that much different um well when you get the sailor

02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:50.020

olr is where you can find us on twitter uh while i quickly check for tweets let me check in with

02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:55.220
loki and see if there's any last minute stories to get to tonight oh my god some of the things

02:54:55.220 --> 02:54:59.380
that are on kickstarter you'll never believe there's a brand new game that someone's trying

02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:04.580
to kickstart uh called coffin dodgers it's about elderly people racing in go-karts

02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:13.300
nice yes so that's that's interesting and then also there's a kickstarter for potato salad

02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:19.220
because you know we haven't abused kickstarter enough someone kickstarted potato salad for

02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:25.860
ten dollars and it's already up to like six grand but kickstarter makes they're five percent or

02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:32.660
whatever so hey and i mean it's aside for the fact that it's satire i understand that

02:55:32.660 --> 02:55:36.260
and people are backing it but it's not necessarily people will go through with it

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:44.420
it's still technically a fun my life project but it's just it's so stupid and it's just gonna get

02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:49.540
people to i mean why don't i do that i mean shit okay i'm gonna make myself a hamburger

02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:52.020
done kickstarter for 10 bucks

02:55:54.180 --> 02:55:59.460
free money yeah better be a tasty burger it will be for six thousand dollars uh we didn't get a

02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:03.700
lot of tweets this week but i do notice that pika uno uh sent us a few tweets i want to make sure

02:56:03.700 --> 02:56:08.660
i read these uh because he was referencing those emails we had about uh gaming in belgium remember

02:56:08.660 --> 02:56:13.780
that so pika uno uh tweeted us and said shame on you for last week's brussels sprouts pun

02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:19.460
also belgium is huge on comic books and stuff but the belgian people i know pretty much buy

02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:26.340
all their stuff from amazon and online uh and pikaruna wants us to know hello i'm the person

02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:32.260
who bought eye of judgment at a massive discount which is really the best way to buy eye of

02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:39.860
judgment if you're gonna buy eye of judgment the best way is to huh for someone to pay you to get

02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:47.380
rid of it please take this off my hands so here's this in a coupon one last bit of uh news here if

02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:55.140
you're looking to purchase an xbox um well the connect version two the one that came with the

02:56:55.140 --> 02:57:00.580
xbox one and you don't have one with your system or if you want it for pc i'm assuming this is just

02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:05.780
for pc right now but pre-orders are up for it now it's going to cost you two hundred dollars

02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:12.180
so that's a little expensive whoa the new ones are two hundred dollars two hundred dollars

02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:17.860
that's interesting is that really trying to encourage people to buy the xbox one that have

02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:22.660
it bundled i don't know but it's directly from microsoft and um you can purchase

02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:29.140
if we're compatible with the pc uh that's going to be available september uh july 15th

02:57:32.820 --> 02:57:36.420
all right well we'll see how well that works out how the sales that works for them

02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:41.060
that's a little expensive a little expensive and honestly i mean for what

02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:49.140
um and i don't even know are the stanley because they haven't really announced the price yet for

02:57:49.140 --> 02:57:54.340
the standalone sensors for the xbox one so is it also gonna be 200 because that doesn't make any

02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:59.940
fucking sense you drop the price of the system 100 and you sell the sensor for 200 that doesn't

02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:05.460
make any sense and don't give me this shit that you know going from xbox one the pc that cable

02:58:05.460 --> 02:58:10.180
or whatever is 100 bucks because that doesn't make any fucking sense either so i don't know i'm

02:58:10.180 --> 02:58:15.620
gonna be interested to see what their excuse is connect one still 100 yeah it's still 100 bucks

02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:20.980
uh maybe that's why it's sold no it doesn't make any sense reduce the price of connect one because

02:58:20.980 --> 02:58:25.220
no one's buying it anyways you can buy them used fuck i have one that i want to sell you so

02:58:25.940 --> 02:58:30.580
i don't know interesting all right i'm sure more on this will develop oh here here's the best part

02:58:30.580 --> 02:58:35.620
the connects the connect for windows v2 sensor does not ship with any software is intended for

02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:42.420
use with connect for windows uh sdk 2.0 licensed separately oh so what the fuck am i paying for

02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:49.060
that 200 is just for the sensor because you have to license the sdk hopefully some clarity will

02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:52.660
come to this in the coming days this seems a little ridiculous for right now maybe there's

02:58:52.660 --> 02:58:56.900
got to be something something else to this all right for now though we're going to wrap up uh

02:58:56.900 --> 02:59:00.420
we got to get out of here it's it's after nine o'clock on the west coast and after midnight on
