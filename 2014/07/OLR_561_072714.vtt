Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
As more summer conventions have come and gone, more details about our favorite games have come to light, more rumors confirm, more plot points teased, and more availability of our favorite classics.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
The theme of this week is more, and we'll tell you about all this and more on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live on this July the 27th, 2014 with the 561st episode of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-host, unfortunately not here tonight, DarkSakura.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
DarkSakura is a little bit sick and she's trying to rest up tonight, so she can be all better to go back to work tomorrow.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
But I do have here in studio, TechMasterLoki.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Hey Loki, how are you?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm fine.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, you know what's weird is that I'm feeling a little bit sniffly too. I don't think it's anything like contagious, I wouldn't worry, but it's just, yeah this is weird. Something in the air.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
It's like a summer sinus infection or something, I don't know, I hope not, I shouldn't curse myself like that, but bleh.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Just the dry air.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, you're the one with kids, you're the one that's supposed to always be sick.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And I am sometimes.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Maybe I'm just getting delayed con play.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
I get like random fevers every now and then. Like earlier this week I'm like, why am I dizzy?

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Wait, I have a fever, why do I have a fever? I'm not even sick, that's weird.

01:38.000 --> 01:49.000
Well I was really surprised that I didn't come back from GamerX2 sick, because like every convention you come back sick, that's to be expected, but unless I've been fighting this off for like two weeks, this is a while ago now.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
Which by the way, I want to give a cheap plug to The Voice of Geeks Network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:57.000 --> 02:10.000
vognetwork.com, that's vognetwork.com, and over at vognetwork.com, not only are there lots of other great shows that you can hear about all different things geek, all over the spectrum, movies, gaming, anime, you know, what have you.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
We also occasionally have some other things posted as well. We have a great TV reviews section of the website that's done by John and his posse over at Critical Myth.

02:19.000 --> 02:30.000
But we also, we started to dip our toe into the water of video coverage, thanks to our pal Eddie from Starboard Power Coupling, which is another show on the network all about Star Trek.

02:30.000 --> 02:39.000
They actually call it Starboard Power Coupling, the Star Trek podcast you hope doesn't fail. And that's a joke if you've ever watched Star Trek, I'll let that one simmer for the ultra nerds in the room.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
But Eddie over there, very talented video guy, and he offered to come to GamerX and shoot some things and, you know, even he was like, Rob, you should get up and do some interviews.

02:48.000 --> 02:59.000
And I was like, no, no, no, I feel fat. I don't want to be on camera and all that stuff. But he, you know, he really encouraged me and he put together some really great little YouTubes that we have up at vognetwork.com that you can check out.

02:59.000 --> 03:11.000
And it's, if you are having trouble finding it, I don't know how, because it's the first image that comes up, you see that infamous cosplay of the two gals from GamerX who did the too hard to render cardboard boxes where they're all in black, right?

03:11.000 --> 03:23.000
With all the Assassin's Creed propaganda. Just click on that and it's going to take you to all the videos, which early in the week, we just had like a little five minute montage, but now there's a bunch of interviews that I did with various cosplayers, some other podcasters, like our pal from Gameboi.org.

03:23.000 --> 03:35.000
Captain's, excuse me. I told you I was sick. Oh, horrible radio. Radio guy's worst enemy. Sorry. Captain's pipe from Gameboi.org and Jonko from Koopa Club amongst some cosplayers.

03:35.000 --> 03:44.000
So you can check that all out again at vognetwork.com. So yeah, I'm hoping we get to do more video coverage later, but big, big props and thanks to Eddie again for that.

03:45.000 --> 03:56.000
Let's talk a little bit about video games. So before we get into how was your gaming week, the types of video games that we've been playing this week, let's talk a little bit about Comic-Con, because Comic-Con's on everybody's minds right now.

03:56.000 --> 04:07.000
And obviously there's a lot of general geek stuff. We don't get into a lot of the, well, who am I kidding? We go on tangents all the time on non-geek stuff. So let's do another one real quick. What are some of the really cool things you've seen come out of Comic-Con so far?

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, the last cool thing I saw that come out of Comic-Con was the trailer for Mad Max, which is pretty sweet.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I like the Batman and Superman thing.

04:19.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, I'm not so... I know they had that leaked shot showing, I guess, some armored Batman thing. I don't know yet. I haven't seen Ben Affleck.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, it's from one of the comics. There's a leaked thing out there.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah, I saw that, but I kind of want to see the trailer. I'd be curious to see.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You know what everybody hated the idea of?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I don't hate the idea of...

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
This is really bad, Loki. Keep talking. I gotta get water. Live radio, everybody.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
No, I don't hate the idea of Ben Affleck being, you know, Bruce Wayne or Batman. It's just I haven't seen how it looks yet.

04:50.000 --> 05:02.000
So I don't know what kind of Batman to expect. I mean, because there's been a whole gamut of Batmans in movies, you know, from campy to, you know, gritty, I guess.

05:02.000 --> 05:14.000
And so I don't know where he falls into the spectrum of that. And I think even coming off of, you know, the last three movies where you have just like, you know, the really dark Batman.

05:14.000 --> 05:26.000
I mean, anything different than that's kind of like, what? Because, I mean, when they're doing the Joel Schumacher films and even like the Burton stuff, it's very different, I guess.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
I like the Christian Bale Batman. I did, despite the whole, you know, crime dog McGruff. Or what was that guy? Only you can prevent crime. Take a bite out of crime.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Always kind of Batman in the new movies. So despite all of that, he was one of my more favorite Batman materials.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm hoping Ben Affleck is a little more like that or Michael Keaton because nobody liked the idea of Michael Keaton doing Batman either and he was great.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
I think, honestly, probably the best one they had. And a little less George Clooney.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
But George Clooney, that was more the fault of the movie than necessarily George Clooney.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
But speaking of Batman, one of my very favorite things to come out of Comic-Con, the announcement of the 60s series on Blu-ray.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
And they actually had the old stars out parading to promote it, which was awesome.

06:10.000 --> 06:22.000
That's pretty sweet. I mean, he's so old though now. Like I saw, they showed a shot of Adam West. I'm like, oh my God, he is so old now.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
He's 83, I believe I read.

06:24.000 --> 06:36.000
But I would have loved to see a superhero show where it's just like, they took the villains and the superheroes from the 60s show and just threw them into modern day.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
They have almost like Austin Powers. They have no concept of the future and reality and stuff.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
And their schemes are just really lo-fi and just kind of cheesy and stupid.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
You know what? Julie Newmar was there too. You know, the OG Catwoman. I mean, obviously there was a few others too. Lee Meriwether, Eartha Kitt.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
But Julie Newmar was there. And you know, I know this is going to sound really weird to you guys, but just hear me out for a minute.

07:01.000 --> 07:10.000
She looks great for like 82 or however old she is. She's like really gorgeous for 82. I mean, obviously she's old.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
But she's still like rocking those dresses with a plunging neckline and all that stuff.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I mean like, you know, you go. You go.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
And nowadays the neckline really has to plunge.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Ha! You ass.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
Um, let's see. What other things did I see out of there? I mean, I don't know.

07:31.000 --> 07:41.000
I had the intention of watching like the Marvel livestream and stuff and then they just, it started and it was so boring.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Like they were just talking about like their toy line and product and I just didn't fucking care.

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
I just wanted to see like panels and like movie stuff and I don't know, stuff that's interesting. But it just was really boring.

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
The one thing everybody's talking about is the whole Wonder Woman redesign quickly. What did you think about that?

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I don't know. I didn't really look that closely.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
I didn't think it was bad at all. Like I was not expecting the whole red and blue jumpsuit 70s Linda Carter look.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
Like I knew that they were not going to go with that type of look so that they were going to kind of make it a little more edgy.

08:22.000 --> 08:30.000
So I don't hate it. But the fact that it's all brown and the way it looks, she really does look like Xena Warrior Princess.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
You know what I mean? Like all she's missing, if she had the little chakra instead of the sword, like she would look like Xena Warrior Princess.

08:38.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, I mean, it's not bad. Now I love Xena, so it's not bad. But I was surprised they didn't try to incorporate a little bit of red and blue into it. But I guess, all right, whatever.

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
You know, what I thought was kind of neat was the, well, actually no, I don't think it's neat now that I think of it.

08:55.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't know. I guess they're trying, I don't know if they're trying to refresh everything or if they're just trying to like, I don't know.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
What's up with, you know, making, you know, not making Thor a woman, but like changing the character to a woman.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
Not as, I guess it's not changing, but a new person is taking over, you know, as Thor a woman.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
And then they also have, you know, the new Captain America and stuff. It's almost like, now I don't have a problem with them changing up characters like that.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
It's just, it's, to me, it feels like they're doing it to like, we need to be more diverse. We need to be more diverse.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
You know, it's like they're playing the diversity card versus like, it makes sense in the story.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
And it very well makes sense in the story since I don't, I don't read it, so I don't know.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
But it just seems like, you know, oh, we're playing diversity card here.

09:43.000 --> 09:52.000
To be fair, they do need to be more diverse, to be fair. I mean, it does, when they do it all at once, when it's like a once and everything goes,

09:52.000 --> 10:01.000
I can kind of see where it gives that impression where it's like, all right, but I mean, they kind of, the comic book world kind of needs this.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
So I'm okay with it. It's not, it's not abnormal for multiple characters.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah, I'm not saying I'm not okay with it. It just seems kind of obvious, you know what I mean?

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
It's not like, oh, you know, this makes sense. Like, oh, we could see, we could have seen this coming, you know?

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
It's just kind of like, strange. I don't know.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm very curious to see how all those changes affect the movie and game universe, although I kind of think they won't right away.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Maybe the game universe a little sooner than the movies. I don't think the movies are going to change any casting.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
I saw that someone had mentioned, was it in the trailer for the new Lego Batman game?

10:37.000 --> 10:46.000
They had, was it Superman and Wonder Woman were dating in there, and they also had their new, the new 52 outfits on.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
So that's kind of cool that they're already adapting that kind of stuff into the game world already.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah. And there's always different comics going on too. I think that's one thing that, you know, I don't, I don't profess to know a lot about comics.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Unfortunately, Jamie isn't here. She's probably the heaviest reader of comics out of all of us.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
But my understanding is there's, there's all these different storylines across all these different comics.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Like there isn't just like one Batman comic. There's a lot of different comics that have Batman in them and all these different stories,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
new, old, and so forth, that go on kind of all at the same time.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
So, you know, usually these big, like, like the whole Archie getting killed thing, right?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
You heard about this? Archie's going to get killed off.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah, I saw that.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
But that's, that's not like, like, nope. It's not like a high school shooter has taken him out or anything.

11:31.000 --> 11:40.000
It's this new Archie, this, this different storyline they have, the new Archie, where I think like in one, it's like this bi-universe thing.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But he did get shot.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
In the, in the new Archie, yes. But there's still other comics for Archie, Archie that exist where I think he's going to get killed.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
I think, come on, Archie fought zombies at one point, so come on, it's not like it's, it's, we can't take it that seriously.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
I mean, and obviously, and here's the other thing too, it's a comic book. Doesn't mean he's going to stay dead.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
I mean, fuck, they've killed Superman off one time, probably multiple times.

12:06.000 --> 12:14.000
I, one time at least I have the issue for, but, but he came back. I mean, it's, whatever, it's for publicity.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Because, seriously, who gives a fuck about Archie comics right now? Most people probably don't.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Me, I love Josie and the Pussycats, that's my favorite.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
Okay, but seriously, you know, one, but now, you know, this makes headlines, oh fuck, I got, I used to love Archie, you know, when I was a kid.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Many, many, many, many years ago. I'm going to read this now, and then he comes back.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
I mean, so, Archie's also been usually pretty progressive as far as comic books go.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Like, he was one of the first that incorporated a gay character into this main storyline, so, you know, for that I appreciate it.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
Anyway, alright, so people are going to be like, I thought this was a video game show. Look, we do tangents all the time.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
Let's talk about video games at Comic Con, because it does seem like they're becoming more and more and more prevalent.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
Like, I really, like, usually when Comic Con season comes around, I have friends that go and I'm kind of like, oh yeah, that looks like a lot of fun.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I think I'd like to go someday, but I don't really feel like I'm missing anything.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
Like, I can kind of read about it on the internet or whatever, but, like, this year I'm starting to feel like, I really feel like I'm missing things.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
Because a lot of, sorry guys, I have, like, hiccups and all this going on at the same time, I'm very sorry.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
I feel like I'm missing things. Like, Nintendo's done all this, like, streaming, and they've done some announcements at the Comic Con.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
There's been other game companies, you know, showing their games there.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Smash Bros. characters announced, because I didn't pay attention.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
I don't think there were new characters announced, but they were definitely showing, like, more of, like, the game interface and more of the game itself.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I think they announced stages.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I think they're talking more like the 3DS version this time around.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, yeah, because that's out sooner rather than later.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah, true.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
So, why do you think Comic Con is getting more and more game content?

13:51.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, I think it's more of, it's spun off into more of just, like, entertainment and almost, like, consumerism.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Just because, you know, it all ties in very well together.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
You have comic books, you have toys, and, you know, the licensed properties.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
So, you have toys, TV, just to say, it all kind of melds together, you know.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Pretty much anything that you're going to be buying stuff from.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
Of course, you're going to want to see, you know, this video game, you know, that might tie in with this.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
Now, why Nintendo is necessarily a Comic Con that I don't understand entirely, but whatever, they're there. Cool.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
But, like, you know, definitely I understand, you know, the tie-ins with, like, you know, Disney Infinity.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
You know, they're showing off the Marvel stuff there.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
They announced their collector's edition, the release date of the 23rd.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I don't know where we heard that before.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And just, like, a bunch of other things like that.

14:44.000 --> 14:53.000
So, it's... I understand that stuff, just because, you know, they were showing off, like, toys and all sorts of, you know, stuff like that.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
I will say the other thing that I really dig that's coming out of Comic Con is superhero-related sales.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Because PlayStation Network, having a big sale right now.

15:01.000 --> 15:09.000
I don't know if Microsoft is, but I know on PlayStation Network, I just picked up before the show tonight for $18.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
$18. I got the Injustice Ultimate Edition and Lego Marvel Super Heroes for $18 on PlayStation 4.

15:17.000 --> 15:27.000
Like, Injustice Ultimate Edition is, like, $8 for PlayStation Plus subscribers and Marvel Ultimate Heroes or whatever Lego is $10.50 or something like that.

15:27.000 --> 15:35.000
So, I was like, yeah, sales. I'm liking how Sony's trying to kind of do their own sort of Steam sales as of late.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
They've done had some really deep discounts on the service.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah, that's cool.

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
I'm looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com because, again, we do tape live on Sunday nights right after Bobby Black Wolf at the vognetwork.com.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Wyland says, I took advantage of that sale.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
And Tech 2030 says, I got Injustice on Vita for $4.20.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
$4.20.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Wyland says, Injustice for $8 is a steal. I know, I can't wait.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
I actually, I haven't played it at all, so I'm really excited about it, actually.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Plus, you get all the, uh...

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
And your stream is not skipping. I still have hiccups, which is the worst enemy of somebody trying to do live radio, so I apologize.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And you have all the extra characters in there, too.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah, exactly. Scorpion and all that stuff, right? That'll be fun.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
Alright, I guess that's gonna do it for our Comic-Con talk for now. I'd like to still go into future.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
We'll cover some of the news that came out of the expo a little later on in the show.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week. Loki.

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
Alright, I only played a couple things. I played, you know, the Destiny beta, at least very, very minimally.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
I literally played just the first level and that's it.

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
It was after I got done playing our weekly Call of Duty match and stuff.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
I was like, you know what? I have, you know, I know the beta's going on right now.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
I'm gonna, you know, jump in and see, you know, what I can play before I have to go to bed here.

17:07.000 --> 17:16.000
And so, I played through the first, like, you know, set of missions or whatever before you get to, kind of like, little hub world type thing.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
And it was cool. I don't know, I like it. You know, I'd probably have to adjust some of the settings, you know, as far as, you know, movement speed and stuff.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
But it seemed to be, you know, kind of fun and I enjoyed it.

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
Even Ghost didn't seem that, you know, annoying as far as, you know, the voice work and stuff. It seemed fine to me.

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
So, and I have, you know, because I only played it on PlayStation 3, I thought it looked good on PlayStation 3 even.

17:41.000 --> 17:49.000
So, I don't know. It was pretty cool. Would I pick it up when it comes out? Maybe. I don't know.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
It's definitely a game I'd look at for the, you know, next, you know, for the holiday. But I don't know.

17:57.000 --> 18:05.000
We'll see. I mean, I don't want to dedicate myself to, like, an MMO because it's just, it's a time save.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
Oh, now, Loki, we just got into this on Bobby's show. It's not an MMO, though, because you're not, it's not persistently...

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
It's online and they keep adding new missions to it. That's pretty much like an MMO, okay?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It has MMO elements, we'll say that.

18:18.000 --> 18:34.000
Whatever. And then I played one stage of Mario Kart 8 because I was actually passing by a kiosk at GameStop and I wanted my son to try it, but he was chickening out, so I got to play a track in it.

18:34.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't even remember which track it was. It was, like, some beachside town thing. And so I played that and it was pretty cool.

18:43.000 --> 18:54.000
You know, I dig it. It looks very nice. And actually, since I haven't really played anything on the Wii U, the controller, I wasn't too, I thought it was pretty comfortable.

18:54.000 --> 19:05.000
It wasn't, like, I thought at first, you know, the analog sticks above the buttons, that's gonna be really strange, but it wasn't actually that bad.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
So, I don't know, maybe I'll, I'm still looking at picking up a Wii U maybe at some point in 2015.

19:12.000 --> 19:21.000
But, I don't know, if I end up getting one earlier, you know, Mario Kart will definitely be something I'll purchase with it. So we'll see.

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
We still don't know what kind of sweet holiday deals they might do. You know, not even necessarily a price drop, but maybe, like, game inclusion and things like that.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah, I'm sure they'll have, like, a bundle. Probably, like, Smash Brothers or something.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
That seems like a given. Maybe a special color or something for Smash Brothers. Like, a red Wii U or something.

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
I don't know, yeah. And then I played Call of Duty Mario World for two. A little bit. So, I did that.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
There's a question from Tech 2030 in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com who asks, can Destiny be played offline single player?

19:52.000 --> 20:02.000
No. I don't think so, no. I think because I noticed it tries to connect to the server when you're playing. I was having problems playing earlier today and it actually kicked me out.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
But they warned everybody. They said, we're doing some tests today and you might get a lot of disconnects. It's a beta, deal with it type of thing.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
And sure enough, I got disconnected and I could see that it kept trying to connect. I couldn't do anything when I wasn't online.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I'm pretty sure it's online only.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah. So, I don't know. There might be some people that feel very strongly anti-Destiny because of that. And that's understandable.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
But they have worked a lot of multiplayer elements into it.

20:26.000 --> 20:35.000
It would be cool if they treated it kind of like Fable or something like that where you could play offline by yourself.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
But if you want to join other players and you have to be online connected or something like that, I don't know.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
But, yeah. I think it is online only.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
That's it. That's all I played this week.

20:47.000 --> 20:55.000
Hopefully, I will be playing more stuff this week because we've got our company game summit thing and we have publishers coming out and I get to play stuff.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
That'll be fun.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Maybe. I don't know. Each year they bring less and less.

20:59.000 --> 21:09.000
Probably, I'm guessing, because Tecmo Koei always brings something, so I'm guessing I'll play Samurai Warriors 3 Ultimate.

21:09.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm guessing they'll bring out. I think that's really the only upcoming game they have in Samurai Warriors 4.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
Alright. Well, that's cool because not a lot of people get to get those sneak peeks. So, I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on that.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
My gaming week, real quick. Sorry, you'll have to deal with my hiccups a little bit.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
I'm trying to drink water really fast while Loki's talking and, unfortunately, without Jamie here, it's only the two of us.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
So, I have to deal.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
But, I've been playing the Destiny online beta like a Loki did for a little bit, but I played a lot more.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
In fact, I actually hit the max level you can in the beta, level 8.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
So, that was pretty cool.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
I also was able to play on Saturday when they were doing the stress test at 2 o'clock.

21:49.000 --> 21:57.000
And, the way they guaranteed that they get as many people online as possible was that they opened up a new single player level for only two hours.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
And, they also opened up the beta to everybody.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Oh yeah, just before. Yeah, they did.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
So, they did open up the beta to everybody and they opened up the extra level, so they had the moon level.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
So, sadly, I thought that might mean they upped the level cap as well, but they didn't, unfortunately.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
So, I was only able to play that one level on the moon, but that was still really...

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Did they have the music?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
From DuckTales? No, I wish. I would have made it even more.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
I kind of want to take my PlayStation 4 footage, because you know what records, and put the DuckTales theme behind it.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I think it would have made it even more epic.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
But, the music in Destiny is great. It's really, you know, it's very high intensity in some places.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
And, you know, kind of more ambient when it needs to be. It's very well done.

22:39.000 --> 22:46.000
Which makes the staffing changes at Bungie even more interesting considering how good the music is.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
Didn't really touch a lot of PvP after last weekend, because I just didn't like it.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
But, I liked the PvE stuff a lot and had a good time.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
I was playing with friends on Saturday on the moon.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
And, the nice thing about that stage is it's one of the first ones I can remember where you can take someone else's vehicle,

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
and the vehicles actually fire, like some of the vehicles in Halo did, so you can actually attack enemies using the vehicle.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
So, that was kind of fun to drive around and shoot things with those lasers.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah, and then you go to this temple on the moon and you go inside, and that was basically it.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
Because they only had the one story mission, you could not go anything past the one.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
So, but that was still neat to be able to see that and experience the beta.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
And, you know, I talked about it at length last week, so I don't have a whole lot else to add.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
Except that I am convinced now I will buy the game when it comes out, for sure.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
I will pre-order it very soon here, probably from, I don't usually believe in pre-ordering games,

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
but I'll probably just get it on Amazon or something where, you know, I usually buy my games and it'll just show up here on release day.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Because I don't usually, I'm too old to start, to do the midnight releases and all that stuff.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I really don't get any value out of that for me, so.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
Yeah, Destiny. Otherwise, I've been playing some older games.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Well, Final Fantasy XIV, that's a given.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Although, I quit my raid group this weekend, so I'll probably be playing a lot less XIV.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
Nothing dramatic, I just, I don't know, the fight, like we were really banging our head against

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
the Ramu extreme, you know, over and over and over again.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It just, it wasn't, I wasn't having a lot of fun. Like, I like the guys that I was playing with,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and sometimes girls too, that I was playing with.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Are you still doing XI?

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
What? Um, I didn't stop doing XI, my account's still active, I haven't been playing it actively,

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
but I've been trying to log in a couple times a week to get my little login points,

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
but I probably will play XI a little bit.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
But now the pressure is really off of me and XIV to really, like, gear up my character

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
and be the best that I can be and all that.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
And so I can really just enjoy the game at a leisurely pace, which is how I kind of want to do it,

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
because I really am falling behind in other games because I keep playing too many MMOs,

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
which, I love MMOs, I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I play a lot of them in my spare time

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
because that's what I choose to do, but there are a lot of single-player games on Final Fantasy XIV.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I know, you haven't played any Grand Theft Auto V.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
I haven't, well now I'm, now I can legitimately say I'm waiting for that PlayStation 4 release,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
because why not at this point, right?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I'm waiting for that PlayStation 4 release.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Tech 2030 in chat asks, wait, is XI free to play? No it is not.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
God, if it was, I would be playing it, well not now, but I would have been playing it earlier today.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
You can catch the whole thing, like the whole collection on Steam.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Like five bucks, man.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Or Amazon download games, pretty cheap when there is a sale going on.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
So I recommend, keep an eye out for that because you get a free month with that if you're at all interested in XI.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
But remember, XI is a very different game. XI is more EverQuest, XIV is more WoW.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
There's a big, big difference between the way those games are set up, just be prepared for it.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
Why won't these hiccups stop? What did I do to deserve this?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Now I'm going to get all these comments in chat.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Just try holding your breath, just try being upside down.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I can't, I'm trying to do a radio show.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Anyway, older games I've been checking out this week.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I played Dead Island, very random, right?

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
But Steam was doing a Dead Island weekend where it's like free to play.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
I already own the game because I think there was like a deep silver bundle thing, humble bundle.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Yeah, there was. I probably have that actually then.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I picked that up, but here was my bright idea.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
I said, if that's the game they're doing a free weekend on on Steam and it's a deep discount and all this stuff,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
then there's going to be a lot of people trying to get the trading cards.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
So I'm going to activate all my trading cards by playing the game.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
And then I'll get some booster packs, which that strategy worked horrifically.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
I have not gotten any booster packs from Steam, so that's the last time I tried that big idea.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
But I did get a chance to kind of go back and revisit Dead Island.

26:42.000 --> 26:50.000
Honestly guys, I know I talked about the sequel a lot on OLR and I was not really a big fan.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
But this was the first time I played the Dead Island, the original, on PC as opposed to a console.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
And I do like controlling it a lot better in the whole keyboard and mouse environment and some of the controls,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
so I did enjoy that a lot more.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
But Dead Island just kind of isn't a game that really does it for me.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I mean, there's a lot of ideas and things I like about it.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
I like that it's open world. I like that it's kind of like the RPGs stuff.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
But for me it gets really repetitive really fast, which sounds horrible to say because I know they have a variety of weapons.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
I know they have all these different ways you can combine weapons.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
I don't even think that's bad to say, because look at Dead Rising.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
I get bored with that game too, and that game looked fantastic.

27:28.000 --> 27:37.000
I even went out with, oh, I'm going to pick up the one that's basically off the record or whatever,

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
and it's got a sandbox mode, you can just do whatever you want, you don't have to worry about anything.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
And it was so boring. I'm like, how is this game so boring?

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
I love the first, when I played the demo, I loved the demo so much.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And it's just so boring.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
I felt very similar about it. You know what I think it is, Loki?

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
I don't know how many people I speak for with this, but I think we're just kind of over zombie games.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm over it. Zombie games, just the zombie fascination in general, I'm over it.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
But then again, the new Dead Island game, actually when I was seeing the little preview at E3,

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
I was like, oh, that does look really pretty and it looks fun, but I worry it's going to suffer from the same thing.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
Just because it's prettier doesn't mean it's going to suddenly hold my interest.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
So we'll see. I'll still approach it with an open mind whenever it comes out.

28:29.000 --> 28:39.000
There was that, and I also, much thanks to my partner Alan and my roommate Shane, their coercion,

28:39.000 --> 28:47.000
I've gone back and tried a BioWare classic, Dragon Age, which I'd played a little bit before on PC,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
but my old PC really couldn't handle the damn game.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
You might remember I got my PC upgraded not that long ago, so I'm trying it again.

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
And it's a lot, what's weird, I tried it on my PC and I tried it on PlayStation 3, and I kind of see the perks to both.

29:03.000 --> 29:10.000
I kind of enjoy lying on the couch in a cooler room like the living room is with the controller in my hand playing it.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
I like that, but there's also a lot of graphical hiccups and frame skips that I see in the PlayStation 3 version.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
So now I have to kind of decide which one do I want to play further. Do I want to play PC or PlayStation 3?

29:22.000 --> 29:30.000
I think I'm going to go with PlayStation 3 just because it's a more comfortable environment for a game that supposedly I'm going to sink hundreds of hours on, but we'll see.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I do like the way the PC one looks, though.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
I kind of been thinking about going back to Skyrim.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Have you?

29:37.000 --> 29:45.000
I'm going to get stuck in there, because once you play Skyrim, you don't just play for a little bit, you play for several hundred hours.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
I'm surprised they never did one more last hurrah DLC for Skyrim, but I guess...

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
They don't need to, man, on PC there's so much stuff that you can get for free.

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
Anyhow, 5th Dream in Chat says, I got notification that Dragon Age Inquisition is coming out November 18th, 16th. Can't remember, but it's nice to have a date.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
18th.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
It got pushed back, too. I don't think it's in our show world, but that was some news that came out just last week.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
It was originally on October 7th.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Yeah, they had to...

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
The $300 day.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Yeah, they pushed it back six weeks to finish the tweaks on it.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Hopefully that gives me enough time, because this is the exact same thing that happened with Mass Effect 3.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
I got into the series right before 3 came out.

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
So I played 1, I played 2, and by the time I was ready to play 3, the game was only a week old.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
So I was able to play 3 and enjoy it, and even experience that first ending that everybody hated.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So I got to experience that before Extindica was out.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
It seems like the same thing is happening with Dragon Age. I don't know, let's just hope Dragon Age Inquisition has a great ending.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
We'll see.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
I'm glad that they delayed a game that they thought wasn't finished.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
Well, it wasn't just that, it was Battlefield, which was probably the more surprising of the two, honestly.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, Battlefield... I guess they needed more time on that.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yeah.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
It's probably... I don't know.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Hey, anything to avoid the fuckery of the first one, right?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That is true.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
But at the same time, they would just probably have a lot of stuff coming out around the same time.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
And it is smarter to move it to a slower period where they can get more sales out of it.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
That's what they did with Mass Effect 3.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
It came out in March, so it makes sense.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah, because literally it was on the 7th, they had so many games coming out.

31:25.000 --> 31:39.000
They had, at one point, it was Middle Earth, Shadow of Mordor, Alien Isolation, NBA 2K15, NBA Live 15, Dragon Age Inquisition.

31:40.000 --> 31:48.000
God, I want to say that there was also... God, what was the other game? There's another Namco RPG.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
This isn't that surprising. Tales of Azealia 2? Is that out that now?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
No, Azealia 2 is...

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
That's out sooner. That's like the end of August.

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
Yeah. But anyway, this isn't too surprising, though, because once you kind of get over Labor Day,

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
like the summer is usually a little bit of a drought, but once you start to get to the end of August and Labor Day,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
that's when the holiday season is really beginning.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
I mean, it really is beginning there, and it's just all the games getting out to be on shelves come Black Friday.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
And there's still plenty that they keep adding crap in there,

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
and there's also a lot of stuff right now that's still to be announced,

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
date-wise, that could still fall in there somewhere.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Tech 2030 in our chat says,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
February-March seems to be a big two months for games nowadays.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite both released around that time in 2013.

32:32.000 --> 32:39.000
Yeah, I think people are finding that people want to play games year round just like they want to see movies year round.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Well, February...

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Movies. Big summer movies are coming out in March now.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Like, the typical summer movies are coming out in March and April now, and they're doing just fine.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
Well, March is usually the end of the financial year for a lot of companies,

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
and fourth quarter is the other big thing, so that's why they push this.

32:56.000 --> 33:03.000
And next year, in February, in Movies 50 Shades of Grey, the movie, the trailer just released this week,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
you know that's going to be huge.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
Because I'm going to go see it, just because I love bad movies.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
I love John Waters movies and cult movies. I love bad movies.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
50 Shades of Grey is going to be hilarious.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
It's going to be intense.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Very intense.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
Intense. That's the adjective of the book.

33:20.000 --> 33:27.000
Even the trailer. I love the Beyonce crazy love remix that they used in the trailer, don't get me wrong,

33:27.000 --> 33:33.000
but in my head, all I could hear while I was watching the 50 Shades of Grey trailer was the American Horror Story theme song.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Have you ever heard that song?

33:35.000 --> 33:42.000
It's just like all this noise. That's all I could hear was like creepy stalker music.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I haven't watched that yet. I should really do that.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
Oh god. Especially the coven is hilarious. It's just like camp.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
But the first and second season are pretty scary.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
I really like Zachary Quinto though.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Me too, but we probably like him in different ways I'm thinking, Loogie.

33:58.000 --> 34:07.000
He's just such a... I'm sorry, I fell in love with him as an actor with Cyler.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
He was just a fucking great character.

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
And seriously one of the best parts of Heroes until they decided to say, poop on Heroes.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
For me it was so notorious, but I mean probably two people out there even know what the fuck I'm talking about with that, so whatever.

34:21.000 --> 34:26.000
Yeah. I think I know what that's about.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
That was the Tori Spelling sitcom on VH1.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
Oh god, no. No, but seriously he's a fucking awesome actor.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
No, he's great.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I just watch anything that he's in.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Shane met him at Comic Con, speaking of Comic Con and things like that.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Shane met him at Comic Con a couple years ago.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Cool.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Little bastard.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Alright, anyway.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
That's it for my Game of the Week. Let's get into some news, but first some quick plugs and housekeeping.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
On Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
And on YouTube, we're YouTube user orange lounge radio, all one word.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
We will have no show on Labor Day weekend.

35:04.000 --> 35:10.000
I know that's a good six weeks away or five or six weeks away, but just warning you now because I'll be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
How awesome would Fifty Shades of Grey be with Elizabeth Berkley?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Elizabeth Berkley's come a long way since Showgirls though.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Showgirls Elizabeth Berkley has.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Okay, 20 year old Elizabeth Berkley would be hilarious.

35:24.000 --> 35:33.000
Well shit, if it had been the Twilight people like Kristen Stewart and what's his name's sparkly emotionless guy.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
That would have been sparkly.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
I think that's right.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Sparkly emotionless guy.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
I'm hilarious too. I really don't like that actress though.

35:41.000 --> 35:48.000
She's so like every day. She just has that face that's like I don't like she's always wearing that I don't like you face.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
She's just.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I don't like him either to be honest.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
She's just so sad inside.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Yes.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Emo.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
They're both dead inside I think.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Like I just like eat a cookie.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Eat a protein cookie. Get some life.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
I don't know anyway.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Alright, let's get into some video games.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
Now people are like okay look I tuned in for a video game podcast and you fuckers are talking about Fifty Shades of Grey and Twilight.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I have had it officially.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Video game news please.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
And that guy has the hiccups so we'll fucking stop.

36:18.000 --> 36:27.000
So they finally reached I guess the quarter proof settlement for the whole PlayStation Network breach that happened back in 2011.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
Which is weird because I didn't even realize there was a whole court thing going on for it.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
I thought hey we got our free games and that's that you know.

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
But no hey guess what we're gonna get more free shit apparently as part of the settlement.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
They're gonna be doling out almost 18 million dollars worth of free stuff.

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
Including the option to either get a free game PlayStation 3 or PSP only.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Three PlayStation 3 themes.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Or in other words the choice that no one will ever fucking pick.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Or credit for three months of PlayStation Plus.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Which is valid for new subscribers only.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
What the fuck.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Seriously only new subscribers.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
Because that was the one I was gonna pick was hey you know what I need some more PlayStation Plus credits.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
It would be pretty sweet if I could get a subscription for three months.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
You know what you greedy little bastard.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
They already gave away a ton of shit after this whole thing happened remember.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Hey the whole welcome back program.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
I agree and I agree that they that whole thing.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
See and if you didn't take advantage of the whole welcome back program.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
You actually get two of the things on there you know you can pick one.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
But if you did already take advantage of that you get one of them.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
But still though I mean it's like.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
We don't know what games they are though right.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
We don't know what games they are it's gonna be different.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
But it's gonna be like stuff we've already given away.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
We do know what games they are I'm sorry we do yes.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
Let's see those it says those benefit benefiting from the settlement will pick up.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
From a list of eight PS3 and six PSP games which include dead nation infamous.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
Little Big Planet superstar does HD and rain so pretty much all those.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Those are all the games they give away during the program except for rain.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
I don't think really rain for PSP was a little big planet.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
Mod nation razor is pot upon three and kills on liberation.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
So almost those are actually really good choices for PSP.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
But the problem is they don't like the PSP is done.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
It's all about the Vita now.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Well you can use those on the via.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Oh I guess that's true.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
That's a good point.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
And then.

38:37.000 --> 38:44.000
So so that's not supposed to happen though until May of 2015 is when that stuff supposed to be.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Just when the PlayStation 3 is officially on its way out the door.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
As more and more people. Yeah.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
So I don't know like.

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
I guess I'll get a free game because like since they're not gonna let me have you know in PlayStation plus grades.

39:02.000 --> 39:10.000
I kind of I'm just whatever with this because I already got a lot of stuff when you know they welcome everybody back.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
I was I was legitimately surprised that they're giving away more.

39:13.000 --> 39:23.000
I thought it was going to be like a whole send in a claim and get a check for fifty five cents for the day that PlayStation Network was down or something like I kind of thought that's what it was going to be.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
But so I'm genuinely surprised they are giving away games.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
Yeah. And I'm not saying that you know.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
I don't feel like I'm entitled to anything but come on man.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
So that's that's how it is.

39:37.000 --> 39:46.000
You didn't necessarily feel entitled to anything until that door kind of opened a jar where it's like oh we're going to we're going to give away some games and they're like oh come on.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
No no no.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Come on.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Seriously.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Get these away.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
The fact that they have that will valid for only new subscribers is bullshit.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
I mean come on because that's all you're doing is like saying hey we want you to get hooked on PlayStation plus.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
You are the problem with the gaming community.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
No I'm not.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
They give you a little bit and you're like it's not good enough.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Hey I didn't say they had to give me anything.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Okay.

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
They did not have to give me one thing but but now that they're offering things to me.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
But one of the choices you know it's like oh but.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
And they're not offering that to you.

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
Like for example you know it's like fucking I was at Jack in the Box today picking up a milkshake because I didn't even want dinner.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
I already had like dinner earlier but like I wanted something.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I'm thinking only you are going to make this about a milkshake.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
No no hold on.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
I'm not making about milkshake.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
I'm making about a taco.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
They have this thing you can register for their fucking app.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
And so you register for the app and you get a coupon for one free Monster Taco.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
But it's not just for the Monster Taco.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
You have to make another purchase with that.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Fuck that.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
The tacos worth like a buck or two.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
And you can't even give me a buck or two worth of tacos.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
But you bought a milkshake.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
I understand that.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
But I still would have to make a completely separate purchase in order to get this taco as well.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
I would have to get something and then the taco.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Perhaps a second milkshake and taco.

41:05.000 --> 41:11.000
But the fact that I have to make another purchase along with the taco is ridiculous.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
What the fuck does your taco have to do?

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
And your fucking first world problems have to do with a Playstation settlement.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
I don't like the small print that says I have to do something.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Do you want Sony to give you a taco?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Is that what this is all about?

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
If Jamie were here, she'd be like, fuck yes, I want a taco.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
I want them to be able to give me three months of Playstation Plus.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
So what if I was a subscriber previously?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I just want three months of Playstation Plus because you know what?

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
That's better than all those other games that you already offered me before.

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
And god damn it, why would I want stupid Playstation themes for my Playstation 3?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
That makes no sense.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
Bonds006 in chat says, making Sony come off like a drug dealer.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
LOL give you a free hit and then you have to pay.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
Well hey, for those that haven't had Playstation Plus before that take that.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
I mean, in three months of Playstation Plus you can get a lot.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
And pro tip, go flag everything on your account even if you don't necessarily download it.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
Because let's say you don't own a Vita yet.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
Well like if you're on Playstation Plus and you've been flagging all these free Vita games that have been given away.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
When you get one, you're going to need one of them.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
They started locking that out.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Did they really?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah, you can't do that anymore.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Like I used to have Playstation 4 games and they locked it out.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Oh, I thought you could on the website.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
That's what I do it through, is on the website.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

42:26.000 --> 42:32.000
I bet the clever workaround would be log in one time from a friend's Playstation 4 and I bet it would work.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Maybe.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
Since I used to have a Vita, Vita games are no problem.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
But yeah, Playstation 4 games don't necessarily work.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
And you know what, that's fine.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Because most of the games that I'm marketing for free anyways, it's like,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Shit, I already got this on fucking Steam anyways.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
And I haven't played it on Steam, I'm probably not going to play it on Playstation 4 either.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
So, whatever, you know.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
You will eat a taco.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
No, their tacos don't look very good to be honest.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
It's got like, it's literally got a slice of like American cheese on it.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It just, it doesn't make any sense.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Blender in chat says, I've had those tacos, you need two to get full.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
But it's monster tacos, it's supposed to be big, right?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Oh, excuse me. Alright, look.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
No, no, the regular tacos, yeah, they're just, it's a buck for two.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
Moving on to something else that I think people spend a lot of money on thinking they need it and then they don't really use it.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
3D Blu-rays. Am I right? 3D? Am I right?

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
I thought that was done. I thought we've all moved on from that.

43:41.000 --> 43:48.000
I think, I think 3D will come back when VR takes off because right now people aren't going to buy.

43:48.000 --> 43:57.000
They're not, it looks, yeah, it's kind of funny seeing that it looks ridiculous to have glasses and watch TV, but wearing goggles to play a game, oh, that's completely fine.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
So you think maybe the Morpheus might support 3D films or something?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Um, I think it could, that would be pretty cool.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
That would actually be really rad in all honesty.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
I think it should, um, you know, that would make sense to at least get some more functionality out of it.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Watching Tron on Morpheus might be kind of awesome.

44:13.000 --> 44:24.000
I would love to see Tron, well, I did see it in 3D, so I know what it's like, but I saw it in 3D and with those awesome motion, motion chairs.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Me too, me too.

44:26.000 --> 44:35.000
Ah, that was awesome. But anyways, um, yeah, I definitely think that we'll see, especially now like with the Oculus Rift and everything, um, and they're going to be marking that down.

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
Hopefully to a price point that's more consumer friendly other than like $300.

44:40.000 --> 44:47.000
Well, I, Loki, I don't know how much lower something like that's going to get, especially when it's initially coming out.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
I don't know, they sell it at a loss or whatever just to get the platform out there.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
For a PC enabled thing? I mean, it's one thing when the software is restricted.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
That's how they can sell consoles at a loss because they'll make the money back on the software and the software licensing.

45:00.000 --> 45:07.000
PC is way more open than that. They can't, so I think you'd have a better chance that the Morpheus being cheaper and they take a loss on that.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
But at the same time, I don't think companies usually take loss on peripherals.

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
Well, it's going to be hard for them to sell a peripheral for like $300, you know, especially to convince people that you need this.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
It looks cool and everything.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
Unless they have their Wii Sports. Let's be real, people bought a Wii to play that game.

45:25.000 --> 45:31.000
I'm so hesitant, though, to buy stuff like that, you know, especially after the Kinect.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
It just, uh...

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
Anyway, the whole reason I brought up 3D Blu-ray in the first place, just so we're clear, they're finally adding support for it for the PlayStation 4.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
Even though the PS3 had it, PlayStation 4 has not had 3D Blu-ray support, but it is coming.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
A very interestingly timed announcement because Microsoft has said the same thing is happening for Xbox One.

45:50.000 --> 45:56.000
And this just came days later, so they don't want Sony to have Microsoft get anything extra there.

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
So yeah, this will be the 1.75 firmware, which should be out sometime in the next week.

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
And Xbox One will have its 3D Blu-ray support at some point in August.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
And if you buy your Blu-rays at Target like me, or actually probably a lot of them do this, it seems like you get five different copies of the movie for one price.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
Like, I swear, when I bought Tron, it was like, you get 3D Tron, and this is Tron Legacy, by the way.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
3D Tron, and Blu-ray Tron, and DVD Tron, and Digital Tron, all for one price.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
And, uh, was it, yeah, Tron 1, and Blu-ray.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
I think I have 3D Lion King, too, for the same reason.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
So, anyway, it'd be interesting to see if that happens.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
But, uh, Black Wolf in our chat gives us something to think about with that whole just watching it on the Morpheus.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Black Wolf says it depends on if they can work out the legal issues with the Blu-ray consortium.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
To get it to display in VR, you have to change the image, which is a no-no.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
But, since Sony's part of the consortium, they can get it changed.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
There's no Blu-ray player for Oculus Rift, because they'd have to violate the DMCA to get it to display.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
So, I think he has a point, though.

47:01.000 --> 47:10.000
If Sony wants to change the rules, they're gonna have the wiggle room to do that a little more than, necessarily, Facebook and Oculus would for their side of things.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
I'm surprised that they would even have to violate anything, because, to me, it seems like it's almost like playing it on, like, a TV.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
Like, it's just a different type of TV.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
You know, they've got, like,

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
If there's very specific resolution lockdowns, though, I get it. I get what you're saying.

47:23.000 --> 47:33.000
But they've got, like, you know, um, those things that split the image, you know, side-by-side, except for different, uh, 3D setups and stuff.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
I don't know. I don't know if they'd need to go through all the, you know, trouble.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
It's not like, uh, it's not like you're pirating or something.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
But whatever, I guess.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
Do we still have lack of 3D games on PlayStation 4, right?

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
I don't think any of them really support 3D.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
I can't think of either.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
I just don't...

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
I think it was kinda overblown, the importance of it.

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
Well, it's kinda too bad, because it was actually something I was really into that idea.

48:00.000 --> 48:08.000
I think doing it in 3D is causing, you know, cuts into the frame rate and, you know, what they can do with that.

48:08.000 --> 48:16.000
And since they're even having trouble, you know, on some of these getting it up to 60 frames per second, or even 1080p at 60 frames per second,

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
they just don't want to risk it for something that not a lot of people are ending up using.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
So I think that's where everyone's at.

48:24.000 --> 48:32.000
Maybe next generation will see that a little bit more, when, you know, when some of the stuff is more...

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
I think when the price comes down, if 3D TVs for whatever reason become more commonplace, but I think you're right.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
I think, I just don't think people, I think people are kinda already over it.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
Well, they've kinda, now they've gone the route of like, okay, 4K is gonna be the thing.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Yeah.

48:45.000 --> 48:51.000
And I think people, once again, it's, they've run into the problem where there's just not enough content out there for it.

48:51.000 --> 48:59.000
You know, even when 3D was, oh well, there's gonna be some, a couple channels that will be 3D, you know, but that's it.

48:59.000 --> 49:08.000
I mean, now 4K, it's like there's not a lot of channels that are 4K, and I think for a lot of people it's just like, eh, I don't really need that.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Alright, well let's move on with something else.

49:10.000 --> 49:19.000
Alright, so Kickstarter, of course there's always a lot of drama with certain Kickstarter funded games or whatever.

49:19.000 --> 49:32.000
So, in this case, one game called Confederate Express that was being, I guess, developed by a guy named Maksim Poshonin.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
He, I guess, had his game on Kickstarter last year.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
It was this sort of rogue-like zombie courier RPG type game.

49:43.000 --> 49:52.000
And what was supposed to be kind of unique about it was that, you know, they had this really neat lighting system on there, which really is just a normal map on top of a sprite.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
But whatever, it's unique, I guess.

49:55.000 --> 50:01.000
And it got funded for 10,000, or his goal, you know, was $10,000 back in November.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
It was supposed to be coming out by June 2014.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
But of course, you know, that was kind of the end of that.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
He didn't really give a lot of updates.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
And now, it's gotten even stranger.

50:16.000 --> 50:21.000
Now, not only is, well there's two sets of drama going on.

50:21.000 --> 50:31.000
The Kickstarter portion, he's actually starting, he is delaying the release of his game to work on another game that is going on around the same time.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Also uses the same engine.

50:33.000 --> 50:43.000
He claims that it was, this company had backed, or given him some funding money to help finish, what was it, Confederate Express.

50:43.000 --> 50:49.000
But come to find out, you know, after some people dug into it, it's actually his brother's company that him and his brother own.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
And so, it was kind of a little bit shady there.

50:52.000 --> 51:01.000
But on top of that, he had rented an apartment, I believe, or condo, from Airbnb.

51:01.000 --> 51:12.000
Which, Airbnb is a company that, you know, if you're leaving town for a while, you can rent your house or whatever out to tenants and make some money while you're not there.

51:12.000 --> 51:21.000
Like if you're, I guess, rich enough to where you vacation somewhere for a long extended period of time, or maybe you own a house for work or something like that.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
And you work in different locations, whatever.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
If you're not using your home for a while, you can rent it out.

51:28.000 --> 51:35.000
Hell, I used to do this one, our family would rent a cabin and go up to the snow or something for a week or something.

51:35.000 --> 51:41.000
But, the problem is, he rented this place for, I guess, 30 days.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
And he's actually stayed, he negotiated a 30 day stay at the condo in Palm Springs.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
And he stayed there for more than 30 days.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
And apparently, because of California law, it's squatter's rights.

51:56.000 --> 52:03.000
So, he now is claiming that he's on a month to month lease because he's been there for over 30 days.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
And he's occupied the living space.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
And now, the original owner can't get him to leave.

52:11.000 --> 52:18.000
And they really can't just tear him out of there because of these protections and California law and stuff like that.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
So, it's a really weird situation.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
And it only gets stranger.

52:23.000 --> 52:30.000
So, you know, instead of coming out and just kind of trying to defend himself and basically saying,

52:30.000 --> 52:37.000
Hey, you know what, this is blown out of proportion, or even trying to explain himself, or just even being quiet about the whole thing.

52:37.000 --> 52:44.000
He comes out and acts like a complete douchebag and makes a comment on the Confederate Express Kickstarter comments page saying,

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
What's the latest deets on the drama? 10 out of 10, would squat again.

52:50.000 --> 52:57.000
Just, I don't know. That's just really, really terrible.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
This guy sounds like he's drunk with power right now.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
He's just doing all this shit because he can.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
That's what it sounds like.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
I take it back. The contract he had was for 44 days.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
So, I guess Airbnb should have done the research knowing that, you know, maybe this could be exploited.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
Most people would, you know, exploit this kind of loophole.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
Unfortunately, a lot of these exploits don't get found out about until somebody exploits it.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
And here's even the strangest part.

53:23.000 --> 53:29.000
You know, because this is terrible that this one, this woman, Corey, is locked out of her house.

53:30.000 --> 53:36.000
You know, while trying to get this guy evicted and it's just not happening.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
So, on top of all this, he's saying that he's the one being harassed.

53:41.000 --> 53:52.000
And that, you know, because of this, you know, I guess his brother is suffering from stress.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Here comes the lawsuit.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Yes, and he's going to sue her.

53:57.000 --> 54:03.000
Because all these people online are saying bad things about all the exploiting stuff that's going on.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
It's really mean.

54:04.000 --> 54:13.000
So, thankfully, Airbnb is helping out the woman, you know, paying her, you know, for the time that this guy's here.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
And trying to, I guess, find your housing and stuff like that in the meantime.

54:16.000 --> 54:23.000
But it's just annoying that she's going to have to spend like five grand to get this guy out of her house.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Yeah.

54:24.000 --> 54:31.000
And he just, and he wants people to back this other Kickstarter while he hasn't even fulfilled the first Kickstarter.

54:31.000 --> 54:41.000
Once again, it's, you know, Kickstarting something is a good idea when it's somebody, you know, that has like a good track record.

54:41.000 --> 54:50.000
And even then, it's hard to tell because remember the Yaga Venture thing, you know, they had a good track record in like pod, you know, doing a YouTube show.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
But maybe not necessarily game development.

54:53.000 --> 55:00.000
Whereas, you know, like I know I backed several times the video game high school stuff.

55:00.000 --> 55:16.000
And I felt a little bit more confident that guys that are making, you know, YouTube videos and doing kind of these little short film things on YouTube are probably capable of making something slightly longer kind of along the same lines.

55:16.000 --> 55:22.000
But not necessarily, you know, you know, not necessarily just on YouTube or something.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
It was a little bit of a safer bet versus, you know, somebody you don't know.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
I don't know. I guess just be very cautious on what you back.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
And maybe even just if you're not sure, maybe not even back that.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
Or if you're going to back something, just back it for a very minimal amount of money.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
As J100matt in chat says, Airbnb is great and I know people who use it, but jerks ruin it by doing this.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
Yeah, I know Jason uses it too and has good experiences with it.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
And the problem here is not Airbnb.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
And it's not even Kickstarter.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Like as much as I've had my issues with the Kickstarter, that's not the issue.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
The problem is you've got this guy is exploiting both of them.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
The two are really unrelated.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
It's just that the guy has found a way to do this here and then do this here.

56:04.000 --> 56:14.000
And he'll probably, inevitably, allegedly, whatever, he'll probably just end up moving to another state or even another country where people can't touch him.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Who's to say the game is going to ever come out?

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
If it does, then hey, great. What a great thing to happen.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
And those people, you know, their faith holds true and everything.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
But the Airbnb side of it doesn't really give you a lot of hope, does it?

56:28.000 --> 56:37.000
It's sad because, you know, looking at what he had a demo, a playable demo of the game when he was doing the Kickstarter, and it actually is pretty good.

56:37.000 --> 56:47.000
It's just, it's just unfortunate, you know, you can be duped by a lot of these people.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
Especially if they don't have a lot of experience.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I don't know.

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
How are these people supposed to know on Kickstarter that this guy is just this crazy psycho?

57:00.000 --> 57:12.000
Not psycho, but you gotta be, you know, you gotta be kind of crazy if you're, you know, purposefully squatting in someone's house and I don't even know why.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
As Jonah and Matt says, it's really this one guy that's ruining everything for everyone. Yep.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Yep.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Pretty much.

57:18.000 --> 57:24.000
Alright, well let's move on. Speaking of one company ruining everything, I've got news on the new Mass Effect game.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. Let's hope not, right? Let's hope not.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
So there is news about the next Mass Effect game coming out of Comic-Con.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
And by news I mean very little, little teases.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
And one thing that they did say, the Bioware panelist said that the game is still years away, which makes me go,

57:41.000 --> 57:50.000
I want it now. Look, I understand. I would rather they take their time and get it right. I don't want a rushed game either.

57:50.000 --> 57:56.000
But as a fan, it is hard to not want that a lot sooner, if at all possible.

57:56.000 --> 58:02.000
I kind of figured it was a little bit away when they didn't have anything to show.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I'm thinking 2016 at the earliest.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Probably spring 2016, I'm guessing.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Or maybe even holiday at this point.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
Yeah, so I don't know. I'm not holding my breath.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
But they didn't tell you what the title is, although they say it's not Mass Effect 4 for now.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
But that doesn't mean they can't always change it.

58:20.000 --> 58:30.000
It does seem like the game will have something to do with N7, which is the military designation that Commander Shepard has in the first few games, the first trilogy.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
But it's not about Commander Shepard.

58:33.000 --> 58:39.000
They only would show your hero in male and female forms, but you don't know the name or anything else.

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
And there's a helmet on. So again, you really don't know a lot. You just kind of see what they look like with the helmet on.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
But it does seem interesting that it is going to be a story that runs concurrently with the first trilogy.

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
So we don't know if his or her path will intertwine with the Shepard story.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
If some of those characters will cross over, it definitely seems like there's a potential for that, that some of the characters could show up.

59:02.000 --> 59:12.000
And this makes a lot of sense. I think we've talked about the next Mass Effect game before on the show, especially Jamie and I, that something, not necessarily a sequel.

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
Because if you have a sequel, then you're going to have to have a definitive ending for the first trilogy, which is going to be a very hard thing to do, to have a canon ending.

59:18.000 --> 59:28.000
But if you run something concurrently or even a prequel, that's going to make it a little easier to have a different story without having a definitive ending for the first few games.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
So it will be very interesting to see how that plays out.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
Also in the game, the Mako will be making an appearance.

59:35.000 --> 59:43.000
Very unpopular vehicle for Mass Effect 1, because it kind of drove like shit, and you end up in all these really crappy positions and stuff.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
But they say they've learned a lot, and of course it's going to be different this time.

59:47.000 --> 59:54.000
I liked in theory what the Mako did, that you had to drive around the planets and look for things.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I mean, that's all part of the space exploration. I get it.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So from that end of things, I understand why they want to bring it back. Just as long as it controls a little better, it'll be really great.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
So, there you go. Sparse details on the next Mass Effect game. Still don't care, huh Matt?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Nope.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I figured as much.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I haven't gotten into it this long. I don't need to get into it.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000
DarkTetsuya in chat says, I feel you Rob. Been waiting on Zelda Wii U since Wind Waker HD finished, so I feel your pain.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Yeah, I know that's going to be a wait too for Zelda Wii U, although that's probably closer to the next holiday, honestly.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I think that's next holiday.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
That'll be next holiday.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I hope it's next holiday.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Zelda Wii U will be out before Mass Effect next.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I think they have to pretty much put it out next holiday at this point, because that's going to really drive system sales.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And they need it now rather than later.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Alright, well let's see what's going to drive sales at your local game store this week as we travel around the world and check out release dates.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
That's easy. It's going to be The Last of Us Remastered on Playstation 4.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And then, probably not so much. They've got Lego Ninjago and Ninjroids on 3DS and Vita. That's it.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Pretty slow week yet again.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's July.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Yeah, this time of year doesn't tend to be very action packed, does it?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Alright, well let's move over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Let's see, on July 31st, I think is the only date I really have releases for, Race Driver Grid 2.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
That's the only price reduction. That's going into the best series on the Playstation 3.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That's it.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
There's a new monitor for Playstation 4 coming out that's not a game, but some type of peripheral.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Like a full HD liquid crystal monitor for Playstation 4.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It just made me think about that, remember that Sony 3D TV that they put out?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Yeah, I remember that.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I kind of wish I'd bought that, like when they dropped the price on it. I had a hard time selling that. I kind of wish I did.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Yeah.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I know, I know.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
They're not, I don't know. We had a couple that we just couldn't get rid of that for a long time.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
It finally did?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
They finally marked them down and they sold them.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Yeah. On the Playstation Vita, Child of Light is released on the Vita, a special edition from Ubisoft this week.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And Kaihu Shoju-Sin comes out this week on the Vita as well.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And lastly, looking at the 3DS, the 3DS has a few more things.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Sony Pro, that's S-O-N-I, not to be confused with the makers of the other handheld.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Happiness Charge Pre-Cure, Kawarun Collection.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And Fate Khalid Linear, Prisma Aliyah comes out.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
So it looks like the 3DS probably has more than anything else, otherwise it's a slow week over in Japan as well.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Sadly, Dark Sakura isn't here, but I happen to have the Europe releases up anyway.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000
On July, excuse me, I'm way too early. Let's try not July dates. Let's try August, huh?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Or the end of July.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Would really be the dates that I want.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I think August 1st would be...

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Yeah, Last of Us Remastered is also out over there on the 29th of July.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
On the 31st of July, Pinball FX2.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And on August 1st, Sacred III on 360, Playstation 3, and PC.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
So also a slow week over there in Europe.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Just a couple more stories, and then the classic game of the week.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Dark Sakura's not here tonight, so I picked a classic game tonight that Loki and I can nerd the fuck out over.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Because sadly it's not a game Dark Sakura ever played.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I know this, because the games come up on the show before.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So we'll get to it in a minute. Don't peek, don't spoil it.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I won't.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So I think this is kind of cool.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:41.000
The Wii version of Skylanders Trap Team is actually going to include a digital copy along with it for the Wii U version of Skylanders Trap Team.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So, hey, you may want to have that for your new console that you might buy in the fourth quarter or something like that when your other games come out.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
So it's kind of cool that they give you two copies of the game.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Granted, it's probably safe to say it's not really two copies of the game, because you need that stupid portal to play the game.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But it's still cool that they're giving something away. I think that's kind of neat.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Now, what's not so neat, though, is this brand new Eons Elite Skylanders figures that they have.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Which, guess who they're exclusive to?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
That's right, Gamestop.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And these Elite figures are actually, I guess, repainted.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:37.000
They have some foil, they come in a foil display case, and you can, they're going to have one, I guess, of each element.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So is that what they were doing, was sitting at the Activision and Gamestop collaboration meeting going,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And we'll cover it in foil, foil.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
They're also going to, I guess, have a premium price tag. Of course, because it's Gamestop!

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Why wouldn't they have a premium price tag?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000
They've got, they've so far announced Spyro and Chop Chop, and the characters look like they're a little bit more intricately painted,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:12.000
and they have crap flying, well, Spyro has, like, books, like magical books flying around with him.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I don't understand where that shit's going to come in, you know.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And if you may be wondering, hey, what exactly is so special about them, other than the fact that they're repainted?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Well, the Eon Elite toys summon their in-game characters who are up to three times as powerful as their non-premium characters.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So, three times more powerful if you pay the cash.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
You better move your laptop, because I'm about to flip that table.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Look, it's not, it's not that I care about Skylanders or whatever, because I'm not as into this series as, like, somebody like, say, Shane.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Although, I did, he made me play the PlayStation 4 one, it was kind of fun. Like, I did enjoy, you know, my time with it.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But, this whole, like, giving Gamestop and only Gamestop the exclusives that have this kind of impact in the game,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
this fuckery, and that's what it is, it is fuckery, it has to quit.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Like, I just, can I go on record and say, if I fucking hear one of these CEOs go,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
oh, this is what the players want, or any form or derivative of that statement, I am going to fucking scream.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Or, I, how about this, I don't want to hear these people fucking complain about Gamestop ruining their margins,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:24.000
because they're selling used games, and yet at the same time they're fucking giving them exclusive DLC on all these new release games,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
and exclusive shit like this.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Listen, you're either friends with Gamestop or you're fucking enemies with Gamestop.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You're not, like, fucking trying to play both sides of the coin.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Like, seriously, it's like, oh, well, did you just, I wished it would stop selling so many used games because,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.000
because it really hurts our new game sales, but you can get this game exclusively at Gamestop.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
You know, that's just, I'm so tired of hearing that.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Just, you pick a side, don't fucking give exclusive DLC out, and let's just be honest now, okay?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I've seen a lot of this DLC that comes out, you know, this pre-order DLC, and a lot of it is just shit.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And a lot of it is just shit that, guess what, it's like Sniper Elite, for example.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Sniper Elite 3 that just came out a few weeks ago.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:19.000
They had this exclusive mission that you go kill Hitler, which, surprise, if you've ever played any of the other Sniper Elite games,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
each one comes with a fucking mission to kill Hitler, okay? Every single one.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
So anyways, whatever, you kill Hitler.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Two weeks later, everybody can, everyone can buy it.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I mean, you have to pay for it, granted, it's not free, but it's not exclusive anymore.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I don't know. Just wait for the Game of the Year edition.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Bonds006 says, thank you for saying exactly what I ask of these game makers.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Gamestop is robbing us, but here's Gamestop-only content. Boo fucking who?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I just, I want choice. I want there to be choice.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
If you're gonna do this, then give it to Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, you know,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:06.000
why does it all have to be this one retailer, like, that I purpose, I just don't like to shop at?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I don't know, I mean, it's-

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I have my reasons, and this is a pretty good one.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And let's be honest, okay, I'm only angry about this because it's not because of Skylanders,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
because I don't give a fuck about Skylanders.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000
My thing is, if I'm not angry about this now, it's eventually gonna get to be something that, something that I want.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000
That, you know, it is a game or something that I really want to buy, but now it's exclusive to Gamestop,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
and they're charging a premium price for it because they can fucking do that.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000
That's where, see, it needs to stop now before it gets to that point. That's the way I see it.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm gonna say something pretty ballsy here, but I don't care.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I'm in a mood tonight, especially with the hiccups having derailed the first half of the show,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I would rather pirate a game than get it at Gamestop.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I'm not using that as an excuse to justify piracy, because I don't pirate games, because most everything I want,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000
even what I came closest to, Xenoblade, came out through the Nintendo thing as well.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:16.000
But, you know, this whole shit has gotta stop, because yes, I would rather pirate games than buy them from Gamestop.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And, no offense, I'm sure we have plenty of Gamestop employees that listen to this show,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
my beef is not with the hardworking people that are getting paid way too little to put up with all of this fuckery.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The fuckery from me, the fuckery from their management, the more fuckery from their management,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and the continued fuckery of their management.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Done. Soapbox. Put it away.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Anything else you'd like to add, Loki?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000
They also announced the dark editions of, you know, the collector's editions that come with characters that are darker.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And it's ten dollars more expensive.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That's like the shinies of Pokemon.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:00.000
But it comes with a trap crystal that you can catch the bad guy of the game in chaos and use him as a character.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Which you only get that through, you know, buying this collector's edition that's ten dollars more expensive.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Oh, by the way, that collector's edition, not even on Skylanders now, let's go back to Disney Infinity here.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000
The collector's edition of Disney Infinity comes with all the, you know, the regular version of the game,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
the starter pack comes with three of the Avenger characters.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And I think that they have, normally they have Hulk, Hawkeye, and Captain America,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
the other characters that they add on top of that with it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
In fact, Hulk isn't exclusive to this collector's edition until the end of,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
oh, I'm sorry, I can't say it, but, until the end of some other month.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And, so, they have that. It's a hundred and eighty dollars.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
A hundred and eighty dollars.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
And it comes, the thing that's really separate from buying the characters themselves in the starter pack

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
is this display case that it has that's not worth sixty extra dollars.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
A hundred and fucking eighty dollars for this shit.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I'm just saying, guys, you have to vote with your wallet at the end of the day.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
How bad do you need that one scrappy little piece of DLC?

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Let me give you a hint, you don't.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
If the game is going to suck without that piece of DLC, then the game wasn't worth the purchase anyway.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
You have to vote with your wallet.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Hey, if you want to shop at GameStop and do all that, you know what, more power to you.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
You, this is America, and you can spend your money wherever the fuck you damn well please, that is your,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and even the other countries that listen to this show enjoy similar freedoms.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
You can spend your money wherever the hell you like.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Don't let this complaining little bastard stop you.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Do it.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But, if you don't like it, and you want things to change, then you have to speak with your wallet

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
because that's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Alright, moving on.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Speaking of voting with your wallet, how would you like to buy some good old fashioned games?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000
That's right, there's GOG.com, some good old games, which, you know, they really like to promote

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
that they give DRM-free game distribution, and that is now coming to Linux as well.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
So for all you that have installed Linux on your toaster or your refrigerator, there are some games you can now play on it.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I'm kidding, because obviously they don't have the power to play these games.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000
But, those of you that do like to put Linux on your laptop or wherever, your desktop, wherever you have Linux,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
you have some games now from GOG that will support Linux, including Pirates Gold Plus, FlatOut 2,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Rise of the Triad, Dark War, 50 Linux compatible games added to the online catalog.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
This is in response to a previous initiative saying they will bring more than 100 Linux games to the service by fall.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Pretty cool. For those, you know, again, that like their choice and you don't want to have to use Windows,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
and you don't like Apple either, so you use Linux, more power to you.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Now you have these games available to you. And some classics, Pirates Gold, that's a classic.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Speaking of classics, folks, it's time to take a trip down memory lane.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I don't think this game is on GOG.com yet, but it should be.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and she finds a game that she says,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
hey, you little bastards ought to be playing this game.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I was going to say, I haven't even looked at what the game was, but I kind of already knew what it was,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
because now I'm thinking of it. And now it confirms that.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Alright, so here it is. Dark Soccer is not here this week, so ha, I'm going to step into my gaming vault

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
and pick a game that I think you guys should play this week.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
And it's one that we've talked about on the show before.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And it's free, I think, right now.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
But believe it or not, it has never been a classic game of the week, and it needs to change.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And I'm going to, this is a DOS game, so it doesn't have a lot of music.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
It didn't even use AdLib or Sound Blaster, so it doesn't really have a lot of music.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
But let me see if you can guess, just from these little sounds, what it is.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Anybody? Anybody?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Now this game doesn't have a lot of sound to it, so I will kind of minimize it.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And it can run there in the background.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Let's talk about a true classic game, one of my very favorite PC games they ever did make.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
ZZT. ZZT is the classic game of the week.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Ah, yes.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:24.000
That's right. ZZT was created in 1991 by Tim Sweeney, which was Potomac Computer Systems at the time,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and now it's Epic MegaGames. That was transitioned in 92.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000
ZZT, it doesn't stand for anything. There was no reason it was given that particular name.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000
The reason why he gave it that name is that it would always appear at the bottom of news group listings.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Some people want to be on the top, others want to be on the bottom.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
So there you go, it's always at the bottom of news group listings.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Sweeney once joked it's short for Zoo of Zero Tolerance, but now everybody kind of believes that that is what it really means.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So Zoo of Zero Tolerance, I had never heard that before.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
The Zoo of Zero Tolerance, it makes sense I guess.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Although it says nothing about the creation aspects of this game.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Now, this game runs all in text, ANSI graphics.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
For those of you younger folks that weren't around when ANSI was all the rage,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
that basically means a game completely played in a text environment, like a text screen.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Kingdom of Krause was a game that used this kind of engine about four years before this game came out.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
ZZT was a shareware game.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And is shareware even something they really do anymore? You don't really see a lot of this.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:37.000
What was shareware? Shareware was they gave away the first of four worlds, and the first one was free.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
So I guess if you think about it, the Destiny beta was the first world.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I would still say that a lot of the Telltale games now are like that.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Ah, that's a good point. A lot of Telltale stuff is like shareware. That's really good.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So yeah, ZZT was shareware. The Freetown was called the town of ZZT.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And for those of you that are looking at YouTube, you'll probably see the little dude playing through that,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
as there's very minimal noise, except when he picks up items.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I hope it's saying to turn down your YouTube a little more.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Is it? Too loud?

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Yeah.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I'm sorry these DOS-based sounds are too much for you all to handle.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
They're too intense.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
They're too intense, all the little blips and blops.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Alright, town of ZZT was the free one they gave away.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Caves of ZZT, dungeons of ZZT, and city of ZZTs were the other.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
It was a very simple game. You moved your little happy face around with four cursor keys.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
If you hold the shift key down and press a cursor key, you will shoot a bullet if you have ammo.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You can pick up ammo, which is five rounds for each thing you pick up.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Gems, which is currency.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Torches, which you use by hitting the T key if a room is dark.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And energizers that will make you invincible temporarily.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Some of the enemies you will fight in the game include lions that randomly move around.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Tigers that move around and fire bullets.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I don't know who decided to give a tiger a gun, but they did.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Ruffians that will chase you, rest and then repeat.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Bears, slimes, and spinning guns.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
So, I know this game may sound like, okay, it doesn't sound that awesome,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000
but here's where the game gets really awesome is that you got to make your own games.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
It had a built-in editor.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
It had an object-oriented scripting language in the game called ZZT OOP

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
that allowed you to actually create your own levels.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And so, back in the day of BBSs, when, you know, Loki's talked about this before.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I've talked about this before.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Fans of Bobby Blackwell know he talks about this too.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You used to call into BBSs, and not only would you download your shareware ZZT,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
but you could download levels that other people made in ZZT and play like friends levels.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And, you know, people would do the same shit then that they do today.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
They would draw a level that's nothing but a giant penis with little guns that shoot out.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
All that same shit would happen back in the day.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
We did some awesome stuff.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I remember my classmates used to make, like, Zen Trotti stuff,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
because they were really big into, like, Macross and stuff,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
so they'd make, like, you know, working mechs and just all sorts of crazy things.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And I actually had a cool game that started that had a really generic title, Adventure Quest.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And it was pretty far along.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And then, unfortunately, my floppy disk got corrupted, and I lost it.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.000
But, yeah, there was that and, you know, Megazooks, of course, and Super ZZT.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.000
They did release what was called The Best of ZZT, which was kind of like the Tim Sweeney endorsed levels that he liked.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
So that was pretty cool that they released all that together.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Now, Loki's starting to talk about some of the other games that came after it.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Some of the other things.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
There was Megazoo was one of them. Super ZZT was there.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Super ZZT didn't really have an easily accessible editor in it,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
which is why a lot of people didn't think it was as good.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Honestly, for me, none of these sequels really did it the same way ZZT did.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Megazooks is actually really good.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Did it?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Have you played that?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I remember playing it back in the day, but not enough.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Megazooks is very much like ZZT.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Super ZZT, they decided they'd go with their own, like, thing.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Instead of it being text-based, it was, like, square-based.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And so they had text and everything, but it looked like it was stretched horizontally.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
It was just really weird.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Whereas Megazooks was more, it looked like ZZT,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
but you could create your own text characters,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and you could also put, you know, your own music in there,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
like Scream Tracker stuff.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I do remember that, because I remember the mod,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
because I had this mod file that was, like, the Gauntlet song or something,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
and we put it in one of those levels.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
That was, like, one of the things we did.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I had some pretty sweet stuff in that one, too.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Nice.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Actually, I restarted my game.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I would love to see some of your old ZZT creations.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Oh, God, I don't have them anymore.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I really wish I had them, because they were so cool.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Yeah, me neither. Online or gone. Sad.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Get this. ZZT was still on sale through 2009,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
where it was available through mail order.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
They finally distributed the very last copy in late 2013.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So that was it.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
That was the end of ZZT.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Now, I thought I heard somewhere, though, that they give this away for free now.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I thought I remember we had a story on it previously.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I don't see it in what's in front of me.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I hope somebody in the chatters know a little more about this,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
because I thought you could just get the whole ZZT thing for free now.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Some of the other games that ZZT inspired.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Dream ZZT, which was an open-source ZZT engine for Mac, Windows, Linux,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
the Nintendo DS, and the Sega Dreamcast.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I had no idea somebody put ZZT on the Dreamcast.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
That's amazing.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
That's awesome.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I want to check that out.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Direct ZZT, which is an open-source C-sharp game

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
that reconstructs ZZT using modern graphics technologies,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
hence the name Direct ZZT in parallel to Direct X.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Very cool.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
So there it is, your classic game of the week, ZZT.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And I think part of the reason Loki and I love this game so much is just

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
it was really, you know, you could create.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
It wasn't just playing these already established levels,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
but being able to create your own shit and share it with friends.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I mean, that's some of the stuff a lot of us still enjoy in games today.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Little Big Planet, huge example of that, and a lot of what happened

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
in what was that called, like, the Gameplay 2.0 Initiative or whatever,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
you know, Play, Create, Share, whatever that was.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Yeah.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
They call that.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
A lot of that you can trace back to something like ZZT

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
and old classic games, a pinball construction set,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
which I'll have to cover in a future week by Electronic Arts.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That's right, yay, way back in the day was a great, great game too

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
that was a similar thing where you can construct your own pinball boards

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
and let your friends play them.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
So there it is.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I missed this.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
This game is awesome.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Right?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I know, huh?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Yeah.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000
We should have, like, a VoG ZZT level creation contest or something.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I feel like nobody would enter.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Or, no, even better, let's just, like, forget just the VoG creation thing,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
just, like, have, like, a co-opt VoG game made out of ZZT.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
That would be pretty sweet.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
We need something on the site besides Flappy VoG.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
All right.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
There it is.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Once again, your Classic Game of the Week, ZZT.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
That is going to do it for Part A of the show,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
We have plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
news about more games coming to PlayStation 4,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
which are PlayStation 3 remakes,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
but these are ones I think a lot of you will be looking forward to,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
and more Tekken updates to follow last week.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
right after this.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
We are live on this July the 27th of 2014 with episode number 561 of our show,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
and here I thought the hiccups and coughing was done.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
They're back for Part B.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I know, they're back for Part B, just like we are.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Good gosh.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
All right, so we're a little broken tonight.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Not only Dark Soccer, she's not here tonight.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Unfortunately, she wasn't feeling too well,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and she needs to rest up so she can go back to work tomorrow,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
so it's just Loki and I holding down the fort,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
but then I keep wanting to spontaneously combust over here or something,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
so I apologize to you guys, but we do it live.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
That's the way we do it.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
It's live and unedited, so sometimes it's going to be a little weird.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
If you want to join us for a live show, of course you can come out on Sunday nights,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Speaking of the Voice of Geeks Network, lots of great shows on the network,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and I mentioned this a little earlier in the show.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I talk about movies and anime and other gaming shows and RPGs

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
and Star Trek and all this stuff.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
One of the other shows on our network,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
and these guys are always really great supporters of what we do here at OLR,

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
and one of their hosts, Brad, is here almost every week, Pod Culture,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
a great show that's on Monday nights on the network, 6 o'clock Pacific.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
They talk about kind of like general sci-fi geekery.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
They talk about a lot of movies and TV,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
but they get into the game chatter once in a while too.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Sometimes they do special episodes on Doctor Who called TARDIS Interruptus,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
but the reason why I bring that up is that I want to give a shout-out

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
to one of the hosts over at Pod Culture, Glenn,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
because Glenn has a new book that just came out that you can check out.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I always say support indie broadcasting, so why not support indie publishing?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
If you want to check out this book, check it out.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
It's Darkness Unbound, and you can check that out at

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
You can check that out at

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Check that out, and if you want to know what this book is all about,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
it's one of those thriller mystery type of things,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
because a family of four murdered in their sleep,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and the entire city is on edge.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Police investigate the occult connections between these murders

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
and similar murders from 13 years ago.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
One detective knows the truth.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Something dark from Sister Marion's past has returned.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Now innocent lives are being lost.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Will she have the faith to face her greatest fear?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
We'll find out over at

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Best of luck to Glenn.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
It's really exciting to have something that you've kind of created

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
and poured a lot into, like be out there and be available,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
which you're hoping to get to with your game someday, right?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Yep. Oh god, my game just, this week, rewriting stuff,

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
making it a lot simpler.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
That's what I was doing.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Except I'm going to be really busy this week.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Damn, I was going to make a joke in there saying like,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
yes, the shocking truth, that it's music and dancing that have caused these murders,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000
and so we have to outlaw all music and dancing.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Wasn't that the plot of Footloose?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Yeah, it might have been.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
All right, again, that's tinyurl.com slash darkness unbound,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
but you've got to capitalize the D and the U, like darkness,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
capital D, unbound, capital U,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
because it's one of those like case sensitive tiny URL.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
That is just going to redirect you to the Amazon page,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
if you're curious, like where are you sending me, Rob?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
It's just the Amazon page where you can buy the book.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Send you on an adventure.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
That's right, a choose your own adventure,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
and you'll have to play all four chapters of ZZT

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
before you're eligible to purchase the book.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I don't know if I've ever played all four chapters.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
We've got some rapid fire news,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
traveling around the gaming industry

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
and checking out what else is going on.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So Media Molecule is teasing a brand new game

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
that they're working on in a video called Embrace the Glitch,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
and apparently they had some sort of glitch

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
with some rendering thing that they were doing,

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
and what is the thing that they're teasing?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Well, it appears to be those marionette puppets

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
or whatever, that tech demo that they had

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
that they showed during E3 2013,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
and it was also that thing that they had

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
where you could sculpt stuff with the PlayStation Move

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
and do all sorts of weird stuff with that.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
So don't know much more about it.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
If I were to take a guess,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I'm guessing that we'll see more of this at maybe Gamescom

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
because I believe Media Molecule is a European company.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
They sure are.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
So that'd be my guess.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Anyways, so this is kind of neat.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
NES Remix pack.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
They're going to be coming out in disc format this holiday,

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and it's going to include NES Remix 1 and 2,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
and no word on what it's going to cost,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
but I'm guessing maybe like $29.99 maybe

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
because they're saying it's about $28 US

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
for the Famicom Remix pack,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
so that makes sense, I guess.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And last but not least,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
the Uncharted movie is supposed to be coming out to theaters

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
June 10th, 2016,

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and I'm not sure if that happens to be the same date

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
that falls on for other movies here.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Oh, yes, June 10th also would be...

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Let's see.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Oh, originally it was supposed to be for the Amazing Inspirement 3.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
That's what it looks like. Familiar.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
But that got delayed to 2018.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
By that time, I'm not going to remember

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
that they have an Amazing Inspirement 3.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Well, that's fine

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
because I've never seen the first or second one, so whatever.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
But Uncharted, that'd be pretty cool.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I'm surprised that they're making so many movies

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
of these Sony properties all of a sudden,

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
and I don't know, I think it's kind of cool.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Maybe, maybe we'll start a trend

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
where there'll be good video game movies.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
That would be something, wouldn't it?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I'm looking forward to...

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I'm looking forward to Fassbender and Assassin's Creed.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I'm just saying, I would think that Sony

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
making a movie of their own property

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
probably won't fuck it up.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Just saying, you know.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I'm pretty confident that Sony knows their own properties

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
that they won't fuck it up.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Well, let's, you know, let's be cautiously optimistic.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Shall we?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Alright, this has me pretty excited.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Arcade classic.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Silent Scope, you ever played this?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I know we used to play this.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
This was featured alongside DDR.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
They used to have that machine,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and what was it, mocap boxing and all that stuff?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Was it Police 911?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Police 911.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Anyway, Silent Scope, they haven't really done one in a while,

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
but get this, it's coming back.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
That's right, Silent Scope is coming back to the arcade.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It's an anime-style Silent Scope game

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
called Silent Scope Bone Eater.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I wonder if it'll have a theme song like Snake Eater.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Bone Eater!

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
That sounds like a parody.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I know.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yeah, I'm just, I'm not gonna go there.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
You all read into it.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
If you have the mind of a 12-year-old, you'll understand.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
But here's the thing.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I mean, if it's Konami, then they're definitely well aware

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
that there was a Snake Eater, so, you know.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
No, why not? So now we got a Bone Eater.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So, again, this is in Japan, though.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
We don't have arcades here in America.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
That's why we probably won't see this over here.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Sad but true.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Silent Scope Bone Eater will have network connectivity

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
that will allow four snipers to all eat bones together

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
and dispatch enemies.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
No word on if it's each other, though,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
because that might be kind of fun if you could, like, snipe each other.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
God, that'd be cool, you know.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Later this year is when this is coming out.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Total tangent, but they should have totally done a, um...

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Oh, what the fuck was that movie?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
It was, um...

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I wanna say The Watchmen, but it's not The Watchmen.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It's, uh...

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
God, okay, now I can't remember the fucking franchise.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
The Guardians of the Galaxy?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
No, it's the one where they curved bullets.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
They've been, um...

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Oh, Wanted.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Wanted, yes.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
It would've been awesome if they did, like, a Wanted gun game

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
with, like, motion sensors built into the guns

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
so you can curve the bullets by, like, moving the gun.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I didn't know it would be totally sweet.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
That would've been a unique feature to have in an arcade cabinet.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And hell, you know what?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
They put out a Rambo game not too long ago.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
It's not fucking too late to make a Wanted game.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I would be happy to see it.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And another Wanted movie,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
because that movie I thought was pretty sweet.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
That movie was so, like, ridiculous, but I loved it.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
It was so, like, stupid.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
The comic, I guess, is even more ridiculous, but...

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I bet.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I can't wait.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Speaking of ridiculous things,

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I love more than anything else in the world.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
We have an excuse to talk about RuPaul's Drag Race this week, everybody.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis 2.0 has been announced

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
for the App Store and Google Play.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And more information on Dragopolis 2.0 came out this week.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Queens like Jinx Monsoon, Shangela, and Sharon Needles

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
will be featured in the game.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Why wasn't this debuted at GamerCon?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
They did announce...

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Actually, I was at a panel where they did kind of confirm

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
that this was happening at GamerX.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
The first Dragopolis was at GamerX last year.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Also, I can't believe...

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
This was in a little summary here, but I have to know...

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
One of my favorite queens ever that's been on the show,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Alaska Thunderfuck, will also be in the game.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Hi!

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Hi, everybody.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Some of the people have no idea what I'm talking about out there.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Guilty pleasure show.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Maybe one of them.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I don't care if you're straight, gay, whatever in between,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
who you are.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
RuPaul's Drag Race is a primo TV show for everybody.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Also in the game, Jujubee, Ongina, Raven also in the game,

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
so that'll be fun.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
You will have fashion challenges,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
and you will be able to outfit and accessorize

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
each queen in the game.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
There is no lip syncing in the game, though, however.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
This is just a little iPhone game.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But, yeah, it's just a silly little iPhone game

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
that I remember you just would like.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It was like a little platformer type of game the first one,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
so I'm sure this one's just like it.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Is this Frog Factions 2?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
No, it's sadly no, I wish.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
But they do say in this game you'll be playing through fashion challenge levels

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.000
inspired by the show, such as the Hero's Ball, the Glitter Ball, and more.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Are you excited to play the Glitter Ball?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I did not play the first game, so...

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I feel that I would be left out.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Bye!

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
All right.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Then here we go.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Let's talk about something maybe you do know a little more about.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
This has to do with Kingdom Hearts meets Batman.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I'm not talking about Kingdom Hearts 3, people. Hold on.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But this is pretty cool.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Tetsuya Nomura, who a lot of you guys know from Kingdom Hearts,

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
he actually did a Batman redesign that is being seen around, I guess, Comic-Con.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
It's at the Square Enix booth at Comic-Con.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And, yeah, he did his own little take on it.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's actually going to be a variant play arts action figure that's coming out.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And what did you think?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I mean, it's very different.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I mean, it's hard to explain on a radio show,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
but when I think of, like, Baflek, I certainly don't see this.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
There's a lot of, like...

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Bahamut Man?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Yeah, it's like Bahamut Man.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Yeah, this is what it looks like.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
It's neat.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
It's not like Batman.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
It's very much of a stretch to call it Batman.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I like the design, but...

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Yeah.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Would you have that sitting on your desk at work?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Yes.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
If someone gave me that, yes, I would put that shit up.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Here you go.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Here's the thing.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I would love to see something that kind of crazy.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
That style, just very Japanese.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Just the whole Batman.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
All the characters would be fucking awesome.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
I would totally dig that.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Is it covered with belts and belt buckles?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
It needs more belt buckles.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Always more belt buckles.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Wrong.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
That's true.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
That's true if you're talking about a character.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000
However, this is more of an armor, so it falls into the mech type thing.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Lots of spikes and unnecessary joints and stuff like that.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Rama says,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Looks beastly as fuck.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And Fifth Dream says,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
It's like if they made a current style movie of Batman Beyond.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Ooh, maybe.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I'd be down with that too.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Now you got me thinking.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Now you got us all thinking here.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
All right, and we wanted to get you guys thinking on this story here

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
with our foogle question of the week.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Thanks for having a good home.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
You slam those together and you get foogle.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And yeah, it's time for the foogle question of the week.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
And we actually asked about this very thing, the whole Batman by Tetsuya Nomura.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And so we said,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
We'd like to know what video game maker would you like to see provide a fresh take

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
on a particular famous movie or comic book character

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
and why would that pairing be so awesome?

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So I'll ask you in a minute, Loki.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
You'll be thinking about this while I get to some of our listeners this week.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
We'll start on Google Plus tonight where we have one lone answer,

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
one lone answer from Redertainment on Google Plus.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
No, love for Google Plus.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
But Redertainment does say,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Movie or comic books?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000
So I can't get Hideo Kojima to write the next season of 24?

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Shoot.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
You know what?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I'll take it, actually.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
That's a pretty awesome crossover.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
24 technically, I think they did have comic books for.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And 24 had a game.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And I think even Konami were the ones that published it, actually.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
It was a long time ago.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Maybe.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I could be wrong on that.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Let me think.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I've been thinking here.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It's no.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
The game was, no, it was Ubisoft, I think did it.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Because it was set between seasons two and three.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I remember that.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I don't think it was Ubisoft either.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Really?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Well, look at, to the wiki.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Yes, but I'll just look it up.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Yeah.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Look it up.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Come back to me in a minute here.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
While we get some of our answers on Facebook.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Because some of you guys answered the question over on Facebook.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And just a few.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I guess you guys were having a hard time thinking of some answers.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Maybe this question was too hard.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I don't know.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
But we do have our friend Renee from Killer Queens from Outer Space Podcast.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Who says Keiji Inafune designing Robocop or Terminator would be Amazeballs.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
That's a good answer.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Dark Tetsuya says 2K.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
It was 2K.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
That's right.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Mrs. Jonah and Matt saying SCE and 2K.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
That was right.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000
2K.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
I remember that was one of the earliest games that wanted to have us work with them.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Because we gave away a copy of that game on the show.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It was a long time ago.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
A long time ago.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
That was a PS2 game if I'm not mistaken.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Yes it was.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
William Murderface.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I always love that name.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
So friendly.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
William Murderface says I would love to see the Witcher team redesign Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I think they could add depth and nuance to a character that deserves far more than she's been given in the past.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I know that the new movie tried to do it but I think it could have been done better.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
You know that new Witcher game.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I didn't get to play it at E3 but they did a very long demo of it.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:27.000
And I noted in that game how cinematic and how the art direction was really good in that game.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
That little preview we saw.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So I can see where you might want to see a different take on Maleficent with that.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I like that.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I think Maleficent is one of those characters that you can see done different ways.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Maleficent is up there with Batman.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Awesome Unicorn says how about we have Platinum Games of Bayonetta fame right?

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Work their magic on Barbarella.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Now granted all she could really do most of the time in the film is get knocked out and have sex with whoever she feels like.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
But I'm sure Kamiya could create a ridiculous Bayonetta style overhaul to allow her fierceness to shine.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I like that.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
That's a good one.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And Dartitsuya last but not least says I'd like to see Kojima Productions take on Pacific Rim.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Good answers.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Good answer.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I'm sad we didn't get more of them but whatever.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I guess that was a tough question.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
So Loki what did you think of that one?

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Let's see.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I got so many ideas.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000
But one I've always wanted to see and actually kind of wanted to try it at one point but it would have just been too damn hard to do it in the current engine.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Is to see Rockstar Games take on Tron.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
It would be fucking amazing.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
You got a little taste of that in Saints Row the Third with that gang.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Okay no no.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I'm sorry no no.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I tried.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Saints Row I'm sorry.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
My god.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Let's go on a tangent here because now we're talking about it.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I've been listening to like at one of my old CDs I have some of the Saints Row 4 music on there.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And I kept thinking about like how they could have changed Saints Row 4 to have made it better.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
And I actually had a great idea and it wouldn't have taken too much.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I mean one they had spoilers.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.000
They would have not blown up Earth you know and they could have still had it where the feets is in and everything.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:21.000
But the very end kind of do sort of a Men in Black type thing where they have to zap everybody so that their memory is erased of you know the events that happened.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:30.000
And because of that now no one remembers who the Saints are and so they have to in the next game come up from nothing like they did in the first one.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Boom reboot for next gen.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And it made perfect sense and it would have brought it back around and they could have maybe drowned it down a little bit and made it look less crazy wacky and a little bit more gangster again.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:52.000
My answer is going to be kind of along the lines of Wanted being very like over the top and everything.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000
This is a series that you know it kind of it's ended. It's gone.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
But we had so much expectations from this series after the first movie particularly.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And they did make a game of this series but I think we all wanted something even more than that.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And that would be I would want Platinum Games. I'm going to go with them as well.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
I would want to see their take on The Matrix.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:20.000
That would have been. Come on. Huh. Some of that some of that really over the top stuff would have been amazing for The Matrix. Right.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And enter The Matrix. I don't remember being a particularly bad game.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
It was a good game. I liked it.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
It was very it was kind of ambitious for its time.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
You know especially how it worked in a lot of like concurrent stuff that runs with the movie.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And like that basically Jada Pinkett who is you know a pretty big star was a big part of that game.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
She had a more pronounced role in those games as she did in the movies.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So I always kind of thought that was interesting.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I liked the game a lot.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So yeah I liked it. But I'd like to see Platinum Games take. I mean who made Enter The Matrix. Is that Atari? I think it was like.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
That was yeah I think.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Because then they made a Matrix online which kind of you know didn't didn't really go so well.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000
But which in theory on paper Matrix online but I think there's just there was too much other stuff going on online.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
But yeah I'd like to see Platinum Games take on that. Some of those fight sequences from the first movie.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I would just love to see a new Matrix game. Just go back to it.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I mean now that the technology is so much better now it would be so cool. How will it even take another Matrix online.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
All right. Those are those are our answers there for the Fugu question of the week.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Thanks you guys for participating. If you missed it try next week.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Let's move on. Some more video game news stories. Loki.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
All right. So let's see. This is kind of cool.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You know there is a lot of games that people are wanting to come back for PlayStation 4.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And some that people are surprised that they didn't even see because you know they've been doing a lot of these HD remakes for PlayStation 4.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
You like you see the Metro collection and The Last of Us and all that stuff.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Well one of the games you know that was I think when the first PlayStation 4 games was Flower.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And people were like oh hey Wolf that game companies flowers there.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Well we see Journey. Maybe.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Well apparently Sony's Gamescom landing page they had a bunch of games listed for the PlayStation 4.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And one of those games of course was Journey included though with that.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Until Dawn. Hey remember Until Dawn.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
It was the PlayStation move horror game title that's supposed to be coming out for PlayStation 3.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
That never happened. Now that may mean that might be I don't know if it's going to be a move title.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Maybe maybe even like no it would be really cool to be like Project Morpheus.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.000
You know a lot of people have that camera though for PlayStation and essentially if you have the controller you have some of that element of move.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Nom Nom Galaxy also they're doing some ports of Hustle Kings, Pixa Cat and the Unfinished Swan.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I guess those are revealed by content rating submissions in Korea.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
So cool I'm definitely checking out to see what kind of announcements we have out of Gamescom.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I'm hoping out of Gamescom we also have the announcement of the release date for Grand Thefto 5 on next gen.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Oh I'm sure it'll be before Black Friday.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000
It's I think it's if I was going to take maybe like the 19th of November.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Yeah that'd be my guess.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Well last week we talked about Tekken 7 and yes Tekken 7.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.000
There was a little trailer that came out of Comic Con from that and some more details from Tekken 7.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000
There will be some answers to Tekken mysteries like why did Heihachi throw his son Kazuya off a cliff.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
That will be answered in Tekken 7 I suppose.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:50.000
There will be guest artists in the game including Yuzuki Kozaki from Fire Emblem Awakening.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Some talent behind Bayonetta, Duel Masters, Anarchy Reigns, that'll be pretty cool.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Lars is also going to be one of the characters in Tekken 7.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
That's pretty cool.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Lars is the son of Heihachi and the half brother of Kazuya so it makes sense that Lars will show up in this game as well.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Will we get any guest characters in this game because that'd be pretty sweet to see Bayonetta and Tekken.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I'm thinking with Lars maybe that's certainly possible.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
So stay tuned for that.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Also speaking of guest characters we questioned last week why did they announce Tekken 7 what the hell happened to Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Well a lot of people are asking that question what the hell happened to Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
You know it was revealed in 2010 and then that was kind of it.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Well Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada said that Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still in development and this was during the fighting game panel at San Diego Comic Con.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
That's it. So it's not dead.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:52.000
I think it's just like I said last week they were waiting until they knew they had a new engine for the next Tekken game.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And instead of developing it for the Tekken 6 engine or whatever they're just going to wait and put it on the Tekken 7 engine.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
So Tekken 7 first and then Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And that's what Fifth Dream in our chat says it will be in the Tekken 7 engine der.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I mean yeah it makes a lot of sense.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:14.000
So they're just putting it on hold because especially after Street Fighter Cross Tekken was kind of lukewarm response to that.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
You know not a lot of people were super into it.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I can see where they really want to really really have a different kind of you know experience so why not.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Who knows by that time we may have like Street Fighter 5.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I'd be very curious to see that.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Alright Loki what do you got?

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Okay you know once again talking about lots of the Sony properties becoming movies.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And another movie that I think a lot of people are going to be very interested to see would be The Last of Us.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000
That was I think announced to be an upcoming motion picture.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:46:00.000
And one of the actresses that they're talking to right now to be in the actual movie would be the actress that plays Arya Stark in the Game of Thrones.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.000
So I don't know that's pretty sweet.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I don't know.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I haven't played Last of Us unfortunately so I don't know if she'd be a good character for was it Ellie I think in the game.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Or am I confusing that with.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
No that's the character's name.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I have not played through this game.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I'm like I don't want to confuse that with The Walking Dead because there's a lot of characters.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
No but yeah Maisie Williams I guess would be the actress.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So I don't know I liked her in Game of Thrones.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:42.000
So I mean maybe she doesn't look like the main characters or it doesn't look like Ellie.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Makeup and hair and all that stuff can go a long way.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Yeah.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I wonder who they'll get to play the lead character in that.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.000
But yeah they haven't really said I guess Sam Raimi is you know supposed to be doing that.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So that's pretty sweet because he knows his horror.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Alright.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Bruce Campbell that would be awesome. Let's get Bruce Campbell.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
No Bruce Campbell is going to be doing the Evil Dead TV series now.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Like he's actually going to be in it.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
What?

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Yeah I saw that on Facebook.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
What there's a community.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It could have been a troll article or something.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
But well I'm if I saw it on Facebook Loki it's got to be true.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Maybe somebody in the chair.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Oh man.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Can that be so awesome if that.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Yeah.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I would be very more excited if it's an army of darkness.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
But whatever whatever I'll deal with that.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Well here's something else to get excited about a revival of a rock band.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
You know we've seen some hints about this and sadly I don't have confirmation today on that.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:49.000
But Harmonix did send out a little survey which through the through the ever lovely Survey Monkey site.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
A lot of people seem to use.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Asking how invested are you basically still in rock band and how likely would you be to join in on a reunion tour.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Could that be the possible theme of a new rock band game who knows.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
They wanted to know how often you play rock band.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
How often do you buy DLC.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
What peripherals do you have.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Do you want a new game on new consoles or legacy consoles.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
So very curious to see what comes to this.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I mean a lot of this is probably exploratory but it is nice to see if they haven't forgotten about rock band altogether.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I mean why not.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I would love to see a new game because I have all the fucking peripherals and I spent a lot of money on those peripherals.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Yeah I think as long as there's some way to kind of convert the peripherals I think that would really help a long way in.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:37.000
The only bad thing though is the music probably would not be able to be ported.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Yeah I don't know what they would be able to do with licensing with that.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
That would be tricky.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
RPGfan112 in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says it would be great to see a new rock band.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I agree.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
It's taken a rest long enough.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Let's bring it back for a reunion tour.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I like that.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Rise from your grave.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Rise from your grave.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.000
By the way Rama in chat says no not a troll article on the Bruce Campbell thing.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Yes.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
There you go.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Speaking of harmonics, one other quick little thing with them.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Dance Central Spotlight.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:16.000
This is the download only version of Dance Central that will be available on Xbox One and it will be available September 2nd.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
You will need a Kinect to play this as there is the option on the Xbox One now.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.000
It will have 10 songs with the game for $9.99.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
There will also be another 50 songs to choose from.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Not all at once necessarily by the way.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
The songs coming out with the game.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
When you buy the $9.99 game you get Avicii with Wake Me Up.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Cher Lloyd with I Wish.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
David Ghetto with Titanium.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Jason Derulo with Talk Dirty.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Kid Ink and Chris Brown with Show Me.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Lorde with Royals.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000
That song isn't played the fuck out but I'll just sing the weird Al Yankovic version and it will be fine.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
One Republic with Counting Stars.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Pharrell Williams with Happy.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Again, songs that are played out but weird Al made better.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Rihanna with Diamonds.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
And Will.I.Am featuring Justin Bieber with Hashtag That Power.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Okay, I'm gonna like show my age here but like really that's a song.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I don't know that song. I guess I should be thankful.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I guess I'll learn it.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Why does the song have a hashtag in it?

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
It is Hashtag That Power.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Unless it's supposed to be a number sign or something else but I don't think that's the case. It's hashtag.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Also available for separate downloads to give you an idea of some of the songs.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.000
And by the way, like all these songs that are being released on September 2nd are like better than the 10 that are included with the game.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
So, Capital City, Safe and Sound. I like that song.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Emily Sandé with Next To Me.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Icona Pop with I Love It. You know that song, right?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I think that's the theme song to Girls.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I love it. I don't care. I love it.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I always sing it.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
McDonald's. I love it.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Lana Del Rey with Summertime Sadness but the Cedric Gervais remix which is really, really good.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
And the B-52s with Love Shack which is the trump card.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Random.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Random. Awesome.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
If you see a faded sign at the side.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I need a guana girl here to do the proper Love Shack duet.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Alright, let's get to the emails. Every week you guys email us.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
And DarkSakura, typically she's going to be responsible for reading your emails.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
But since she is having a sick day, I will bear that responsibility.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
So let's get to it. The emails tonight.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
First up, AZHP says,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Hey, OLR crew. AZHP here.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I just wanted to submit a correction of facts for a story you reported on a few weeks ago.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
The tournament which banned female players from playing Hearthstone was following the IESF,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
a Korean organization's guidelines.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.000
The IESF divides players into male and female divisions to emulate the divide in real sports.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Because this tournament's winners would be placed in the Korean tournament,

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
they did not want a conflict to occur if a female player disqualified a male player

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
who could have been sent to the invitational tournament.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
It was not because they wanted to protect a male player's pride.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
The whole rationale is still stupid, but I just wanted to present all the facts

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
before we all jump down the tournament organizer's throats.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
They wanted gender division, not gender discrimination, and blocking women from playing at all.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Yours truly, AZHP.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I thought we had referenced that when we were originally going over the article,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
or at least I thought I had said, like,

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I think they did this because of the greater, like the championships or whatever.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I maybe forgot at the time that it was in Korea or whatever.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
But I think you kind of said it at the end there.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It doesn't necessarily make it right.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I mean, it definitely explains how it happened.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And I think there's just so many voices out there that says,

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
your cultural traditions be damned.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Gaming is a universally loved thing by people of all genders, all colors,

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
all shapes, all sizes, all sexualities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Right?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Right.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Thank you, though, for the clarification.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
AZHP is also a multiple gold star recipient.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
So, you know, some people I don't want to be corrected by, but AZHP, I'll take it.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Just kidding.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Love y'all.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Fantastic.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Every gamer has a voice here.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Next up from EA Skizie.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Hey, Orange Lounge.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I'm glad you guys had fun on your weekend off.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Me too.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
In your personal opinions, what was the greatest video game-based movie ever made?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I personally think Silent Hill was pretty dang cool.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Keep gaming.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000
EA Skizie, straight out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Meaning Milliwake.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Remember when Alice Cooper was in Wayne's World?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Wayne's World was my favorite movie.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Oh, wait.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
No, not game-based off a movie.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Which, by the way, it actually really sucked.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
What was your favorite movie based off a game?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Movie based off a game.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Well, I mean, I guess Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Oh, good choice.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
You know what?

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
None of them were really good, EA Skizie.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
That's the problem.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
We don't really have a lot of good ones.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Even if I was going to pick one that was actually...

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
I mean, even...

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
What was it?

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
The Final Fantasy...

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
What the fuck was the other one?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
The Spirits Within?

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
That wasn't too bad.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
It wasn't bad.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
It was just not Final Fantasy at all.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Yeah, it wasn't Final Fantasy.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Where was my fucking Chocobo in Spirits Within?

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Oh, wait.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I think there was half a frame.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
But anyway.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
My answer to the question, honestly, I know this might sound like a cop-out,

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
but Silent Hill was also my favorite.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
It was.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I liked the games, and I thought the movie did a pretty good job.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
It didn't blow my mind.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Awesome!

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
But it was good enough.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
It was probably the best one they've done so far.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat both weren't necessarily bad.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I still haven't seen the second Silent Hill movie.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Neither have I, but it's on Netflix.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
So if you have Netflix, yeah.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I do have Netflix.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
It's in my queue or whatever they changed.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Because Netflix always has to change something.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
So they're changing their logo, or they're changing their layout,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
or they're changing Saturday service,

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
and you don't have a queue anymore.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
It's your list.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Whatever.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Whatever.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
So that's in my list.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Some answers in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Tigerclaw says,

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Mortal Kombat without a doubt was a pretty faithful adaptation of the game

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
minus the fatalities.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Blackwool says,

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
It's a toss-up between Advent Children and the first Mortal Kombat.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Mortal Kombat is really the true sequel to Highlander.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Connor McCloud became the god of lightning after winning the tournament

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
and being the only one left.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Does The Wizard count as a video game movie?

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Actually, I think it should.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Skeezy, I'm retracting my answer and saying The Wizard.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
He touched my breast!

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
That was a definitive movie.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Or Tron, even though that's more of a game based off of a movie.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000
That's a good one, too.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Spirits Within was too Japanese and not commercial enough.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
It was a CGI art movie that tried to lie to people with action scenes.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
And I'm not hating.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I love that movie, but I don't argue with anyone that hated it.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000
There you go.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Tomb Raider, some folks in chat saying,

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yeah, Tomb Raider wasn't bad.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
It was that same category.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't like...

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
It wasn't bad because of Angelina Jolie.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
And she's great.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
And a great person.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I love Angelina Jolie.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
You guys really make me question my sexuality.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Her and Alex from Orange is the New Black are like...

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
I start to wonder.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Clearly the right answer is, you know,

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Street Fighter the movie said no one ever.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
No. No. God.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Oh, poor Raul Julia with that being the last movie.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Alright.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Moving on.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Next email.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
And this email is from IngramAV98.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I hope I said that correct.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Hey guys and gal.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Well, gal's absent tonight, but we'll pass this along.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.000
This email may appear a little fragmented as I started writing it three or four weeks ago.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Doh!

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I'm listening at the moment to you guys talk about your motivations

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
for still working on this show all these years.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
This must have been after our 12th birthday show.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
And I wanted to say a big thank you.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Aww, thank you for listening.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I started listening some seven years ago.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.000
I'd been at a low point in my life and randomly took a chance on OLR

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
so I could try and get back into games after a five year hiatus.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I definitely don't regret it.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I will always be thankful to you guys and the community you created

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
for reigniting that spark in me.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I'm still a little behind the times now that I'm busy with real life,

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
but you guys always manage to keep me up to date

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
and most importantly, I feel included and entertained.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Aww, thank you!

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I mean, seriously, you don't even understand.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Like, comments like that, like, that's why we're still fucking doing this after 12 years, right?

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Right.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
And then even, you know, we gotta tip our hat and say a big thank you to Bobby Blackwolf as well,

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
who's been our partner show on Sunday nights for like the past seven years at least.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
He actually hit nine years tonight.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Or, well, technically it was on the 24th, but like this is the show where he's observing it, right?

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
He hit nine years.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
And I had one of those reactions where I was like,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
oh my god, you've been doing this for nine years?

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I was like, oh my god, I'm so old.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Like, I had that reaction of like when your friend is at, like when you turn 30, Loki.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000
I was like, Loki's turning 30? Oh my god, what does that make me?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
That was the reaction I had when Bobby said he's turning nine years old.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Anyway, thank you. Thank you for being a supporter of the show.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
There is more to this email.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
With all the gratitude out of the way and it now being the present, I have a question.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Loki, I've been keeping up to date with your game development project and contemplated doing this myself.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
My degree was in games design.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I recently moved to Dusseldorf, I probably said that wrong, Germany, from London,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
and that I said right, and found it hard to find work as a web developer.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So I thought about turning to mobile games development to try and generate some pocket money.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
What kind of time have you sunk into the project so far?

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Well, I've been working on it whenever free time I have, which is not a lot since the beginning of March.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:56.000
But that includes like research and just kind of, I don't know, it's not like, I don't know.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Like, a lot of it is just thinking about it or like, you know, just researching stuff is a lot of my time spent.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Because, you know, there's some nights, like last night, I had my computer open and I was like,

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.000
you know what, I'm just going to rewrite, you know, this helper script that I have for my primitives to,

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I have it for my color, changing colors of, you know, the materials and stuff because I use the vector, or the vertex colors.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:30.000
So I had to rewrite everything from the way I was doing it before, and I was just too tired to do it.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:39.000
So I just stopped. But, yeah, I'd say, I don't know, like four months now I've been working on it.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:48.000
But it's, of those four months, you know, maybe a couple hours a day, you know, or an hour a day.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I'm always thinking about it, but, you know, actually getting time to work on it.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Like, on a good day, you know, I might work on it, my work breaks and lunch, which would be an hour and a half.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:04.000
So, that's about it. And how much of that time am I actually productive? Very little.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.000
But you're learning a lot, and I, you know, I think it's, I actually, I'm really glad we're getting these emails,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
because I know you've talked a lot about the project, and you don't, I mean, with all due respect, you have nothing to show for it yet,

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000
so it's just a lot of talk, right? Which is fine, which is fine. I mean, making games is hard,

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
but what I like about this is that you're also one of the more critical guys on the show.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:29.000
So, it's nice for you to feel the pain a little bit, because I feel like it's going to bring a whole new perspective to some of the games you talk about in the future.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Well, I like, just, it gives me a better understanding of things, because I can look at something and see how they do it,

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000
and kind of like, okay, that's, that's how they're doing this, or that's why they did it this way.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I love, too, that some of, like, our industry friends, like, people that actually do the game design stuff for a living,

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
like our buddy at Crystal Dynamics, Tim, was giving you advice on Twitter.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Yeah, yeah, I was at, well, because I was asking about, like, I was trying to get my shader to look a certain way,

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.000
and I was trying to figure out how something was, how to render something so it looked a certain way,

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:08.000
and, you know, you can't put that in the Google, you can't say, like, how do I render something to look like something like this,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.000
and, you know, how it makes sense, you have, I didn't know the terminology for what I was looking for,

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:20.000
you know, to do a search on it, and it was ambient inclusion, which, sadly, I'm probably not going to be able to do,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000
because that's a UND Pro thing, and it's screen space.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.000
But when you make all the oodles of money from this project, you'll be able to buy it for your next project.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Probably when I launch a Kickstarter, I'll be able to pay for that, but, you know, because unfortunately,

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:41.000
I'm probably going to do that just to pay for software, but not until it's almost done, of course.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.000
But, yeah, I mean, once I, there's a lot of fees you gotta look for, you know, even starting a company,

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.000
and, like, registering trademarks, that's, like, about $1,000 in itself right there, and...

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Yeah, VOC is a company now, you know that?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
The taxes?

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Yeah.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Yeah, well, have you registered a trademark for VOC?

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I don't think, uh, I...

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
That's about $1,000.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
That's a Bobby question, I don't, I don't...

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
I don't think you, yeah.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I don't think it is trademarked, actually.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000
I mean, it's trademarked...

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
That doesn't mean you're gonna, I will wreck you if you steal it.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Well, no, no, no, it's trademarked, because you can use it as a trademark, but it's not a registered trademark,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
which is different.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.000
So, yeah, I have to register a trademark for my company name, and for my, which I already have picked out,

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.000
and my game name, which I also already have picked out, and then, um, just, probably licensing music

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
is gonna be the hardest thing, because right now I've been working off of free Creative Commons music.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
That's smart, though, to reach out to those artists directly, and, you know,

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
because a lot of them would just love the exposure, I mean...

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Yeah, a lot of it's just Creative Commons music, and, and I have a weird, eclectic mix of music right now.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Alright, we're tangenting...

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
That's okay, there's another question here, too, that's the reason why I want to bring this back,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.000
because the other question is, and you've kind of answered this already, but just if there's anything you want to add,

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
the other question from IngramAV98 is,

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
is it purely a passion project, or do you consider it a viable source for a trickle of income?

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Um, well, it's definitely gonna be a trickle of income, and I think it can be a source of income,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:14.000
it's just, probably the way I should have done it is done a bunch of really small projects first,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
to have that income coming in.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Isn't that what Bobby told you to do?

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Yeah, but the problem is, it's so boring, it's so boring.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Yes, I, no, his, his advice was to remake, like, Pong or something like that, and to learn how to use Unity.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I get that.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Which, that makes sense, and I have no problem knowing how to use Unity right now, that's okay,

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:40.000
but, like, to make small games, because the way that people make games on the App Store now,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
it's like you make a game that people like, and they'll pay 99 cents to buy it or something,

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:51.000
or you make a bunch of free-to-play games, and you reskin the shit out of it, and you keep uploading it as a different game.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
And yeah, that sounds kind of lame, but that's how you kind of make money,

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:01.000
because you got people to download it in order to get ad revenue, and even ad revenue is just not that great.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So, it's just small things so that you have stuff out there so you can make some sort of money.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
But yeah, I'm hoping to make some sort of money. Is it going to replace my daytime job?

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I hope it will, but I don't think it's going to.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Oh, you'll find out, because unfortunately we talked about a few weeks ago the whole layoff thing.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
You're going to have a little time in between job hunting to work on this project, so.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Well, I have the kid at home, so I don't know if it's going to be that much time.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
It's true, a full-time parent.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
All right, anyhow, to finish out the email, that's it for now.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I'm sure I'll be back with more emails in the future.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Sorry I can't listen live, I did try a few times, but it's just too late for me.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I know you guys over there on the other side of the pond, it's too damn late for you guys,

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000
but I mean, in order to do a show for you guys at the quote-unquote right time,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
we'd have to be here at noon on a Sunday, which just kills the weekend, you know.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
So, sorry guys, but that's why there's podcasts.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
That's why you get into the podcast.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Oh, before I forget, the whole Xbox games with gold thing, I checked into it,

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.000
and you only have to say subscribe with Xbox One to keep your games.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.000
For 360, you can still keep your games once you enter your subscription,

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
or at least that's what I read.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Last time you talked about it, the latter part was in question.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Cheers.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Hmm, well, I still have a subscription.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
My 360 is still sitting over there unplugged.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Unplugged and unloved, unfortunately.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Unfortunately, I do have like, I still have like $60 worth of money on the Xbox account.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
But I don't know what the fuck to buy.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I need that DLC for Rent of the Heart of Five to come out already.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
All right.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Loki, I bet, before we get into our next story, we're talking about the mobile games and all that stuff,

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:37.000
I bet you wish you had thought up a Kim Kardashian Hollywood adventure, right?

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Do you know how fucking big that game is?

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:47.000
That is like the new Farmville, Flappy Bird, this fucking Kim Kardashian Hollywood.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:55.000
It's because it's a perfect center between, you know, trendy people like Kim Kardashian, so the player game,

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000
and then there's people that hate Kim Kardashian and want to play the game that'd be ironically funny,

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
and then they end up getting addicted to it.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I remember at the last big E3 in 2006, Paris Hilton was hawking something like that.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Paris Hilton's Jules game, it was just like a bejeweled clone with Paris Hilton.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
That did not take off for her like this fucking Kim Kardashian.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Well, it's because people are being ironically funny with it.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
It'll blow over. Meanwhile, it only came out a couple weeks ago.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Yeah. Well, they already have clones out there on the marketplace too, of course.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
We have clones of that. Who's the clone of?

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Hollywood starlet or something like that is some clone.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Gilbert Gottfried's Hollywood starlet.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
That I'd play. That I'd play.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
I don't think you're good enough to be on the A-list yet.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
You need to make some more movies.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:47.000
I'm surprised they don't have, if we were going to see a clone, it would have been Kathy Griffin.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Kathy Griffin, life on the D-list.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
No, that would be something, obviously.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
All right. Speaking of life on the D-list, it's time to get to the FUs of the week,

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
because sometimes we're feeling pretty D-list.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
This is fucked up.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.000
It reminds me of when everybody was playing Sorority Light on Facebook. Remember that?

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
It was one of the first big Facebook games.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I try to block all those games on Facebook.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I seriously, the only time I've ever played a game on Facebook.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Well, I'm sorry. There's two times I've played games on Facebook.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Number one was to play the stupid duck game to get these explosive ducks in Crackdown 1.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
That was the first one.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Number two was to play the stupid garage sale game for Ready Player One,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
and I regret all that time spent on that game.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
It was fucking terrible.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.000
And had I known what the last challenge was, I wouldn't have even bothered.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I had friends that were hardcore in Sorority Life, like making spreadsheets and shit. It was crazy.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Anyway, sorry Loki, FUs of the week.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Actually, funny enough, it just reminded me of it.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
FU to myself for my cut of that song.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Because in the very beginning there, it's actually a quote from the movie Punisher.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:21.000
It cuts off because I couldn't get, like, it's like, I forget the lines.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Like, I am just as I am something I am, and it just didn't sound right.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000
But, yeah, so FU that.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
My FU of the week goes to those fucking hiccups I had in the first half of the show.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
My god, like, imagine somebody's listening to the show for the first time this week,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and they're like, who are these two amateur clowns? How have they not been cancelled after twelve years?

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Because no one can cancel us! We're our own show! Who's gonna cancel us?

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
We're gonna make no money!

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
We'll show you cancellation.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
What, we're gonna make less money?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:59.000
That's right. I think I need to pay the bill to keep VOG running, by the way. I think that's due.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Alright, let's get back into some more gaming news.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
And then your calls coming up in just a little bit, about five minutes away from your calls,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
at 1-877-GAMO-LR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
But first, Loki.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Speaking of less money, what's less than free?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Well, nothing. Unless they give you money.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
But EA's not gonna give you money to play The Sims 2, but you can play it for free.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.000
And the way you can do that, and this is by July 31st is when this runs out,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.000
you can actually go on Origin and redeem a code that is for The Sims 2.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And I can't remember, it's like something, I love The Sims, or something.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Yeah, it's I love The Sims, and I-love-the-sims.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000
And it will redeem a free copy of The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Now you may remember we talked a little bit about them giving out free copies for,

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
if you had an original copy of The Sims 2.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I don't think they wanted to deal with people calling them to redeem that,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.000
so they just said, fuck it, you know what, we're gonna advertise this to kind of

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
get some interest for The Sims 4 that's coming out in a couple months.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:13.000
So, The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection, for free, through Origin.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.000
I love The Sims. That's what you have to put in, redeem product code.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Yes, you do have to install Origin, but you know what, I did it for Titanfall, so whatever.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Yeah, probably a lot of people have had to give up and install Origin.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000
And it wasn't as evil as I thought it was. But I'm not buying anything on that store.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000
But it's not like the devil on my computer or anything.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Yeah, Origin's not as awful as it was when it first came out.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.000
They are giving away the free games, which does enhance its value a little bit,

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000
but give you a reason to install it, but I don't know.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I'm still not like, ooh, this is a must-have thing. I'm always just kind of like,

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
why does everybody have to have their own fucking thing?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Like, why can't we just make a contract with another company?

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Everybody's gotta have their own thing.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Everybody wants a piece of the pot and the money, but it's like,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000
can't we just have like three or four big ones?

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
You know what, though, I'm totally cool with them having their own thing.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Yeah, it's a little lame that they have games exclusive to it,

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
but at the same time, I'm glad they do have another storefront,

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
because it is more competition, which drives the prices down.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
That is good, but you still have Dasura, GOG.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I mean, there are other, Humble Store now, there are other games.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Yeah.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Yeah.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
All right.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, game services are always awful

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
until people get tired of bitching about it.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Well, I also haven't tried to play Mass Effect multiplayer in a very long time,

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
and that's the thing that always pissed me off about Origin.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000
It was so redonkulous how Allen and I, being in the same house,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000
couldn't connect to multiplayer matches without waiting for Jupiter to be aligned

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
with the second moon of Saturn.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.000
And the best part about The Sims 2 is they didn't remove pools,

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
and I think there are still babies in this.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Oh, yay, drown all the toddlers you want.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Well, you can't do that in The Sims 4.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
There you go.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
I'm not saying drown toddlers, but it's separate.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
You have babies and drown the adults.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Kill everyone now.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Trap them in the walls.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
One more story for you guys tonight, and probably a lot of you guys have seen this

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000
making the rounds on Facebook and some other forms of social media

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
because it's given everybody a little case of the feels

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
that it has to do with video games.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000
And I think a lot of you guys have heard about this story

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000
where a 16-year-old guy was playing his Xbox,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000
and his father had passed away about a decade ago when the son was four.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
The dad had brought home a first-generation Xbox

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
so that they would play together as much as they could while the son was four.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Now, the Xbox is still something that works, and he's able to play.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000
So the son decided to bring up on the Xbox an old, old game called Rally Sport Challenge,

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000
which was out in 2002.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And going through the menus and starting up the game, what did he find in the game?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
His dad's racing ghost, essentially.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:12.000
He was able to play with his dad again about ten years after he passed away.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Sorry for chopping onions over here, but I just thought,

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
you know, we always hear these stories about how video games are bad and all this.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I like stories like this, how, wow, video games can provide these really awesome moments like this,

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000
thanks to the ghost data.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And would you think about it?

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I bet a lot of you probably haven't played Rally Sport Challenge,

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
but a lot of you probably have played Mario Kart, which does something very similar.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Just imagine my ghost data.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000
My son races against my ghost data from Forza Horizon.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
It crashes to the wall.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Up-turn crashes to the wall.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Up-turn crashes to the wall.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Yes.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.000
What's also interesting, though, is that he realized as he was racing,

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
he could never beat his dad because if he passed the dad,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
he would replace the ghost data with his own.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
So he purposely loses every race so he could still play.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000
That's why you back up your data.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
That's a good point.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Always back it up.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Hopefully he's done that by now.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.000
As the story has made the rounds, I'm sure a lot of people will give advice.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
You know, I saw a really similar thing like this on Facebook once.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I think it was a translated Korean cartoon or something that was about playing Animal Crossing.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
And I think the person who had been playing it, their mom had passed away or something,

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
and they logged into Animal Crossing long after the fact and they got all these letters

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
because the mom was playing Animal Crossing hardcore

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000
and sent all these letters every week that the kid never read until she was gone

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000
and went back into Animal Crossing and saw all these letters and gifts and things.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.000
It was just like this really like, you know, cries, sobbing.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.000
I swear I've seen this exact same story, the racing thing,

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:54.000
several years ago that someone had a racing ghost and they did this.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I don't know. I swear I've seen this before.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Just think of it, you know, years after you're gone, Loki, Josh or Danny might find your old ZZT games.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Good, because I don't know where the fuck they are.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Or worse yet, episodes of this show.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
More likely.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.000
This is the legacy that we're leaving behind, Loki.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
So this is why we're home every Sunday?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Daddy, why aren't you coming with us?

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Why aren't you coming with us? I'm going to work, Josh.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
That's what I tell him every week.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
You call it work?

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Well, I start calling it the radio show because his mom's like,

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000
It's not work.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
It's a hobby.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000
When you make money from it, then it's work.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
All right.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
There you go. That is it for our news tonight.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
But that means we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.000
It's your turn to give us a call.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Feel free to give us a call. It is open.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
And I'm not going to keep it open forever, though.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
So if you want to get through, do it now.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Meanwhile, Loki, any last-minute stories?

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I do want to bring up one thing, because I can't believe I didn't put it somewhere else in the show.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.000
But I just realized out of Comic-Con, one of the other big, big things of a game that I used to be really into,

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
not so much anymore, but Warcraft.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Or World of Warcraft.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:22.000
This movie, going back to the roots, Warcraft, they apparently did show a clip at Comic-Con of the movie.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Unfortunately, that one has not leaked to the internet.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000
All we got was a logo that, you know, I mean, it's whatever, it's a logo.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.000
It doesn't look like the game's logo, OMG, but I kind of didn't expect it to.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Because, like, did Resident Evil's logo look like the game? No.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Did Mortal Kombats look like the game?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Have those movies even fucking followed the storyline of Resident Evil?

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Because it doesn't make any goddamn sense now.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Alright, let's get on those phones, and Rama's saying we're not on Skype.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Yes, we are. Watch, I'll prove it.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Hi, this is Raginator.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Hey, Raginator, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Uh, not a whole lot. There is one story that I found earlier that you guys have recovered.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
I'll try to make it short and sweet.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Basically, later on, around October 18th, for 24 hours, you will be able to get paid the heist on Steam for free.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Wait, in October?

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Yeah, specifically October 18th.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Why would they advertise it this far in advance, because now they're going to...

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
No one will remember.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Well, A, nobody's going to remember. B, they're not going to sell any copies of the game now until October, because everybody's going to be waiting for the free.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Yeah, well, I just discovered the story on another site.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Basically, what I'm saying is that there was some kind of movement on the Steam forums or whatever.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Where a whole bunch of people joined the A-Day 2 Steam group and, you know, like, petitioned that the original games would be free.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Basically, the publisher said, yeah, we'll make it free if a whole bunch of people will continue to join the A-Day 2 Steam group.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:37.000
That's it? You just have to join the Steam group and you get a free game?

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Yeah, I think they wanted to hit the 1.5 million member mark to get quote-unquote secret stuff.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Clearly, they've got another one in the works, clearly.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Yeah, but anyway, I think it's likely less of that to get the Bay Mask.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:14.000
But anyway, yeah, just join the A-Day 2 Steam group and wait for October 18th for 24 hours only.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
On October 18th, you can get the game for free.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Alright, well, I'm gonna help everybody out right now. So, get out your little phones, okay, and hold the button down.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:30.000
And I'm gonna say, sorry Android users, I got nothing for you. But for iPhone users, here you go. Hold the button down. You ready?

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Siri, set a reminder on October 18th to download Pay Day. It's free, y'all. There you go.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Yeah, I have no idea if the game's good or not, but you can't really argue with free, so...

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:54.000
That's right. Pay Day's not a series I'm very familiar with, but for free, I'll check it out.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Oh, yeah. Well, that's the only thing I really want to cover. You know, I'll book you or cover another story that I was gonna talk about.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Which was what, quickly?

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Huh?

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Which was what?

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Actually, I forget what the story was. I think I linked it to you, but Logan took care of it.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Alright, well, good to know he's on top of things. Alright, I guess we can keep him around.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Alright, Raginator, we'll set that reminder on your calendar, alright?

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Alright, have a good one.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Alright, you too, buddy.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Alright, bye-bye.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Bye. If it's free and it's on PC, Raginator's on it, everybody. He's on the case, so...

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:46.000
There was, actually, it was, I forget which game it was now, there's on Steam Greenlight right now, there's a game that used to be a PSP Japanese RPG that they're trying to get greenlit,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:55.000
and if you vote for it, that you want it greenlit, and you post on their forums that you voted, they will send you a free copy.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:00.000
A little gaming the system there, but free game, who cares?

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Alright, we got another call. Maybe they'll talk about a free game, too, we'll see. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Well, the only free game I play are on my Android phone. Oh, hi, it's Rama.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Hi, Rama, it just wouldn't be a night on OLR without you. What's up, buddy?

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Oh, the usual. I just want to get in about this whole San Diego Comic-Con thing, because you had asked earlier, why is SCCC getting all this gaming content?

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Well, let's take a step back. Why don't you do Comic-Con?

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Okay. I don't have enough blood in my body to get press passes for that. It used to be easy for New York Comic-Con.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Now, this time, you have to fill out a seven-page form in triplicate and put down the people you want as press.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:51.000
When they approve your form, each person has filled that same form in triplicate and sent it in, and somewhere at the bottom, they ask for a vial of your blood.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
This is why you need an intern.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
I am the intern.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Fair enough.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It's got so bad that most of the local press outlets out here don't even go to New York Comic-Con for any money. Like, fuck it, it's not worth it.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000
R's got a real job, so I guess we have an opening.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Just give it the regenator.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Maybe. Maybe he's kind of working the free Steam games angle, at least.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I know.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000
He calls on the H.A.S. and tells us about the free anime that's available on iTunes and all that cool stuff.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.000
There you go. Hey, you know what? Somebody's got to look out for all the free stuff. Sometimes it's hidden.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
So what did you want to say about Comic-Con?

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Well, the reason why I say it's getting all this gaming content is, I mean, think about it. It's right there in California.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:44.000
All these gaming companies are right there, so it's pretty easy for them to travel there and set up their booths and advertise.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:56.000
It's getting to the point where SDCC should be called SDEC, San Diego Entertainment-Con, because to be perfectly honest, when was the last time you heard anything comic-related come out of there?

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Well, the Batman vs. Superman movie? Wonder Woman's outfit?

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
The movie's talking comic.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
I get your point. I get your point. Here's food for thought, though.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I would argue, yeah, there's a lot of companies in Silicon Valley, and I always laugh at that whole thing where now they're talking about separating into six states, because it won't be in the same state anymore if that crap passes.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:27.000
But all these companies in Silicon Valley, yeah, sure, it's easy for them, but very few of them went to GamerX, that's for sure, for having all those companies in the backyard.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:31.000
But I guess that's a whole other Oprah. But there are a lot of companies everywhere.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I mean, you know, you got a few out back east that do the PAX East, right? In Boston, what, 2K and Harmonix and stuff.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And obviously Seattle, where PAX Prime is at, is like the stronghold of Nintendo and Microsoft.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:50.000
So, you know, California doesn't get everybody. I mean, we got a good chunk. We got Sony here, but we don't got everybody.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I get that, but also, it's like Anime Expo, a lot of game companies were there, too, because out of the sheer convenience, you know?

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Right.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:08.000
And now Comic-Con is trying to pull a cease and desist, because another convention is calling themselves Comic-Con. They're like, we can't have that.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
That's why registered trademarks are important.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Which means they're gonna piss off New York. Comic-Con, Baltimore Comic-Con, Boston Comic-Con, Philly Comic-Con, you get drafted.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:28.000
There's a lot. There's a lot. BlackWolf in chat pointing out Austin, Texas has a lot of companies, too, hence PAX South being nearby.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Yeah, that's where Gearbox is located, right? So, yeah. There you go.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:38.000
All right, Rama. Well, you know, it is awfully convenient for a lot of those companies to get over there. That is true.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:46.000
But I just kind of feel like E3 is kind of the kickoff season where a lot of these companies kind of go around to different places and do various expos.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:56.000
You know, not even necessarily E3. I mean, with Game Developers Conference and PAX East, there's plenty of employees at companies that do a lot, a lot, a lot of these expos.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Look at that. Shiller Games US Tour 2014.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Why not? Gotta sell something. All right, Rama. If there's nothing else, I'm gonna let you go, okay?

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:10.000
We have a surprise on Anime Jam Session. Tune in. You'll find out what it is.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Surprise?

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Yep.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.000
All right. I guess I like surprises.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Oh, you do. I know.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Am I gonna like this surprise?

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Yes. Yes, you will.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
All right. We'll check it out on Tuesday.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000
You got it, bro.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000
All right, later.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Later.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000
We'll see if we get one more call in. 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Loki, any last minute stories that you've discovered? I'll check Twitter. I don't think I saw anything coming on Twitter.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:40.000
It got really ridiculous when I couldn't tell if this was just some sort of advertisement from GameStop.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:49.000
But it's claiming that GameStop says that only half, fewer than half of their customers know that they can trade in games.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:50.000
What?

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Or know that they, I guess, I don't know if it's trading games or if it's trading in like phones and tablets.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Oh, okay.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:09.000
No, no, no. Here's what it says. GameStop president Tony Bartell told VentureBeat that only 40% of the retailers' customers know they can trade in their old products for in-store credit or cash.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.000
And he says even fewer know that they can trade in mobile devices like phones and tablets. I call bullshit. I don't believe that.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
I don't believe that either.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I think that's just like a way that, did you know that you could trade in stuff and we give you really great value for your trades?

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
It sounds like it's just like an article as an advertisement.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
It's something they tell you every time you're at the counter.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:33.000
How do you not know? I mean, how would you not know? I mean, seriously. Can you not read?

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Now, I would argue that more of GameStop's customers don't know that they could get more money from that game selling it on eBay or directly or somewhere else.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000
I'm pretty sure that everybody knows that. Like, where did they think those used games come from?

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000
They just magically appeared. Poof.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
They used GameFairy, brought more!

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.000
The wild last year's Madden approaches. What will you do?

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
They've run away.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.000
All right. Nobody else is calling. Any other last minute stories you want to sneak in there?

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
That's all I had.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
All right. Well, with no other calls coming in, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:19.000
We're a little early tonight, but that's okay with me being a little sniffly and Jamie not being here.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
And clearly I'm one big cootie tonight because I keep hiccuping and all this stuff.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000
I think it's all right for us to go ahead and throw in the towel towel here just a little bit early.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:32.000
But I don't want to wrap things up until I do remind everybody, you know, it isn't an indie show.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
We don't make money off of it. All the joking that we do.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
So if you do like our show, please help spread the word about Orange Laundry. Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Help spread the word. And if you if you decided, you know, you got the whole way through this show.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Bless your heart. And you still thought it sucked. You know what?

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Support other indie broadcasters because there's a lot of hardworking independent producers out there making content.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Please support our fellow indie podcasters.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.000
That is about going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.000
But first, I got to check in with everybody's final thoughts.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
So, Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I got to figure out how I'm going to squeeze in a haircut in tomorrow.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Because I got to do that before all my customers come out for our event.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Yeah, I'm way overdue for one too.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I meant to do it today, but then like my wife ended up leaving with Josh and them.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Usually I'll do it in like free time between, you know, when she leaves and when the show begins.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:27.000
But she left with me like at four thirty and then she's like, oh, by the way, I need you to pack Josh's lunch.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:32.000
And they need you to put the clean sheets on the bed because Danny peed all over the bed.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:39.000
So, yeah, kids say it's all pee and poop with these things.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Literally, all babies do and children.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.000
So, here's that. But I don't know. This week will be fun.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Alright. My final thought is I would like to stop having the snifflies and feel better.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000
K, thanks. And I'll try to be at 100 percent next week, you guys.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Thanks for getting through the show. I appreciate it.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.000
And thanks to all you live folks that tune out or tune out, turn out and then tune out and listen to the show.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I really appreciate it. And also all our podcastees and the folks listening.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.000
And I hope we helped get you through your workday or your commute this week.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000
So, that's it. We're done. We're out of here.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Until next time. Have a great week, everybody. And we'll see you next time here at Orange Lawn Radio.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Jamie will be back next week. Oh, also next week on the show. I believe next week is the day.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Oh, I got to confirm this real quick. Shoot, shoot.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I would say, Loki, buy me time. You already unplugged your mic, didn't you? You are out of here.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I didn't unplug my mic.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
I want to confirm this for next week because I had a date on this.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
It's a guest?

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Yeah, we're going to have a guest here in studio and it is, yes, it's next week, August 3rd.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Our old friend from Orange Lawn Radio, explicit, or Jonas, will be here. Ran into him at Game Wrecks.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.000
But will he be dressed up like an NDS or Wii Remote or something of that sort?

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:58.000
We're going to ask him and he's not going to be alone. He's bringing his little posse.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Maybe he'll bring you some games for us to play. I don't know because that's what they do.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
They go around to anime conventions and set up games.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:07.000
So, we're going to talk about, he's going to be doing that here locally for SAC Anime.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.000
We'll talk about that and just kind of what all goes into making the game room.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
So, we're going to talk about that next week. Very excited.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
So, stay tuned guys. We'll see you next week here at Orange Lawn Radio. Good night.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Those of the staff of Orange Lawn Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
See you next week.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Thanks for watching!
