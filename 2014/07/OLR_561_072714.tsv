7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	As more summer conventions have come and gone, more details about our favorite games have come to light, more rumors confirm, more plot points teased, and more availability of our favorite classics.
21000	27000	The theme of this week is more, and we'll tell you about all this and more on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live on this July the 27th, 2014 with the 561st episode of our show.
45000	55000	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-host, unfortunately not here tonight, DarkSakura.
55000	61000	DarkSakura is a little bit sick and she's trying to rest up tonight, so she can be all better to go back to work tomorrow.
61000	63000	But I do have here in studio, TechMasterLoki.
63000	64000	Hello.
64000	65000	Hey Loki, how are you?
65000	66000	I'm fine.
66000	73000	Yeah, you know what's weird is that I'm feeling a little bit sniffly too. I don't think it's anything like contagious, I wouldn't worry, but it's just, yeah this is weird. Something in the air.
73000	80000	It's like a summer sinus infection or something, I don't know, I hope not, I shouldn't curse myself like that, but bleh.
80000	82000	Just the dry air.
82000	85000	Yeah, you're the one with kids, you're the one that's supposed to always be sick.
85000	87000	And I am sometimes.
87000	89000	Maybe I'm just getting delayed con play.
89000	94000	I get like random fevers every now and then. Like earlier this week I'm like, why am I dizzy?
94000	98000	Wait, I have a fever, why do I have a fever? I'm not even sick, that's weird.
98000	109000	Well I was really surprised that I didn't come back from GamerX2 sick, because like every convention you come back sick, that's to be expected, but unless I've been fighting this off for like two weeks, this is a while ago now.
109000	117000	Which by the way, I want to give a cheap plug to The Voice of Geeks Network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
117000	130000	vognetwork.com, that's vognetwork.com, and over at vognetwork.com, not only are there lots of other great shows that you can hear about all different things geek, all over the spectrum, movies, gaming, anime, you know, what have you.
131000	139000	We also occasionally have some other things posted as well. We have a great TV reviews section of the website that's done by John and his posse over at Critical Myth.
139000	150000	But we also, we started to dip our toe into the water of video coverage, thanks to our pal Eddie from Starboard Power Coupling, which is another show on the network all about Star Trek.
150000	159000	They actually call it Starboard Power Coupling, the Star Trek podcast you hope doesn't fail. And that's a joke if you've ever watched Star Trek, I'll let that one simmer for the ultra nerds in the room.
159000	168000	But Eddie over there, very talented video guy, and he offered to come to GamerX and shoot some things and, you know, even he was like, Rob, you should get up and do some interviews.
168000	179000	And I was like, no, no, no, I feel fat. I don't want to be on camera and all that stuff. But he, you know, he really encouraged me and he put together some really great little YouTubes that we have up at vognetwork.com that you can check out.
179000	191000	And it's, if you are having trouble finding it, I don't know how, because it's the first image that comes up, you see that infamous cosplay of the two gals from GamerX who did the too hard to render cardboard boxes where they're all in black, right?
191000	203000	With all the Assassin's Creed propaganda. Just click on that and it's going to take you to all the videos, which early in the week, we just had like a little five minute montage, but now there's a bunch of interviews that I did with various cosplayers, some other podcasters, like our pal from Gameboi.org.
203000	215000	Captain's, excuse me. I told you I was sick. Oh, horrible radio. Radio guy's worst enemy. Sorry. Captain's pipe from Gameboi.org and Jonko from Koopa Club amongst some cosplayers.
215000	224000	So you can check that all out again at vognetwork.com. So yeah, I'm hoping we get to do more video coverage later, but big, big props and thanks to Eddie again for that.
225000	236000	Let's talk a little bit about video games. So before we get into how was your gaming week, the types of video games that we've been playing this week, let's talk a little bit about Comic-Con, because Comic-Con's on everybody's minds right now.
236000	247000	And obviously there's a lot of general geek stuff. We don't get into a lot of the, well, who am I kidding? We go on tangents all the time on non-geek stuff. So let's do another one real quick. What are some of the really cool things you've seen come out of Comic-Con so far?
248000	254000	Well, the last cool thing I saw that come out of Comic-Con was the trailer for Mad Max, which is pretty sweet.
257000	259000	I like the Batman and Superman thing.
259000	269000	Yeah, I'm not so... I know they had that leaked shot showing, I guess, some armored Batman thing. I don't know yet. I haven't seen Ben Affleck.
269000	272000	Well, it's from one of the comics. There's a leaked thing out there.
272000	276000	Yeah, I saw that, but I kind of want to see the trailer. I'd be curious to see.
276000	278000	You know what everybody hated the idea of?
278000	280000	I don't hate the idea of...
280000	283000	This is really bad, Loki. Keep talking. I gotta get water. Live radio, everybody.
283000	290000	No, I don't hate the idea of Ben Affleck being, you know, Bruce Wayne or Batman. It's just I haven't seen how it looks yet.
290000	302000	So I don't know what kind of Batman to expect. I mean, because there's been a whole gamut of Batmans in movies, you know, from campy to, you know, gritty, I guess.
302000	314000	And so I don't know where he falls into the spectrum of that. And I think even coming off of, you know, the last three movies where you have just like, you know, the really dark Batman.
314000	326000	I mean, anything different than that's kind of like, what? Because, I mean, when they're doing the Joel Schumacher films and even like the Burton stuff, it's very different, I guess.
327000	335000	I like the Christian Bale Batman. I did, despite the whole, you know, crime dog McGruff. Or what was that guy? Only you can prevent crime. Take a bite out of crime.
335000	341000	Always kind of Batman in the new movies. So despite all of that, he was one of my more favorite Batman materials.
341000	347000	I'm hoping Ben Affleck is a little more like that or Michael Keaton because nobody liked the idea of Michael Keaton doing Batman either and he was great.
347000	354000	I think, honestly, probably the best one they had. And a little less George Clooney.
354000	358000	But George Clooney, that was more the fault of the movie than necessarily George Clooney.
358000	365000	But speaking of Batman, one of my very favorite things to come out of Comic-Con, the announcement of the 60s series on Blu-ray.
365000	370000	And they actually had the old stars out parading to promote it, which was awesome.
370000	382000	That's pretty sweet. I mean, he's so old though now. Like I saw, they showed a shot of Adam West. I'm like, oh my God, he is so old now.
382000	384000	He's 83, I believe I read.
384000	396000	But I would have loved to see a superhero show where it's just like, they took the villains and the superheroes from the 60s show and just threw them into modern day.
396000	403000	They have almost like Austin Powers. They have no concept of the future and reality and stuff.
403000	409000	And their schemes are just really lo-fi and just kind of cheesy and stupid.
409000	416000	You know what? Julie Newmar was there too. You know, the OG Catwoman. I mean, obviously there was a few others too. Lee Meriwether, Eartha Kitt.
416000	421000	But Julie Newmar was there. And you know, I know this is going to sound really weird to you guys, but just hear me out for a minute.
421000	430000	She looks great for like 82 or however old she is. She's like really gorgeous for 82. I mean, obviously she's old.
430000	437000	But she's still like rocking those dresses with a plunging neckline and all that stuff.
437000	439000	I mean like, you know, you go. You go.
439000	442000	And nowadays the neckline really has to plunge.
442000	444000	Ha! You ass.
444000	451000	Um, let's see. What other things did I see out of there? I mean, I don't know.
451000	461000	I had the intention of watching like the Marvel livestream and stuff and then they just, it started and it was so boring.
461000	467000	Like they were just talking about like their toy line and product and I just didn't fucking care.
467000	476000	I just wanted to see like panels and like movie stuff and I don't know, stuff that's interesting. But it just was really boring.
476000	484000	The one thing everybody's talking about is the whole Wonder Woman redesign quickly. What did you think about that?
484000	488000	I don't know. I didn't really look that closely.
489000	496000	I didn't think it was bad at all. Like I was not expecting the whole red and blue jumpsuit 70s Linda Carter look.
496000	502000	Like I knew that they were not going to go with that type of look so that they were going to kind of make it a little more edgy.
502000	510000	So I don't hate it. But the fact that it's all brown and the way it looks, she really does look like Xena Warrior Princess.
510000	517000	You know what I mean? Like all she's missing, if she had the little chakra instead of the sword, like she would look like Xena Warrior Princess.
518000	527000	Yeah, I mean, it's not bad. Now I love Xena, so it's not bad. But I was surprised they didn't try to incorporate a little bit of red and blue into it. But I guess, all right, whatever.
527000	535000	You know, what I thought was kind of neat was the, well, actually no, I don't think it's neat now that I think of it.
535000	544000	I don't know. I guess they're trying, I don't know if they're trying to refresh everything or if they're just trying to like, I don't know.
544000	551000	What's up with, you know, making, you know, not making Thor a woman, but like changing the character to a woman.
551000	557000	Not as, I guess it's not changing, but a new person is taking over, you know, as Thor a woman.
557000	563000	And then they also have, you know, the new Captain America and stuff. It's almost like, now I don't have a problem with them changing up characters like that.
563000	570000	It's just, it's, to me, it feels like they're doing it to like, we need to be more diverse. We need to be more diverse.
570000	575000	You know, it's like they're playing the diversity card versus like, it makes sense in the story.
575000	580000	And it very well makes sense in the story since I don't, I don't read it, so I don't know.
580000	583000	But it just seems like, you know, oh, we're playing diversity card here.
583000	592000	To be fair, they do need to be more diverse, to be fair. I mean, it does, when they do it all at once, when it's like a once and everything goes,
592000	601000	I can kind of see where it gives that impression where it's like, all right, but I mean, they kind of, the comic book world kind of needs this.
601000	605000	So I'm okay with it. It's not, it's not abnormal for multiple characters.
605000	611000	Yeah, I'm not saying I'm not okay with it. It just seems kind of obvious, you know what I mean?
611000	616000	It's not like, oh, you know, this makes sense. Like, oh, we could see, we could have seen this coming, you know?
616000	620000	It's just kind of like, strange. I don't know.
621000	628000	I'm very curious to see how all those changes affect the movie and game universe, although I kind of think they won't right away.
628000	632000	Maybe the game universe a little sooner than the movies. I don't think the movies are going to change any casting.
632000	637000	I saw that someone had mentioned, was it in the trailer for the new Lego Batman game?
637000	646000	They had, was it Superman and Wonder Woman were dating in there, and they also had their new, the new 52 outfits on.
646000	652000	So that's kind of cool that they're already adapting that kind of stuff into the game world already.
652000	660000	Yeah. And there's always different comics going on too. I think that's one thing that, you know, I don't, I don't profess to know a lot about comics.
660000	664000	Unfortunately, Jamie isn't here. She's probably the heaviest reader of comics out of all of us.
664000	669000	But my understanding is there's, there's all these different storylines across all these different comics.
669000	674000	Like there isn't just like one Batman comic. There's a lot of different comics that have Batman in them and all these different stories,
674000	677000	new, old, and so forth, that go on kind of all at the same time.
677000	684000	So, you know, usually these big, like, like the whole Archie getting killed thing, right?
684000	686000	You heard about this? Archie's going to get killed off.
686000	687000	Yeah, I saw that.
687000	691000	But that's, that's not like, like, nope. It's not like a high school shooter has taken him out or anything.
691000	700000	It's this new Archie, this, this different storyline they have, the new Archie, where I think like in one, it's like this bi-universe thing.
700000	702000	But he did get shot.
703000	709000	In the, in the new Archie, yes. But there's still other comics for Archie, Archie that exist where I think he's going to get killed.
709000	716000	I think, come on, Archie fought zombies at one point, so come on, it's not like it's, it's, we can't take it that seriously.
716000	722000	I mean, and obviously, and here's the other thing too, it's a comic book. Doesn't mean he's going to stay dead.
722000	726000	I mean, fuck, they've killed Superman off one time, probably multiple times.
726000	734000	I, one time at least I have the issue for, but, but he came back. I mean, it's, whatever, it's for publicity.
734000	739000	Because, seriously, who gives a fuck about Archie comics right now? Most people probably don't.
739000	741000	Me, I love Josie and the Pussycats, that's my favorite.
741000	749000	Okay, but seriously, you know, one, but now, you know, this makes headlines, oh fuck, I got, I used to love Archie, you know, when I was a kid.
749000	754000	Many, many, many, many years ago. I'm going to read this now, and then he comes back.
754000	758000	I mean, so, Archie's also been usually pretty progressive as far as comic books go.
758000	764000	Like, he was one of the first that incorporated a gay character into this main storyline, so, you know, for that I appreciate it.
764000	769000	Anyway, alright, so people are going to be like, I thought this was a video game show. Look, we do tangents all the time.
769000	775000	Let's talk about video games at Comic Con, because it does seem like they're becoming more and more and more prevalent.
775000	782000	Like, I really, like, usually when Comic Con season comes around, I have friends that go and I'm kind of like, oh yeah, that looks like a lot of fun.
782000	785000	I think I'd like to go someday, but I don't really feel like I'm missing anything.
785000	790000	Like, I can kind of read about it on the internet or whatever, but, like, this year I'm starting to feel like, I really feel like I'm missing things.
790000	797000	Because a lot of, sorry guys, I have, like, hiccups and all this going on at the same time, I'm very sorry.
797000	805000	I feel like I'm missing things. Like, Nintendo's done all this, like, streaming, and they've done some announcements at the Comic Con.
805000	809000	There's been other game companies, you know, showing their games there.
809000	812000	Smash Bros. characters announced, because I didn't pay attention.
812000	818000	I don't think there were new characters announced, but they were definitely showing, like, more of, like, the game interface and more of the game itself.
818000	819000	I think they announced stages.
819000	822000	I think they're talking more like the 3DS version this time around.
822000	825000	Well, yeah, because that's out sooner rather than later.
825000	826000	Yeah, true.
826000	831000	So, why do you think Comic Con is getting more and more game content?
831000	838000	Well, I think it's more of, it's spun off into more of just, like, entertainment and almost, like, consumerism.
838000	842000	Just because, you know, it all ties in very well together.
842000	845000	You have comic books, you have toys, and, you know, the licensed properties.
845000	851000	So, you have toys, TV, just to say, it all kind of melds together, you know.
851000	854000	Pretty much anything that you're going to be buying stuff from.
854000	859000	Of course, you're going to want to see, you know, this video game, you know, that might tie in with this.
859000	866000	Now, why Nintendo is necessarily a Comic Con that I don't understand entirely, but whatever, they're there. Cool.
866000	872000	But, like, you know, definitely I understand, you know, the tie-ins with, like, you know, Disney Infinity.
872000	874000	You know, they're showing off the Marvel stuff there.
874000	879000	They announced their collector's edition, the release date of the 23rd.
879000	881000	I don't know where we heard that before.
881000	884000	And just, like, a bunch of other things like that.
884000	893000	So, it's... I understand that stuff, just because, you know, they were showing off, like, toys and all sorts of, you know, stuff like that.
893000	898000	I will say the other thing that I really dig that's coming out of Comic Con is superhero-related sales.
898000	901000	Because PlayStation Network, having a big sale right now.
901000	909000	I don't know if Microsoft is, but I know on PlayStation Network, I just picked up before the show tonight for $18.
909000	917000	$18. I got the Injustice Ultimate Edition and Lego Marvel Super Heroes for $18 on PlayStation 4.
917000	927000	Like, Injustice Ultimate Edition is, like, $8 for PlayStation Plus subscribers and Marvel Ultimate Heroes or whatever Lego is $10.50 or something like that.
927000	935000	So, I was like, yeah, sales. I'm liking how Sony's trying to kind of do their own sort of Steam sales as of late.
935000	938000	They've done had some really deep discounts on the service.
938000	940000	Yeah, that's cool.
943000	951000	I'm looking at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com because, again, we do tape live on Sunday nights right after Bobby Black Wolf at the vognetwork.com.
951000	954000	Wyland says, I took advantage of that sale.
954000	959000	And Tech 2030 says, I got Injustice on Vita for $4.20.
959000	960000	$4.20.
960000	964000	Wyland says, Injustice for $8 is a steal. I know, I can't wait.
964000	969000	I actually, I haven't played it at all, so I'm really excited about it, actually.
969000	971000	Plus, you get all the, uh...
971000	978000	And your stream is not skipping. I still have hiccups, which is the worst enemy of somebody trying to do live radio, so I apologize.
978000	980000	And you have all the extra characters in there, too.
980000	984000	Yeah, exactly. Scorpion and all that stuff, right? That'll be fun.
985000	991000	Alright, I guess that's gonna do it for our Comic-Con talk for now. I'd like to still go into future.
991000	994000	We'll cover some of the news that came out of the expo a little later on in the show.
994000	999000	Let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week. Loki.
999000	1006000	Alright, I only played a couple things. I played, you know, the Destiny beta, at least very, very minimally.
1006000	1009000	I literally played just the first level and that's it.
1010000	1018000	It was after I got done playing our weekly Call of Duty match and stuff.
1018000	1022000	I was like, you know what? I have, you know, I know the beta's going on right now.
1022000	1027000	I'm gonna, you know, jump in and see, you know, what I can play before I have to go to bed here.
1027000	1036000	And so, I played through the first, like, you know, set of missions or whatever before you get to, kind of like, little hub world type thing.
1036000	1043000	And it was cool. I don't know, I like it. You know, I'd probably have to adjust some of the settings, you know, as far as, you know, movement speed and stuff.
1043000	1047000	But it seemed to be, you know, kind of fun and I enjoyed it.
1047000	1054000	Even Ghost didn't seem that, you know, annoying as far as, you know, the voice work and stuff. It seemed fine to me.
1054000	1061000	So, and I have, you know, because I only played it on PlayStation 3, I thought it looked good on PlayStation 3 even.
1061000	1069000	So, I don't know. It was pretty cool. Would I pick it up when it comes out? Maybe. I don't know.
1069000	1077000	It's definitely a game I'd look at for the, you know, next, you know, for the holiday. But I don't know.
1077000	1085000	We'll see. I mean, I don't want to dedicate myself to, like, an MMO because it's just, it's a time save.
1085000	1091000	Oh, now, Loki, we just got into this on Bobby's show. It's not an MMO, though, because you're not, it's not persistently...
1091000	1096000	It's online and they keep adding new missions to it. That's pretty much like an MMO, okay?
1096000	1098000	It has MMO elements, we'll say that.
1098000	1114000	Whatever. And then I played one stage of Mario Kart 8 because I was actually passing by a kiosk at GameStop and I wanted my son to try it, but he was chickening out, so I got to play a track in it.
1114000	1123000	I don't even remember which track it was. It was, like, some beachside town thing. And so I played that and it was pretty cool.
1123000	1134000	You know, I dig it. It looks very nice. And actually, since I haven't really played anything on the Wii U, the controller, I wasn't too, I thought it was pretty comfortable.
1134000	1145000	It wasn't, like, I thought at first, you know, the analog sticks above the buttons, that's gonna be really strange, but it wasn't actually that bad.
1145000	1152000	So, I don't know, maybe I'll, I'm still looking at picking up a Wii U maybe at some point in 2015.
1152000	1161000	But, I don't know, if I end up getting one earlier, you know, Mario Kart will definitely be something I'll purchase with it. So we'll see.
1161000	1169000	We still don't know what kind of sweet holiday deals they might do. You know, not even necessarily a price drop, but maybe, like, game inclusion and things like that.
1169000	1173000	Yeah, I'm sure they'll have, like, a bundle. Probably, like, Smash Brothers or something.
1173000	1178000	That seems like a given. Maybe a special color or something for Smash Brothers. Like, a red Wii U or something.
1178000	1186000	I don't know, yeah. And then I played Call of Duty Mario World for two. A little bit. So, I did that.
1186000	1192000	There's a question from Tech 2030 in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com who asks, can Destiny be played offline single player?
1192000	1202000	No. I don't think so, no. I think because I noticed it tries to connect to the server when you're playing. I was having problems playing earlier today and it actually kicked me out.
1202000	1208000	But they warned everybody. They said, we're doing some tests today and you might get a lot of disconnects. It's a beta, deal with it type of thing.
1208000	1214000	And sure enough, I got disconnected and I could see that it kept trying to connect. I couldn't do anything when I wasn't online.
1214000	1216000	I'm pretty sure it's online only.
1216000	1223000	Yeah. So, I don't know. There might be some people that feel very strongly anti-Destiny because of that. And that's understandable.
1223000	1226000	But they have worked a lot of multiplayer elements into it.
1226000	1235000	It would be cool if they treated it kind of like Fable or something like that where you could play offline by yourself.
1235000	1240000	But if you want to join other players and you have to be online connected or something like that, I don't know.
1241000	1243000	But, yeah. I think it is online only.
1245000	1247000	That's it. That's all I played this week.
1247000	1255000	Hopefully, I will be playing more stuff this week because we've got our company game summit thing and we have publishers coming out and I get to play stuff.
1255000	1256000	That'll be fun.
1256000	1258000	Maybe. I don't know. Each year they bring less and less.
1259000	1269000	Probably, I'm guessing, because Tecmo Koei always brings something, so I'm guessing I'll play Samurai Warriors 3 Ultimate.
1269000	1277000	I'm guessing they'll bring out. I think that's really the only upcoming game they have in Samurai Warriors 4.
1277000	1282000	Alright. Well, that's cool because not a lot of people get to get those sneak peeks. So, I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on that.
1282000	1286000	My gaming week, real quick. Sorry, you'll have to deal with my hiccups a little bit.
1286000	1291000	I'm trying to drink water really fast while Loki's talking and, unfortunately, without Jamie here, it's only the two of us.
1291000	1293000	So, I have to deal.
1293000	1298000	But, I've been playing the Destiny online beta like a Loki did for a little bit, but I played a lot more.
1298000	1302000	In fact, I actually hit the max level you can in the beta, level 8.
1302000	1304000	So, that was pretty cool.
1304000	1309000	I also was able to play on Saturday when they were doing the stress test at 2 o'clock.
1309000	1317000	And, the way they guaranteed that they get as many people online as possible was that they opened up a new single player level for only two hours.
1317000	1321000	And, they also opened up the beta to everybody.
1321000	1324000	Oh yeah, just before. Yeah, they did.
1324000	1328000	So, they did open up the beta to everybody and they opened up the extra level, so they had the moon level.
1328000	1333000	So, sadly, I thought that might mean they upped the level cap as well, but they didn't, unfortunately.
1333000	1336000	So, I was only able to play that one level on the moon, but that was still really...
1336000	1338000	Did they have the music?
1338000	1341000	From DuckTales? No, I wish. I would have made it even more.
1341000	1346000	I kind of want to take my PlayStation 4 footage, because you know what records, and put the DuckTales theme behind it.
1346000	1348000	I think it would have made it even more epic.
1348000	1354000	But, the music in Destiny is great. It's really, you know, it's very high intensity in some places.
1354000	1359000	And, you know, kind of more ambient when it needs to be. It's very well done.
1359000	1366000	Which makes the staffing changes at Bungie even more interesting considering how good the music is.
1366000	1372000	Didn't really touch a lot of PvP after last weekend, because I just didn't like it.
1372000	1375000	But, I liked the PvE stuff a lot and had a good time.
1375000	1379000	I was playing with friends on Saturday on the moon.
1379000	1385000	And, the nice thing about that stage is it's one of the first ones I can remember where you can take someone else's vehicle,
1385000	1391000	and the vehicles actually fire, like some of the vehicles in Halo did, so you can actually attack enemies using the vehicle.
1391000	1394000	So, that was kind of fun to drive around and shoot things with those lasers.
1395000	1400000	Yeah, and then you go to this temple on the moon and you go inside, and that was basically it.
1400000	1404000	Because they only had the one story mission, you could not go anything past the one.
1404000	1408000	So, but that was still neat to be able to see that and experience the beta.
1408000	1412000	And, you know, I talked about it at length last week, so I don't have a whole lot else to add.
1412000	1416000	Except that I am convinced now I will buy the game when it comes out, for sure.
1416000	1422000	I will pre-order it very soon here, probably from, I don't usually believe in pre-ordering games,
1422000	1428000	but I'll probably just get it on Amazon or something where, you know, I usually buy my games and it'll just show up here on release day.
1428000	1432000	Because I don't usually, I'm too old to start, to do the midnight releases and all that stuff.
1432000	1435000	I really don't get any value out of that for me, so.
1436000	1440000	Yeah, Destiny. Otherwise, I've been playing some older games.
1440000	1442000	Well, Final Fantasy XIV, that's a given.
1442000	1446000	Although, I quit my raid group this weekend, so I'll probably be playing a lot less XIV.
1446000	1451000	Nothing dramatic, I just, I don't know, the fight, like we were really banging our head against
1451000	1454000	the Ramu extreme, you know, over and over and over again.
1454000	1458000	It just, it wasn't, I wasn't having a lot of fun. Like, I like the guys that I was playing with,
1458000	1460000	and sometimes girls too, that I was playing with.
1460000	1462000	Are you still doing XI?
1462000	1467000	What? Um, I didn't stop doing XI, my account's still active, I haven't been playing it actively,
1467000	1471000	but I've been trying to log in a couple times a week to get my little login points,
1471000	1474000	but I probably will play XI a little bit.
1474000	1479000	But now the pressure is really off of me and XIV to really, like, gear up my character
1479000	1481000	and be the best that I can be and all that.
1481000	1485000	And so I can really just enjoy the game at a leisurely pace, which is how I kind of want to do it,
1485000	1490000	because I really am falling behind in other games because I keep playing too many MMOs,
1490000	1495000	which, I love MMOs, I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I play a lot of them in my spare time
1495000	1498000	because that's what I choose to do, but there are a lot of single-player games on Final Fantasy XIV.
1498000	1501000	I know, you haven't played any Grand Theft Auto V.
1501000	1506000	I haven't, well now I'm, now I can legitimately say I'm waiting for that PlayStation 4 release,
1506000	1508000	because why not at this point, right?
1508000	1510000	I'm waiting for that PlayStation 4 release.
1511000	1515000	Tech 2030 in chat asks, wait, is XI free to play? No it is not.
1515000	1521000	God, if it was, I would be playing it, well not now, but I would have been playing it earlier today.
1521000	1525000	You can catch the whole thing, like the whole collection on Steam.
1525000	1526000	Like five bucks, man.
1526000	1530000	Or Amazon download games, pretty cheap when there is a sale going on.
1531000	1535000	So I recommend, keep an eye out for that because you get a free month with that if you're at all interested in XI.
1535000	1540000	But remember, XI is a very different game. XI is more EverQuest, XIV is more WoW.
1540000	1544000	There's a big, big difference between the way those games are set up, just be prepared for it.
1546000	1549000	Why won't these hiccups stop? What did I do to deserve this?
1552000	1554000	Now I'm going to get all these comments in chat.
1554000	1556000	Just try holding your breath, just try being upside down.
1556000	1558000	I can't, I'm trying to do a radio show.
1560000	1564000	Anyway, older games I've been checking out this week.
1564000	1566000	I played Dead Island, very random, right?
1567000	1571000	But Steam was doing a Dead Island weekend where it's like free to play.
1571000	1574000	I already own the game because I think there was like a deep silver bundle thing, humble bundle.
1574000	1577000	Yeah, there was. I probably have that actually then.
1577000	1579000	I picked that up, but here was my bright idea.
1579000	1585000	I said, if that's the game they're doing a free weekend on on Steam and it's a deep discount and all this stuff,
1585000	1587000	then there's going to be a lot of people trying to get the trading cards.
1587000	1590000	So I'm going to activate all my trading cards by playing the game.
1590000	1595000	And then I'll get some booster packs, which that strategy worked horrifically.
1595000	1599000	I have not gotten any booster packs from Steam, so that's the last time I tried that big idea.
1599000	1602000	But I did get a chance to kind of go back and revisit Dead Island.
1602000	1610000	Honestly guys, I know I talked about the sequel a lot on OLR and I was not really a big fan.
1610000	1615000	But this was the first time I played the Dead Island, the original, on PC as opposed to a console.
1615000	1620000	And I do like controlling it a lot better in the whole keyboard and mouse environment and some of the controls,
1620000	1622000	so I did enjoy that a lot more.
1622000	1626000	But Dead Island just kind of isn't a game that really does it for me.
1626000	1628000	I mean, there's a lot of ideas and things I like about it.
1628000	1633000	I like that it's open world. I like that it's kind of like the RPGs stuff.
1633000	1638000	But for me it gets really repetitive really fast, which sounds horrible to say because I know they have a variety of weapons.
1638000	1641000	I know they have all these different ways you can combine weapons.
1641000	1645000	I don't even think that's bad to say, because look at Dead Rising.
1645000	1648000	I get bored with that game too, and that game looked fantastic.
1648000	1657000	I even went out with, oh, I'm going to pick up the one that's basically off the record or whatever,
1657000	1663000	and it's got a sandbox mode, you can just do whatever you want, you don't have to worry about anything.
1663000	1668000	And it was so boring. I'm like, how is this game so boring?
1668000	1672000	I love the first, when I played the demo, I loved the demo so much.
1672000	1674000	And it's just so boring.
1674000	1677000	I felt very similar about it. You know what I think it is, Loki?
1677000	1683000	I don't know how many people I speak for with this, but I think we're just kind of over zombie games.
1683000	1689000	I'm over it. Zombie games, just the zombie fascination in general, I'm over it.
1689000	1695000	But then again, the new Dead Island game, actually when I was seeing the little preview at E3,
1695000	1700000	I was like, oh, that does look really pretty and it looks fun, but I worry it's going to suffer from the same thing.
1700000	1705000	Just because it's prettier doesn't mean it's going to suddenly hold my interest.
1705000	1709000	So we'll see. I'll still approach it with an open mind whenever it comes out.
1709000	1719000	There was that, and I also, much thanks to my partner Alan and my roommate Shane, their coercion,
1719000	1727000	I've gone back and tried a BioWare classic, Dragon Age, which I'd played a little bit before on PC,
1727000	1731000	but my old PC really couldn't handle the damn game.
1731000	1736000	You might remember I got my PC upgraded not that long ago, so I'm trying it again.
1736000	1743000	And it's a lot, what's weird, I tried it on my PC and I tried it on PlayStation 3, and I kind of see the perks to both.
1743000	1750000	I kind of enjoy lying on the couch in a cooler room like the living room is with the controller in my hand playing it.
1750000	1756000	I like that, but there's also a lot of graphical hiccups and frame skips that I see in the PlayStation 3 version.
1756000	1762000	So now I have to kind of decide which one do I want to play further. Do I want to play PC or PlayStation 3?
1762000	1770000	I think I'm going to go with PlayStation 3 just because it's a more comfortable environment for a game that supposedly I'm going to sink hundreds of hours on, but we'll see.
1771000	1773000	I do like the way the PC one looks, though.
1773000	1776000	I kind of been thinking about going back to Skyrim.
1776000	1777000	Have you?
1777000	1785000	I'm going to get stuck in there, because once you play Skyrim, you don't just play for a little bit, you play for several hundred hours.
1785000	1789000	I'm surprised they never did one more last hurrah DLC for Skyrim, but I guess...
1789000	1795000	They don't need to, man, on PC there's so much stuff that you can get for free.
1796000	1803000	Anyhow, 5th Dream in Chat says, I got notification that Dragon Age Inquisition is coming out November 18th, 16th. Can't remember, but it's nice to have a date.
1803000	1804000	18th.
1804000	1808000	It got pushed back, too. I don't think it's in our show world, but that was some news that came out just last week.
1808000	1809000	It was originally on October 7th.
1809000	1810000	Yeah, they had to...
1810000	1811000	The $300 day.
1811000	1815000	Yeah, they pushed it back six weeks to finish the tweaks on it.
1815000	1819000	Hopefully that gives me enough time, because this is the exact same thing that happened with Mass Effect 3.
1819000	1823000	I got into the series right before 3 came out.
1823000	1829000	So I played 1, I played 2, and by the time I was ready to play 3, the game was only a week old.
1829000	1834000	So I was able to play 3 and enjoy it, and even experience that first ending that everybody hated.
1834000	1836000	So I got to experience that before Extindica was out.
1838000	1843000	It seems like the same thing is happening with Dragon Age. I don't know, let's just hope Dragon Age Inquisition has a great ending.
1843000	1844000	We'll see.
1845000	1848000	I'm glad that they delayed a game that they thought wasn't finished.
1848000	1853000	Well, it wasn't just that, it was Battlefield, which was probably the more surprising of the two, honestly.
1853000	1857000	Yeah, Battlefield... I guess they needed more time on that.
1857000	1858000	Yeah.
1858000	1859000	It's probably... I don't know.
1859000	1862000	Hey, anything to avoid the fuckery of the first one, right?
1862000	1864000	That is true.
1864000	1868000	But at the same time, they would just probably have a lot of stuff coming out around the same time.
1868000	1874000	And it is smarter to move it to a slower period where they can get more sales out of it.
1874000	1876000	That's what they did with Mass Effect 3.
1876000	1879000	It came out in March, so it makes sense.
1881000	1885000	Yeah, because literally it was on the 7th, they had so many games coming out.
1885000	1899000	They had, at one point, it was Middle Earth, Shadow of Mordor, Alien Isolation, NBA 2K15, NBA Live 15, Dragon Age Inquisition.
1900000	1908000	God, I want to say that there was also... God, what was the other game? There's another Namco RPG.
1908000	1911000	This isn't that surprising. Tales of Azealia 2? Is that out that now?
1911000	1912000	No, Azealia 2 is...
1912000	1915000	That's out sooner. That's like the end of August.
1915000	1921000	Yeah. But anyway, this isn't too surprising, though, because once you kind of get over Labor Day,
1921000	1925000	like the summer is usually a little bit of a drought, but once you start to get to the end of August and Labor Day,
1925000	1927000	that's when the holiday season is really beginning.
1927000	1932000	I mean, it really is beginning there, and it's just all the games getting out to be on shelves come Black Friday.
1932000	1935000	And there's still plenty that they keep adding crap in there,
1935000	1939000	and there's also a lot of stuff right now that's still to be announced,
1939000	1944000	date-wise, that could still fall in there somewhere.
1944000	1946000	Tech 2030 in our chat says,
1946000	1949000	February-March seems to be a big two months for games nowadays.
1949000	1952000	Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite both released around that time in 2013.
1952000	1959000	Yeah, I think people are finding that people want to play games year round just like they want to see movies year round.
1959000	1960000	Well, February...
1960000	1963000	Movies. Big summer movies are coming out in March now.
1963000	1967000	Like, the typical summer movies are coming out in March and April now, and they're doing just fine.
1967000	1971000	Well, March is usually the end of the financial year for a lot of companies,
1971000	1975000	and fourth quarter is the other big thing, so that's why they push this.
1976000	1983000	And next year, in February, in Movies 50 Shades of Grey, the movie, the trailer just released this week,
1983000	1985000	you know that's going to be huge.
1985000	1988000	Because I'm going to go see it, just because I love bad movies.
1988000	1991000	I love John Waters movies and cult movies. I love bad movies.
1991000	1993000	50 Shades of Grey is going to be hilarious.
1993000	1995000	It's going to be intense.
1995000	1997000	Very intense.
1997000	2000000	Intense. That's the adjective of the book.
2000000	2007000	Even the trailer. I love the Beyonce crazy love remix that they used in the trailer, don't get me wrong,
2007000	2013000	but in my head, all I could hear while I was watching the 50 Shades of Grey trailer was the American Horror Story theme song.
2013000	2015000	Have you ever heard that song?
2015000	2022000	It's just like all this noise. That's all I could hear was like creepy stalker music.
2022000	2024000	I haven't watched that yet. I should really do that.
2024000	2028000	Oh god. Especially the coven is hilarious. It's just like camp.
2028000	2031000	But the first and second season are pretty scary.
2031000	2034000	I really like Zachary Quinto though.
2034000	2038000	Me too, but we probably like him in different ways I'm thinking, Loogie.
2038000	2047000	He's just such a... I'm sorry, I fell in love with him as an actor with Cyler.
2047000	2049000	He was just a fucking great character.
2049000	2055000	And seriously one of the best parts of Heroes until they decided to say, poop on Heroes.
2055000	2061000	For me it was so notorious, but I mean probably two people out there even know what the fuck I'm talking about with that, so whatever.
2061000	2066000	Yeah. I think I know what that's about.
2066000	2069000	That was the Tori Spelling sitcom on VH1.
2069000	2075000	Oh god, no. No, but seriously he's a fucking awesome actor.
2075000	2076000	No, he's great.
2076000	2078000	I just watch anything that he's in.
2078000	2081000	Shane met him at Comic Con, speaking of Comic Con and things like that.
2081000	2083000	Shane met him at Comic Con a couple years ago.
2083000	2084000	Cool.
2084000	2085000	Little bastard.
2085000	2087000	Alright, anyway.
2087000	2092000	That's it for my Game of the Week. Let's get into some news, but first some quick plugs and housekeeping.
2092000	2094000	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
2094000	2097000	On Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2097000	2101000	And on YouTube, we're YouTube user orange lounge radio, all one word.
2101000	2104000	We will have no show on Labor Day weekend.
2104000	2110000	I know that's a good six weeks away or five or six weeks away, but just warning you now because I'll be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.
2110000	2114000	How awesome would Fifty Shades of Grey be with Elizabeth Berkley?
2116000	2119000	Elizabeth Berkley's come a long way since Showgirls though.
2119000	2121000	Showgirls Elizabeth Berkley has.
2121000	2124000	Okay, 20 year old Elizabeth Berkley would be hilarious.
2124000	2133000	Well shit, if it had been the Twilight people like Kristen Stewart and what's his name's sparkly emotionless guy.
2133000	2135000	That would have been sparkly.
2135000	2136000	I think that's right.
2136000	2138000	Sparkly emotionless guy.
2138000	2141000	I'm hilarious too. I really don't like that actress though.
2141000	2148000	She's so like every day. She just has that face that's like I don't like she's always wearing that I don't like you face.
2148000	2149000	She's just.
2149000	2151000	I don't like him either to be honest.
2151000	2153000	She's just so sad inside.
2153000	2154000	Yes.
2154000	2155000	Emo.
2155000	2157000	They're both dead inside I think.
2157000	2159000	Like I just like eat a cookie.
2159000	2161000	Eat a protein cookie. Get some life.
2161000	2162000	I don't know anyway.
2162000	2164000	Alright, let's get into some video games.
2165000	2170000	Now people are like okay look I tuned in for a video game podcast and you fuckers are talking about Fifty Shades of Grey and Twilight.
2170000	2172000	I have had it officially.
2173000	2175000	Video game news please.
2175000	2178000	And that guy has the hiccups so we'll fucking stop.
2178000	2187000	So they finally reached I guess the quarter proof settlement for the whole PlayStation Network breach that happened back in 2011.
2187000	2191000	Which is weird because I didn't even realize there was a whole court thing going on for it.
2191000	2195000	I thought hey we got our free games and that's that you know.
2195000	2200000	But no hey guess what we're gonna get more free shit apparently as part of the settlement.
2200000	2205000	They're gonna be doling out almost 18 million dollars worth of free stuff.
2205000	2212000	Including the option to either get a free game PlayStation 3 or PSP only.
2212000	2215000	Three PlayStation 3 themes.
2215000	2219000	Or in other words the choice that no one will ever fucking pick.
2219000	2222000	Or credit for three months of PlayStation Plus.
2222000	2226000	Which is valid for new subscribers only.
2226000	2227000	What the fuck.
2227000	2230000	Seriously only new subscribers.
2230000	2235000	Because that was the one I was gonna pick was hey you know what I need some more PlayStation Plus credits.
2235000	2239000	It would be pretty sweet if I could get a subscription for three months.
2239000	2241000	You know what you greedy little bastard.
2241000	2246000	They already gave away a ton of shit after this whole thing happened remember.
2246000	2248000	Hey the whole welcome back program.
2248000	2251000	I agree and I agree that they that whole thing.
2251000	2255000	See and if you didn't take advantage of the whole welcome back program.
2255000	2259000	You actually get two of the things on there you know you can pick one.
2259000	2263000	But if you did already take advantage of that you get one of them.
2263000	2264000	But still though I mean it's like.
2264000	2266000	We don't know what games they are though right.
2266000	2268000	We don't know what games they are it's gonna be different.
2268000	2271000	But it's gonna be like stuff we've already given away.
2271000	2274000	We do know what games they are I'm sorry we do yes.
2274000	2280000	Let's see those it says those benefit benefiting from the settlement will pick up.
2280000	2286000	From a list of eight PS3 and six PSP games which include dead nation infamous.
2286000	2291000	Little Big Planet superstar does HD and rain so pretty much all those.
2291000	2294000	Those are all the games they give away during the program except for rain.
2294000	2298000	I don't think really rain for PSP was a little big planet.
2298000	2301000	Mod nation razor is pot upon three and kills on liberation.
2301000	2304000	So almost those are actually really good choices for PSP.
2304000	2307000	But the problem is they don't like the PSP is done.
2307000	2308000	It's all about the Vita now.
2308000	2310000	Well you can use those on the via.
2310000	2311000	Oh I guess that's true.
2311000	2314000	That's a good point.
2314000	2317000	And then.
2317000	2324000	So so that's not supposed to happen though until May of 2015 is when that stuff supposed to be.
2324000	2327000	Just when the PlayStation 3 is officially on its way out the door.
2327000	2331000	As more and more people. Yeah.
2331000	2336000	So I don't know like.
2336000	2342000	I guess I'll get a free game because like since they're not gonna let me have you know in PlayStation plus grades.
2342000	2350000	I kind of I'm just whatever with this because I already got a lot of stuff when you know they welcome everybody back.
2350000	2353000	I was I was legitimately surprised that they're giving away more.
2353000	2363000	I thought it was going to be like a whole send in a claim and get a check for fifty five cents for the day that PlayStation Network was down or something like I kind of thought that's what it was going to be.
2363000	2367000	But so I'm genuinely surprised they are giving away games.
2367000	2370000	Yeah. And I'm not saying that you know.
2370000	2374000	I don't feel like I'm entitled to anything but come on man.
2375000	2377000	So that's that's how it is.
2377000	2386000	You didn't necessarily feel entitled to anything until that door kind of opened a jar where it's like oh we're going to we're going to give away some games and they're like oh come on.
2386000	2387000	No no no.
2387000	2388000	Come on.
2388000	2389000	Seriously.
2389000	2390000	Get these away.
2390000	2394000	The fact that they have that will valid for only new subscribers is bullshit.
2394000	2399000	I mean come on because that's all you're doing is like saying hey we want you to get hooked on PlayStation plus.
2399000	2401000	You are the problem with the gaming community.
2401000	2402000	No I'm not.
2402000	2404000	They give you a little bit and you're like it's not good enough.
2404000	2406000	Hey I didn't say they had to give me anything.
2406000	2407000	Okay.
2407000	2412000	They did not have to give me one thing but but now that they're offering things to me.
2412000	2415000	But one of the choices you know it's like oh but.
2415000	2416000	And they're not offering that to you.
2416000	2424000	Like for example you know it's like fucking I was at Jack in the Box today picking up a milkshake because I didn't even want dinner.
2424000	2428000	I already had like dinner earlier but like I wanted something.
2428000	2430000	I'm thinking only you are going to make this about a milkshake.
2430000	2431000	No no hold on.
2431000	2432000	I'm not making about milkshake.
2432000	2433000	I'm making about a taco.
2433000	2438000	They have this thing you can register for their fucking app.
2438000	2443000	And so you register for the app and you get a coupon for one free Monster Taco.
2443000	2445000	But it's not just for the Monster Taco.
2445000	2447000	You have to make another purchase with that.
2447000	2448000	Fuck that.
2448000	2450000	The tacos worth like a buck or two.
2450000	2453000	And you can't even give me a buck or two worth of tacos.
2453000	2455000	But you bought a milkshake.
2455000	2456000	I understand that.
2456000	2460000	But I still would have to make a completely separate purchase in order to get this taco as well.
2460000	2463000	I would have to get something and then the taco.
2463000	2465000	Perhaps a second milkshake and taco.
2465000	2471000	But the fact that I have to make another purchase along with the taco is ridiculous.
2471000	2473000	What the fuck does your taco have to do?
2473000	2478000	And your fucking first world problems have to do with a Playstation settlement.
2478000	2481000	I don't like the small print that says I have to do something.
2481000	2483000	Do you want Sony to give you a taco?
2483000	2484000	Is that what this is all about?
2484000	2487000	If Jamie were here, she'd be like, fuck yes, I want a taco.
2487000	2490000	I want them to be able to give me three months of Playstation Plus.
2490000	2493000	So what if I was a subscriber previously?
2493000	2496000	I just want three months of Playstation Plus because you know what?
2496000	2499000	That's better than all those other games that you already offered me before.
2499000	2504000	And god damn it, why would I want stupid Playstation themes for my Playstation 3?
2504000	2506000	That makes no sense.
2506000	2509000	Bonds006 in chat says, making Sony come off like a drug dealer.
2509000	2512000	LOL give you a free hit and then you have to pay.
2512000	2515000	Well hey, for those that haven't had Playstation Plus before that take that.
2515000	2518000	I mean, in three months of Playstation Plus you can get a lot.
2518000	2523000	And pro tip, go flag everything on your account even if you don't necessarily download it.
2523000	2526000	Because let's say you don't own a Vita yet.
2526000	2529000	Well like if you're on Playstation Plus and you've been flagging all these free Vita games that have been given away.
2529000	2531000	When you get one, you're going to need one of them.
2531000	2533000	They started locking that out.
2533000	2534000	Did they really?
2534000	2535000	Yeah, you can't do that anymore.
2535000	2538000	Like I used to have Playstation 4 games and they locked it out.
2538000	2540000	Oh, I thought you could on the website.
2540000	2543000	That's what I do it through, is on the website.
2543000	2546000	And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
2546000	2552000	I bet the clever workaround would be log in one time from a friend's Playstation 4 and I bet it would work.
2552000	2553000	Maybe.
2553000	2557000	Since I used to have a Vita, Vita games are no problem.
2557000	2561000	But yeah, Playstation 4 games don't necessarily work.
2561000	2563000	And you know what, that's fine.
2563000	2566000	Because most of the games that I'm marketing for free anyways, it's like,
2566000	2568000	Shit, I already got this on fucking Steam anyways.
2568000	2572000	And I haven't played it on Steam, I'm probably not going to play it on Playstation 4 either.
2572000	2574000	So, whatever, you know.
2574000	2576000	You will eat a taco.
2576000	2579000	No, their tacos don't look very good to be honest.
2579000	2583000	It's got like, it's literally got a slice of like American cheese on it.
2583000	2585000	It just, it doesn't make any sense.
2585000	2589000	Blender in chat says, I've had those tacos, you need two to get full.
2589000	2594000	But it's monster tacos, it's supposed to be big, right?
2594000	2596000	Oh, excuse me. Alright, look.
2596000	2599000	No, no, the regular tacos, yeah, they're just, it's a buck for two.
2607000	2613000	Moving on to something else that I think people spend a lot of money on thinking they need it and then they don't really use it.
2613000	2617000	3D Blu-rays. Am I right? 3D? Am I right?
2617000	2621000	I thought that was done. I thought we've all moved on from that.
2621000	2628000	I think, I think 3D will come back when VR takes off because right now people aren't going to buy.
2628000	2637000	They're not, it looks, yeah, it's kind of funny seeing that it looks ridiculous to have glasses and watch TV, but wearing goggles to play a game, oh, that's completely fine.
2637000	2642000	So you think maybe the Morpheus might support 3D films or something?
2642000	2644000	Um, I think it could, that would be pretty cool.
2644000	2646000	That would actually be really rad in all honesty.
2646000	2651000	I think it should, um, you know, that would make sense to at least get some more functionality out of it.
2651000	2653000	Watching Tron on Morpheus might be kind of awesome.
2653000	2664000	I would love to see Tron, well, I did see it in 3D, so I know what it's like, but I saw it in 3D and with those awesome motion, motion chairs.
2664000	2666000	Me too, me too.
2666000	2675000	Ah, that was awesome. But anyways, um, yeah, I definitely think that we'll see, especially now like with the Oculus Rift and everything, um, and they're going to be marking that down.
2675000	2680000	Hopefully to a price point that's more consumer friendly other than like $300.
2680000	2687000	Well, I, Loki, I don't know how much lower something like that's going to get, especially when it's initially coming out.
2687000	2691000	I don't know, they sell it at a loss or whatever just to get the platform out there.
2691000	2696000	For a PC enabled thing? I mean, it's one thing when the software is restricted.
2696000	2700000	That's how they can sell consoles at a loss because they'll make the money back on the software and the software licensing.
2700000	2707000	PC is way more open than that. They can't, so I think you'd have a better chance that the Morpheus being cheaper and they take a loss on that.
2707000	2711000	But at the same time, I don't think companies usually take loss on peripherals.
2711000	2717000	Well, it's going to be hard for them to sell a peripheral for like $300, you know, especially to convince people that you need this.
2717000	2719000	It looks cool and everything.
2719000	2724000	Unless they have their Wii Sports. Let's be real, people bought a Wii to play that game.
2725000	2731000	I'm so hesitant, though, to buy stuff like that, you know, especially after the Kinect.
2731000	2733000	It just, uh...
2733000	2740000	Anyway, the whole reason I brought up 3D Blu-ray in the first place, just so we're clear, they're finally adding support for it for the PlayStation 4.
2740000	2745000	Even though the PS3 had it, PlayStation 4 has not had 3D Blu-ray support, but it is coming.
2745000	2750000	A very interestingly timed announcement because Microsoft has said the same thing is happening for Xbox One.
2750000	2756000	And this just came days later, so they don't want Sony to have Microsoft get anything extra there.
2756000	2761000	So yeah, this will be the 1.75 firmware, which should be out sometime in the next week.
2761000	2766000	And Xbox One will have its 3D Blu-ray support at some point in August.
2766000	2773000	And if you buy your Blu-rays at Target like me, or actually probably a lot of them do this, it seems like you get five different copies of the movie for one price.
2774000	2780000	Like, I swear, when I bought Tron, it was like, you get 3D Tron, and this is Tron Legacy, by the way.
2780000	2786000	3D Tron, and Blu-ray Tron, and DVD Tron, and Digital Tron, all for one price.
2786000	2790000	And, uh, was it, yeah, Tron 1, and Blu-ray.
2790000	2793000	I think I have 3D Lion King, too, for the same reason.
2793000	2796000	So, anyway, it'd be interesting to see if that happens.
2796000	2802000	But, uh, Black Wolf in our chat gives us something to think about with that whole just watching it on the Morpheus.
2802000	2806000	Black Wolf says it depends on if they can work out the legal issues with the Blu-ray consortium.
2806000	2810000	To get it to display in VR, you have to change the image, which is a no-no.
2810000	2813000	But, since Sony's part of the consortium, they can get it changed.
2813000	2818000	There's no Blu-ray player for Oculus Rift, because they'd have to violate the DMCA to get it to display.
2818000	2821000	So, I think he has a point, though.
2821000	2830000	If Sony wants to change the rules, they're gonna have the wiggle room to do that a little more than, necessarily, Facebook and Oculus would for their side of things.
2830000	2836000	I'm surprised that they would even have to violate anything, because, to me, it seems like it's almost like playing it on, like, a TV.
2836000	2839000	Like, it's just a different type of TV.
2839000	2840000	You know, they've got, like,
2840000	2843000	If there's very specific resolution lockdowns, though, I get it. I get what you're saying.
2843000	2853000	But they've got, like, you know, um, those things that split the image, you know, side-by-side, except for different, uh, 3D setups and stuff.
2853000	2858000	I don't know. I don't know if they'd need to go through all the, you know, trouble.
2859000	2862000	It's not like, uh, it's not like you're pirating or something.
2862000	2863000	But whatever, I guess.
2863000	2867000	Do we still have lack of 3D games on PlayStation 4, right?
2867000	2870000	I don't think any of them really support 3D.
2870000	2871000	I can't think of either.
2871000	2872000	I just don't...
2872000	2876000	I think it was kinda overblown, the importance of it.
2876000	2880000	Well, it's kinda too bad, because it was actually something I was really into that idea.
2880000	2888000	I think doing it in 3D is causing, you know, cuts into the frame rate and, you know, what they can do with that.
2888000	2896000	And since they're even having trouble, you know, on some of these getting it up to 60 frames per second, or even 1080p at 60 frames per second,
2896000	2902000	they just don't want to risk it for something that not a lot of people are ending up using.
2902000	2904000	So I think that's where everyone's at.
2904000	2912000	Maybe next generation will see that a little bit more, when, you know, when some of the stuff is more...
2912000	2917000	I think when the price comes down, if 3D TVs for whatever reason become more commonplace, but I think you're right.
2917000	2920000	I think, I just don't think people, I think people are kinda already over it.
2920000	2924000	Well, they've kinda, now they've gone the route of like, okay, 4K is gonna be the thing.
2924000	2925000	Yeah.
2925000	2931000	And I think people, once again, it's, they've run into the problem where there's just not enough content out there for it.
2931000	2939000	You know, even when 3D was, oh well, there's gonna be some, a couple channels that will be 3D, you know, but that's it.
2939000	2948000	I mean, now 4K, it's like there's not a lot of channels that are 4K, and I think for a lot of people it's just like, eh, I don't really need that.
2948000	2950000	Alright, well let's move on with something else.
2950000	2959000	Alright, so Kickstarter, of course there's always a lot of drama with certain Kickstarter funded games or whatever.
2959000	2972000	So, in this case, one game called Confederate Express that was being, I guess, developed by a guy named Maksim Poshonin.
2972000	2977000	He, I guess, had his game on Kickstarter last year.
2977000	2983000	It was this sort of rogue-like zombie courier RPG type game.
2983000	2992000	And what was supposed to be kind of unique about it was that, you know, they had this really neat lighting system on there, which really is just a normal map on top of a sprite.
2992000	2995000	But whatever, it's unique, I guess.
2995000	3001000	And it got funded for 10,000, or his goal, you know, was $10,000 back in November.
3001000	3005000	It was supposed to be coming out by June 2014.
3005000	3009000	But of course, you know, that was kind of the end of that.
3009000	3013000	He didn't really give a lot of updates.
3013000	3016000	And now, it's gotten even stranger.
3016000	3021000	Now, not only is, well there's two sets of drama going on.
3021000	3031000	The Kickstarter portion, he's actually starting, he is delaying the release of his game to work on another game that is going on around the same time.
3031000	3033000	Also uses the same engine.
3033000	3043000	He claims that it was, this company had backed, or given him some funding money to help finish, what was it, Confederate Express.
3043000	3049000	But come to find out, you know, after some people dug into it, it's actually his brother's company that him and his brother own.
3049000	3052000	And so, it was kind of a little bit shady there.
3052000	3061000	But on top of that, he had rented an apartment, I believe, or condo, from Airbnb.
3061000	3072000	Which, Airbnb is a company that, you know, if you're leaving town for a while, you can rent your house or whatever out to tenants and make some money while you're not there.
3072000	3081000	Like if you're, I guess, rich enough to where you vacation somewhere for a long extended period of time, or maybe you own a house for work or something like that.
3081000	3084000	And you work in different locations, whatever.
3084000	3088000	If you're not using your home for a while, you can rent it out.
3088000	3095000	Hell, I used to do this one, our family would rent a cabin and go up to the snow or something for a week or something.
3095000	3101000	But, the problem is, he rented this place for, I guess, 30 days.
3101000	3107000	And he's actually stayed, he negotiated a 30 day stay at the condo in Palm Springs.
3107000	3111000	And he stayed there for more than 30 days.
3111000	3116000	And apparently, because of California law, it's squatter's rights.
3116000	3123000	So, he now is claiming that he's on a month to month lease because he's been there for over 30 days.
3123000	3125000	And he's occupied the living space.
3125000	3130000	And now, the original owner can't get him to leave.
3131000	3138000	And they really can't just tear him out of there because of these protections and California law and stuff like that.
3138000	3141000	So, it's a really weird situation.
3141000	3143000	And it only gets stranger.
3143000	3150000	So, you know, instead of coming out and just kind of trying to defend himself and basically saying,
3150000	3157000	Hey, you know what, this is blown out of proportion, or even trying to explain himself, or just even being quiet about the whole thing.
3157000	3164000	He comes out and acts like a complete douchebag and makes a comment on the Confederate Express Kickstarter comments page saying,
3164000	3170000	What's the latest deets on the drama? 10 out of 10, would squat again.
3170000	3177000	Just, I don't know. That's just really, really terrible.
3177000	3181000	This guy sounds like he's drunk with power right now.
3181000	3184000	He's just doing all this shit because he can.
3184000	3186000	That's what it sounds like.
3186000	3189000	I take it back. The contract he had was for 44 days.
3189000	3193000	So, I guess Airbnb should have done the research knowing that, you know, maybe this could be exploited.
3193000	3196000	Most people would, you know, exploit this kind of loophole.
3196000	3200000	Unfortunately, a lot of these exploits don't get found out about until somebody exploits it.
3200000	3203000	And here's even the strangest part.
3203000	3209000	You know, because this is terrible that this one, this woman, Corey, is locked out of her house.
3210000	3216000	You know, while trying to get this guy evicted and it's just not happening.
3216000	3221000	So, on top of all this, he's saying that he's the one being harassed.
3221000	3232000	And that, you know, because of this, you know, I guess his brother is suffering from stress.
3232000	3234000	Here comes the lawsuit.
3234000	3236000	Yes, and he's going to sue her.
3237000	3243000	Because all these people online are saying bad things about all the exploiting stuff that's going on.
3243000	3244000	It's really mean.
3244000	3253000	So, thankfully, Airbnb is helping out the woman, you know, paying her, you know, for the time that this guy's here.
3253000	3256000	And trying to, I guess, find your housing and stuff like that in the meantime.
3256000	3263000	But it's just annoying that she's going to have to spend like five grand to get this guy out of her house.
3263000	3264000	Yeah.
3264000	3271000	And he just, and he wants people to back this other Kickstarter while he hasn't even fulfilled the first Kickstarter.
3271000	3281000	Once again, it's, you know, Kickstarting something is a good idea when it's somebody, you know, that has like a good track record.
3281000	3290000	And even then, it's hard to tell because remember the Yaga Venture thing, you know, they had a good track record in like pod, you know, doing a YouTube show.
3291000	3293000	But maybe not necessarily game development.
3293000	3300000	Whereas, you know, like I know I backed several times the video game high school stuff.
3300000	3316000	And I felt a little bit more confident that guys that are making, you know, YouTube videos and doing kind of these little short film things on YouTube are probably capable of making something slightly longer kind of along the same lines.
3316000	3322000	But not necessarily, you know, you know, not necessarily just on YouTube or something.
3322000	3326000	It was a little bit of a safer bet versus, you know, somebody you don't know.
3326000	3331000	I don't know. I guess just be very cautious on what you back.
3331000	3335000	And maybe even just if you're not sure, maybe not even back that.
3335000	3340000	Or if you're going to back something, just back it for a very minimal amount of money.
3341000	3345000	As J100matt in chat says, Airbnb is great and I know people who use it, but jerks ruin it by doing this.
3345000	3349000	Yeah, I know Jason uses it too and has good experiences with it.
3349000	3352000	And the problem here is not Airbnb.
3352000	3354000	And it's not even Kickstarter.
3354000	3356000	Like as much as I've had my issues with the Kickstarter, that's not the issue.
3356000	3359000	The problem is you've got this guy is exploiting both of them.
3359000	3360000	The two are really unrelated.
3360000	3364000	It's just that the guy has found a way to do this here and then do this here.
3364000	3374000	And he'll probably, inevitably, allegedly, whatever, he'll probably just end up moving to another state or even another country where people can't touch him.
3374000	3377000	Who's to say the game is going to ever come out?
3377000	3380000	If it does, then hey, great. What a great thing to happen.
3380000	3383000	And those people, you know, their faith holds true and everything.
3383000	3387000	But the Airbnb side of it doesn't really give you a lot of hope, does it?
3388000	3397000	It's sad because, you know, looking at what he had a demo, a playable demo of the game when he was doing the Kickstarter, and it actually is pretty good.
3397000	3407000	It's just, it's just unfortunate, you know, you can be duped by a lot of these people.
3407000	3411000	Especially if they don't have a lot of experience.
3411000	3413000	I don't know.
3414000	3420000	How are these people supposed to know on Kickstarter that this guy is just this crazy psycho?
3420000	3432000	Not psycho, but you gotta be, you know, you gotta be kind of crazy if you're, you know, purposefully squatting in someone's house and I don't even know why.
3432000	3436000	As Jonah and Matt says, it's really this one guy that's ruining everything for everyone. Yep.
3436000	3437000	Yep.
3437000	3438000	Pretty much.
3438000	3444000	Alright, well let's move on. Speaking of one company ruining everything, I've got news on the new Mass Effect game.
3444000	3447000	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. Let's hope not, right? Let's hope not.
3447000	3451000	So there is news about the next Mass Effect game coming out of Comic-Con.
3451000	3454000	And by news I mean very little, little teases.
3454000	3460000	And one thing that they did say, the Bioware panelist said that the game is still years away, which makes me go,
3461000	3470000	I want it now. Look, I understand. I would rather they take their time and get it right. I don't want a rushed game either.
3470000	3476000	But as a fan, it is hard to not want that a lot sooner, if at all possible.
3476000	3482000	I kind of figured it was a little bit away when they didn't have anything to show.
3482000	3484000	I'm thinking 2016 at the earliest.
3484000	3486000	Probably spring 2016, I'm guessing.
3486000	3489000	Or maybe even holiday at this point.
3490000	3493000	Yeah, so I don't know. I'm not holding my breath.
3493000	3498000	But they didn't tell you what the title is, although they say it's not Mass Effect 4 for now.
3498000	3500000	But that doesn't mean they can't always change it.
3500000	3510000	It does seem like the game will have something to do with N7, which is the military designation that Commander Shepard has in the first few games, the first trilogy.
3510000	3513000	But it's not about Commander Shepard.
3513000	3519000	They only would show your hero in male and female forms, but you don't know the name or anything else.
3519000	3525000	And there's a helmet on. So again, you really don't know a lot. You just kind of see what they look like with the helmet on.
3525000	3531000	But it does seem interesting that it is going to be a story that runs concurrently with the first trilogy.
3531000	3537000	So we don't know if his or her path will intertwine with the Shepard story.
3537000	3542000	If some of those characters will cross over, it definitely seems like there's a potential for that, that some of the characters could show up.
3542000	3552000	And this makes a lot of sense. I think we've talked about the next Mass Effect game before on the show, especially Jamie and I, that something, not necessarily a sequel.
3552000	3558000	Because if you have a sequel, then you're going to have to have a definitive ending for the first trilogy, which is going to be a very hard thing to do, to have a canon ending.
3558000	3568000	But if you run something concurrently or even a prequel, that's going to make it a little easier to have a different story without having a definitive ending for the first few games.
3568000	3571000	So it will be very interesting to see how that plays out.
3571000	3575000	Also in the game, the Mako will be making an appearance.
3575000	3583000	Very unpopular vehicle for Mass Effect 1, because it kind of drove like shit, and you end up in all these really crappy positions and stuff.
3583000	3587000	But they say they've learned a lot, and of course it's going to be different this time.
3587000	3594000	I liked in theory what the Mako did, that you had to drive around the planets and look for things.
3594000	3596000	I mean, that's all part of the space exploration. I get it.
3596000	3602000	So from that end of things, I understand why they want to bring it back. Just as long as it controls a little better, it'll be really great.
3602000	3608000	So, there you go. Sparse details on the next Mass Effect game. Still don't care, huh Matt?
3608000	3610000	Nope.
3610000	3612000	I figured as much.
3612000	3615000	I haven't gotten into it this long. I don't need to get into it.
3615000	3622000	DarkTetsuya in chat says, I feel you Rob. Been waiting on Zelda Wii U since Wind Waker HD finished, so I feel your pain.
3623000	3629000	Yeah, I know that's going to be a wait too for Zelda Wii U, although that's probably closer to the next holiday, honestly.
3629000	3630000	I think that's next holiday.
3630000	3631000	That'll be next holiday.
3631000	3632000	I hope it's next holiday.
3632000	3635000	Zelda Wii U will be out before Mass Effect next.
3635000	3644000	I think they have to pretty much put it out next holiday at this point, because that's going to really drive system sales.
3644000	3647000	And they need it now rather than later.
3647000	3653000	Alright, well let's see what's going to drive sales at your local game store this week as we travel around the world and check out release dates.
3653000	3657000	That's easy. It's going to be The Last of Us Remastered on Playstation 4.
3657000	3666000	And then, probably not so much. They've got Lego Ninjago and Ninjroids on 3DS and Vita. That's it.
3666000	3669000	Pretty slow week yet again.
3669000	3670000	It's July.
3670000	3674000	Yeah, this time of year doesn't tend to be very action packed, does it?
3674000	3678000	Alright, well let's move over to Japan and check out the releases over there.
3678000	3686000	Let's see, on July 31st, I think is the only date I really have releases for, Race Driver Grid 2.
3686000	3691000	That's the only price reduction. That's going into the best series on the Playstation 3.
3691000	3692000	That's it.
3692000	3698000	There's a new monitor for Playstation 4 coming out that's not a game, but some type of peripheral.
3698000	3701000	Like a full HD liquid crystal monitor for Playstation 4.
3701000	3704000	It just made me think about that, remember that Sony 3D TV that they put out?
3704000	3705000	Yeah, I remember that.
3705000	3709000	I kind of wish I'd bought that, like when they dropped the price on it. I had a hard time selling that. I kind of wish I did.
3709000	3710000	Yeah.
3710000	3711000	I know, I know.
3711000	3717000	They're not, I don't know. We had a couple that we just couldn't get rid of that for a long time.
3717000	3719000	It finally did?
3719000	3721000	They finally marked them down and they sold them.
3721000	3728000	Yeah. On the Playstation Vita, Child of Light is released on the Vita, a special edition from Ubisoft this week.
3728000	3733000	And Kaihu Shoju-Sin comes out this week on the Vita as well.
3733000	3738000	And lastly, looking at the 3DS, the 3DS has a few more things.
3738000	3744000	Sony Pro, that's S-O-N-I, not to be confused with the makers of the other handheld.
3744000	3748000	Happiness Charge Pre-Cure, Kawarun Collection.
3748000	3751000	And Fate Khalid Linear, Prisma Aliyah comes out.
3751000	3757000	So it looks like the 3DS probably has more than anything else, otherwise it's a slow week over in Japan as well.
3757000	3761000	Sadly, Dark Sakura isn't here, but I happen to have the Europe releases up anyway.
3761000	3767000	On July, excuse me, I'm way too early. Let's try not July dates. Let's try August, huh?
3767000	3769000	Or the end of July.
3769000	3772000	Would really be the dates that I want.
3772000	3774000	I think August 1st would be...
3774000	3777000	Yeah, Last of Us Remastered is also out over there on the 29th of July.
3777000	3780000	On the 31st of July, Pinball FX2.
3780000	3784000	And on August 1st, Sacred III on 360, Playstation 3, and PC.
3785000	3787000	So also a slow week over there in Europe.
3787000	3791000	Just a couple more stories, and then the classic game of the week.
3791000	3797000	Dark Sakura's not here tonight, so I picked a classic game tonight that Loki and I can nerd the fuck out over.
3797000	3801000	Because sadly it's not a game Dark Sakura ever played.
3801000	3804000	I know this, because the games come up on the show before.
3804000	3806000	So we'll get to it in a minute. Don't peek, don't spoil it.
3806000	3808000	I won't.
3808000	3810000	So I think this is kind of cool.
3810000	3821000	The Wii version of Skylanders Trap Team is actually going to include a digital copy along with it for the Wii U version of Skylanders Trap Team.
3821000	3831000	So, hey, you may want to have that for your new console that you might buy in the fourth quarter or something like that when your other games come out.
3831000	3834000	So it's kind of cool that they give you two copies of the game.
3835000	3841000	Granted, it's probably safe to say it's not really two copies of the game, because you need that stupid portal to play the game.
3841000	3847000	But it's still cool that they're giving something away. I think that's kind of neat.
3847000	3855000	Now, what's not so neat, though, is this brand new Eons Elite Skylanders figures that they have.
3855000	3859000	Which, guess who they're exclusive to?
3859000	3861000	That's right, Gamestop.
3862000	3869000	And these Elite figures are actually, I guess, repainted.
3869000	3877000	They have some foil, they come in a foil display case, and you can, they're going to have one, I guess, of each element.
3877000	3881000	So is that what they were doing, was sitting at the Activision and Gamestop collaboration meeting going,
3881000	3886000	And we'll cover it in foil, foil.
3886000	3891000	They're also going to, I guess, have a premium price tag. Of course, because it's Gamestop!
3891000	3893000	Why wouldn't they have a premium price tag?
3895000	3905000	They've got, they've so far announced Spyro and Chop Chop, and the characters look like they're a little bit more intricately painted,
3905000	3912000	and they have crap flying, well, Spyro has, like, books, like magical books flying around with him.
3912000	3916000	I don't understand where that shit's going to come in, you know.
3916000	3922000	And if you may be wondering, hey, what exactly is so special about them, other than the fact that they're repainted?
3922000	3932000	Well, the Eon Elite toys summon their in-game characters who are up to three times as powerful as their non-premium characters.
3932000	3936000	So, three times more powerful if you pay the cash.
3936000	3938000	You better move your laptop, because I'm about to flip that table.
3938000	3944000	Look, it's not, it's not that I care about Skylanders or whatever, because I'm not as into this series as, like, somebody like, say, Shane.
3944000	3950000	Although, I did, he made me play the PlayStation 4 one, it was kind of fun. Like, I did enjoy, you know, my time with it.
3950000	3956000	But, this whole, like, giving Gamestop and only Gamestop the exclusives that have this kind of impact in the game,
3956000	3959000	this fuckery, and that's what it is, it is fuckery, it has to quit.
3959000	3964000	Like, I just, can I go on record and say, if I fucking hear one of these CEOs go,
3964000	3970000	oh, this is what the players want, or any form or derivative of that statement, I am going to fucking scream.
3970000	3976000	Or, I, how about this, I don't want to hear these people fucking complain about Gamestop ruining their margins,
3976000	3984000	because they're selling used games, and yet at the same time they're fucking giving them exclusive DLC on all these new release games,
3984000	3986000	and exclusive shit like this.
3986000	3990000	Listen, you're either friends with Gamestop or you're fucking enemies with Gamestop.
3990000	3993000	You're not, like, fucking trying to play both sides of the coin.
3993000	4000000	Like, seriously, it's like, oh, well, did you just, I wished it would stop selling so many used games because,
4000000	4007000	because it really hurts our new game sales, but you can get this game exclusively at Gamestop.
4007000	4010000	You know, that's just, I'm so tired of hearing that.
4010000	4016000	Just, you pick a side, don't fucking give exclusive DLC out, and let's just be honest now, okay?
4016000	4022000	I've seen a lot of this DLC that comes out, you know, this pre-order DLC, and a lot of it is just shit.
4022000	4028000	And a lot of it is just shit that, guess what, it's like Sniper Elite, for example.
4028000	4031000	Sniper Elite 3 that just came out a few weeks ago.
4031000	4039000	They had this exclusive mission that you go kill Hitler, which, surprise, if you've ever played any of the other Sniper Elite games,
4039000	4043000	each one comes with a fucking mission to kill Hitler, okay? Every single one.
4043000	4046000	So anyways, whatever, you kill Hitler.
4046000	4050000	Two weeks later, everybody can, everyone can buy it.
4050000	4055000	I mean, you have to pay for it, granted, it's not free, but it's not exclusive anymore.
4055000	4058000	I don't know. Just wait for the Game of the Year edition.
4058000	4062000	Bonds006 says, thank you for saying exactly what I ask of these game makers.
4062000	4067000	Gamestop is robbing us, but here's Gamestop-only content. Boo fucking who?
4067000	4071000	I just, I want choice. I want there to be choice.
4071000	4078000	If you're gonna do this, then give it to Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, you know,
4078000	4086000	why does it all have to be this one retailer, like, that I purpose, I just don't like to shop at?
4089000	4090000	I don't know, I mean, it's-
4090000	4092000	I have my reasons, and this is a pretty good one.
4092000	4097000	And let's be honest, okay, I'm only angry about this because it's not because of Skylanders,
4097000	4099000	because I don't give a fuck about Skylanders.
4099000	4107000	My thing is, if I'm not angry about this now, it's eventually gonna get to be something that, something that I want.
4107000	4114000	That, you know, it is a game or something that I really want to buy, but now it's exclusive to Gamestop,
4114000	4117000	and they're charging a premium price for it because they can fucking do that.
4117000	4123000	That's where, see, it needs to stop now before it gets to that point. That's the way I see it.
4123000	4127000	I'm gonna say something pretty ballsy here, but I don't care.
4127000	4130000	I'm in a mood tonight, especially with the hiccups having derailed the first half of the show,
4130000	4134000	I would rather pirate a game than get it at Gamestop.
4135000	4141000	I'm not using that as an excuse to justify piracy, because I don't pirate games, because most everything I want,
4141000	4148000	even what I came closest to, Xenoblade, came out through the Nintendo thing as well.
4148000	4156000	But, you know, this whole shit has gotta stop, because yes, I would rather pirate games than buy them from Gamestop.
4156000	4160000	And, no offense, I'm sure we have plenty of Gamestop employees that listen to this show,
4160000	4165000	my beef is not with the hardworking people that are getting paid way too little to put up with all of this fuckery.
4165000	4170000	The fuckery from me, the fuckery from their management, the more fuckery from their management,
4170000	4172000	and the continued fuckery of their management.
4173000	4175000	Done. Soapbox. Put it away.
4175000	4177000	Anything else you'd like to add, Loki?
4178000	4185000	They also announced the dark editions of, you know, the collector's editions that come with characters that are darker.
4186000	4188000	And it's ten dollars more expensive.
4189000	4191000	That's like the shinies of Pokemon.
4191000	4200000	But it comes with a trap crystal that you can catch the bad guy of the game in chaos and use him as a character.
4201000	4207000	Which you only get that through, you know, buying this collector's edition that's ten dollars more expensive.
4207000	4212000	Oh, by the way, that collector's edition, not even on Skylanders now, let's go back to Disney Infinity here.
4212000	4219000	The collector's edition of Disney Infinity comes with all the, you know, the regular version of the game,
4219000	4222000	the starter pack comes with three of the Avenger characters.
4222000	4229000	And I think that they have, normally they have Hulk, Hawkeye, and Captain America,
4229000	4234000	the other characters that they add on top of that with it.
4234000	4238000	In fact, Hulk isn't exclusive to this collector's edition until the end of,
4238000	4242000	oh, I'm sorry, I can't say it, but, until the end of some other month.
4242000	4248000	And, so, they have that. It's a hundred and eighty dollars.
4249000	4251000	A hundred and eighty dollars.
4251000	4257000	And it comes, the thing that's really separate from buying the characters themselves in the starter pack
4257000	4261000	is this display case that it has that's not worth sixty extra dollars.
4261000	4265000	A hundred and fucking eighty dollars for this shit.
4265000	4269000	I'm just saying, guys, you have to vote with your wallet at the end of the day.
4269000	4273000	How bad do you need that one scrappy little piece of DLC?
4273000	4275000	Let me give you a hint, you don't.
4275000	4280000	If the game is going to suck without that piece of DLC, then the game wasn't worth the purchase anyway.
4280000	4282000	You have to vote with your wallet.
4282000	4287000	Hey, if you want to shop at GameStop and do all that, you know what, more power to you.
4287000	4292000	You, this is America, and you can spend your money wherever the fuck you damn well please, that is your,
4292000	4296000	and even the other countries that listen to this show enjoy similar freedoms.
4296000	4298000	You can spend your money wherever the hell you like.
4298000	4301000	Don't let this complaining little bastard stop you.
4301000	4302000	Do it.
4302000	4309000	But, if you don't like it, and you want things to change, then you have to speak with your wallet
4309000	4313000	because that's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day.
4316000	4318000	Alright, moving on.
4319000	4323000	Speaking of voting with your wallet, how would you like to buy some good old fashioned games?
4323000	4329000	That's right, there's GOG.com, some good old games, which, you know, they really like to promote
4329000	4335000	that they give DRM-free game distribution, and that is now coming to Linux as well.
4335000	4340000	So for all you that have installed Linux on your toaster or your refrigerator, there are some games you can now play on it.
4340000	4343000	I'm kidding, because obviously they don't have the power to play these games.
4343000	4349000	But, those of you that do like to put Linux on your laptop or wherever, your desktop, wherever you have Linux,
4349000	4355000	you have some games now from GOG that will support Linux, including Pirates Gold Plus, FlatOut 2,
4355000	4361000	Rise of the Triad, Dark War, 50 Linux compatible games added to the online catalog.
4361000	4368000	This is in response to a previous initiative saying they will bring more than 100 Linux games to the service by fall.
4368000	4374000	Pretty cool. For those, you know, again, that like their choice and you don't want to have to use Windows,
4374000	4379000	and you don't like Apple either, so you use Linux, more power to you.
4379000	4384000	Now you have these games available to you. And some classics, Pirates Gold, that's a classic.
4384000	4389000	Speaking of classics, folks, it's time to take a trip down memory lane.
4389000	4392000	I don't think this game is on GOG.com yet, but it should be.
4393000	4397000	Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and she finds a game that she says,
4397000	4400000	hey, you little bastards ought to be playing this game.
4400000	4404000	I was going to say, I haven't even looked at what the game was, but I kind of already knew what it was,
4404000	4407000	because now I'm thinking of it. And now it confirms that.
4407000	4413000	Alright, so here it is. Dark Soccer is not here this week, so ha, I'm going to step into my gaming vault
4413000	4417000	and pick a game that I think you guys should play this week.
4417000	4419000	And it's one that we've talked about on the show before.
4419000	4421000	And it's free, I think, right now.
4421000	4425000	But believe it or not, it has never been a classic game of the week, and it needs to change.
4425000	4429000	And I'm going to, this is a DOS game, so it doesn't have a lot of music.
4429000	4432000	It didn't even use AdLib or Sound Blaster, so it doesn't really have a lot of music.
4432000	4436000	But let me see if you can guess, just from these little sounds, what it is.
4439000	4441000	Anybody? Anybody?
4441000	4445000	Now this game doesn't have a lot of sound to it, so I will kind of minimize it.
4445000	4447000	And it can run there in the background.
4447000	4452000	Let's talk about a true classic game, one of my very favorite PC games they ever did make.
4452000	4455000	ZZT. ZZT is the classic game of the week.
4455000	4456000	Ah, yes.
4456000	4464000	That's right. ZZT was created in 1991 by Tim Sweeney, which was Potomac Computer Systems at the time,
4464000	4468000	and now it's Epic MegaGames. That was transitioned in 92.
4468000	4474000	ZZT, it doesn't stand for anything. There was no reason it was given that particular name.
4474000	4480000	The reason why he gave it that name is that it would always appear at the bottom of news group listings.
4480000	4483000	Some people want to be on the top, others want to be on the bottom.
4483000	4486000	So there you go, it's always at the bottom of news group listings.
4486000	4495000	Sweeney once joked it's short for Zoo of Zero Tolerance, but now everybody kind of believes that that is what it really means.
4495000	4497000	So Zoo of Zero Tolerance, I had never heard that before.
4497000	4499000	The Zoo of Zero Tolerance, it makes sense I guess.
4499000	4502000	Although it says nothing about the creation aspects of this game.
4502000	4506000	Now, this game runs all in text, ANSI graphics.
4506000	4509000	For those of you younger folks that weren't around when ANSI was all the rage,
4509000	4514000	that basically means a game completely played in a text environment, like a text screen.
4514000	4522000	Kingdom of Krause was a game that used this kind of engine about four years before this game came out.
4522000	4524000	ZZT was a shareware game.
4524000	4528000	And is shareware even something they really do anymore? You don't really see a lot of this.
4528000	4537000	What was shareware? Shareware was they gave away the first of four worlds, and the first one was free.
4537000	4540000	So I guess if you think about it, the Destiny beta was the first world.
4540000	4544000	I would still say that a lot of the Telltale games now are like that.
4544000	4547000	Ah, that's a good point. A lot of Telltale stuff is like shareware. That's really good.
4547000	4551000	So yeah, ZZT was shareware. The Freetown was called the town of ZZT.
4551000	4555000	And for those of you that are looking at YouTube, you'll probably see the little dude playing through that,
4555000	4558000	as there's very minimal noise, except when he picks up items.
4558000	4561000	I hope it's saying to turn down your YouTube a little more.
4561000	4563000	Is it? Too loud?
4563000	4564000	Yeah.
4564000	4568000	I'm sorry these DOS-based sounds are too much for you all to handle.
4568000	4569000	They're too intense.
4569000	4571000	They're too intense, all the little blips and blops.
4571000	4573000	Alright, town of ZZT was the free one they gave away.
4573000	4576000	Caves of ZZT, dungeons of ZZT, and city of ZZTs were the other.
4576000	4581000	It was a very simple game. You moved your little happy face around with four cursor keys.
4581000	4585000	If you hold the shift key down and press a cursor key, you will shoot a bullet if you have ammo.
4585000	4590000	You can pick up ammo, which is five rounds for each thing you pick up.
4590000	4591000	Gems, which is currency.
4591000	4595000	Torches, which you use by hitting the T key if a room is dark.
4595000	4599000	And energizers that will make you invincible temporarily.
4599000	4602000	Some of the enemies you will fight in the game include lions that randomly move around.
4602000	4605000	Tigers that move around and fire bullets.
4605000	4607000	I don't know who decided to give a tiger a gun, but they did.
4607000	4611000	Ruffians that will chase you, rest and then repeat.
4611000	4614000	Bears, slimes, and spinning guns.
4614000	4618000	So, I know this game may sound like, okay, it doesn't sound that awesome,
4618000	4623000	but here's where the game gets really awesome is that you got to make your own games.
4623000	4625000	It had a built-in editor.
4625000	4629000	It had an object-oriented scripting language in the game called ZZT OOP
4629000	4632000	that allowed you to actually create your own levels.
4633000	4637000	And so, back in the day of BBSs, when, you know, Loki's talked about this before.
4637000	4638000	I've talked about this before.
4638000	4640000	Fans of Bobby Blackwell know he talks about this too.
4640000	4643000	You used to call into BBSs, and not only would you download your shareware ZZT,
4643000	4648000	but you could download levels that other people made in ZZT and play like friends levels.
4648000	4653000	And, you know, people would do the same shit then that they do today.
4653000	4658000	They would draw a level that's nothing but a giant penis with little guns that shoot out.
4658000	4660000	All that same shit would happen back in the day.
4660000	4661000	We did some awesome stuff.
4661000	4667000	I remember my classmates used to make, like, Zen Trotti stuff,
4667000	4670000	because they were really big into, like, Macross and stuff,
4670000	4675000	so they'd make, like, you know, working mechs and just all sorts of crazy things.
4675000	4679000	And I actually had a cool game that started that had a really generic title, Adventure Quest.
4679000	4683000	And it was pretty far along.
4683000	4689000	And then, unfortunately, my floppy disk got corrupted, and I lost it.
4690000	4697000	But, yeah, there was that and, you know, Megazooks, of course, and Super ZZT.
4697000	4704000	They did release what was called The Best of ZZT, which was kind of like the Tim Sweeney endorsed levels that he liked.
4704000	4707000	So that was pretty cool that they released all that together.
4707000	4710000	Now, Loki's starting to talk about some of the other games that came after it.
4710000	4711000	Some of the other things.
4711000	4715000	There was Megazoo was one of them. Super ZZT was there.
4715000	4718000	Super ZZT didn't really have an easily accessible editor in it,
4718000	4720000	which is why a lot of people didn't think it was as good.
4720000	4724000	Honestly, for me, none of these sequels really did it the same way ZZT did.
4724000	4725000	Megazooks is actually really good.
4725000	4726000	Did it?
4726000	4727000	Have you played that?
4727000	4729000	I remember playing it back in the day, but not enough.
4729000	4731000	Megazooks is very much like ZZT.
4731000	4734000	Super ZZT, they decided they'd go with their own, like, thing.
4734000	4738000	Instead of it being text-based, it was, like, square-based.
4738000	4741000	And so they had text and everything, but it looked like it was stretched horizontally.
4741000	4743000	It was just really weird.
4743000	4746000	Whereas Megazooks was more, it looked like ZZT,
4746000	4749000	but you could create your own text characters,
4749000	4755000	and you could also put, you know, your own music in there,
4755000	4757000	like Scream Tracker stuff.
4757000	4758000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4758000	4760000	I do remember that, because I remember the mod,
4760000	4764000	because I had this mod file that was, like, the Gauntlet song or something,
4764000	4765000	and we put it in one of those levels.
4765000	4767000	That was, like, one of the things we did.
4767000	4770000	I had some pretty sweet stuff in that one, too.
4770000	4771000	Nice.
4771000	4773000	Actually, I restarted my game.
4773000	4775000	I would love to see some of your old ZZT creations.
4775000	4777000	Oh, God, I don't have them anymore.
4777000	4779000	I really wish I had them, because they were so cool.
4779000	4781000	Yeah, me neither. Online or gone. Sad.
4781000	4785000	Get this. ZZT was still on sale through 2009,
4785000	4787000	where it was available through mail order.
4787000	4792000	They finally distributed the very last copy in late 2013.
4792000	4793000	So that was it.
4793000	4795000	That was the end of ZZT.
4795000	4798000	Now, I thought I heard somewhere, though, that they give this away for free now.
4798000	4801000	I thought I remember we had a story on it previously.
4801000	4803000	I don't see it in what's in front of me.
4803000	4805000	I hope somebody in the chatters know a little more about this,
4805000	4807000	because I thought you could just get the whole ZZT thing for free now.
4807000	4810000	Some of the other games that ZZT inspired.
4810000	4815000	Dream ZZT, which was an open-source ZZT engine for Mac, Windows, Linux,
4815000	4817000	the Nintendo DS, and the Sega Dreamcast.
4817000	4822000	I had no idea somebody put ZZT on the Dreamcast.
4822000	4823000	That's amazing.
4823000	4824000	That's awesome.
4824000	4825000	I want to check that out.
4825000	4828000	Direct ZZT, which is an open-source C-sharp game
4828000	4832000	that reconstructs ZZT using modern graphics technologies,
4832000	4836000	hence the name Direct ZZT in parallel to Direct X.
4838000	4839000	Very cool.
4839000	4844000	So there it is, your classic game of the week, ZZT.
4844000	4847000	And I think part of the reason Loki and I love this game so much is just
4847000	4849000	it was really, you know, you could create.
4849000	4852000	It wasn't just playing these already established levels,
4852000	4854000	but being able to create your own shit and share it with friends.
4854000	4857000	I mean, that's some of the stuff a lot of us still enjoy in games today.
4857000	4861000	Little Big Planet, huge example of that, and a lot of what happened
4861000	4864000	in what was that called, like, the Gameplay 2.0 Initiative or whatever,
4864000	4866000	you know, Play, Create, Share, whatever that was.
4866000	4867000	Yeah.
4867000	4868000	They call that.
4868000	4870000	A lot of that you can trace back to something like ZZT
4870000	4874000	and old classic games, a pinball construction set,
4874000	4877000	which I'll have to cover in a future week by Electronic Arts.
4877000	4881000	That's right, yay, way back in the day was a great, great game too
4881000	4884000	that was a similar thing where you can construct your own pinball boards
4884000	4885000	and let your friends play them.
4885000	4887000	So there it is.
4887000	4888000	I missed this.
4888000	4889000	This game is awesome.
4889000	4890000	Right?
4890000	4891000	I know, huh?
4891000	4892000	Yeah.
4892000	4897000	We should have, like, a VoG ZZT level creation contest or something.
4897000	4899000	I feel like nobody would enter.
4899000	4903000	Or, no, even better, let's just, like, forget just the VoG creation thing,
4903000	4908000	just, like, have, like, a co-opt VoG game made out of ZZT.
4908000	4911000	That would be pretty sweet.
4911000	4914000	We need something on the site besides Flappy VoG.
4914000	4915000	All right.
4915000	4916000	There it is.
4916000	4918000	Once again, your Classic Game of the Week, ZZT.
4918000	4920000	That is going to do it for Part A of the show,
4920000	4921000	but don't go anywhere, guys.
4921000	4924000	We have plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week,
4924000	4926000	news about more games coming to PlayStation 4,
4926000	4928000	which are PlayStation 3 remakes,
4928000	4931000	but these are ones I think a lot of you will be looking forward to,
4931000	4933000	and more Tekken updates to follow last week.
4933000	4936000	We will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4936000	4937000	right after this.
4937000	4938000	Don't go anywhere.
4944000	4947000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4947000	4954000	We are live on this July the 27th of 2014 with episode number 561 of our show,
4954000	4957000	and here I thought the hiccups and coughing was done.
4957000	4958000	They're back for Part B.
4958000	4960000	I know, they're back for Part B, just like we are.
4960000	4961000	Good gosh.
4961000	4962000	All right, so we're a little broken tonight.
4962000	4964000	Not only Dark Soccer, she's not here tonight.
4964000	4966000	Unfortunately, she wasn't feeling too well,
4966000	4968000	and she needs to rest up so she can go back to work tomorrow,
4968000	4970000	so it's just Loki and I holding down the fort,
4970000	4974000	but then I keep wanting to spontaneously combust over here or something,
4974000	4976000	so I apologize to you guys, but we do it live.
4976000	4977000	That's the way we do it.
4977000	4980000	It's live and unedited, so sometimes it's going to be a little weird.
4980000	4984000	If you want to join us for a live show, of course you can come out on Sunday nights,
4984000	4988000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
4988000	4991000	Speaking of the Voice of Geeks Network, lots of great shows on the network,
4991000	4994000	and I mentioned this a little earlier in the show.
4994000	4999000	I talk about movies and anime and other gaming shows and RPGs
4999000	5001000	and Star Trek and all this stuff.
5001000	5003000	One of the other shows on our network,
5003000	5007000	and these guys are always really great supporters of what we do here at OLR,
5007000	5011000	and one of their hosts, Brad, is here almost every week, Pod Culture,
5011000	5015000	a great show that's on Monday nights on the network, 6 o'clock Pacific.
5015000	5019000	They talk about kind of like general sci-fi geekery.
5019000	5021000	They talk about a lot of movies and TV,
5021000	5023000	but they get into the game chatter once in a while too.
5023000	5027000	Sometimes they do special episodes on Doctor Who called TARDIS Interruptus,
5027000	5029000	but the reason why I bring that up is that I want to give a shout-out
5029000	5032000	to one of the hosts over at Pod Culture, Glenn,
5032000	5036000	because Glenn has a new book that just came out that you can check out.
5036000	5041000	I always say support indie broadcasting, so why not support indie publishing?
5041000	5043000	If you want to check out this book, check it out.
5043000	5045000	It's Darkness Unbound, and you can check that out at
5045000	5046000	You can check that out at
5061000	5064000	Check that out, and if you want to know what this book is all about,
5064000	5068000	it's one of those thriller mystery type of things,
5068000	5071000	because a family of four murdered in their sleep,
5071000	5073000	and the entire city is on edge.
5073000	5076000	Police investigate the occult connections between these murders
5076000	5078000	and similar murders from 13 years ago.
5078000	5080000	One detective knows the truth.
5080000	5083000	Something dark from Sister Marion's past has returned.
5083000	5085000	Now innocent lives are being lost.
5085000	5088000	Will she have the faith to face her greatest fear?
5088000	5089000	We'll find out over at
5092000	5093000	Best of luck to Glenn.
5093000	5097000	It's really exciting to have something that you've kind of created
5097000	5100000	and poured a lot into, like be out there and be available,
5100000	5102000	which you're hoping to get to with your game someday, right?
5102000	5108000	Yep. Oh god, my game just, this week, rewriting stuff,
5108000	5110000	making it a lot simpler.
5111000	5112000	That's what I was doing.
5112000	5114000	Except I'm going to be really busy this week.
5117000	5119000	Damn, I was going to make a joke in there saying like,
5119000	5123000	yes, the shocking truth, that it's music and dancing that have caused these murders,
5123000	5126000	and so we have to outlaw all music and dancing.
5126000	5127000	Wasn't that the plot of Footloose?
5127000	5128000	Yeah, it might have been.
5128000	5132000	All right, again, that's tinyurl.com slash darkness unbound,
5132000	5134000	but you've got to capitalize the D and the U, like darkness,
5134000	5136000	capital D, unbound, capital U,
5136000	5138000	because it's one of those like case sensitive tiny URL.
5138000	5140000	That is just going to redirect you to the Amazon page,
5140000	5142000	if you're curious, like where are you sending me, Rob?
5142000	5144000	It's just the Amazon page where you can buy the book.
5144000	5145000	Send you on an adventure.
5145000	5146000	That's right, a choose your own adventure,
5146000	5149000	and you'll have to play all four chapters of ZZT
5149000	5151000	before you're eligible to purchase the book.
5151000	5154000	I don't know if I've ever played all four chapters.
5154000	5156000	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
5156000	5158000	We've got some rapid fire news,
5158000	5160000	traveling around the gaming industry
5160000	5162000	and checking out what else is going on.
5162000	5167000	So Media Molecule is teasing a brand new game
5167000	5172000	that they're working on in a video called Embrace the Glitch,
5172000	5175000	and apparently they had some sort of glitch
5175000	5177000	with some rendering thing that they were doing,
5177000	5181000	and what is the thing that they're teasing?
5181000	5186000	Well, it appears to be those marionette puppets
5186000	5189000	or whatever, that tech demo that they had
5189000	5192000	that they showed during E3 2013,
5192000	5194000	and it was also that thing that they had
5194000	5198000	where you could sculpt stuff with the PlayStation Move
5198000	5201000	and do all sorts of weird stuff with that.
5201000	5204000	So don't know much more about it.
5204000	5206000	If I were to take a guess,
5206000	5210000	I'm guessing that we'll see more of this at maybe Gamescom
5210000	5213000	because I believe Media Molecule is a European company.
5213000	5214000	They sure are.
5214000	5218000	So that'd be my guess.
5218000	5222000	Anyways, so this is kind of neat.
5222000	5223000	NES Remix pack.
5223000	5229000	They're going to be coming out in disc format this holiday,
5229000	5233000	and it's going to include NES Remix 1 and 2,
5233000	5238000	and no word on what it's going to cost,
5238000	5241000	but I'm guessing maybe like $29.99 maybe
5241000	5245000	because they're saying it's about $28 US
5245000	5247000	for the Famicom Remix pack,
5247000	5250000	so that makes sense, I guess.
5250000	5252000	And last but not least,
5252000	5257000	the Uncharted movie is supposed to be coming out to theaters
5257000	5260000	June 10th, 2016,
5260000	5265000	and I'm not sure if that happens to be the same date
5265000	5268000	that falls on for other movies here.
5268000	5272000	Oh, yes, June 10th also would be...
5272000	5273000	Let's see.
5273000	5276000	Oh, originally it was supposed to be for the Amazing Inspirement 3.
5276000	5278000	That's what it looks like. Familiar.
5278000	5282000	But that got delayed to 2018.
5282000	5284000	By that time, I'm not going to remember
5284000	5286000	that they have an Amazing Inspirement 3.
5286000	5287000	Well, that's fine
5287000	5291000	because I've never seen the first or second one, so whatever.
5291000	5293000	But Uncharted, that'd be pretty cool.
5293000	5295000	I'm surprised that they're making so many movies
5295000	5297000	of these Sony properties all of a sudden,
5297000	5299000	and I don't know, I think it's kind of cool.
5299000	5301000	Maybe, maybe we'll start a trend
5301000	5304000	where there'll be good video game movies.
5304000	5306000	That would be something, wouldn't it?
5306000	5308000	I'm looking forward to...
5308000	5311000	I'm looking forward to Fassbender and Assassin's Creed.
5311000	5314000	I'm just saying, I would think that Sony
5314000	5317000	making a movie of their own property
5317000	5319000	probably won't fuck it up.
5319000	5320000	Just saying, you know.
5320000	5322000	I'm pretty confident that Sony knows their own properties
5322000	5324000	that they won't fuck it up.
5324000	5328000	Well, let's, you know, let's be cautiously optimistic.
5328000	5330000	Shall we?
5330000	5333000	Alright, this has me pretty excited.
5333000	5335000	Arcade classic.
5335000	5337000	Silent Scope, you ever played this?
5337000	5339000	I know we used to play this.
5339000	5341000	This was featured alongside DDR.
5341000	5343000	They used to have that machine,
5343000	5345000	and what was it, mocap boxing and all that stuff?
5345000	5347000	Was it Police 911?
5347000	5348000	Police 911.
5348000	5350000	Anyway, Silent Scope, they haven't really done one in a while,
5350000	5352000	but get this, it's coming back.
5352000	5354000	That's right, Silent Scope is coming back to the arcade.
5354000	5356000	It's an anime-style Silent Scope game
5356000	5358000	called Silent Scope Bone Eater.
5360000	5362000	I wonder if it'll have a theme song like Snake Eater.
5362000	5364000	Bone Eater!
5364000	5366000	That sounds like a parody.
5366000	5368000	I know.
5368000	5370000	Yeah, I'm just, I'm not gonna go there.
5370000	5371000	You all read into it.
5371000	5373000	If you have the mind of a 12-year-old, you'll understand.
5373000	5374000	But here's the thing.
5374000	5376000	I mean, if it's Konami, then they're definitely well aware
5376000	5378000	that there was a Snake Eater, so, you know.
5378000	5380000	No, why not? So now we got a Bone Eater.
5380000	5382000	So, again, this is in Japan, though.
5382000	5384000	We don't have arcades here in America.
5384000	5387000	That's why we probably won't see this over here.
5387000	5389000	Sad but true.
5389000	5392000	Silent Scope Bone Eater will have network connectivity
5392000	5395000	that will allow four snipers to all eat bones together
5395000	5397000	and dispatch enemies.
5397000	5399000	No word on if it's each other, though,
5399000	5401000	because that might be kind of fun if you could, like, snipe each other.
5401000	5403000	God, that'd be cool, you know.
5403000	5405000	Later this year is when this is coming out.
5405000	5409000	Total tangent, but they should have totally done a, um...
5409000	5411000	Oh, what the fuck was that movie?
5411000	5413000	It was, um...
5413000	5415000	I wanna say The Watchmen, but it's not The Watchmen.
5415000	5417000	It's, uh...
5417000	5420000	God, okay, now I can't remember the fucking franchise.
5420000	5421000	The Guardians of the Galaxy?
5421000	5424000	No, it's the one where they curved bullets.
5424000	5425000	They've been, um...
5425000	5426000	Oh, Wanted.
5426000	5427000	Wanted, yes.
5427000	5429000	It would've been awesome if they did, like, a Wanted gun game
5429000	5431000	with, like, motion sensors built into the guns
5431000	5433000	so you can curve the bullets by, like, moving the gun.
5433000	5435000	I didn't know it would be totally sweet.
5435000	5438000	That would've been a unique feature to have in an arcade cabinet.
5438000	5440000	And hell, you know what?
5440000	5442000	They put out a Rambo game not too long ago.
5442000	5444000	It's not fucking too late to make a Wanted game.
5444000	5445000	I would be happy to see it.
5445000	5447000	And another Wanted movie,
5447000	5449000	because that movie I thought was pretty sweet.
5449000	5451000	That movie was so, like, ridiculous, but I loved it.
5451000	5453000	It was so, like, stupid.
5453000	5455000	The comic, I guess, is even more ridiculous, but...
5455000	5456000	I bet.
5456000	5457000	I can't wait.
5457000	5459000	Speaking of ridiculous things,
5459000	5461000	I love more than anything else in the world.
5462000	5465000	We have an excuse to talk about RuPaul's Drag Race this week, everybody.
5465000	5469000	RuPaul's Drag Race Dragopolis 2.0 has been announced
5469000	5472000	for the App Store and Google Play.
5472000	5474000	And more information on Dragopolis 2.0 came out this week.
5474000	5478000	Queens like Jinx Monsoon, Shangela, and Sharon Needles
5478000	5479000	will be featured in the game.
5479000	5482000	Why wasn't this debuted at GamerCon?
5482000	5483000	They did announce...
5483000	5486000	Actually, I was at a panel where they did kind of confirm
5486000	5487000	that this was happening at GamerX.
5487000	5490000	The first Dragopolis was at GamerX last year.
5491000	5493000	Also, I can't believe...
5493000	5496000	This was in a little summary here, but I have to know...
5496000	5498000	One of my favorite queens ever that's been on the show,
5498000	5501000	Alaska Thunderfuck, will also be in the game.
5501000	5502000	Hi!
5502000	5504000	Hi, everybody.
5504000	5508000	Some of the people have no idea what I'm talking about out there.
5508000	5509000	Guilty pleasure show.
5509000	5510000	Maybe one of them.
5510000	5513000	I don't care if you're straight, gay, whatever in between,
5513000	5514000	who you are.
5514000	5519000	RuPaul's Drag Race is a primo TV show for everybody.
5519000	5524000	Also in the game, Jujubee, Ongina, Raven also in the game,
5524000	5525000	so that'll be fun.
5525000	5528000	You will have fashion challenges,
5528000	5531000	and you will be able to outfit and accessorize
5531000	5532000	each queen in the game.
5532000	5536000	There is no lip syncing in the game, though, however.
5536000	5538000	This is just a little iPhone game.
5538000	5542000	But, yeah, it's just a silly little iPhone game
5542000	5544000	that I remember you just would like.
5544000	5546000	It was like a little platformer type of game the first one,
5546000	5548000	so I'm sure this one's just like it.
5548000	5550000	Is this Frog Factions 2?
5550000	5553000	No, it's sadly no, I wish.
5553000	5556000	But they do say in this game you'll be playing through fashion challenge levels
5556000	5561000	inspired by the show, such as the Hero's Ball, the Glitter Ball, and more.
5561000	5565000	Are you excited to play the Glitter Ball?
5565000	5568000	I did not play the first game, so...
5568000	5571000	I feel that I would be left out.
5571000	5573000	Bye!
5573000	5574000	All right.
5574000	5575000	Then here we go.
5575000	5577000	Let's talk about something maybe you do know a little more about.
5577000	5580000	This has to do with Kingdom Hearts meets Batman.
5580000	5582000	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.
5582000	5584000	I'm not talking about Kingdom Hearts 3, people. Hold on.
5584000	5585000	But this is pretty cool.
5585000	5588000	Tetsuya Nomura, who a lot of you guys know from Kingdom Hearts,
5588000	5593000	he actually did a Batman redesign that is being seen around, I guess, Comic-Con.
5593000	5596000	It's at the Square Enix booth at Comic-Con.
5596000	5598000	And, yeah, he did his own little take on it.
5598000	5602000	It's actually going to be a variant play arts action figure that's coming out.
5602000	5603000	And what did you think?
5603000	5604000	I mean, it's very different.
5604000	5606000	I mean, it's hard to explain on a radio show,
5606000	5610000	but when I think of, like, Baflek, I certainly don't see this.
5610000	5611000	There's a lot of, like...
5611000	5612000	Bahamut Man?
5612000	5614000	Yeah, it's like Bahamut Man.
5614000	5616000	Yeah, this is what it looks like.
5616000	5618000	It's neat.
5618000	5620000	It's not like Batman.
5620000	5624000	It's very much of a stretch to call it Batman.
5624000	5626000	I like the design, but...
5626000	5627000	Yeah.
5627000	5631000	Would you have that sitting on your desk at work?
5631000	5632000	Yes.
5632000	5636000	If someone gave me that, yes, I would put that shit up.
5636000	5637000	Here you go.
5637000	5638000	Here's the thing.
5638000	5640000	I would love to see something that kind of crazy.
5640000	5644000	That style, just very Japanese.
5644000	5646000	Just the whole Batman.
5646000	5648000	All the characters would be fucking awesome.
5648000	5649000	I would totally dig that.
5649000	5650000	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
5650000	5652000	Is it covered with belts and belt buckles?
5652000	5653000	It needs more belt buckles.
5653000	5654000	Always more belt buckles.
5654000	5655000	Wrong.
5655000	5656000	That's true.
5656000	5659000	That's true if you're talking about a character.
5659000	5664000	However, this is more of an armor, so it falls into the mech type thing.
5664000	5669000	Lots of spikes and unnecessary joints and stuff like that.
5669000	5670000	Rama says,
5670000	5672000	Looks beastly as fuck.
5672000	5673000	And Fifth Dream says,
5673000	5676000	It's like if they made a current style movie of Batman Beyond.
5676000	5678000	Ooh, maybe.
5678000	5679000	I'd be down with that too.
5679000	5680000	Now you got me thinking.
5680000	5681000	Now you got us all thinking here.
5681000	5684000	All right, and we wanted to get you guys thinking on this story here
5684000	5687000	with our foogle question of the week.
5687000	5694000	Thanks for having a good home.
5694000	5698000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
5698000	5700000	You slam those together and you get foogle.
5700000	5703000	And yeah, it's time for the foogle question of the week.
5703000	5707000	And we actually asked about this very thing, the whole Batman by Tetsuya Nomura.
5707000	5708000	And so we said,
5708000	5714000	We'd like to know what video game maker would you like to see provide a fresh take
5714000	5717000	on a particular famous movie or comic book character
5717000	5719000	and why would that pairing be so awesome?
5719000	5721000	So I'll ask you in a minute, Loki.
5721000	5724000	You'll be thinking about this while I get to some of our listeners this week.
5724000	5727000	We'll start on Google Plus tonight where we have one lone answer,
5727000	5730000	one lone answer from Redertainment on Google Plus.
5730000	5731000	No, love for Google Plus.
5731000	5732000	But Redertainment does say,
5732000	5734000	Movie or comic books?
5734000	5738000	So I can't get Hideo Kojima to write the next season of 24?
5738000	5739000	Shoot.
5739000	5740000	You know what?
5740000	5741000	I'll take it, actually.
5741000	5743000	That's a pretty awesome crossover.
5743000	5745000	24 technically, I think they did have comic books for.
5745000	5748000	And 24 had a game.
5748000	5751000	And I think even Konami were the ones that published it, actually.
5751000	5752000	It was a long time ago.
5752000	5753000	Maybe.
5753000	5754000	I could be wrong on that.
5754000	5755000	Let me think.
5755000	5756000	I've been thinking here.
5756000	5757000	It's no.
5757000	5759000	The game was, no, it was Ubisoft, I think did it.
5759000	5762000	Because it was set between seasons two and three.
5762000	5763000	I remember that.
5763000	5767000	I don't think it was Ubisoft either.
5767000	5768000	Really?
5768000	5770000	Well, look at, to the wiki.
5770000	5772000	Yes, but I'll just look it up.
5772000	5773000	Yeah.
5773000	5774000	Look it up.
5774000	5775000	Come back to me in a minute here.
5775000	5776000	While we get some of our answers on Facebook.
5776000	5779000	Because some of you guys answered the question over on Facebook.
5779000	5780000	And just a few.
5780000	5783000	I guess you guys were having a hard time thinking of some answers.
5783000	5784000	Maybe this question was too hard.
5784000	5785000	I don't know.
5785000	5788000	But we do have our friend Renee from Killer Queens from Outer Space Podcast.
5788000	5795000	Who says Keiji Inafune designing Robocop or Terminator would be Amazeballs.
5795000	5797000	That's a good answer.
5797000	5799000	Dark Tetsuya says 2K.
5799000	5800000	It was 2K.
5800000	5801000	That's right.
5801000	5803000	Mrs. Jonah and Matt saying SCE and 2K.
5803000	5804000	That was right.
5804000	5805000	2K.
5805000	5811000	I remember that was one of the earliest games that wanted to have us work with them.
5811000	5813000	Because we gave away a copy of that game on the show.
5813000	5814000	It was a long time ago.
5814000	5815000	A long time ago.
5815000	5817000	That was a PS2 game if I'm not mistaken.
5817000	5819000	Yes it was.
5819000	5821000	William Murderface.
5821000	5822000	I always love that name.
5822000	5823000	So friendly.
5823000	5828000	William Murderface says I would love to see the Witcher team redesign Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty.
5828000	5833000	I think they could add depth and nuance to a character that deserves far more than she's been given in the past.
5833000	5837000	I know that the new movie tried to do it but I think it could have been done better.
5837000	5838000	You know that new Witcher game.
5838000	5841000	I didn't get to play it at E3 but they did a very long demo of it.
5841000	5847000	And I noted in that game how cinematic and how the art direction was really good in that game.
5847000	5848000	That little preview we saw.
5848000	5853000	So I can see where you might want to see a different take on Maleficent with that.
5853000	5854000	I like that.
5854000	5857000	I think Maleficent is one of those characters that you can see done different ways.
5858000	5859000	Maleficent is up there with Batman.
5859000	5865000	Awesome Unicorn says how about we have Platinum Games of Bayonetta fame right?
5865000	5869000	Work their magic on Barbarella.
5869000	5874000	Now granted all she could really do most of the time in the film is get knocked out and have sex with whoever she feels like.
5874000	5881000	But I'm sure Kamiya could create a ridiculous Bayonetta style overhaul to allow her fierceness to shine.
5881000	5882000	I like that.
5882000	5883000	That's a good one.
5884000	5890000	And Dartitsuya last but not least says I'd like to see Kojima Productions take on Pacific Rim.
5890000	5891000	Good answers.
5891000	5892000	Good answer.
5892000	5894000	I'm sad we didn't get more of them but whatever.
5894000	5895000	I guess that was a tough question.
5895000	5897000	So Loki what did you think of that one?
5899000	5900000	Let's see.
5900000	5902000	I got so many ideas.
5902000	5910000	But one I've always wanted to see and actually kind of wanted to try it at one point but it would have just been too damn hard to do it in the current engine.
5910000	5913000	Is to see Rockstar Games take on Tron.
5915000	5916000	It would be fucking amazing.
5916000	5919000	You got a little taste of that in Saints Row the Third with that gang.
5919000	5920000	Okay no no.
5920000	5922000	I'm sorry no no.
5922000	5923000	I tried.
5923000	5925000	Saints Row I'm sorry.
5925000	5926000	My god.
5926000	5929000	Let's go on a tangent here because now we're talking about it.
5929000	5934000	I've been listening to like at one of my old CDs I have some of the Saints Row 4 music on there.
5934000	5941000	And I kept thinking about like how they could have changed Saints Row 4 to have made it better.
5941000	5944000	And I actually had a great idea and it wouldn't have taken too much.
5944000	5947000	I mean one they had spoilers.
5947000	5953000	They would have not blown up Earth you know and they could have still had it where the feets is in and everything.
5953000	5961000	But the very end kind of do sort of a Men in Black type thing where they have to zap everybody so that their memory is erased of you know the events that happened.
5961000	5970000	And because of that now no one remembers who the Saints are and so they have to in the next game come up from nothing like they did in the first one.
5970000	5972000	Boom reboot for next gen.
5972000	5984000	And it made perfect sense and it would have brought it back around and they could have maybe drowned it down a little bit and made it look less crazy wacky and a little bit more gangster again.
5985000	5992000	My answer is going to be kind of along the lines of Wanted being very like over the top and everything.
5992000	5997000	This is a series that you know it kind of it's ended. It's gone.
5997000	6002000	But we had so much expectations from this series after the first movie particularly.
6002000	6007000	And they did make a game of this series but I think we all wanted something even more than that.
6007000	6010000	And that would be I would want Platinum Games. I'm going to go with them as well.
6010000	6013000	I would want to see their take on The Matrix.
6013000	6020000	That would have been. Come on. Huh. Some of that some of that really over the top stuff would have been amazing for The Matrix. Right.
6020000	6024000	And enter The Matrix. I don't remember being a particularly bad game.
6024000	6025000	It was a good game. I liked it.
6025000	6029000	It was very it was kind of ambitious for its time.
6029000	6033000	You know especially how it worked in a lot of like concurrent stuff that runs with the movie.
6033000	6038000	And like that basically Jada Pinkett who is you know a pretty big star was a big part of that game.
6038000	6041000	She had a more pronounced role in those games as she did in the movies.
6041000	6043000	So I always kind of thought that was interesting.
6043000	6045000	I liked the game a lot.
6045000	6050000	So yeah I liked it. But I'd like to see Platinum Games take. I mean who made Enter The Matrix. Is that Atari? I think it was like.
6050000	6051000	That was yeah I think.
6051000	6055000	Because then they made a Matrix online which kind of you know didn't didn't really go so well.
6055000	6061000	But which in theory on paper Matrix online but I think there's just there was too much other stuff going on online.
6061000	6066000	But yeah I'd like to see Platinum Games take on that. Some of those fight sequences from the first movie.
6066000	6069000	I would just love to see a new Matrix game. Just go back to it.
6069000	6076000	I mean now that the technology is so much better now it would be so cool. How will it even take another Matrix online.
6076000	6080000	All right. Those are those are our answers there for the Fugu question of the week.
6080000	6084000	Thanks you guys for participating. If you missed it try next week.
6084000	6088000	Let's move on. Some more video game news stories. Loki.
6088000	6093000	All right. So let's see. This is kind of cool.
6093000	6100000	You know there is a lot of games that people are wanting to come back for PlayStation 4.
6100000	6108000	And some that people are surprised that they didn't even see because you know they've been doing a lot of these HD remakes for PlayStation 4.
6108000	6112000	You like you see the Metro collection and The Last of Us and all that stuff.
6112000	6118000	Well one of the games you know that was I think when the first PlayStation 4 games was Flower.
6118000	6123000	And people were like oh hey Wolf that game companies flowers there.
6123000	6126000	Well we see Journey. Maybe.
6126000	6135000	Well apparently Sony's Gamescom landing page they had a bunch of games listed for the PlayStation 4.
6135000	6140000	And one of those games of course was Journey included though with that.
6140000	6142000	Until Dawn. Hey remember Until Dawn.
6142000	6146000	It was the PlayStation move horror game title that's supposed to be coming out for PlayStation 3.
6146000	6153000	That never happened. Now that may mean that might be I don't know if it's going to be a move title.
6153000	6158000	Maybe maybe even like no it would be really cool to be like Project Morpheus.
6158000	6164000	You know a lot of people have that camera though for PlayStation and essentially if you have the controller you have some of that element of move.
6165000	6172000	Nom Nom Galaxy also they're doing some ports of Hustle Kings, Pixa Cat and the Unfinished Swan.
6172000	6177000	I guess those are revealed by content rating submissions in Korea.
6180000	6184000	So cool I'm definitely checking out to see what kind of announcements we have out of Gamescom.
6184000	6190000	I'm hoping out of Gamescom we also have the announcement of the release date for Grand Thefto 5 on next gen.
6190000	6192000	Oh I'm sure it'll be before Black Friday.
6192000	6198000	It's I think it's if I was going to take maybe like the 19th of November.
6198000	6201000	Yeah that'd be my guess.
6201000	6205000	Well last week we talked about Tekken 7 and yes Tekken 7.
6205000	6211000	There was a little trailer that came out of Comic Con from that and some more details from Tekken 7.
6213000	6219000	There will be some answers to Tekken mysteries like why did Heihachi throw his son Kazuya off a cliff.
6219000	6221000	That will be answered in Tekken 7 I suppose.
6221000	6230000	There will be guest artists in the game including Yuzuki Kozaki from Fire Emblem Awakening.
6230000	6235000	Some talent behind Bayonetta, Duel Masters, Anarchy Reigns, that'll be pretty cool.
6235000	6240000	Lars is also going to be one of the characters in Tekken 7.
6240000	6242000	That's pretty cool.
6242000	6247000	Lars is the son of Heihachi and the half brother of Kazuya so it makes sense that Lars will show up in this game as well.
6247000	6251000	Will we get any guest characters in this game because that'd be pretty sweet to see Bayonetta and Tekken.
6251000	6254000	I'm thinking with Lars maybe that's certainly possible.
6256000	6258000	So stay tuned for that.
6258000	6264000	Also speaking of guest characters we questioned last week why did they announce Tekken 7 what the hell happened to Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
6264000	6268000	Well a lot of people are asking that question what the hell happened to Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
6268000	6271000	You know it was revealed in 2010 and then that was kind of it.
6272000	6281000	Well Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada said that Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still in development and this was during the fighting game panel at San Diego Comic Con.
6281000	6284000	That's it. So it's not dead.
6284000	6292000	I think it's just like I said last week they were waiting until they knew they had a new engine for the next Tekken game.
6292000	6299000	And instead of developing it for the Tekken 6 engine or whatever they're just going to wait and put it on the Tekken 7 engine.
6299000	6302000	So Tekken 7 first and then Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
6302000	6306000	And that's what Fifth Dream in our chat says it will be in the Tekken 7 engine der.
6306000	6308000	I mean yeah it makes a lot of sense.
6308000	6314000	So they're just putting it on hold because especially after Street Fighter Cross Tekken was kind of lukewarm response to that.
6314000	6316000	You know not a lot of people were super into it.
6316000	6321000	I can see where they really want to really really have a different kind of you know experience so why not.
6321000	6324000	Who knows by that time we may have like Street Fighter 5.
6324000	6328000	I'd be very curious to see that.
6329000	6331000	Alright Loki what do you got?
6331000	6336000	Okay you know once again talking about lots of the Sony properties becoming movies.
6336000	6343000	And another movie that I think a lot of people are going to be very interested to see would be The Last of Us.
6343000	6348000	That was I think announced to be an upcoming motion picture.
6348000	6360000	And one of the actresses that they're talking to right now to be in the actual movie would be the actress that plays Arya Stark in the Game of Thrones.
6360000	6365000	So I don't know that's pretty sweet.
6365000	6367000	I don't know.
6369000	6377000	I haven't played Last of Us unfortunately so I don't know if she'd be a good character for was it Ellie I think in the game.
6377000	6379000	Or am I confusing that with.
6379000	6381000	No that's the character's name.
6381000	6383000	I have not played through this game.
6383000	6387000	I'm like I don't want to confuse that with The Walking Dead because there's a lot of characters.
6387000	6393000	No but yeah Maisie Williams I guess would be the actress.
6393000	6395000	So I don't know I liked her in Game of Thrones.
6395000	6402000	So I mean maybe she doesn't look like the main characters or it doesn't look like Ellie.
6402000	6405000	Makeup and hair and all that stuff can go a long way.
6405000	6406000	Yeah.
6406000	6409000	I wonder who they'll get to play the lead character in that.
6412000	6418000	But yeah they haven't really said I guess Sam Raimi is you know supposed to be doing that.
6418000	6423000	So that's pretty sweet because he knows his horror.
6424000	6425000	Alright.
6425000	6428000	Bruce Campbell that would be awesome. Let's get Bruce Campbell.
6428000	6430000	No Bruce Campbell is going to be doing the Evil Dead TV series now.
6430000	6432000	Like he's actually going to be in it.
6432000	6433000	What?
6433000	6434000	Yeah I saw that on Facebook.
6434000	6435000	What there's a community.
6435000	6437000	It could have been a troll article or something.
6437000	6441000	But well I'm if I saw it on Facebook Loki it's got to be true.
6441000	6442000	Maybe somebody in the chair.
6442000	6443000	Oh man.
6443000	6445000	Can that be so awesome if that.
6445000	6446000	Yeah.
6446000	6449000	I would be very more excited if it's an army of darkness.
6449000	6451000	But whatever whatever I'll deal with that.
6451000	6455000	Well here's something else to get excited about a revival of a rock band.
6455000	6460000	You know we've seen some hints about this and sadly I don't have confirmation today on that.
6460000	6469000	But Harmonix did send out a little survey which through the through the ever lovely Survey Monkey site.
6469000	6470000	A lot of people seem to use.
6470000	6477000	Asking how invested are you basically still in rock band and how likely would you be to join in on a reunion tour.
6477000	6480000	Could that be the possible theme of a new rock band game who knows.
6480000	6483000	They wanted to know how often you play rock band.
6483000	6484000	How often do you buy DLC.
6484000	6486000	What peripherals do you have.
6486000	6490000	Do you want a new game on new consoles or legacy consoles.
6490000	6492000	So very curious to see what comes to this.
6492000	6498000	I mean a lot of this is probably exploratory but it is nice to see if they haven't forgotten about rock band altogether.
6498000	6499000	I mean why not.
6499000	6506000	I would love to see a new game because I have all the fucking peripherals and I spent a lot of money on those peripherals.
6506000	6511000	Yeah I think as long as there's some way to kind of convert the peripherals I think that would really help a long way in.
6511000	6517000	The only bad thing though is the music probably would not be able to be ported.
6517000	6520000	Yeah I don't know what they would be able to do with licensing with that.
6520000	6521000	That would be tricky.
6521000	6526000	RPGfan112 in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says it would be great to see a new rock band.
6526000	6527000	I agree.
6527000	6530000	It's taken a rest long enough.
6530000	6532000	Let's bring it back for a reunion tour.
6532000	6533000	I like that.
6533000	6534000	Rise from your grave.
6534000	6536000	Rise from your grave.
6536000	6541000	By the way Rama in chat says no not a troll article on the Bruce Campbell thing.
6541000	6542000	Yes.
6542000	6543000	There you go.
6543000	6546000	Speaking of harmonics, one other quick little thing with them.
6546000	6548000	Dance Central Spotlight.
6548000	6556000	This is the download only version of Dance Central that will be available on Xbox One and it will be available September 2nd.
6556000	6560000	You will need a Kinect to play this as there is the option on the Xbox One now.
6560000	6565000	It will have 10 songs with the game for $9.99.
6565000	6569000	There will also be another 50 songs to choose from.
6569000	6573000	Not all at once necessarily by the way.
6573000	6575000	The songs coming out with the game.
6575000	6579000	When you buy the $9.99 game you get Avicii with Wake Me Up.
6579000	6580000	Cher Lloyd with I Wish.
6580000	6582000	David Ghetto with Titanium.
6582000	6585000	Jason Derulo with Talk Dirty.
6585000	6587000	Kid Ink and Chris Brown with Show Me.
6587000	6589000	Lorde with Royals.
6589000	6594000	That song isn't played the fuck out but I'll just sing the weird Al Yankovic version and it will be fine.
6594000	6595000	One Republic with Counting Stars.
6595000	6597000	Pharrell Williams with Happy.
6597000	6600000	Again, songs that are played out but weird Al made better.
6600000	6601000	Rihanna with Diamonds.
6601000	6606000	And Will.I.Am featuring Justin Bieber with Hashtag That Power.
6606000	6611000	Okay, I'm gonna like show my age here but like really that's a song.
6611000	6613000	I don't know that song. I guess I should be thankful.
6613000	6614000	I guess I'll learn it.
6614000	6616000	Why does the song have a hashtag in it?
6616000	6619000	It is Hashtag That Power.
6619000	6624000	Unless it's supposed to be a number sign or something else but I don't think that's the case. It's hashtag.
6624000	6628000	Also available for separate downloads to give you an idea of some of the songs.
6628000	6634000	And by the way, like all these songs that are being released on September 2nd are like better than the 10 that are included with the game.
6634000	6636000	So, Capital City, Safe and Sound. I like that song.
6636000	6638000	Emily Sandé with Next To Me.
6638000	6642000	Icona Pop with I Love It. You know that song, right?
6642000	6644000	I think that's the theme song to Girls.
6644000	6648000	I love it. I don't care. I love it.
6648000	6649000	I always sing it.
6649000	6651000	McDonald's. I love it.
6651000	6656000	Lana Del Rey with Summertime Sadness but the Cedric Gervais remix which is really, really good.
6656000	6661000	And the B-52s with Love Shack which is the trump card.
6661000	6662000	Random.
6662000	6664000	Random. Awesome.
6664000	6666000	If you see a faded sign at the side.
6666000	6670000	I need a guana girl here to do the proper Love Shack duet.
6670000	6674000	Alright, let's get to the emails. Every week you guys email us.
6674000	6678000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
6678000	6682000	And DarkSakura, typically she's going to be responsible for reading your emails.
6682000	6687000	But since she is having a sick day, I will bear that responsibility.
6687000	6689000	So let's get to it. The emails tonight.
6689000	6691000	First up, AZHP says,
6691000	6694000	Hey, OLR crew. AZHP here.
6694000	6698000	I just wanted to submit a correction of facts for a story you reported on a few weeks ago.
6698000	6703000	The tournament which banned female players from playing Hearthstone was following the IESF,
6703000	6705000	a Korean organization's guidelines.
6705000	6710000	The IESF divides players into male and female divisions to emulate the divide in real sports.
6710000	6714000	Because this tournament's winners would be placed in the Korean tournament,
6714000	6718000	they did not want a conflict to occur if a female player disqualified a male player
6718000	6720000	who could have been sent to the invitational tournament.
6720000	6723000	It was not because they wanted to protect a male player's pride.
6723000	6727000	The whole rationale is still stupid, but I just wanted to present all the facts
6727000	6730000	before we all jump down the tournament organizer's throats.
6730000	6735000	They wanted gender division, not gender discrimination, and blocking women from playing at all.
6735000	6737000	Yours truly, AZHP.
6737000	6741000	I thought we had referenced that when we were originally going over the article,
6741000	6743000	or at least I thought I had said, like,
6743000	6747000	I think they did this because of the greater, like the championships or whatever.
6747000	6750000	I maybe forgot at the time that it was in Korea or whatever.
6750000	6752000	But I think you kind of said it at the end there.
6752000	6754000	It doesn't necessarily make it right.
6754000	6759000	I mean, it definitely explains how it happened.
6759000	6762000	And I think there's just so many voices out there that says,
6762000	6764000	your cultural traditions be damned.
6764000	6769000	Gaming is a universally loved thing by people of all genders, all colors,
6769000	6772000	all shapes, all sizes, all sexualities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
6772000	6773000	Right?
6773000	6774000	Right.
6774000	6778000	Thank you, though, for the clarification.
6778000	6781000	AZHP is also a multiple gold star recipient.
6781000	6786000	So, you know, some people I don't want to be corrected by, but AZHP, I'll take it.
6786000	6787000	Just kidding.
6787000	6788000	Love y'all.
6788000	6789000	Fantastic.
6789000	6790000	Every gamer has a voice here.
6790000	6792000	Next up from EA Skizie.
6792000	6793000	Hey, Orange Lounge.
6793000	6795000	I'm glad you guys had fun on your weekend off.
6795000	6796000	Me too.
6796000	6800000	In your personal opinions, what was the greatest video game-based movie ever made?
6800000	6803000	I personally think Silent Hill was pretty dang cool.
6803000	6804000	Keep gaming.
6804000	6808000	EA Skizie, straight out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
6808000	6811000	Meaning Milliwake.
6811000	6813000	Remember when Alice Cooper was in Wayne's World?
6813000	6815000	Wayne's World was my favorite movie.
6815000	6816000	Oh, wait.
6816000	6818000	No, not game-based off a movie.
6818000	6821000	Which, by the way, it actually really sucked.
6821000	6823000	What was your favorite movie based off a game?
6823000	6827000	Movie based off a game.
6827000	6834000	Well, I mean, I guess Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children.
6834000	6836000	Oh, good choice.
6836000	6837000	You know what?
6837000	6839000	None of them were really good, EA Skizie.
6839000	6840000	That's the problem.
6840000	6841000	We don't really have a lot of good ones.
6841000	6844000	Even if I was going to pick one that was actually...
6844000	6846000	I mean, even...
6846000	6848000	What was it?
6848000	6851000	The Final Fantasy...
6851000	6853000	What the fuck was the other one?
6853000	6854000	The Spirits Within?
6854000	6856000	That wasn't too bad.
6856000	6857000	It wasn't bad.
6857000	6859000	It was just not Final Fantasy at all.
6859000	6860000	Yeah, it wasn't Final Fantasy.
6860000	6862000	Where was my fucking Chocobo in Spirits Within?
6862000	6863000	Oh, wait.
6863000	6864000	I think there was half a frame.
6864000	6865000	But anyway.
6865000	6868000	My answer to the question, honestly, I know this might sound like a cop-out,
6868000	6870000	but Silent Hill was also my favorite.
6870000	6871000	It was.
6871000	6873000	I liked the games, and I thought the movie did a pretty good job.
6873000	6874000	It didn't blow my mind.
6874000	6876000	Awesome!
6876000	6878000	But it was good enough.
6878000	6880000	It was probably the best one they've done so far.
6880000	6884000	Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat both weren't necessarily bad.
6884000	6886000	I still haven't seen the second Silent Hill movie.
6886000	6888000	Neither have I, but it's on Netflix.
6888000	6890000	So if you have Netflix, yeah.
6890000	6891000	I do have Netflix.
6891000	6893000	It's in my queue or whatever they changed.
6893000	6895000	Because Netflix always has to change something.
6895000	6897000	So they're changing their logo, or they're changing their layout,
6897000	6899000	or they're changing Saturday service,
6899000	6901000	and you don't have a queue anymore.
6901000	6903000	It's your list.
6903000	6904000	Whatever.
6904000	6905000	Whatever.
6905000	6907000	So that's in my list.
6907000	6910000	Some answers in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
6910000	6911000	Tigerclaw says,
6911000	6914000	Mortal Kombat without a doubt was a pretty faithful adaptation of the game
6914000	6916000	minus the fatalities.
6916000	6917000	Blackwool says,
6917000	6920000	It's a toss-up between Advent Children and the first Mortal Kombat.
6920000	6923000	Mortal Kombat is really the true sequel to Highlander.
6923000	6925000	Connor McCloud became the god of lightning after winning the tournament
6925000	6928000	and being the only one left.
6929000	6932000	Does The Wizard count as a video game movie?
6932000	6934000	Actually, I think it should.
6934000	6937000	Skeezy, I'm retracting my answer and saying The Wizard.
6937000	6939000	He touched my breast!
6940000	6942000	That was a definitive movie.
6942000	6945000	Or Tron, even though that's more of a game based off of a movie.
6945000	6946000	That's a good one, too.
6946000	6947000	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
6947000	6950000	Spirits Within was too Japanese and not commercial enough.
6950000	6954000	It was a CGI art movie that tried to lie to people with action scenes.
6954000	6955000	And I'm not hating.
6955000	6958000	I love that movie, but I don't argue with anyone that hated it.
6958000	6959000	There you go.
6959000	6961000	Tomb Raider, some folks in chat saying,
6961000	6963000	Yeah, Tomb Raider wasn't bad.
6963000	6964000	It was that same category.
6964000	6966000	It wasn't bad, but it wasn't like...
6966000	6969000	It wasn't bad because of Angelina Jolie.
6969000	6971000	And she's great.
6971000	6973000	And a great person.
6973000	6975000	I love Angelina Jolie.
6975000	6977000	You guys really make me question my sexuality.
6977000	6981000	Her and Alex from Orange is the New Black are like...
6982000	6984000	I start to wonder.
6984000	6986000	Clearly the right answer is, you know,
6986000	6988000	Street Fighter the movie said no one ever.
6988000	6990000	No. No. God.
6990000	6993000	Oh, poor Raul Julia with that being the last movie.
6993000	6994000	Alright.
6994000	6995000	Moving on.
6995000	6996000	Next email.
6996000	6998000	And this email is from IngramAV98.
6998000	6999000	I hope I said that correct.
6999000	7001000	Hey guys and gal.
7001000	7004000	Well, gal's absent tonight, but we'll pass this along.
7004000	7009000	This email may appear a little fragmented as I started writing it three or four weeks ago.
7009000	7010000	Doh!
7010000	7012000	I'm listening at the moment to you guys talk about your motivations
7012000	7014000	for still working on this show all these years.
7014000	7017000	This must have been after our 12th birthday show.
7017000	7019000	And I wanted to say a big thank you.
7019000	7021000	Aww, thank you for listening.
7021000	7023000	I started listening some seven years ago.
7023000	7027000	I'd been at a low point in my life and randomly took a chance on OLR
7027000	7030000	so I could try and get back into games after a five year hiatus.
7030000	7031000	I definitely don't regret it.
7031000	7034000	I will always be thankful to you guys and the community you created
7034000	7036000	for reigniting that spark in me.
7036000	7039000	I'm still a little behind the times now that I'm busy with real life,
7039000	7041000	but you guys always manage to keep me up to date
7041000	7044000	and most importantly, I feel included and entertained.
7044000	7046000	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
7046000	7048000	Aww, thank you!
7048000	7050000	I mean, seriously, you don't even understand.
7050000	7056000	Like, comments like that, like, that's why we're still fucking doing this after 12 years, right?
7056000	7057000	Right.
7057000	7060000	And then even, you know, we gotta tip our hat and say a big thank you to Bobby Blackwolf as well,
7060000	7064000	who's been our partner show on Sunday nights for like the past seven years at least.
7064000	7067000	He actually hit nine years tonight.
7067000	7070000	Or, well, technically it was on the 24th, but like this is the show where he's observing it, right?
7070000	7072000	He hit nine years.
7072000	7074000	And I had one of those reactions where I was like,
7074000	7075000	oh my god, you've been doing this for nine years?
7075000	7077000	I was like, oh my god, I'm so old.
7077000	7082000	Like, I had that reaction of like when your friend is at, like when you turn 30, Loki.
7082000	7085000	I was like, Loki's turning 30? Oh my god, what does that make me?
7085000	7089000	That was the reaction I had when Bobby said he's turning nine years old.
7089000	7092000	Anyway, thank you. Thank you for being a supporter of the show.
7092000	7094000	There is more to this email.
7094000	7098000	With all the gratitude out of the way and it now being the present, I have a question.
7098000	7104000	Loki, I've been keeping up to date with your game development project and contemplated doing this myself.
7104000	7106000	My degree was in games design.
7106000	7111000	I recently moved to Dusseldorf, I probably said that wrong, Germany, from London,
7111000	7115000	and that I said right, and found it hard to find work as a web developer.
7115000	7120000	So I thought about turning to mobile games development to try and generate some pocket money.
7120000	7123000	What kind of time have you sunk into the project so far?
7124000	7130000	Well, I've been working on it whenever free time I have, which is not a lot since the beginning of March.
7130000	7136000	But that includes like research and just kind of, I don't know, it's not like, I don't know.
7136000	7143000	Like, a lot of it is just thinking about it or like, you know, just researching stuff is a lot of my time spent.
7143000	7148000	Because, you know, there's some nights, like last night, I had my computer open and I was like,
7148000	7153000	you know what, I'm just going to rewrite, you know, this helper script that I have for my primitives to,
7153000	7163000	I have it for my color, changing colors of, you know, the materials and stuff because I use the vector, or the vertex colors.
7163000	7170000	So I had to rewrite everything from the way I was doing it before, and I was just too tired to do it.
7170000	7179000	So I just stopped. But, yeah, I'd say, I don't know, like four months now I've been working on it.
7179000	7188000	But it's, of those four months, you know, maybe a couple hours a day, you know, or an hour a day.
7188000	7191000	I'm always thinking about it, but, you know, actually getting time to work on it.
7191000	7197000	Like, on a good day, you know, I might work on it, my work breaks and lunch, which would be an hour and a half.
7197000	7204000	So, that's about it. And how much of that time am I actually productive? Very little.
7204000	7210000	But you're learning a lot, and I, you know, I think it's, I actually, I'm really glad we're getting these emails,
7210000	7215000	because I know you've talked a lot about the project, and you don't, I mean, with all due respect, you have nothing to show for it yet,
7215000	7219000	so it's just a lot of talk, right? Which is fine, which is fine. I mean, making games is hard,
7219000	7222000	but what I like about this is that you're also one of the more critical guys on the show.
7223000	7229000	So, it's nice for you to feel the pain a little bit, because I feel like it's going to bring a whole new perspective to some of the games you talk about in the future.
7229000	7234000	Well, I like, just, it gives me a better understanding of things, because I can look at something and see how they do it,
7234000	7238000	and kind of like, okay, that's, that's how they're doing this, or that's why they did it this way.
7238000	7243000	I love, too, that some of, like, our industry friends, like, people that actually do the game design stuff for a living,
7243000	7247000	like our buddy at Crystal Dynamics, Tim, was giving you advice on Twitter.
7247000	7254000	Yeah, yeah, I was at, well, because I was asking about, like, I was trying to get my shader to look a certain way,
7254000	7260000	and I was trying to figure out how something was, how to render something so it looked a certain way,
7260000	7268000	and, you know, you can't put that in the Google, you can't say, like, how do I render something to look like something like this,
7268000	7273000	and, you know, how it makes sense, you have, I didn't know the terminology for what I was looking for,
7273000	7280000	you know, to do a search on it, and it was ambient inclusion, which, sadly, I'm probably not going to be able to do,
7280000	7284000	because that's a UND Pro thing, and it's screen space.
7284000	7289000	But when you make all the oodles of money from this project, you'll be able to buy it for your next project.
7289000	7295000	Probably when I launch a Kickstarter, I'll be able to pay for that, but, you know, because unfortunately,
7295000	7301000	I'm probably going to do that just to pay for software, but not until it's almost done, of course.
7302000	7309000	But, yeah, I mean, once I, there's a lot of fees you gotta look for, you know, even starting a company,
7309000	7314000	and, like, registering trademarks, that's, like, about $1,000 in itself right there, and...
7314000	7316000	Yeah, VOC is a company now, you know that?
7316000	7317000	The taxes?
7317000	7318000	Yeah.
7318000	7320000	Yeah, well, have you registered a trademark for VOC?
7320000	7322000	I don't think, uh, I...
7322000	7323000	That's about $1,000.
7323000	7325000	That's a Bobby question, I don't, I don't...
7325000	7326000	I don't think you, yeah.
7326000	7328000	I don't think it is trademarked, actually.
7328000	7329000	I mean, it's trademarked...
7329000	7331000	That doesn't mean you're gonna, I will wreck you if you steal it.
7331000	7337000	Well, no, no, no, it's trademarked, because you can use it as a trademark, but it's not a registered trademark,
7337000	7338000	which is different.
7338000	7344000	So, yeah, I have to register a trademark for my company name, and for my, which I already have picked out,
7344000	7351000	and my game name, which I also already have picked out, and then, um, just, probably licensing music
7351000	7355000	is gonna be the hardest thing, because right now I've been working off of free Creative Commons music.
7355000	7358000	That's smart, though, to reach out to those artists directly, and, you know,
7358000	7360000	because a lot of them would just love the exposure, I mean...
7360000	7366000	Yeah, a lot of it's just Creative Commons music, and, and I have a weird, eclectic mix of music right now.
7366000	7367000	Alright, we're tangenting...
7367000	7368000	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
7368000	7370000	That's okay, there's another question here, too, that's the reason why I want to bring this back,
7370000	7374000	because the other question is, and you've kind of answered this already, but just if there's anything you want to add,
7374000	7376000	the other question from IngramAV98 is,
7376000	7381000	is it purely a passion project, or do you consider it a viable source for a trickle of income?
7381000	7386000	Um, well, it's definitely gonna be a trickle of income, and I think it can be a source of income,
7386000	7394000	it's just, probably the way I should have done it is done a bunch of really small projects first,
7394000	7395000	to have that income coming in.
7395000	7397000	Isn't that what Bobby told you to do?
7397000	7401000	Yeah, but the problem is, it's so boring, it's so boring.
7401000	7407000	Yes, I, no, his, his advice was to remake, like, Pong or something like that, and to learn how to use Unity.
7407000	7408000	I get that.
7408000	7414000	Which, that makes sense, and I have no problem knowing how to use Unity right now, that's okay,
7414000	7420000	but, like, to make small games, because the way that people make games on the App Store now,
7420000	7425000	it's like you make a game that people like, and they'll pay 99 cents to buy it or something,
7425000	7431000	or you make a bunch of free-to-play games, and you reskin the shit out of it, and you keep uploading it as a different game.
7431000	7435000	And yeah, that sounds kind of lame, but that's how you kind of make money,
7435000	7441000	because you got people to download it in order to get ad revenue, and even ad revenue is just not that great.
7441000	7447000	So, it's just small things so that you have stuff out there so you can make some sort of money.
7447000	7451000	But yeah, I'm hoping to make some sort of money. Is it going to replace my daytime job?
7451000	7454000	I hope it will, but I don't think it's going to.
7454000	7458000	Oh, you'll find out, because unfortunately we talked about a few weeks ago the whole layoff thing.
7458000	7462000	You're going to have a little time in between job hunting to work on this project, so.
7462000	7465000	Well, I have the kid at home, so I don't know if it's going to be that much time.
7465000	7466000	It's true, a full-time parent.
7466000	7469000	All right, anyhow, to finish out the email, that's it for now.
7469000	7471000	I'm sure I'll be back with more emails in the future.
7471000	7475000	Sorry I can't listen live, I did try a few times, but it's just too late for me.
7475000	7479000	I know you guys over there on the other side of the pond, it's too damn late for you guys,
7479000	7484000	but I mean, in order to do a show for you guys at the quote-unquote right time,
7484000	7487000	we'd have to be here at noon on a Sunday, which just kills the weekend, you know.
7487000	7490000	So, sorry guys, but that's why there's podcasts.
7490000	7491000	That's why you get into the podcast.
7491000	7495000	Oh, before I forget, the whole Xbox games with gold thing, I checked into it,
7495000	7498000	and you only have to say subscribe with Xbox One to keep your games.
7498000	7501000	For 360, you can still keep your games once you enter your subscription,
7501000	7503000	or at least that's what I read.
7503000	7505000	Last time you talked about it, the latter part was in question.
7505000	7506000	Cheers.
7506000	7508000	Hmm, well, I still have a subscription.
7508000	7511000	My 360 is still sitting over there unplugged.
7511000	7513000	Unplugged and unloved, unfortunately.
7513000	7519000	Unfortunately, I do have like, I still have like $60 worth of money on the Xbox account.
7519000	7521000	But I don't know what the fuck to buy.
7521000	7525000	I need that DLC for Rent of the Heart of Five to come out already.
7525000	7527000	All right.
7527000	7531000	Loki, I bet, before we get into our next story, we're talking about the mobile games and all that stuff,
7531000	7537000	I bet you wish you had thought up a Kim Kardashian Hollywood adventure, right?
7537000	7540000	Do you know how fucking big that game is?
7540000	7547000	That is like the new Farmville, Flappy Bird, this fucking Kim Kardashian Hollywood.
7547000	7555000	It's because it's a perfect center between, you know, trendy people like Kim Kardashian, so the player game,
7555000	7559000	and then there's people that hate Kim Kardashian and want to play the game that'd be ironically funny,
7559000	7561000	and then they end up getting addicted to it.
7561000	7565000	I remember at the last big E3 in 2006, Paris Hilton was hawking something like that.
7565000	7569000	Paris Hilton's Jules game, it was just like a bejeweled clone with Paris Hilton.
7569000	7573000	That did not take off for her like this fucking Kim Kardashian.
7573000	7576000	Well, it's because people are being ironically funny with it.
7576000	7579000	It'll blow over. Meanwhile, it only came out a couple weeks ago.
7579000	7583000	Yeah. Well, they already have clones out there on the marketplace too, of course.
7583000	7586000	We have clones of that. Who's the clone of?
7586000	7588000	Hollywood starlet or something like that is some clone.
7588000	7591000	Gilbert Gottfried's Hollywood starlet.
7591000	7594000	That I'd play. That I'd play.
7594000	7598000	I don't think you're good enough to be on the A-list yet.
7598000	7600000	You need to make some more movies.
7600000	7607000	I'm surprised they don't have, if we were going to see a clone, it would have been Kathy Griffin.
7607000	7610000	Kathy Griffin, life on the D-list.
7610000	7613000	No, that would be something, obviously.
7613000	7618000	All right. Speaking of life on the D-list, it's time to get to the FUs of the week,
7618000	7620000	because sometimes we're feeling pretty D-list.
7631000	7634000	This is fucked up.
7637000	7642000	It reminds me of when everybody was playing Sorority Light on Facebook. Remember that?
7642000	7644000	It was one of the first big Facebook games.
7644000	7646000	I try to block all those games on Facebook.
7646000	7650000	I seriously, the only time I've ever played a game on Facebook.
7650000	7653000	Well, I'm sorry. There's two times I've played games on Facebook.
7653000	7659000	Number one was to play the stupid duck game to get these explosive ducks in Crackdown 1.
7659000	7660000	That was the first one.
7660000	7666000	Number two was to play the stupid garage sale game for Ready Player One,
7666000	7669000	and I regret all that time spent on that game.
7669000	7671000	It was fucking terrible.
7671000	7675000	And had I known what the last challenge was, I wouldn't have even bothered.
7675000	7679000	I had friends that were hardcore in Sorority Life, like making spreadsheets and shit. It was crazy.
7679000	7681000	Anyway, sorry Loki, FUs of the week.
7683000	7686000	Actually, funny enough, it just reminded me of it.
7686000	7689000	FU to myself for my cut of that song.
7689000	7694000	Because in the very beginning there, it's actually a quote from the movie Punisher.
7694000	7701000	It cuts off because I couldn't get, like, it's like, I forget the lines.
7701000	7705000	Like, I am just as I am something I am, and it just didn't sound right.
7705000	7708000	But, yeah, so FU that.
7709000	7713000	My FU of the week goes to those fucking hiccups I had in the first half of the show.
7713000	7716000	My god, like, imagine somebody's listening to the show for the first time this week,
7716000	7722000	and they're like, who are these two amateur clowns? How have they not been cancelled after twelve years?
7722000	7727000	Because no one can cancel us! We're our own show! Who's gonna cancel us?
7727000	7729000	We're gonna make no money!
7729000	7731000	We'll show you cancellation.
7731000	7733000	What, we're gonna make less money?
7735000	7739000	That's right. I think I need to pay the bill to keep VOG running, by the way. I think that's due.
7739000	7743000	Alright, let's get back into some more gaming news.
7743000	7746000	And then your calls coming up in just a little bit, about five minutes away from your calls,
7746000	7749000	at 1-877-GAMO-LR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7749000	7751000	But first, Loki.
7751000	7754000	Speaking of less money, what's less than free?
7754000	7757000	Well, nothing. Unless they give you money.
7757000	7761000	But EA's not gonna give you money to play The Sims 2, but you can play it for free.
7761000	7766000	And the way you can do that, and this is by July 31st is when this runs out,
7766000	7772000	you can actually go on Origin and redeem a code that is for The Sims 2.
7772000	7775000	And I can't remember, it's like something, I love The Sims, or something.
7775000	7782000	Yeah, it's I love The Sims, and I-love-the-sims.
7782000	7787000	And it will redeem a free copy of The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection.
7787000	7792000	Now you may remember we talked a little bit about them giving out free copies for,
7792000	7795000	if you had an original copy of The Sims 2.
7795000	7800000	I don't think they wanted to deal with people calling them to redeem that,
7800000	7805000	so they just said, fuck it, you know what, we're gonna advertise this to kind of
7805000	7808000	get some interest for The Sims 4 that's coming out in a couple months.
7808000	7813000	So, The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection, for free, through Origin.
7813000	7818000	I love The Sims. That's what you have to put in, redeem product code.
7818000	7822000	Yes, you do have to install Origin, but you know what, I did it for Titanfall, so whatever.
7822000	7826000	Yeah, probably a lot of people have had to give up and install Origin.
7826000	7830000	And it wasn't as evil as I thought it was. But I'm not buying anything on that store.
7830000	7835000	But it's not like the devil on my computer or anything.
7835000	7840000	Yeah, Origin's not as awful as it was when it first came out.
7840000	7845000	They are giving away the free games, which does enhance its value a little bit,
7845000	7848000	but give you a reason to install it, but I don't know.
7849000	7853000	I'm still not like, ooh, this is a must-have thing. I'm always just kind of like,
7853000	7856000	why does everybody have to have their own fucking thing?
7856000	7859000	Like, why can't we just make a contract with another company?
7859000	7861000	Everybody's gotta have their own thing.
7861000	7864000	Everybody wants a piece of the pot and the money, but it's like,
7864000	7867000	can't we just have like three or four big ones?
7867000	7870000	You know what, though, I'm totally cool with them having their own thing.
7870000	7873000	Yeah, it's a little lame that they have games exclusive to it,
7873000	7876000	but at the same time, I'm glad they do have another storefront,
7876000	7879000	because it is more competition, which drives the prices down.
7879000	7882000	That is good, but you still have Dasura, GOG.
7882000	7886000	I mean, there are other, Humble Store now, there are other games.
7886000	7887000	Yeah.
7887000	7888000	Yeah.
7888000	7890000	All right.
7890000	7893000	Fifth Dream in chat says, game services are always awful
7893000	7895000	until people get tired of bitching about it.
7895000	7898000	Well, I also haven't tried to play Mass Effect multiplayer in a very long time,
7898000	7900000	and that's the thing that always pissed me off about Origin.
7900000	7904000	It was so redonkulous how Allen and I, being in the same house,
7904000	7908000	couldn't connect to multiplayer matches without waiting for Jupiter to be aligned
7908000	7910000	with the second moon of Saturn.
7910000	7915000	And the best part about The Sims 2 is they didn't remove pools,
7915000	7917000	and I think there are still babies in this.
7917000	7921000	Oh, yay, drown all the toddlers you want.
7921000	7923000	Well, you can't do that in The Sims 4.
7923000	7924000	There you go.
7924000	7926000	I'm not saying drown toddlers, but it's separate.
7926000	7928000	You have babies and drown the adults.
7928000	7930000	Kill everyone now.
7930000	7932000	Trap them in the walls.
7932000	7935000	One more story for you guys tonight, and probably a lot of you guys have seen this
7935000	7939000	making the rounds on Facebook and some other forms of social media
7939000	7942000	because it's given everybody a little case of the feels
7942000	7944000	that it has to do with video games.
7944000	7948000	And I think a lot of you guys have heard about this story
7948000	7952000	where a 16-year-old guy was playing his Xbox,
7952000	7957000	and his father had passed away about a decade ago when the son was four.
7957000	7961000	The dad had brought home a first-generation Xbox
7961000	7965000	so that they would play together as much as they could while the son was four.
7965000	7970000	Now, the Xbox is still something that works, and he's able to play.
7970000	7975000	So the son decided to bring up on the Xbox an old, old game called Rally Sport Challenge,
7975000	7978000	which was out in 2002.
7978000	7982000	And going through the menus and starting up the game, what did he find in the game?
7982000	7985000	His dad's racing ghost, essentially.
7985000	7992000	He was able to play with his dad again about ten years after he passed away.
7992000	7995000	Sorry for chopping onions over here, but I just thought,
7995000	7999000	you know, we always hear these stories about how video games are bad and all this.
7999000	8007000	I like stories like this, how, wow, video games can provide these really awesome moments like this,
8007000	8008000	thanks to the ghost data.
8008000	8009000	And would you think about it?
8009000	8011000	I bet a lot of you probably haven't played Rally Sport Challenge,
8011000	8015000	but a lot of you probably have played Mario Kart, which does something very similar.
8015000	8017000	Just imagine my ghost data.
8017000	8021000	My son races against my ghost data from Forza Horizon.
8021000	8023000	It crashes to the wall.
8023000	8025000	Up-turn crashes to the wall.
8025000	8030000	Up-turn crashes to the wall.
8030000	8031000	Yes.
8031000	8034000	What's also interesting, though, is that he realized as he was racing,
8034000	8039000	he could never beat his dad because if he passed the dad,
8039000	8041000	he would replace the ghost data with his own.
8041000	8044000	So he purposely loses every race so he could still play.
8044000	8047000	That's why you back up your data.
8047000	8048000	That's a good point.
8048000	8049000	Always back it up.
8049000	8051000	Hopefully he's done that by now.
8051000	8054000	As the story has made the rounds, I'm sure a lot of people will give advice.
8054000	8056000	You know, I saw a really similar thing like this on Facebook once.
8056000	8062000	I think it was a translated Korean cartoon or something that was about playing Animal Crossing.
8062000	8066000	And I think the person who had been playing it, their mom had passed away or something,
8066000	8069000	and they logged into Animal Crossing long after the fact and they got all these letters
8069000	8071000	because the mom was playing Animal Crossing hardcore
8071000	8075000	and sent all these letters every week that the kid never read until she was gone
8075000	8078000	and went back into Animal Crossing and saw all these letters and gifts and things.
8078000	8082000	It was just like this really like, you know, cries, sobbing.
8082000	8088000	I swear I've seen this exact same story, the racing thing,
8088000	8094000	several years ago that someone had a racing ghost and they did this.
8094000	8096000	I don't know. I swear I've seen this before.
8096000	8104000	Just think of it, you know, years after you're gone, Loki, Josh or Danny might find your old ZZT games.
8104000	8107000	Good, because I don't know where the fuck they are.
8107000	8111000	Or worse yet, episodes of this show.
8111000	8113000	More likely.
8113000	8116000	This is the legacy that we're leaving behind, Loki.
8116000	8118000	So this is why we're home every Sunday?
8118000	8122000	Daddy, why aren't you coming with us?
8122000	8126000	Why aren't you coming with us? I'm going to work, Josh.
8126000	8128000	That's what I tell him every week.
8128000	8129000	You call it work?
8129000	8133000	Well, I start calling it the radio show because his mom's like,
8133000	8136000	It's not work.
8136000	8138000	It's a hobby.
8138000	8142000	When you make money from it, then it's work.
8142000	8144000	All right.
8144000	8146000	There you go. That is it for our news tonight.
8146000	8148000	But that means we're going to open up the Skype line.
8148000	8152000	It's your turn to give us a call.
8152000	8154000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8154000	8156000	Feel free to give us a call. It is open.
8156000	8158000	And I'm not going to keep it open forever, though.
8158000	8161000	So if you want to get through, do it now.
8161000	8163000	Meanwhile, Loki, any last-minute stories?
8163000	8166000	I do want to bring up one thing, because I can't believe I didn't put it somewhere else in the show.
8166000	8171000	But I just realized out of Comic-Con, one of the other big, big things of a game that I used to be really into,
8171000	8174000	not so much anymore, but Warcraft.
8174000	8176000	Or World of Warcraft.
8176000	8182000	This movie, going back to the roots, Warcraft, they apparently did show a clip at Comic-Con of the movie.
8182000	8185000	Unfortunately, that one has not leaked to the internet.
8185000	8189000	All we got was a logo that, you know, I mean, it's whatever, it's a logo.
8189000	8193000	It doesn't look like the game's logo, OMG, but I kind of didn't expect it to.
8193000	8198000	Because, like, did Resident Evil's logo look like the game? No.
8198000	8200000	Did Mortal Kombats look like the game?
8200000	8204000	Have those movies even fucking followed the storyline of Resident Evil?
8204000	8207000	Because it doesn't make any goddamn sense now.
8207000	8213000	Alright, let's get on those phones, and Rama's saying we're not on Skype.
8213000	8215000	Yes, we are. Watch, I'll prove it.
8215000	8217000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8217000	8219000	Hi, this is Raginator.
8219000	8221000	Hey, Raginator, what's on your mind, buddy?
8221000	8228000	Uh, not a whole lot. There is one story that I found earlier that you guys have recovered.
8228000	8230000	I'll try to make it short and sweet.
8230000	8247000	Basically, later on, around October 18th, for 24 hours, you will be able to get paid the heist on Steam for free.
8247000	8249000	Wait, in October?
8249000	8252000	Yeah, specifically October 18th.
8252000	8255000	Why would they advertise it this far in advance, because now they're going to...
8255000	8256000	No one will remember.
8256000	8263000	Well, A, nobody's going to remember. B, they're not going to sell any copies of the game now until October, because everybody's going to be waiting for the free.
8263000	8272000	Yeah, well, I just discovered the story on another site.
8272000	8281000	Basically, what I'm saying is that there was some kind of movement on the Steam forums or whatever.
8282000	8294000	Where a whole bunch of people joined the A-Day 2 Steam group and, you know, like, petitioned that the original games would be free.
8294000	8310000	Basically, the publisher said, yeah, we'll make it free if a whole bunch of people will continue to join the A-Day 2 Steam group.
8310000	8317000	That's it? You just have to join the Steam group and you get a free game?
8317000	8328000	Yeah, I think they wanted to hit the 1.5 million member mark to get quote-unquote secret stuff.
8328000	8331000	Clearly, they've got another one in the works, clearly.
8331000	8339000	Yeah, but anyway, I think it's likely less of that to get the Bay Mask.
8339000	8354000	But anyway, yeah, just join the A-Day 2 Steam group and wait for October 18th for 24 hours only.
8354000	8358000	On October 18th, you can get the game for free.
8358000	8364000	Alright, well, I'm gonna help everybody out right now. So, get out your little phones, okay, and hold the button down.
8364000	8370000	And I'm gonna say, sorry Android users, I got nothing for you. But for iPhone users, here you go. Hold the button down. You ready?
8370000	8380000	Siri, set a reminder on October 18th to download Pay Day. It's free, y'all. There you go.
8380000	8387000	Yeah, I have no idea if the game's good or not, but you can't really argue with free, so...
8387000	8394000	That's right. Pay Day's not a series I'm very familiar with, but for free, I'll check it out.
8394000	8404000	Oh, yeah. Well, that's the only thing I really want to cover. You know, I'll book you or cover another story that I was gonna talk about.
8404000	8406000	Which was what, quickly?
8406000	8407000	Huh?
8407000	8408000	Which was what?
8409000	8416000	Actually, I forget what the story was. I think I linked it to you, but Logan took care of it.
8416000	8421000	Alright, well, good to know he's on top of things. Alright, I guess we can keep him around.
8421000	8425000	Alright, Raginator, we'll set that reminder on your calendar, alright?
8425000	8426000	Alright, have a good one.
8426000	8427000	Alright, you too, buddy.
8427000	8428000	Alright, bye-bye.
8428000	8434000	Bye. If it's free and it's on PC, Raginator's on it, everybody. He's on the case, so...
8434000	8446000	There was, actually, it was, I forget which game it was now, there's on Steam Greenlight right now, there's a game that used to be a PSP Japanese RPG that they're trying to get greenlit,
8446000	8455000	and if you vote for it, that you want it greenlit, and you post on their forums that you voted, they will send you a free copy.
8455000	8460000	A little gaming the system there, but free game, who cares?
8460000	8466000	Alright, we got another call. Maybe they'll talk about a free game, too, we'll see. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8466000	8470000	Well, the only free game I play are on my Android phone. Oh, hi, it's Rama.
8470000	8473000	Hi, Rama, it just wouldn't be a night on OLR without you. What's up, buddy?
8473000	8483000	Oh, the usual. I just want to get in about this whole San Diego Comic-Con thing, because you had asked earlier, why is SCCC getting all this gaming content?
8483000	8486000	Well, let's take a step back. Why don't you do Comic-Con?
8487000	8495000	Okay. I don't have enough blood in my body to get press passes for that. It used to be easy for New York Comic-Con.
8495000	8502000	Now, this time, you have to fill out a seven-page form in triplicate and put down the people you want as press.
8502000	8511000	When they approve your form, each person has filled that same form in triplicate and sent it in, and somewhere at the bottom, they ask for a vial of your blood.
8511000	8513000	This is why you need an intern.
8514000	8516000	I am the intern.
8516000	8518000	Fair enough.
8518000	8525000	It's got so bad that most of the local press outlets out here don't even go to New York Comic-Con for any money. Like, fuck it, it's not worth it.
8525000	8528000	R's got a real job, so I guess we have an opening.
8528000	8530000	Just give it the regenator.
8530000	8536000	Maybe. Maybe he's kind of working the free Steam games angle, at least.
8536000	8537000	I know.
8538000	8543000	He calls on the H.A.S. and tells us about the free anime that's available on iTunes and all that cool stuff.
8543000	8547000	There you go. Hey, you know what? Somebody's got to look out for all the free stuff. Sometimes it's hidden.
8547000	8549000	So what did you want to say about Comic-Con?
8549000	8556000	Well, the reason why I say it's getting all this gaming content is, I mean, think about it. It's right there in California.
8556000	8564000	All these gaming companies are right there, so it's pretty easy for them to travel there and set up their booths and advertise.
8564000	8576000	It's getting to the point where SDCC should be called SDEC, San Diego Entertainment-Con, because to be perfectly honest, when was the last time you heard anything comic-related come out of there?
8576000	8579000	Well, the Batman vs. Superman movie? Wonder Woman's outfit?
8579000	8582000	The movie's talking comic.
8582000	8586000	I get your point. I get your point. Here's food for thought, though.
8586000	8598000	I would argue, yeah, there's a lot of companies in Silicon Valley, and I always laugh at that whole thing where now they're talking about separating into six states, because it won't be in the same state anymore if that crap passes.
8598000	8607000	But all these companies in Silicon Valley, yeah, sure, it's easy for them, but very few of them went to GamerX, that's for sure, for having all those companies in the backyard.
8607000	8611000	But I guess that's a whole other Oprah. But there are a lot of companies everywhere.
8611000	8617000	I mean, you know, you got a few out back east that do the PAX East, right? In Boston, what, 2K and Harmonix and stuff.
8617000	8623000	And obviously Seattle, where PAX Prime is at, is like the stronghold of Nintendo and Microsoft.
8623000	8630000	So, you know, California doesn't get everybody. I mean, we got a good chunk. We got Sony here, but we don't got everybody.
8630000	8638000	I get that, but also, it's like Anime Expo, a lot of game companies were there, too, because out of the sheer convenience, you know?
8638000	8639000	Right.
8639000	8648000	And now Comic-Con is trying to pull a cease and desist, because another convention is calling themselves Comic-Con. They're like, we can't have that.
8648000	8651000	That's why registered trademarks are important.
8651000	8661000	Which means they're gonna piss off New York. Comic-Con, Baltimore Comic-Con, Boston Comic-Con, Philly Comic-Con, you get drafted.
8661000	8668000	There's a lot. There's a lot. BlackWolf in chat pointing out Austin, Texas has a lot of companies, too, hence PAX South being nearby.
8668000	8672000	Yeah, that's where Gearbox is located, right? So, yeah. There you go.
8672000	8678000	All right, Rama. Well, you know, it is awfully convenient for a lot of those companies to get over there. That is true.
8678000	8686000	But I just kind of feel like E3 is kind of the kickoff season where a lot of these companies kind of go around to different places and do various expos.
8686000	8696000	You know, not even necessarily E3. I mean, with Game Developers Conference and PAX East, there's plenty of employees at companies that do a lot, a lot, a lot of these expos.
8696000	8701000	Look at that. Shiller Games US Tour 2014.
8701000	8707000	Why not? Gotta sell something. All right, Rama. If there's nothing else, I'm gonna let you go, okay?
8707000	8710000	We have a surprise on Anime Jam Session. Tune in. You'll find out what it is.
8710000	8711000	Surprise?
8711000	8712000	Yep.
8712000	8715000	All right. I guess I like surprises.
8715000	8717000	Oh, you do. I know.
8717000	8719000	Am I gonna like this surprise?
8719000	8721000	Yes. Yes, you will.
8721000	8723000	All right. We'll check it out on Tuesday.
8723000	8724000	You got it, bro.
8724000	8725000	All right, later.
8725000	8726000	Later.
8726000	8731000	We'll see if we get one more call in. 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8731000	8736000	Loki, any last minute stories that you've discovered? I'll check Twitter. I don't think I saw anything coming on Twitter.
8736000	8740000	It got really ridiculous when I couldn't tell if this was just some sort of advertisement from GameStop.
8740000	8749000	But it's claiming that GameStop says that only half, fewer than half of their customers know that they can trade in games.
8749000	8750000	What?
8750000	8757000	Or know that they, I guess, I don't know if it's trading games or if it's trading in like phones and tablets.
8757000	8758000	Oh, okay.
8759000	8769000	No, no, no. Here's what it says. GameStop president Tony Bartell told VentureBeat that only 40% of the retailers' customers know they can trade in their old products for in-store credit or cash.
8769000	8774000	And he says even fewer know that they can trade in mobile devices like phones and tablets. I call bullshit. I don't believe that.
8774000	8775000	I don't believe that either.
8775000	8783000	I think that's just like a way that, did you know that you could trade in stuff and we give you really great value for your trades?
8783000	8785000	It sounds like it's just like an article as an advertisement.
8785000	8787000	It's something they tell you every time you're at the counter.
8787000	8793000	How do you not know? I mean, how would you not know? I mean, seriously. Can you not read?
8793000	8802000	Now, I would argue that more of GameStop's customers don't know that they could get more money from that game selling it on eBay or directly or somewhere else.
8802000	8808000	I'm pretty sure that everybody knows that. Like, where did they think those used games come from?
8808000	8812000	They just magically appeared. Poof.
8812000	8815000	They used GameFairy, brought more!
8815000	8820000	The wild last year's Madden approaches. What will you do?
8820000	8823000	They've run away.
8823000	8828000	All right. Nobody else is calling. Any other last minute stories you want to sneak in there?
8828000	8830000	That's all I had.
8830000	8834000	All right. Well, with no other calls coming in, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up.
8834000	8839000	We're a little early tonight, but that's okay with me being a little sniffly and Jamie not being here.
8839000	8843000	And clearly I'm one big cootie tonight because I keep hiccuping and all this stuff.
8843000	8846000	I think it's all right for us to go ahead and throw in the towel towel here just a little bit early.
8846000	8852000	But I don't want to wrap things up until I do remind everybody, you know, it isn't an indie show.
8852000	8854000	We don't make money off of it. All the joking that we do.
8854000	8859000	So if you do like our show, please help spread the word about Orange Laundry. Tell a friend or two about the show.
8859000	8863000	Help spread the word. And if you if you decided, you know, you got the whole way through this show.
8863000	8866000	Bless your heart. And you still thought it sucked. You know what?
8866000	8870000	Support other indie broadcasters because there's a lot of hardworking independent producers out there making content.
8870000	8873000	Please support our fellow indie podcasters.
8873000	8877000	That is about going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.
8877000	8880000	But first, I got to check in with everybody's final thoughts.
8880000	8882000	So, Loki, you have a final thought for us tonight?
8882000	8885000	I got to figure out how I'm going to squeeze in a haircut in tomorrow.
8885000	8890000	Because I got to do that before all my customers come out for our event.
8890000	8892000	Yeah, I'm way overdue for one too.
8892000	8896000	I meant to do it today, but then like my wife ended up leaving with Josh and them.
8896000	8902000	Usually I'll do it in like free time between, you know, when she leaves and when the show begins.
8902000	8907000	But she left with me like at four thirty and then she's like, oh, by the way, I need you to pack Josh's lunch.
8907000	8912000	And they need you to put the clean sheets on the bed because Danny peed all over the bed.
8912000	8919000	So, yeah, kids say it's all pee and poop with these things.
8919000	8923000	Literally, all babies do and children.
8923000	8926000	So, here's that. But I don't know. This week will be fun.
8926000	8931000	Alright. My final thought is I would like to stop having the snifflies and feel better.
8931000	8935000	K, thanks. And I'll try to be at 100 percent next week, you guys.
8935000	8938000	Thanks for getting through the show. I appreciate it.
8938000	8944000	And thanks to all you live folks that tune out or tune out, turn out and then tune out and listen to the show.
8944000	8948000	I really appreciate it. And also all our podcastees and the folks listening.
8948000	8952000	And I hope we helped get you through your workday or your commute this week.
8952000	8955000	So, that's it. We're done. We're out of here.
8955000	8960000	Until next time. Have a great week, everybody. And we'll see you next time here at Orange Lawn Radio.
8960000	8964000	Jamie will be back next week. Oh, also next week on the show. I believe next week is the day.
8964000	8966000	Oh, I got to confirm this real quick. Shoot, shoot.
8966000	8971000	I would say, Loki, buy me time. You already unplugged your mic, didn't you? You are out of here.
8971000	8973000	I didn't unplug my mic.
8973000	8976000	I want to confirm this for next week because I had a date on this.
8976000	8978000	It's a guest?
8978000	8983000	Yeah, we're going to have a guest here in studio and it is, yes, it's next week, August 3rd.
8983000	8990000	Our old friend from Orange Lawn Radio, explicit, or Jonas, will be here. Ran into him at Game Wrecks.
8990000	8994000	But will he be dressed up like an NDS or Wii Remote or something of that sort?
8994000	8998000	We're going to ask him and he's not going to be alone. He's bringing his little posse.
8998000	9001000	Maybe he'll bring you some games for us to play. I don't know because that's what they do.
9001000	9003000	They go around to anime conventions and set up games.
9003000	9007000	So, we're going to talk about, he's going to be doing that here locally for SAC Anime.
9007000	9011000	We'll talk about that and just kind of what all goes into making the game room.
9011000	9013000	So, we're going to talk about that next week. Very excited.
9013000	9016000	So, stay tuned guys. We'll see you next week here at Orange Lawn Radio. Good night.
9037000	9044000	Those of the staff of Orange Lawn Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
9046000	9048000	See you next week.
9067000	9077000	Thanks for watching!
