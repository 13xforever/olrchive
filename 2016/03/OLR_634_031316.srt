00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,720
This week, some new adventure MMOs are unlikely to see the light of day, while one classic

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,600
adventure game gets a patch to update its compatibility despite having a popular sequel.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,200
We're bringing you the details on these and the rest of the week's gaming news, and it

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,200
all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, March the 13th of 2016, episode number

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,360
634 of our show.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,360
That's right, been running since 2002.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,680
Myself here in studio, Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E,

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,600
and joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,440
Are you yourself the elf?

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,320
Uh, I think.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Is that a...

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Did you ever hear of herself the elf?

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
Uh, is that a band?

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,320
The 80s.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Is that like a 90s band?

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
It was the 80s.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Is that a goth-y band?

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
No, it was a cartoon.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,680
Did they open for Susie and the Banshees?

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,000
It was an 80s cartoon.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I see.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,880
No, I guess I'm behind on my 80s cartoons.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
I'm trying to think.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,920
I mean, there was a lot of 80s cartoons I liked, but probably, I don't know, my favorite

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,840
by far, Muppet Babies.

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
That was my jam.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
I watched that every day.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,000
I was a big fan of David the Gnome.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,680
I don't even know that one.

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
You don't know David the Gnome?

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
I don't think so.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm a visual person.

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I bet if you showed it to me, it'd be like, oh yeah, it is.

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,080
They had Tom Bosley as David the Gnome.

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh, maybe I did see that.

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,280
He had the big red hat, and they had the fox friend.

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,840
And then when they died, they turned into trees, and the fox cried.

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,480
Okay, I think I did see that.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Yes, I did.

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,600
But I was more raised on, I mean, I watched a lot of Nickelodeon.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,800
You Can't Do That on Television was my jam.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,520
Like that was required viewing.

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,160
The greatest thing Canada's ever given us besides Alanis Morissette.

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,400
However, Alanis Morissette, of course, was on You Can't Do That on Television.

48
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
For A season.

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
There you go.

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,480
For like two episodes, I think.

51
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,040
But anyway, then game shows was the big thing.

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,680
Like USA Network used to play game shows like nonstop all day.

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,800
The Scrabble game show and Supermarket Sweep, although I think that was a lifetime.

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,680
Rob decided he wanted to be what was his face from Press Your Luck to Markin.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Peter to Markin.

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Yeah.

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Right.

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
You decided you wanted to be him when you grew up.

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,480
Well, Bob Barker was always a personal inspiration of mine because the price is right.

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
He is very orange.

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
I saw the prices.

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,240
I think he's more orangy than Trump.

63
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
I'm sure.

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm sure.

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm sure at some point I've told this story on OLR, but I actually went to the prices

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,600
right in 2001 when you were blinded by the jacket.

67
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Yes.

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,840
When Barker was still hosting it and Rod Roddy, rest in peace, was still alive.

69
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,600
And we went to two tapings.

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,240
And for the second taping, we were sitting right behind Rod Roddy and the jacket was

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
sparkling in my face.

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Rest in peace.

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
He was a fantastic.

74
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,760
And Rob came back with a tan.

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm just sad I didn't get called up on stage, but oh, my God, we had we had been at Coachella.

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
The day before.

77
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
So I was exhausted.

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,600
Speaking, ironically, Susie and the Banshees, we saw Coachella.

79
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,720
So go figure that it was it was Susie and the Banshees, the Chemical Brothers and Bjork.

80
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Rob.

81
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
What?

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Peekaboo.

83
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
That's pretty much what it sounded like.

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,320
That was pretty much if you could kind of combine Susie and the Banshees and Bjork

85
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,480
into one thing, it would be that anyway.

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
Not joining us tonight.

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,040
Sadly, tech master, Loki, one of Loki's kids is really sick and sitting on his chair.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,720
So tech master Loki was afraid that he would bring the virus over here if he showed up.

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,960
So if you're out there, Loki listening, I hope you and the youngins feel better.

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,880
But filling in on a moment's notice tonight.

92
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Very appreciative.

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,200
He could step in the studio tonight.

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,800
All it took was a little bit of wine to bribe him.

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Say hello, everybody to Shane.

96
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Hello.

97
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
How are you?

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,200
Isn't it pronounced, pronounced Coachella?

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Not Coachella.

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I don't know.

101
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,080
Like, it's not a co it's coach Ella.

102
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,640
Yeah, because you don't put a co it on.

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
By the way, I thought of you.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
Or write a bow it.

105
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Really good.

106
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,240
Did somebody mispronounce something horribly and kinda what I was watching?

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
I was playing.

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,100
No, I was actually finishing up the danganronpa anime before I finished the game.

109
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,280
And there's like they do one big point because Xanadu and they did a second when he goes

110
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
back Xanadu.

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,800
I was like, Oh, that's like Rob.

112
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,120
Shut up.

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
So what?

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Anyway.

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,040
It made me think of you fondly, fondly.

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Yeah.

117
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Yeah.

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Watching people get murdered.

119
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
It was great.

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,400
Shana Linco here in the house to fill in for or I'm just I don't know why you still use

121
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
a link.

122
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,620
Oh, I thought you use both.

123
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,480
That's just all my Twitter because I don't put my last name even though it's in there

124
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
anyway.

125
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
So I should just I'll change it right now.

126
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Are you gonna change your Twitter handle?

127
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Sure.

128
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Why not?

129
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
All right.

130
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Whatever.

131
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Well, anyway, I don't know how I already gave up on this.

132
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,760
If you were going to follow Rob's theme, the OMG, you could be WTF.

133
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,760
No, I don't want to follow a Rob theme.

134
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Okay.

135
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,280
Well, yeah, I know I use I use the name OMG, it's Rob and certain things.

136
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,160
And I kind of joke that if Shane wanted to follow my footsteps, his appropriate name

137
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,200
would be whatever it's Shane.

138
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,520
Just like the the character from that game I'm going to sue for ripping me off.

139
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,440
Oh, the Stardew Valley?

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Yes.

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
We're talking about that in a little bit.

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,240
I swear to God, the guy that made Stardew Valley is an OLR fan because Shane is in

143
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
the game.

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I'm not in the game.

145
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
You're not in the game.

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Loki's not in the game.

147
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Shane is in the game.

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Like where to go.

149
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
One hundred percent.

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,500
It is me down to a T and his name is Shane.

151
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,240
So hey, that's the one that you were talking about when we were talking about cosplay,

152
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
right?

153
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
Yeah.

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,320
I was like, I should I could do that because all I would need is nothing because I it's

155
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
me.

156
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
All right.

157
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
All right.

158
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Well, hey.

159
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,840
So guy who made Stardew Valley, if you're out there, A, come on the show because you

160
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
made a great game.

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
I'll talk about it later.

162
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,280
But B, thanks for putting Shane in the game, but not the rest of us.

163
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,520
Just just, you know, maybe the guy who made Stardew Valley is a fan of Ranger Pride, which

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
is your podcast.

165
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
I doubt that.

166
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
That's OK.

167
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,160
Who would be a fan of that?

168
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,480
Everybody should.

169
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,840
Tell us quickly about Ranger Pride.

170
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,400
It's about Power Rangers and Super Sentai and we talk about news and episodes and we

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,480
have topics of the week and we have a fun time and it's super positive show and we have

172
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,000
a good time.

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,640
And Shane finally forced me to watch some Super Sentai earlier today.

174
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
It was great.

175
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
I was busy trying to prep for the show.

176
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,040
We were watching Ju-O-Jir.

177
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,960
I didn't see as much of it as Dark Sakura did, but it was I kept laughing at how, like,

178
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
silly it is.

179
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
But it is for kids.

180
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
I mean, it's not like, you know.

181
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Yes.

182
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
But it's still fun to watch.

183
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Yeah.

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,600
No, you get you when you when I asked you before and you gave the whole superhero analogy,

185
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,360
like some people are obsessed with Marvel Universe.

186
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Why can't I be obsessed with Power Rangers?

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Exactly.

188
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
That was a very good defense.

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,980
It is a good defense and that's my, like, easy defense to go to.

190
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,280
People are freaking the fuck out about five seconds of Spider-Man in a new trailer.

191
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,000
We went to the movies, me and Flacco Jones and Exfer and Flacco Jones' wife, last night

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,220
and saw 10 Cloverfield Lane and then they put the Civil War trailer on and Flacco Jones

193
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,260
and his wife were so excited, but it was the old trailer and there was no Spider-Man.

194
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,700
I was like, maybe the next trailer that comes up will have it.

195
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,180
It wasn't though.

196
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
They'll play both trailers.

197
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,180
Yes.

198
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
No, but the next one was X-Men.

199
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
So I was happy.

200
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
Oh, there you go.

201
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
All right.

202
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,140
Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight.

203
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,780
I do quickly, though, have to plug our chat room.

204
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,020
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

205
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,100
Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

206
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,580
Do tune in sometime for a live show if you never have before.

207
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,060
It's a different experience when you get to participate and join along in our chat room

208
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,060
over at live.vognetwork.com.

209
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
I'm exposing celebrities.

210
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,060
Are you...

211
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,780
You guys are talking about celebrities by one word because you're talking about Bjork

212
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
and now I see Cher.

213
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Yeah.

214
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,560
Because I said that Bjork probably just goes by Bjork because she's got a really long complicated

215
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,460
Icelandic family name or last name.

216
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,420
Well, it's not like you know a ton of people named Bjork.

217
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,060
Gudmund's daughter, which means that was her dad's name, is Gudmund.

218
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,100
But Cher's is Cherlyn's Sarkeesian.

219
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,700
But Cher is Cher, she'll always be just Cher.

220
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,420
Which by the way, can we talk about quickly because Daylight Savings Time happened last

221
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
night obviously.

222
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,980
So everybody was sharing on Facebook that image of Cher that said, don't forget, turn

223
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,260
back time this Saturday and tell your friends and I'm sitting there going, uh-uh.

224
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,980
Someone did a different version of it.

225
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I was like, no, no, no.

226
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,500
We don't turn back time.

227
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,940
This is turn forward time.

228
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,860
Or I would have gone with a picture of Cyndi Lauper and said this is the time after time.

229
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,980
Well, the people were reposting the Cher picture and it said, you idiots don't need to turn

230
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
back time.

231
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
It's spring forward.

232
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Now share this.

233
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,220
Anyhow, um, let's see.

234
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,660
And I see you are talking about your addiction with Don Gunropa in our chat.

235
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,860
Yes, because Don Gunropa, I came to the game late because I didn't own a PS, well I mean

236
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,200
I have a PSP somewhere in my house amongst all the stuff.

237
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,140
But when was the last time we ever touched that?

238
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,820
And I don't have a Vita, so I've missed out on Don Gunropa for a while.

239
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,020
And so when it came out to steam, I was super excited and of course I get super irritated

240
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,020
at it now.

241
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,100
I know it's not talking about my gaming weekend, but I have to get this out.

242
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Sure.

243
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Of course.

244
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Okay.

245
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,800
So I play with Japanese language and English, you know, text.

246
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,060
So what's so weird, and this is the annoying part of knowing enough about a language to

247
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:55,180
get the gist of what they're saying, is hearing the localization be completely bizarre.

248
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,340
Like there's a scene where they're talking about, well, where, first of all, they changed

249
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,020
genocide or show to genocide Jack for some stupid reason.

250
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,140
And then she's talking about like ramen and ramen, you know, how you have to choose the

251
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,240
noodles and everything.

252
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,820
And they're, instead change it to spaghetti, but they're talking about ramen.

253
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,900
And I hear ramen and I see spaghetti and my brain shuts down.

254
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,700
And I'm like, I can't even, I just need to learn to read Kanji.

255
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,380
Um, so that's been my, my annoyance with that game.

256
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Kids today know ramen, especially poor college kids.

257
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Definitely know ramen.

258
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,380
Exactly.

259
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,680
And I mean, it's not like we're, we're, you know, no one knew, you know, jack shit about

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Japanese culture.

261
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,620
It's pretty much a lot more common knowledge these days.

262
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
So I thought.

263
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,860
Back in my day, I remember at WinCo, you could get ramen for seven cents a thing.

264
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,420
And that was like, what, let me finish.

265
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Cause I'm annoyed.

266
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
I thought you were finished.

267
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Sorry.

268
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
I wasn't.

269
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
Fine.

270
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,860
Um, it's just, some of the localization is pretty clever, but the rest of it's just really

271
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
aggravating.

272
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,980
Um, so I don't want to say bad job localization team, you know, you did badly, but at the

273
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,180
same time I would like to, you know, have the video game companies behind these things,

274
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,780
give us some kind of credit, you know, and not think that we're total plebeians and don't

275
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
know anything.

276
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,860
Um, let's see, uh, Brad from pod cultures and chat saying about the ramen thing and

277
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,780
broke adults, you know, you're broke when you see six for a buck and go, Ooh, a sale.

278
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:36,060
But we know the difference between cheap ass, you know, cup of noodles and actual good ramen

279
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,780
that you get in a ramen shop.

280
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,420
And you know what, we've all fallen on tough times and had to do the ramen thing.

281
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,260
So, you know, it happens, but I also know, um, certain unnamed people that I may or may

282
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,300
not happen to live with will enjoy ramen as a snack as well.

283
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,340
Like just eating the, that's pretty good.

284
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
Yeah.

285
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
I know so many people do that.

286
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,900
I don't really make ramen burgers that way.

287
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,460
That's a big trend thing too, is making the, the buns out of noodles.

288
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,420
But anyway, look, we can talk about food, um, a ton, but we need to get into my smoothie.

289
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,460
We need to get into video games and, uh, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic

290
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,220
tonight, which is an interesting story that I've seen floating around Twitter that I wanted

291
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,860
to bring up on the show.

292
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,220
And I don't know, um, Shane, you watch a lot more Twitch than I do and have watched that

293
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
really evolve.

294
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
Right?

295
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,220
Well, yes and no.

296
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
How so?

297
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,820
Well, no, because we'll talk about it in my gaming week.

298
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,980
All right.

299
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,100
But yes, because I was watching a lot of Twitch.

300
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
All right.

301
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,100
I don't know if you know this particular Twitch streamer, but there is a Twitch streamer out

302
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,860
there and she went by Arah Gaming.

303
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,860
I hope I'm saying that right.

304
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
No, I don't.

305
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,020
I know the story you're about to say, but no, I never watched this person.

306
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,560
And unfortunately she, she had a divorce recently or, or fortunately, I don't know the circumstance,

307
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,980
but a divorce happened in that particular situation.

308
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,940
And you know, those are always, you know, tough situations, but things happen.

309
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,220
And what made this really weird and why this is suddenly going all around Twitter and even

310
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
ending up on our podcast.

311
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,980
And I feel really weird talking about somebody's personal life like this.

312
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,420
So I don't, I don't, you know, I don't know the details about what happens.

313
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
I want to get into that.

314
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,460
I want to keep it classy.

315
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:22,440
But what's fascinating about this is that it seems like Arah Gaming's husband got access

316
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,300
in the divorce to her social media accounts.

317
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,180
So he has the Twitter and the Twitch account.

318
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Isn't that illegal?

319
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:36,780
I, you would think, but apparently this is what's happening, is that somebody else showed

320
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:44,020
up on her Twitch stream, some other gal that wasn't her, like the stand in, I guess.

321
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,300
And you know, of course the first thing people are saying is, who's this stranger?

322
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Who's this?

323
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,540
And there's a little part of me, and again, I don't know any of these people involved.

324
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,980
I don't know the story and it's probably a mess that I don't want to know, but you almost

325
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,780
have to kind of feel like, what did that other girl agree to get herself into?

326
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,780
Does she know exactly what's happening and that she is the splendor?

327
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,180
Maybe he's treating this like a season.

328
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,620
So this season it's this chick on the channel and then when they get a divorce, season three

329
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,300
will start and we'll get a new chick.

330
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,520
But I mean, and it's not like it isn't completely obvious what's going on, but the new woman

331
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,520
will not talk about why she's commandeering the channel.

332
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,360
So, and I believe people are jumping to conclusions that the husband got the Twitch channel and

333
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,520
the settlement and so forth.

334
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,800
And the new streamer says she can't comment on it due to legal reasons, but ARA Gaming

335
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,580
decided to stop streaming and incorporate the channel so people can still enjoy some

336
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,280
of the gameplay while she's no longer streaming.

337
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,960
I guess the channel was sold by the original streamer, although ARA Gaming has not said

338
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,320
anything since the divorce, has not said a single thing, and with good reason, probably

339
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,520
has stayed radio silent on all of this because here we all are speculating on what the hell's

340
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
going on.

341
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,560
So now of course there's a Twitter hashtag, ARAgate, which is going on with this and somebody

342
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,280
claiming to be the husband, so we don't know if it is or not, went into the Twitch chat

343
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,560
and said that ARA Gaming will not be streaming for five years.

344
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:31,940
So I don't know how that happened, but something in this divorce settlement may have made her

345
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,480
unable to stream for five years.

346
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,320
It's crazy.

347
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,920
By the way, this isn't the first time dramatic things have happened on Twitch.

348
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,960
Drama things happen all the time.

349
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,480
But again, I don't want to get into this person's personal business because it's tacky, but

350
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,880
I find it fascinating the whole fact that somebody's Twitch channel is now essentially

351
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,600
something that has to be divided up in a divorce.

352
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,400
And part of me wonders, and again, rampant speculation.

353
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,240
I don't know anything going on here.

354
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,640
Was the Twitch channel part of the reason for the divorce, which is why she had to give

355
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
it up?

356
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,120
It's probably an asset issue.

357
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,280
It's a revenue generating asset.

358
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,560
You know, like I would probably say something along the lines of like book rights and things

359
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,400
like that, especially if you had a co-written book.

360
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
You know, what state is she in?

361
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,240
Are they California?

362
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,840
I honestly do not know off the top of my head and did not dig deep enough to figure it out.

363
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,720
I know for California and actually for a lot of states out there, if you don't have a prenup

364
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,760
for divorce, then assets are split 50-50 between spouses.

365
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,760
So it could be a legal divider that it is considered an asset.

366
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,200
Well, she had 30,000 subscribers.

367
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,480
That probably, I mean, that's not the largest Twitch channel, but it's a nice little chunk of

368
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,160
pocket change.

369
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,960
But you can't help but wonder, was the husband taking the channel just to be personal?

370
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,920
You know, and again, I feel a little tacky, but these are the questions we inevitably ask

371
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,440
ourselves when we don't have all the facts in front of us, because for whatever reason,

372
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,200
whether it's she's under a gag order or she just doesn't want to fucking acknowledge it

373
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,760
anymore, she's not commenting.

374
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,680
So we don't really have both sides of the story.

375
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:24,400
This is just sort of setting off every single spousal abuse trigger in my head.

376
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,200
You know, it's just sending off red flags.

377
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,360
And I think that it's nothing that we should be speculating on.

378
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
I don't know what the precedent is.

379
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,200
I don't know why.

380
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,200
And until we have that information, speculation, there's not really much that we can do.

381
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
We could also hope for the best, though, for her.

382
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,280
Maybe this is part of some sort of settlement.

383
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,760
And the trade off is, yeah, she can't stream and make that revenue, but maybe her ex-husband's

384
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,440
paying a nice chunk of change because of that.

385
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,280
Maybe he had to pay for it.

386
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
He could be paying taxes on revenue from it.

387
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,000
Potentially.

388
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,080
You know, and something, something to think about when Conan O'Brien got a divorce, haha, from

389
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:08,320
NBC, like, he was paid to not be on the air for, what was it, like six months?

390
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,360
That's why he went out on tour.

391
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
He did the live tour, remember?

392
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,760
And then the TBS thing started.

393
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,200
So, you know, five years seems like an awful long time, but maybe she'll be able to come back at

394
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,040
some point and maybe he's paying all the revenue in the long term.

395
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,600
Again, you know, I'm speculating, but I just, this is such a 2016 story.

396
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,080
Who would have thought, even five years ago, when we were broadcasting video of OLR on

397
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,760
Justin TV, that people would ever be fighting over the ownership of Twitch channels like this?

398
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't know.

399
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,400
Shane, since you watch a lot of Twitch, anything, any other comments or insight on this?

400
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,480
No, not at all.

401
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,560
I think it's, if she had viewers, I'm sorry that they can't watch her stream anymore if she was

402
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,040
awesome.

403
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,440
So, sucks for that.

404
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,560
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

405
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,440
Alan Alchemy says, I get that streaming is very lucrative, but wouldn't he just argue for more

406
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,920
alimony if she was the breadwinner?

407
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,040
And the meat and potatoes is her personality.

408
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,640
He can broadcast using her subs, but they'll drop like flies once they realize it's not her.

409
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,600
And then Kaijuto went into saying, register a new account, case closed.

410
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,480
And Alan Alchemy said, yeah, but if she hit a certain subscriber milestone, she'll have to rebuild it.

411
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,240
Well, I mean, you know, despite how awkward this situation is, it is getting her a lot of press.

412
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,840
And so if she were to suddenly come out and say, I have a new channel, she'd probably get this bulk of

413
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,680
the subscribers back and then some in a short timeframe.

414
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:38,760
I mean, that's just, that's just the reality of how this kind of like, you know, drive by looking at the,

415
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,240
you know, car accident that happened on the side of the road, looky-loo type of thing works.

416
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,960
Oh, no.

417
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,360
Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com also says, plus Twitch is such a shithole now anyway, so she's

418
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,040
better off.

419
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,600
She can start a playroom show on Ustream.

420
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,040
Is Twitch, is Twitch turning into a shithole, Shane?

421
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,800
Um, to be honest, again, without going into our gaming weeks yet, the last stuff I was watching on it was

422
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,480
just a lot of Until Dawn.

423
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,000
So I don't care for like the big streamers.

424
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,920
I've never watched the big streamers.

425
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,120
Like if you have like over 300 subs, I probably wouldn't be watching you.

426
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,320
But the little ones I liked still, I still thought they were great.

427
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,120
Yeah.

428
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,880
I like the more genuine reaction stuff.

429
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
Although I would certainly say personality goes a long way.

430
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,600
Yeah.

431
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,800
But the people that get like the thousands of subscriptions, those aren't the personalities usually I like.

432
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,640
Those are like the over the top, like making random noises, saying weird things.

433
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,000
People that will read the dialogue in an RPG in a crazy accent while they're in the RPG.

434
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,640
That's okay.

435
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
That's that can be okay.

436
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,800
I don't mind that so much because then I'm, it's like listening to a story on tape or something.

437
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,880
All right.

438
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,480
Anyhow, I just thought that would be an interesting thing to talk about because

439
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,280
I can't think of anything more modern in gaming than that fighting over the rights of a Twitch feed.

440
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,120
Let's get into our gaming weeks before we get into the rest of the news.

441
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,000
This week, we're going to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

442
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,720
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

443
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,240
I've been playing Danganronpa.

444
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,640
I've been playing Heroes of Dragon Age.

445
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,120
I've been ingressing and Neko Atsume and I saw something on Twitter the other day.

446
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,200
Somebody was making necklaces of cat butts from Neko Atsume.

447
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,280
And I was like, oh, Dark Sakura needs one of those.

448
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,600
Maybe I'll get it for you for your birthday.

449
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
You want a cat butt keychain?

450
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,680
No, thank you.

451
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,080
I have way too many keychains right now.

452
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
And I'm sad the portal one that you got me broke.

453
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,280
Oh, no.

454
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,440
Yeah, those plastic ones don't really hold up that long to my insane usage of keys.

455
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,720
Yeah, sadly, I think those types of things are more for show than actual use.

456
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,800
I had a Pokemon one that lit up, that thing got busted in a year.

457
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,720
I wore out one of my Togepis and thankfully I found another one in the package.

458
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,920
I just had it lying around.

459
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,800
And Dan and I were, well, mostly Dan, but Dan was playing like elevator action today and breaking out the nest stuff.

460
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,200
He took apart our Nintendo last night, took out the lock chip and cleaned it like completely inside and out.

461
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,080
Wow.

462
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,960
So that he wouldn't have to unbox one of our other ones.

463
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,880
That's still in the box.

464
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,400
Is that cleaning it so that you don't have to blow on the cartridge anymore?

465
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,440
Like cleaning the contacts so you don't have to do the whole thing.

466
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,440
But he also took out the lock chip, so it was just like the pirate lockout.

467
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:26,960
Right.

468
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,360
Yeah.

469
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,680
So I didn't know he knew how to do all that, but that doesn't surprise me at the same time.

470
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,000
He learned it on YouTube.

471
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
Of course.

472
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I watched him do it.

473
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
It was educational.

474
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,800
And then I went back to making my wine cork, uh, cork board.

475
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,480
Because Pinterest.

476
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,800
Do you actually use Pinterest?

477
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,760
I hate their website.

478
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:54,560
I actually use Pinterest for looking up, um, lately my thing has been, uh, medieval, um, instruments.

479
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,680
And Pinterest has actually been a pretty good source because I haven't found examples of certain ones.

480
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,440
So I'll just look through the various ones until I find the one that I want.

481
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,120
I can get the name of it and then I can search for it that way.

482
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,680
The only thing that bugs me about Pinterest is every time I go to their mobile site, something links me there.

483
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,240
It's like, download the app right now.

484
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,320
Download it, do it, do it.

485
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,800
It's just like, Oh my God, some of those, some of the mobile ads and some of those sites are horrendous.

486
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:26,480
I hate the ones that will automatically, like you go to the page and it's like, opens up the app store and it's like, get Candy Crush, Soda, Saga, Supreme, King Commander right now.

487
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
And I'm like, fuck off.

488
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,000
I will never download your game.

489
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,520
Block.

490
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Report it for spam.

491
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,960
But I've, I've been using it more only on my computer.

492
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,640
I don't use it on my phone at all.

493
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,440
Well, that works.

494
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,480
All right.

495
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,240
Well, if that's it for Dark Soccer's gaming week, Shane, you said you had an interesting story here for your gaming week.

496
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,720
No, I didn't say it was interesting.

497
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,080
All right.

498
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,400
Well, what is, what is your gaming week?

499
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,800
I don't have a gaming week.

500
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,960
I quit playing video games for now.

501
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,720
Okay, wait a minute.

502
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,000
So you quit playing video games?

503
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,320
Why?

504
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,760
Yes.

505
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,680
Cause I don't know.

506
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,920
I, I seriously, all I did was watch some random movie on Netflix and afterwards I was like, I'm going to stop eating meat and quit playing video games.

507
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,840
And it didn't have anything to do with the movie whatsoever.

508
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
And that's just how it's been since then.

509
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I haven't touched a single game, not like an iPhone game or an iPad game or a handheld game or a computer game or a console game.

510
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,360
Nothing.

511
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,440
So what the hell are you doing on a video game podcast?

512
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,080
Laying on a couch and playing on my iPad, but not a game.

513
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,640
Just looking on the internet.

514
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:35,360
Well, the way you'd phrased it to me earlier, which I was hoping you'd repeat was, was that you're not like, just because you're not playing video games doesn't mean you hate it.

515
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,880
That's true.

516
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,600
All my only websites I know to go to still are video game websites.

517
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,760
So I still read about video games.

518
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,200
I just don't play them.

519
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,720
And I canceled all my pre-orders except for one.

520
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,760
I kept my No Man's Sky collector's edition just in case.

521
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,880
And we know, uh, when Pokemon comes out, I will definitely be playing games at that point.

522
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,920
But, uh, until I figure out what I want to do about this, there's no video games.

523
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,320
What do you mean by what you want to do?

524
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:17,080
Like, I was kind of toying with the idea of maybe just, like, playing games at, like, a very, um, reduced, like, I don't know what the next word I want to say.

525
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,880
Like, I would want to play them less.

526
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,760
So maybe, like, only allow myself to play, like, three hours a week or something stupid like that.

527
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,680
And not for any particular reason, but I just think there's maybe more to do out there than just play video games.

528
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,440
Do you think you were addicted to video games?

529
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,560
And so this is something where you're like-

530
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,960
No, because I really have not been playing video games a lot lately anyway.

531
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,640
This is just, like, like, I was already at playing maybe, like, five hours a week at the most.

532
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,080
And I was just like, eh, lazy.

533
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,360
I don't want to play games now, so I just won't.

534
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
So what are you doing instead?

535
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
What do you do with the time that you-

536
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,600
Living life.

537
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,160
Yes.

538
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,600
And by living life, Hulu.

539
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,320
Well, yeah, I-

540
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,960
Okay, but to be fair, hold on, I've got to raj you on this, because how is that any different?

541
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,800
That's what I was going to say.

542
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,800
It's really not different, but it's really not different.

543
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,480
But it's just, in my head, it's kind of different.

544
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:19,400
So once I figure out what I want to really do with this time, then there'll be less Hulu.

545
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,920
But I just need to figure out what I want to do.

546
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,000
Like, I want to go out and do something instead.

547
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:30,240
I don't want to just, like, sit there and watch Hulu or Netflix or Amazon Prime or anything like that for hours.

548
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,520
I want to go out and do something.

549
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,160
And if I play video games so much, then I can't do that.

550
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
And if I watch Hulu so much, I can't do that.

551
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,880
So that's why everything's kind of just, like, taking a backseat or falling off a cliff and being gone.

552
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,440
Having known Shane, because some of you might be like, why the hell is he on this show if he doesn't play video games?

553
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,840
Because-

554
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,520
But I have, and, you know, just up until this week did.

555
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,080
Well, and also, like, you know, like you said, you still stay on tap with what's doing, what's going on in the community and everything.

556
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,560
And for me, just knowing Shane as long as I have, Shane is very much the type of person where he's either all in or he's all out.

557
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,440
Yes, yep, that's how it is.

558
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,160
When Shane says, I need to play less video games-

559
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,960
That means zero.

560
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,840
The only way he knows physically how to accomplish that is saying to himself, I need to play no video games.

561
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,800
Yep. That's just how I did, like, soda.

562
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,960
It's like, I need to drink less soda.

563
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,280
So what I do? Cold turkey'd it.

564
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,080
I need to eat less Taco Bell. What do I do? Cold turkey'd it.

565
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,000
I need to play less video games. What do I do? Cold turkey'd it.

566
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,400
But you're eating Del Taco right now.

567
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,880
That is not Taco Bell.

568
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,040
But it won't last forever.

569
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,080
It's already gone. I already ate it.

570
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,800
But it's- I mean, it's the same thing.

571
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,120
You're banned from Taco Bell. I'm sorry, Del Taco is the same thing.

572
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

573
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,400
The Taco Bell thing was just because I ate it too much.

574
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,400
So if Del Taco becomes a problem, then I have to eat less of it, which means cold turkey.

575
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,640
Yeah, but Sunday night during OLR, we always eat like shit.

576
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,760
So, well, yeah, I was just like, what am I going to eat?

577
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,680
I think I ate very healthy, thank you.

578
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,120
All right. I apologize.

579
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,720
And since like once in a while, she eats shit too.

580
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Once in a while.

581
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,840
Since I gave up meat, it's like, what am I really going to do?

582
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,400
Like, I have to find these alternatives and sometimes they're not the best alternatives.

583
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,840
So whatever. My gaming week is nothing.

584
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,960
The end.

585
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,280
Oh, except that, you know, my gaming week does involve apparently me farming and

586
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,000
working at a Wal-Mart type store in a video game that ripped off my likeness.

587
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,560
I feel like video games are just something you gave up for Lent, like in 40 days.

588
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,160
Maybe.

589
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,480
Maybe when Easter happens.

590
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,760
No, it might not even be 40 days, because again, I'm playing with the idea of can I

591
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,200
maybe do like three hours a week and hold myself to it?

592
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,040
Probably.

593
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,600
There's going to be something that comes out.

594
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,720
No, well, I just got Twilight Princess that came out last Friday and I was loving the

595
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,640
heck out of it.

596
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
And then, you know, this happens.

597
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm like, I just want to play Twilight Princess, but I'm not letting myself at all.

598
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,200
And it sucks because I just did my absolute favorite dungeon in that game, which is the

599
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,600
one where you get the spinner, which is the best item in any Zelda game ever and has the

600
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,320
best boss fight because it's basically Jet Set Radio.

601
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,920
And I can't play beyond that now.

602
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,120
That's it.

603
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,680
Why don't you tell yourself, like, OK, if I go all day without eating meat or Taco Bell,

604
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,640
then that's one hour of video game I can play.

605
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Or if I...

606
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,000
Because I will be like, oh, it's only an hour.

607
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Maybe I'll just push another 30 minutes and then it'll be, oh, I've already done an hour

608
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,080
or three.

609
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,360
Why don't I do three hours?

610
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,200
Somebody needs an app or something that starts yelling at him once the hour is up or something

611
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,080
where, like, if I go to the gym for 30 minutes, then I can play 90 minutes of Twilight

612
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,840
Princess or something.

613
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,480
I don't know.

614
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,320
No, it doesn't work.

615
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,680
All in or all out.

616
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,560
That's the chain way.

617
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,440
That is my way.

618
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,680
Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love eating turkey, but I gave it up.

619
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,480
I went cold turkey on the turkey.

620
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,800
Oh, and like, dark meat turkey is really good, too.

621
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,720
You know what, though, I keep telling Shane that when he plays video games again, he needs

622
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
to play the game with me.

623
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,680
He needs to play Dungannormpa because it's great.

624
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,720
Hey, Bobby Black Wolf has a decent suggestion, Shane, for how you can force yourself to only

625
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,480
play a certain amount of time.

626
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,880
Bobby Black Wolf says, use the parental controls on the consoles.

627
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,320
Oh, no, because then I will unlock it because I'll have the parental control.

628
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
What if I had the parental control?

629
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,400
Do you really want me to bug you until you give it to me?

630
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,720
I kind of love this idea.

631
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,080
Do you want me to come over in the middle of the night and smash your windows because you

632
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
wouldn't give me the code?

633
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,240
Because that's a thing that could happen.

634
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,800
We have a guard cat.

635
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,160
Come on.

636
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,080
No, you know better.

637
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,960
Or do I know better or do you know better?

638
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,720
I will have half the code and Dark Sakura will have the other half of the code.

639
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,680
And then that's the only way it's going to be unlocked.

640
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,400
There are, I think Bobby had a good idea there.

641
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,640
No.

642
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,920
My first idea was just to leave my video game systems at different people's houses.

643
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,280
Do that.

644
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,440
I was like, I'm stronger than that.

645
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,480
I still want to borrow your Vita TV when I want to play Danganronpa too.

646
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,840
I know.

647
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,040
Now I'm like, I want you to bring your video games over.

648
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,520
My, my whole thing when I said, I don't understand why you're doing this is because you, you

649
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,360
weren't able to tell me what you were going to do instead.

650
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,960
You were like, I'm going to stop playing video games.

651
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I'm like, so you don't really have to have something to do instead.

652
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,480
I just didn't want you to sit around on the couch.

653
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,880
I could teach you how to knit, Shane.

654
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,920
No, that's scary.

655
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,680
Uh, SSG, SSG 100.

656
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,360
Matt says, yes, please do this.

657
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
I want this to happen and recorded.

658
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,240
I don't know about that.

659
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,720
What?

660
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,960
The breaking his windows?

661
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,640
No, I think that's what he's talking about.

662
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,320
So Bobby Blackwell is offering up a new YouTube video series on VoG network.

663
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,960
It can be like that show.

664
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,720
What the hell is that horrible game show?

665
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,200
It was on the reality channel where they were in solid solitary.

666
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,040
So did you say it was a horrible show and that's the best show and you would just, it's

667
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,400
like a reality solitary.

668
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,760
Okay.

669
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,320
Then great.

670
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,920
Since you love it so much, you it's like you're on it.

671
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,480
God, I can't even talk to you right now.

672
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,280
I'm going to break your windows for real, but you have to go without games.

673
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,360
Do I get a voice?

674
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
That's awesome.

675
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,160
That will make fun of me up on the wall.

676
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,480
Yes, but it's just Jamie.

677
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,200
Solitary was so good.

678
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,080
Jamie gets to be the glados role.

679
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,680
I'm so upset now that we brought up solitary cause it's like my favorite game show.

680
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,520
Oh my God.

681
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,520
Um, bonds double 06 and chat says, Shane, like every teenage male said about quitting

682
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,400
porn, I can quit, but I have to quit cold Turkey.

683
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,440
Well, okay.

684
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,880
Shane's not talking crazy.

685
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Shane didn't ever say he was going to give up porn.

686
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,400
I said video games and that's what he is.

687
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,160
That's why he won't tell me what he replaced it with.

688
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,200
He just replaced it with more porn.

689
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,680
That's that's what it ended up being.

690
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,320
He's like, you know what?

691
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,120
I don't have enough porn.

692
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,680
Uh, act deaf to chat says Shane holding off on something.

693
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,560
I seriously want to see how long it goes.

694
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,840
Uh, well like soda has been like two years now, so I don't push me because if you

695
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,840
think like I'm one of those people that you tell me not to do something, I'll do

696
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,080
it and like, do it tenfold.

697
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,440
What's the saying 99 cent of everything I do.

698
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,920
99% of everything I do is motivated by spite.

699
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,560
That's 174% of everything I do.

700
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,200
All right.

701
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,560
Tiger con chat says the only way Shane will ever play a video game is if they put

702
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,120
porn on it.

703
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
Um, absolutely not even true.

704
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,920
Absolutely.

705
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,080
If they make a dyno charger.

706
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,880
Oh God.

707
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,240
Yeah.

708
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,840
If Jason Riley were on it and he can make chase and Riley make out, that's it.

709
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,960
It's over.

710
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,480
It's over.

711
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:25,960
I windows.

712
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,720
I will do.

713
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,280
Yeah, I'll smash them out of excitement either way.

714
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,960
Your windows need to be replaced soon.

715
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,200
All right.

716
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,440
Um, my gaming week.

717
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,360
So, uh, I've played a few things this week.

718
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,960
Uh, one new game that I played this week, actually a listener was kind enough to buy

719
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,480
this for me.

720
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,640
So I just want to, I give a shout out, you know who you are and thank you for giving

721
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,360
this to me as a gift.

722
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,920
Cause it was a game I was gender genuinely curious about anyway, because

723
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,040
Shane started talking to me about it one day.

724
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,640
He's like, so did you hear about this new game?

725
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,920
It's like the new Minecraft or five nights at Freddy's.

726
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,640
It's the new.

727
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,240
I said it was the new, um, that other game I've never played Undertale.

728
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,600
Okay.

729
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,440
It's, but it's the new indie sensation game, right?

730
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,200
He says it's called Stardew Valley.

731
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,480
And I said, I don't know anything about it.

732
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,760
Uh, and what you said, it was like animal crossing and harvest moon or something like

733
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:14,920
that.

734
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,240
Right.

735
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,480
So I was like, all right, well then I looked up the steam page and I put it on my

736
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,800
wishlist and I swear, not even like two hours later, I get a message on Twitter.

737
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,000
That's like, Hey, I, there's this game you need to play.

738
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,280
You need to play and I want to get it for you because I know you'll like it and it's

739
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,040
right up your alley.

740
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,480
And I was just kind of like, okay, well, I didn't know what the game was at that

741
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,160
point. But then when I saw what it was, I was like, okay, this is funny.

742
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,640
Cause I had just put it on my wishlist two hours before.

743
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,720
And yes, I do want to try this.

744
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,360
Okay.

745
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,680
So Stardew Valley, it's a new game that just came out on steam like one or two

746
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,080
weeks ago.

747
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,440
Right.

748
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,360
And yeah, it's, it's similar to harvest moon, but also kind of Minecraft.

749
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,840
I really feel like Stardew Valley in a way is Minecraft for people that hate

750
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,480
Minecraft.

751
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,920
I think that's one of the best ways to describe it because you, you're not in

752
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,440
that whole weird first person thing and you're not having to break the bricks.

753
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,480
It's, it's totally different.

754
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,240
You are on a farm and you have similar types of tools to what you'd have in

755
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,720
Minecraft.

756
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,120
You have a pickaxe, a shovel, a hoe, and those are all things for killing

757
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,720
somebody and burying the body, which you can probably do in Stardew Valley.

758
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,600
I just haven't got there yet.

759
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,120
So you, you can clean up your farm and then you can start to bury little plant

760
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,160
seeds and stuff and grow plants.

761
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,280
There's a town nearby and you start to get to know the villagers and I guess you

762
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,080
can romance the villagers.

763
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,000
Although there is one particular villager who like, well, when you try to talk to

764
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,360
him is like, I don't want to talk to you.

765
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm very busy, you know, type of thing.

766
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,480
And his name is Shane.

767
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,320
And he's rude and rude.

768
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:54,800
He had, until today, he had my hair cut and he only wears blue and I saw

769
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,120
wearing brown actually.

770
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,320
Well, he wears like shorts and a hoodie.

771
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,400
That's what I do.

772
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,440
It's, it's ridiculous.

773
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,200
It's me.

774
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,480
But you can't romance Shane.

775
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,640
But I was reading some weird, uh, online article where the guy was actually

776
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,080
talking, the guy who created the game and I'm sorry, I forget his name in the

777
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,600
moment, but, um, the guy, it was all created by one guy, which is really

778
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,040
impressive.

779
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,760
Um, and the guy actually said, yeah, I want to work on some free updates and

780
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,000
items and people keep asking me to make Shane romanceable.

781
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,080
So that's one thing I'm going to add into the game.

782
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,920
Um, and so I was like, okay, that's super awkward, but that is the thing that I

783
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,440
guess they're going to actually put in the game.

784
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,720
Um, I, I am so, I'm still trying to learn about this game that I can't figure out

785
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,240
how to romance anybody yet.

786
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,520
I, my understanding is there's no, like they do the cool thing where whoever your

787
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,000
character is can romance anybody that is romanceable.

788
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
There's, you know, there's five guys and five girls.

789
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,120
Yeah.

790
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,080
There's no gender provisions or anything like that.

791
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,160
And there's a lot of customizability with your characters.

792
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,200
That's why the game doesn't really care about that, which is cool.

793
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Um, but, uh, here's the thing about the game is that yet again, it's one of those

794
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,400
games like Minecraft, when it first came out, that doesn't really handhold you an

795
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,000
awful lot.

796
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,960
Like it doesn't really tell you a lot about what to do now, granted you do get

797
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,320
quests to go talk to villagers, you get quests to do plants.

798
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,040
So it does kind of give you little like hints and things, but like there's other

799
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,640
like things that I would think would be critically important that the game doesn't

800
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,320
really explain very well to you.

801
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:35,120
Things like you have an energy bar and if you don't eat, you will faint or you will,

802
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,680
you know, like other things will happen.

803
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,800
And I don't know, like it's, it's kind of hard to figure out like, okay, well, how

804
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
do I continue stocking myself with food?

805
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,280
And I've just basically gotten to the point where it's like, okay, if my energy

806
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,560
meter's done for the day, what did I do?

807
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,960
I think I, I think I dug through the garbage and found something to eat, but in

808
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,200
what, on the other hand, that's part of what's really cool about the game is that

809
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,840
it is so open because it doesn't tell you what to do.

810
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,640
I kind of think that's the point.

811
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,880
I think the guy who made it wants to see what people come up with and how people,

812
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,400
you know, um, experience and, and get over the certain challenges in the game.

813
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,120
And I think that's why this game is so popular right now because it's incredibly

814
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,320
popular on live streams.

815
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,200
He also said that there's like hidden stuff that nobody's figured out yet and he's

816
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,960
not going to talk about it either.

817
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,280
And the game does go beyond just having the farm.

818
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,440
You can end up doing fishing.

819
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,840
There's a mine that you go into later.

820
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,280
I heard it's very, just like Animal Crossing slash Harvest Moon.

821
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,080
That's what the game is.

822
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,680
It really is.

823
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,760
But I actually find, I don't know, I never really got into Harvest Moon, but I'm

824
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,840
enjoying what I've playing a Stardew Valley so far.

825
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,240
I just feel like, and this is kind of like my, my OCD coming in to play a little bit.

826
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,280
I keep feeling like I'm playing the game wrong.

827
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,880
I keep feeling like I'm going to die.

828
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,800
I'm going to lose.

829
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,960
I'm not doing this right.

830
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,880
And I have to kind of remind myself at some point, there is no right or wrong way

831
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,280
to be playing this, but it's just, it's a weird hurdle for me to get over.

832
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,800
Does it make sense?

833
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,280
What I'm saying?

834
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,480
No, it doesn't.

835
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,200
I'm sorry.

836
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,160
No, whatever.

837
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,040
There's a, I've seen on a video game site that you don't like to talk about, but I'll

838
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,640
say anyway, Kotaku, um, they have like tips for playing it.

839
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,600
Maybe you should check it out if you really feel like you're doing something wrong.

840
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,080
Well, maybe, maybe I will look into that.

841
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,480
Who knows?

842
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,280
Um, let's see.

843
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,120
I was seeing if anybody in chat was commenting on this, but no, they're still

844
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,280
talking about the window breaking.

845
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,240
Uh, see, they're really into it.

846
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,840
I think this is what should happen.

847
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,600
There should be a poll.

848
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Can you put a poll up on VoG and see how many windows they want me to break?

849
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,760
No, I will not.

850
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,880
Also house or car?

851
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,840
What?

852
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,760
House windows or car windows?

853
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,320
Which ones?

854
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,080
Well, both.

855
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,800
This is the house is a rental.

856
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,320
My car is covered by my insurance.

857
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,240
So I guess the car.

858
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,680
No, no, no, no, no windows.

859
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,240
They get to pick.

860
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,800
They're the ones into this idea.

861
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,800
Stop it.

862
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,160
Anyway.

863
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,320
Um, so Stardew Valley, I played a little bit of that and it's, it's really kind of

864
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
addicting in, in a Minecraft kind of way.

865
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,920
And I will be playing more of that.

866
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,680
So thanks again.

867
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,040
Um, I never expect money or gifts or whatever from doing this show.

868
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,840
It's a really flattering thing when a listener spends their harder money to buy

869
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
something just because they think I'd get a kick out of it.

870
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,720
So I really appreciate that.

871
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,200
Um, also in my gaming week, I played a little bit of Tron run R because I had

872
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,400
yet to play the full game once they released it on steam and here's the

873
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,560
hilarious thing about Tron run R.

874
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,160
It crashes my computer.

875
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,480
I think that's great.

876
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,280
I can play the first level fine.

877
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,120
And then the second level crash.

878
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,640
Have you updated like your graphics?

879
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,640
I just updated my graphics drivers last night.

880
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,360
So I'm going to try it again, probably after the show tonight and see if it

881
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,240
still crashes on me.

882
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,160
Cause isn't it coming to console?

883
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,000
So too, it is already on console.

884
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,960
Why don't you just pick it up there?

885
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,560
Unless it's going to crash again.

886
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,320
But then yeah, you do.

887
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,840
It's Tron.

888
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,440
It is Tron.

889
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,920
If you support Tron, maybe they'll make another movie.

890
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,560
Maybe there's an achievement in the game called Tron three.

891
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
And I was like, is the achievement for getting that achievement.

892
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,120
LOL.

893
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,840
Just kidding.

894
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,160
No, I don't.

895
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,800
I, what was it?

896
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,560
Oh, you have to get like a combo through the entire stage or something

897
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,640
and you get that achievement.

898
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,160
I just, I randomly got that on the first stage cause I'd played the game before.

899
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,800
So I, I knew what I was doing.

900
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,880
So Alan alchemy and chat says, wow, that's impressive because

901
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,280
your computer is rock solid.

902
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:21,880
Alan.

903
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,640
It just means I need a video card upgrade.

904
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,720
Like we've been talking about, even though my video cards only, what a year

905
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,760
old, it's time to get the video card.

906
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,000
That'll run the Oculus.

907
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Don't you want me to have it?

908
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,880
Uh, so yeah, I, I tried to play a little bit of Tron run R and, uh, that

909
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,640
didn't go so well.

910
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,600
So instead I went to the PlayStation four and I was like, Oh, what can I

911
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,920
download?

912
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,720
What can I check out?

913
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,200
And my buddy extra for that hosts a show with me called guys on a show.

914
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,080
Also here at vog network.com has been pimping a game for ever that

915
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,440
he really, really, really loves.

916
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,400
And so I decided to check this game out, even though I played Rayman legends.

917
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,200
No, it was not, I played that, but not this week.

918
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,800
Uh, I played it at E3 like two years ago.

919
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,880
It was a while ago on the PS four.

920
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,200
And then I played it on PC a little bit.

921
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,120
The game is assault Android cactus, and it was one of the games that was, you

922
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,240
could vote for it to be free, but unfortunately it didn't win because it

923
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,960
was up against a game called bro force.

924
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,160
There was no way anything was going to win against that.

925
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,440
Yeah.

926
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,080
Which is kinda, which is kinda sucky.

927
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,760
Cause I'll tell you what I've played both.

928
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,960
And I think assault Android cactus is kind of a more interesting game.

929
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,600
Sorry, bro.

930
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,400
Bro force.

931
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Wasn't that bad though.

932
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,000
I, I haven't been into it.

933
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,880
I couldn't get into it.

934
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,640
Like some of the over the top stuff.

935
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,880
I was like, Oh, that's funny.

936
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,080
But like assault Android cactus kind of had me right from the get go because

937
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,520
it's, it's a twin stick shooter type of game.

938
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,320
But it has some different sorts of mechanics.

939
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,040
Like, you know, I could say like, Oh, it's like geometry wars, but it's

940
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,240
really nothing like it, like at its core where you have the two sticks move

941
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,000
and shoot smash TVS type of game.

942
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,080
Yeah, I guess it's that, but you can switch weapons midway through.

943
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,920
And there's actually, you have to think when you switch weapons, there's

944
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,160
going to be time to do that.

945
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,520
So you don't want to get yourself in a corner.

946
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,720
Uh, there's power ups and the level design is kind of interesting because

947
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,600
some levels the lights will go out.

948
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,360
So the only way you can see is the monsters that are around.

949
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,600
Some levels have conveyor belts, which is really weird.

950
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,720
Like, uh, you might have like a giant wheel and then the middle wheel is

951
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,880
spinning, so you kind of have to keep that in mind as the levels going.

952
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,520
So sounds kind of unfair, but that's mean that's part of it.

953
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,680
That's part of the challenge.

954
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,280
So they can't just all be nice square little stages.

955
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,880
So yeah, I I've been having fun with this all Android cactus.

956
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,560
I think that's kind of a neat game and it does the whole thing like Spelunky

957
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,200
does, where like there's a daily challenge that you can play and see

958
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,560
how you rank against your friends.

959
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,960
And there's like an endless mode.

960
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,840
So, um, yeah, I I've been having fun with this all Android cactus.

961
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,880
So I didn't play it a lot, a lot, but I played it enough to know that I enjoy it.

962
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,560
So, uh, that'll probably do it for my gaming week.

963
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,600
I think that's all I need to say.

964
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,200
So, um, I want to get into some housekeeping real quick.

965
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,640
Uh, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R we're also on Facebook,

966
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,120
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

967
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,760
Uh, we will not be having a show in a few weeks.

968
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,920
It's April 3rd, just so you know, no live show, April 3rd, I'll be out of town.

969
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,080
Uh, but we will be back the next week on April 10th and on April 9th, we will be

970
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,960
at the Sacramento, uh, indie game, indie gaming arcade, uh, and, um, looking to

971
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,880
try and get Bree and Gabe back on the show in the next couple of weeks to tell

972
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,320
us a little more about this year's event.

973
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,000
I know they have a nice bigger space.

974
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,880
It's going to be a lot of fun.

975
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,360
So, uh, we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks when they come back onto the

976
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:37,640
show.

977
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,960
Um, otherwise we will still be here through the coming weeks.

978
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,760
Uh, one other thing I want to mention over at vog network.com, of course, where

979
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,840
this show is and broadcast live on Sunday night, uh, over at vog network.com, our

980
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,920
pal Bobby Black Wolf, who does the show right before us here on Sunday nights,

981
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,400
he just posted a cool little video, uh, over at vog network, uh, on our YouTube

982
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,760
account.

983
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,600
And then it's also there on the main page.

984
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,360
Um, that was his little road trip to magfest.

985
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:11,480
He actually drove from Atlanta to Washington, DC, but he actually kind of

986
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,400
now has, has, has come out as a Tesla owner.

987
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,760
Basically, it was kind of keeping it a secret for a little while.

988
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,320
Uh, but he actually has mentioned now, uh, everybody knows he has a Tesla.

989
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,160
And so when you have an all electric vehicle like that, you don't stop at a

990
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,480
gas station to get gas.

991
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,280
When you have a very long drive, you do this whole little thing where you stop

992
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,200
at superchargers.

993
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,120
Uh, so he actually planned his route and he did a really good job with this video.

994
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,640
It's like an hour long, so it's almost like a bit of a documentary, but I got to

995
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,840
say, and I'm not just saying this because I know Bobby and he's my friend and I

996
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,000
like to promote his stuff because if it wasn't good, I probably just would have

997
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,120
mentioned it and ended it there.

998
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,880
But it actually is really good because, uh, he actually explains it at a level

999
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,600
like a lot of the Tesla stuff he was showing me before was like at a level for

1000
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,520
people that already owned the vehicles and already kind of know that stuff.

1001
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,320
But Bobby kind of phrased it in a way where if you don't really know anything

1002
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,800
about what being a Tesla owner is like or how the electric cars are very different

1003
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,120
from the gas cars, he kind of explains all that and really breaks it down.

1004
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,560
So I thought it was a good little like kind of entry level.

1005
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:19,040
Like if you're curious, like why are those cars so damn expensive and, and what

1006
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,120
is that all about?

1007
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,240
Why are people so into it?

1008
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,280
I think Bobby does a really good job explaining that and framing it in the

1009
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,440
video game text of the fact that it was a road trip to go to magfest.

1010
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,320
And if you get to the end of the documentary, he does have a cool little,

1011
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,800
um, kind of montage.

1012
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,120
Cause you know, it's not a movie without a montage.

1013
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,600
So he has a fun little montage of the end.

1014
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,160
There are some of the stuff at magfest.

1015
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,120
So I check that out.

1016
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,280
It's over on the vog network, YouTube, or you can see that on the main page.

1017
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,920
Uh, vog network.com.

1018
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,400
Um, act deft and chat says, uh, hopefully like black Wolf said, the cars get

1019
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,400
cheaper with time.

1020
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,640
Uh, and Nintendo maniac 64 is in our chat room.

1021
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,600
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

1022
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,760
Live.vognetwork.com and says, um, I decided to check in and funny thing

1023
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,800
about Tesla, I've been following Tesla for longer than OLR.

1024
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,600
So if anyone needs another Tesla expert, I'm here.

1025
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,240
Well, Nintendo maniac, you definitely should go check out Bobby's documentary

1026
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,480
and let them know your feedback.

1027
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,400
I've been studying Tesla since I was a little kid.

1028
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,760
Because Nikola Tesla was really awesome and Edison stole his shit.

1029
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,280
Yes.

1030
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,160
So, yes.

1031
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,960
Uh, I was, Hey, uh, I actually rode in Bobby's car.

1032
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,920
Uh, he picked me up at the airport for, um, dragon con last year.

1033
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,240
And so we, we went on a little trip and I got to say, I was like, wow, I

1034
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,720
can see why these are cool.

1035
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,200
And I kind of want one.

1036
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,040
It's going to be a little while before I can get a couple of folks at my, um, at

1037
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,880
my work, have them in the parking lot.

1038
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,880
So I've gotten to stare at them.

1039
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,560
They're nice.

1040
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,120
They're nice cars.

1041
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,720
I mean, and as this electric thing gets more and more and more, I think we're

1042
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,880
going to see more competition, which will be a good thing.

1043
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,360
It drives the price down and competition drives the industry.

1044
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,760
So it's, I think it's gonna be fascinating in a few years.

1045
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,880
Anyway, I don't want to spend too much more time on that.

1046
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,720
Cause it is a video game show, but, uh, Bobby did a great job and

1047
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,080
it's worth the kudos over there.

1048
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,440
So, um, let's get into some gaming news, some video game stuff.

1049
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,160
Uh, Shane filling in for Loki this week and to start us off tonight.

1050
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,240
But then I have to stop watching this video of adorable puppies that are

1051
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,760
like huddled up and look, then they get, they all run away.

1052
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:19,760
Okay.

1053
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,280
A it's horrible radio.

1054
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,080
When you describe a video, uh, well, let me hold it up to the

1055
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,920
microphone so they can see.

1056
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,800
Why don't you just pause it, read the story, and then you can go back to it.

1057
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,640
That's not as fun.

1058
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,520
That was so cute.

1059
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,560
Anyway, let's talk about other cute things like, um, just that I play games.

1060
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,600
It's just like, I do nickel.

1061
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,000
That's amazing.

1062
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,640
What are you talking about?

1063
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,120
So another cute thing, just like those puppies is that lion's head, uh, studios

1064
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,080
is probably closing down and fable legends got canceled.

1065
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,200
How is that cute?

1066
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,320
I don't know, but I'm sure there's something cute about that.

1067
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,000
No, I don't think there's anything cute about that.

1068
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,920
It's cute in the, Oh, that's cute.

1069
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,360
Yeah.

1070
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,720
Um, so basically a statement was made on the Xbox site, uh, saying after much

1071
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,800
consideration, we have decided to cease development on fable legends and are in

1072
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,800
discussions with the employees about the proposed closure of lion head studios in

1073
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,880
the UK.

1074
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,600
So no more fable, I guess.

1075
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,440
It's not a flagship for Microsoft anymore unless they move it to another studio.

1076
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,080
Yeah.

1077
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,280
But I think what, this is the third, this was to be the third fable game since the

1078
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,880
numbered series and it's the third fable game.

1079
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,960
I don't think a lot of people were really excited for.

1080
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:36,920
Well, I, I think maybe going away from the mainline series was a mistake in a way.

1081
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,960
I mean, fable three wasn't as well received as fable two.

1082
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,280
Well, the first half was.

1083
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,480
The first half of fable three was super well received and then the second half

1084
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:44,960
happened.

1085
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,320
True.

1086
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:51,320
Um, I just kind of think that they should have tried to do another fable game

1087
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,240
because the problem with the games that came after fable is that they weren't

1088
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,160
really fable games.

1089
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,000
Remember that?

1090
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,480
Remember, I don't even remember the name of it.

1091
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,200
It was the connect fable game and they had to sit there until they were blue in the

1092
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,560
face going, it's not on rails.

1093
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,760
Um, it wasn't really that good of a game.

1094
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,080
I didn't even realize that there was like a beta for fable legends.

1095
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,040
That's how much that fables not on my radar and I'm guessing it's probably not

1096
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,520
on a lot of people's anymore.

1097
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,880
So it's really sad that they're possibly closing down.

1098
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,520
Um, it looks like they also kind of announced that a Danish developer press

1099
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,360
play, uh, the team that did, uh, max, the curse of the brotherhood is also being

1100
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,760
shuttered.

1101
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,440
Like that one's a hundred percent sure.

1102
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,560
So, uh, not a good time to be a Microsoft, uh, first party studio.

1103
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,280
Rare.

1104
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,000
You hear that?

1105
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,160
That the shuttering noise is your future.

1106
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,560
Trouble.

1107
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:41,840
Really?

1108
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,560
Oh, I think so.

1109
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,560
What, what have they done?

1110
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,560
They don't do killer instinct.

1111
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,040
The rare anniversary pack was their thing, I guess.

1112
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,680
That's basically a glorified Xbox live arcade on a disc.

1113
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,880
Um, they did do, I didn't, they do the conquer, uh, hollow lens stuff that like

1114
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,520
people like threw up when they saw it because it was so awful.

1115
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
No, I don't know.

1116
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:03,960
Maybe.

1117
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,440
I think they did that too, but I mean.

1118
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,720
They just, they're the next ones to go.

1119
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,240
What if rare is getting fable?

1120
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,560
That could be interesting.

1121
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,800
That would be interesting.

1122
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,280
I mean, again, I feel kind of tacky though.

1123
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,680
Like, you know, like obviously people were impacted jobs.

1124
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,000
Yeah.

1125
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,840
But just, just like all the time, Peter Molyneux left though, to do his, his

1126
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,960
what's in the cube crap and all this other weird stuff that also is terrible, but he

1127
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,880
kind of, it's, it seems like he left them hanging.

1128
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,560
I get this, I get this weird feeling.

1129
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,040
I think he left them hanging while he was still there.

1130
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,960
So, um, no, but the thing about, you know, these studio closures is that when

1131
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,440
everyone gets announced, you go to Twitter or you go to like LinkedIn, you've got

1132
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,960
all these other companies that are supportive of these people that have just

1133
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,000
lost their jobs and like, Hey, we have spots open, come apply for us.

1134
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,920
So it sucks that the studio closed down, but I don't think that the talented people

1135
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,440
there won't find work elsewhere at a place not owned by Microsoft.

1136
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,560
Therefore probably not going to be closed.

1137
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,120
Microsoft is the new, new EA.

1138
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,040
Well, I hope they do a fable for one way or another.

1139
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,760
Like I really think they should attempt another fable game.

1140
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,200
I really do.

1141
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,000
Like not a spinoff game, a real fable game in the same game.

1142
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,200
Who would you want to do it though?

1143
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,320
Let's just say not rare because again, they're next to be closed.

1144
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,160
Shit.

1145
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,720
I don't know.

1146
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,280
Um, and it's going to have to be Microsoft first party.

1147
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,760
Who do they have left?

1148
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,120
They have the people that do Alan Wake.

1149
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,880
I think that's first party, but they're doing quantum break right now.

1150
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,040
Halo, uh, three, four, three.

1151
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,400
I think they need to just worry about halo.

1152
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,600
Yeah.

1153
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,720
Then that is probably exactly what they're doing.

1154
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,600
Um, and then who else do they have?

1155
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,760
Now's not a good time to ask me after I've been drinking.

1156
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,840
You wouldn't have known the answer anyway, so it's fine.

1157
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,960
I don't know who else they have either, but, um,

1158
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,960
SSJ100 Matt says, who does Forza?

1159
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,960
Oh, I want to play car fable.

1160
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,840
Uh, well, I, I can answer who does fable.

1161
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,560
It's a under Microsoft studios.

1162
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,720
No, that's Forza.

1163
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,880
That's not fable.

1164
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,760
Try reading it again.

1165
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,800
Playground games.

1166
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,240
Okay.

1167
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,520
Well, some of it, no, cause somebody in chat says, no, but you said I can tell you who does fable.

1168
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,160
Oh, sorry.

1169
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,120
I meant Forza.

1170
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,240
Cause you're drunk.

1171
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,280
And Bobby Black Wolf says, uh, turn 10 and playground does horizon.

1172
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,800
Oh, excuse me.

1173
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,880
A Forza horizon was what I was looking at over there.

1174
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,560
So, well, maybe they could do it.

1175
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,920
And I prefer horizon to the regular Forza series anyway.

1176
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,680
So if they do do car fable, as long as I can kick a chicken with my car.

1177
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,560
All right.

1178
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,680
Now you're just getting silly.

1179
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,840
Uh, but that was the best part of fable one.

1180
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,240
When I played the demo of it was kicking chickens.

1181
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,680
Good luck to those affected people.

1182
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,240
And I really hope something can happen.

1183
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,080
Maybe it's not a hundred percent sure that they're going to shutter lion heads still, but it is.

1184
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,360
Can I do, can I do one tinfoil hat thing before I go on to the next story?

1185
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,880
Cause it wouldn't be an episode of OLR if I didn't break out the tinfoil at some point.

1186
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,120
Okay.

1187
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,600
You ready?

1188
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,320
So let's say this studio closes.

1189
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:14,360
What's to stop somebody else from coming in and funding the company to reopen and make games for them?

1190
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,440
Such as, Oh, I don't know.

1191
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,440
Sony.

1192
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:24,960
Now, not that I'm saying fable four is going to be on the PlayStation, but what about a Fable-esque game?

1193
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,800
They can totally do that, but I don't think the chances are very likely.

1194
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,280
Yeah.

1195
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,320
They would have to know the demand is there and I'm not totally sure it is after the last three fable games.

1196
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,640
I mean, I just don't think.

1197
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,280
I have this weird feeling.

1198
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,480
Nintendo would be more interested in that, but at the same time, they've got legend of Zelda and that's close enough.

1199
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,560
Yeah, I guess.

1200
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:46,920
Yeah.

1201
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,120
I mean, they're not very similar, but if you put them side by side, I think people would be like, Oh, they kind of look similar enough.

1202
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,920
Yeah, I guess.

1203
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,000
All right.

1204
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,360
Well, it was, it was worth a tinfoil hat.

1205
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,760
Was it edited out?

1206
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,280
No, I'm not going to edit it out.

1207
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:02,800
It's live.

1208
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,040
All right.

1209
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,280
Uh, let's move on.

1210
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,320
So a followup to something we talked about last week.

1211
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:22,760
So, um, do you remember last week on the show, we had talked about a very interesting rumor about the fact that beyond good and evil two may be getting the Bayonetta two type of treatment.

1212
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:31,960
But on the NX, meaning that Nintendo is funding beyond good and evil two, hypothetically, allegedly for these rumors, uh, to be an NX exclusive.

1213
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,000
And while many of us said, Oh, okay, you know, rumor, LOL.

1214
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,960
Wouldn't that be interesting?

1215
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:45,720
But then very interesting development this week, Ubisoft asked Destructoid, the original source of the story to remove that story.

1216
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,280
And what happens when that happens?

1217
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,440
Your tinfoil hat goes back on.

1218
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,000
Yes.

1219
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,360
It's something we call the Streisand effect, which I'm, I've never heard of that.

1220
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,680
You never heard of the Streisand effect?

1221
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:07,560
No, it was, um, where there were, uh, there was a picture of her house on some website somewhere and she didn't want people to know where she lived.

1222
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:15,760
So her lawyers requested that the picture get taken down and it only caused the picture to go everywhere on the internet.

1223
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,360
The type of thing where it's like, when you try to hide it, it just shines a giant spotlight on it.

1224
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,160
That's, that's what the Streisand effect is.

1225
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:28,680
So, um, and I really abbreviated that story, but you know, I'm a couple glasses in at this point.

1226
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,400
Um, so anyway, now that Ubisoft has come out and said, please take that story down.

1227
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,840
It kind of lends credence to the fact that it's true.

1228
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,520
Uh, so we'll see.

1229
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,520
I'm just saying we here at OLR have experienced something like that firsthand.

1230
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:54,360
And I'll let those of you who were around in 2006 fill in the gaps on what, uh, what that all meant.

1231
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,560
Meanwhile, why don't we go to another story, Dar Sakura.

1232
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,760
Well, I have to thank Reginator for this one.

1233
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:09,520
Um, there is a browser run NES emulator, except it's not just any NES emulator.

1234
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,400
It runs them in a kind of 3D.

1235
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,960
It's kind of weird.

1236
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,360
It's called 3Dness.

1237
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,640
Um, it's not perfect.

1238
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:32,520
I think it's still kind of beta right now, but, um, it basically has like any kind of surface, like a walking surface and a wall have a 3D effect to it.

1239
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:41,440
Um, now the, the sprites themselves, like the, uh, you know, character sprites and, you know, like one of the examples was the pills in Dr. Mario.

1240
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,680
Those are really flat kind of Parappa-ish, but it's kind of, kind of interesting.

1241
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,200
And yeah, it runs, um, actually only in Firefox, but it runs.

1242
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,600
Um, some people have speculated as to what makes it run.

1243
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:03,680
Um, but I think that the end goal is that there's going to be, uh, an executable version of that later on for everybody.

1244
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,640
It gave me a bit of a headache watching it because, yeah, it's okay.

1245
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:19,400
It's one of those things where it's like, it's a really neat concept, but, um, and yeah, going to our chat over at live.fognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says it perfectly.

1246
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,320
The 3D looks cool, but it's not practical.

1247
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,920
Uh, Dartitsuya says, I've seen videos of that on YouTube.

1248
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:30,840
It still looks a little bit rough in spots, but I'll forgive them for still being in early stages, but it's a neat effect.

1249
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:39,080
I mean, if you want to see, like, I was just looking through the little video on that again, and one of the bad ones, at least as far as the splash screen was Contra.

1250
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:44,720
The Mega Man ones look pretty neat, you know, it's just got like an odd shadow effect to it.

1251
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:54,880
And then it's, I think what it does is that it takes the side parts of the layers and the top parts of them and sort of extends them back like an image.

1252
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,240
It looks okay, but it just is kind of disruptive.

1253
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,000
And when I watch it, it makes my, my head hurt more.

1254
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,040
Bobby will love me for this comment.

1255
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:12,440
Maybe it's to help 8-bit games be easily ported into the Oculus Rift by adding that 3D element.

1256
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,800
Okay, here's another weird one is Super Mario 3.

1257
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:23,040
This one's really kind of screwed up because Mario runs behind the bushes and everything.

1258
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:32,080
And then like the ones that you can actually do the drop down behind, like the white one, he actually shows up behind it.

1259
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:37,400
It's just really an odd effect for the way that this turns out for the emulation.

1260
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,880
Like the clouds are kind of drifting backwards.

1261
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:53,400
I'll put it this way, this effect only really works for, I would say just block images and not any of the rounded sprites or graphic effects.

1262
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:04,320
You know, what might be an interesting use of this is that when you look at the YouTubes and stuff, it kind of goes, it goes like full throttle with these effects.

1263
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:09,120
And maybe subtlety is the key to make this a really awesome effect.

1264
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:19,520
And what I'm thinking of is, you know how on the 3DS, you have the pictures that you collect the puzzle pieces right on StreetPass, and you make these pictures.

1265
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:34,880
And when you unlock the pictures, they're in 3D, but they have a very subtle effect that if you actually use the control pad, you can tilt it a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right, up and down, but not like crazy, like 360 degrees and all this stuff.

1266
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:43,480
Maybe it'd be kind of cool, like for any defect that maybe like with the tilt or a little bit, it would do a very slight tilt in the 3D or something.

1267
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,880
But again, how practical is that? I don't know. It's more one of those like, cool, now turn it off.

1268
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,360
Well, it looks like it's a blanket effect that tries to apply it to everything.

1269
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,560
And I don't think it's got any sort of way of...

1270
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,120
Actually, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think that it's extending the surfaces into the into the background.

1271
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,640
I think it's extending them into the foreground.

1272
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:17,960
So that's why when you see a character walk around something that might be kind of a separate layer, it's actually having him go behind it when it tries to apply the effect.

1273
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:24,680
Yeah, I think this is like a blanket effect that's supposed to be doing the whole thing, but it doesn't quite work for everything.

1274
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,840
So just saying.

1275
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,960
OK, well, we'll see, you know, this is probably going to be one of those things.

1276
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,240
It's like, oh, it's really cool.

1277
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,040
But then, you know, we probably won't see a lot of practical use for it.

1278
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,200
But, you know, I'll link video of it to the chat room.

1279
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,640
Just because it's not necessarily practical doesn't mean this guy hasn't had a heck of an achievement with it.

1280
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,800
And I think that's that's a really cool kind of tech thing to show that he can do it.

1281
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:59,840
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, actdeftinchat says, I prefer what the 3D classic games on the Nintendo 3DS do or what Shovel Knight on the 3DS does.

1282
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:06,720
Yeah, I like I like the classic games on the 3DS too, just with the very subtle like the planes are just on different levels.

1283
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,120
I think that's that's cool.

1284
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,240
So it's it's interesting if this might automate a little more of that.

1285
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,200
But anyway, let's move on.

1286
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:15,680
All right.

1287
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:32,480
So if you remember that show you guys did after PlayStation Experience, one of the games I raved about and probably my game of the show, if it wasn't for like ResVR, was Thumper, which is a rhythm violence game.

1288
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,320
And it's amazing.

1289
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,320
And there was a PlayStation blog about it this past week.

1290
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,160
And it's coming to PSVR.

1291
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,000
And that is so cool.

1292
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:54,360
So now there are at least two games for PSVR that are worth your time and it can still be played in 2D on PS4 or if you get PSVR, it's going to be in full 3D.

1293
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,720
And that just makes me super excited for this game.

1294
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,720
And I love Thumper and it's so much fun.

1295
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,560
Apparently at Best Buy, it's on the demos.

1296
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,760
They're kiosks.

1297
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,000
I had no idea until I just read about it.

1298
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:15,880
So everybody should go out to your local Best Buy and try it out and see if you like it, especially if you're a fan of rhythm games, because that's what it is.

1299
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,520
It's just a rhythm game that's really intense.

1300
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:27,160
So since you've played Thumper and since you've had time on the PlayStation VR, obviously you didn't get to do both because it was an announcer there.

1301
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:27,320
Yeah.

1302
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:31,280
But do you think Thumper is a game that will work well in VR?

1303
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:31,840
Yes.

1304
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:39,400
Do you think it's a game that's going to translate into VR and will be given something additional from the VR?

1305
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,800
I'm not sure if it'll be given something additional.

1306
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,080
I think it may be the preferred way to play.

1307
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:53,640
It was actually a question I asked the guy at the booth was if it was going to come to PSVR and he said he wasn't sure at that time.

1308
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,960
Clearly he was a liar because there's no way this just started happening.

1309
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,120
But I think it's going to be a lot more fun in VR.

1310
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:12,880
However, if you have like a really nice sound system for your entertainment setup, that may be the better way to go because the music, I mean, it's all about musical cues for the rhythm aspects of this game.

1311
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,320
So like the better you can hear it, probably the more you'll get out of it.

1312
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,560
But I would want to play it in VR.

1313
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,120
I think that'd just be way too much fun.

1314
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:27,360
So even though you're on a game hiatus, I can still be super hyped for an awesome game like Thumper.

1315
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,360
But do you think PlayStation VR is going to break you?

1316
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:35,840
No, because I'm pretty sure Pokemon Sun and Moon will be out before PSVR.

1317
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,960
Well, we'll know this. We're getting the answer this week.

1318
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,680
We are?

1319
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,760
On PlayStation VR, yeah. Isn't GDC this week?

1320
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,240
But did they say they're going to announce the date?

1321
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,560
Well, PlayStation is doing a VR press conference, basically.

1322
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:54,760
So and we know it's about VR, so I'm not sure what else there is to announce, especially since they said.

1323
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,280
I know they just announced Thumper.

1324
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:56,960
So what else?

1325
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,000
I mean...

1326
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,600
Date and price. Call me crazy, but that would be...

1327
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,280
Crazy.

1328
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,720
All right. Well, I am crazy for a little game on my cell phone called Ingress.

1329
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,040
And I'm really excited that the same company is making a game called Pokemon Go.

1330
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,720
And I'm really, really excited to check this out.

1331
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,800
But what's weird is that Niantic actually backed out of GDC to do a panel there.

1332
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,200
And we've talked about that before.

1333
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:28,440
But what did come up this week is that they are going to be doing a beta test for Pokemon Go.

1334
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,280
A legit one.

1335
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,240
Not one of the spam things you see online that's trying to get your personal information.

1336
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,680
But Niantic has actually announced a legitimate one.

1337
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,400
And you have to have an Android or an iOS device.

1338
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,800
You can go to the official website at NianticLabs.com and register.

1339
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,600
Oh, and you also have to live in Japan because it is a Japanese...

1340
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,520
Darsaka just made a face.

1341
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,800
Like she was really excited for this.

1342
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,360
And now, oh, by the way, you also have to live in Japan.

1343
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,920
And that is something that's supposed to kick off a little later this month.

1344
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,240
There will be an NDA attached to it, but ha, ha, ha, ha.

1345
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,280
That is going to get broken within seconds.

1346
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,040
Let's be real.

1347
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,960
So, yeah, we'll see what the game is all about once that rolls out a little later this month.

1348
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,800
I really wish there wasn't an NDA because I would like to see what it's actually going to look like if it's worth the time.

1349
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,200
It's going to get broken.

1350
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,200
I know, I know, I know.

1351
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,800
But I don't want to have to wait an extra minute to know the information.

1352
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,560
I want it as soon as I can.

1353
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:31,480
Uh, SSG100Matt over at live.vognetwork.com says, I don't trust any Pokemon Go beta signups.

1354
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,920
There are so many scams involved with fake beta signups.

1355
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,880
That's why you should only go to Niantic's official site, NianticLabs.com, and that will have the link if you're in Japan.

1356
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,160
If you are AkumaJP, who I don't see in chat right now, the Daylight Savings might've messed stuff up for his time, but...

1357
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Do they even have that there?

1358
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Uh, well that's why, because we observed it and other places didn't, the time shifted of this show for other people.

1359
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,320
Um, so, but anyway, maybe he'll sign up.

1360
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:04,440
I don't even know if this is something that interests him though, but hopefully somebody we know over there will get in and send me some screenshots and let me know what to look forward to.

1361
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:16,280
But I just, I feel like, especially within the Ingress circles, people will start sharing screenshots within the Ingress circles and they'll make their way out as things tend to spread around the internet.

1362
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,400
That's what usually happens.

1363
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,880
Uh, I do want to mention this though, since we are talking about Pokemon.

1364
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:30,560
Pokemon Go will not be the only Pokemon mobile game, which makes sense because we already have the Pokemon, uh, match three game.

1365
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,240
I always forget the name of, what's that game called?

1366
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,240
The Pokemon, uh, shuffle, shuffle full.

1367
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:34,720
Yes.

1368
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,600
I actually like to say Pokemon Puzzle League.

1369
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,320
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

1370
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,280
That's a different match for game.

1371
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:49,200
Uh, anyhow, the Pokemon company has announced a collaboration with Heroes, which is a Japanese startup on a free to play strategy board game called Pokemon Co-Master.

1372
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:55,720
Uh, this is something where, uh, Heroes, I guess previously did board game apps and an AI system.

1373
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,360
Um, so this technology is going to be used in Pokemon Co-Master.

1374
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:06,440
So this is a, uh, uh, app that is scheduled to come out in the spring in Japan around iOS and Android platforms.

1375
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,720
So lots more Pokemon coming to your cell phone for the 20th anniversary.

1376
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,400
Let's move on Dark Soccer.

1377
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:17,160
You know, it's not going to come on your regular 3DS SNES games.

1378
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,800
Oh yes, this again.

1379
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:24,120
Well, Nintendo did put out a statement and I'm just going to read it as is.

1380
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:34,600
Um, as previously announced new Nintendo 3DS has an improved CPU, which enables Super NES games to run on the system with quality results.

1381
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:46,800
The Super NES games also include perfect pixel mode, which allows players to see their games in their original TV resolution and aspect resolution, um, which sounds to me like

1382
01:08:50,800 --> 01:09:03,240
I mean, I understand that emulators have proved proven that there are some games that won't handle perfectly, but still if the 3DS can play Nintendo 64 games.

1383
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,160
Why can't it do mode seven?

1384
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:13,240
You know, the, the, here's the thing, the tech stuff, I got into it on Twitter this week, not into it, but you know, respectfully.

1385
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,880
And so I had a lot of tech stuff thrown at me on Twitter.

1386
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,000
And so it's kind of like, okay, I get it.

1387
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:30,160
You know, I understand that there is some complexities that come with the emulation, especially with all the different, um, like they, they use this game as an example.

1388
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,080
The, um, Speedy Gonzalez, I think is the game they use as an example.

1389
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:38,360
Um, where certain things won't happen if a mode is not enabled perfectly.

1390
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:47,160
And I think it has to do more with, do you want to emulate the Super Nintendo perfectly takes a lot of power or do you want to do it half-assed?

1391
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:59,560
But one of these stories that I was linked to, actually, I kind of think gave a little credit to the whole, well, if Nintendo put a little more work in it, they could probably pull it off.

1392
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:06,520
And that was about the whole emulator, SNES 9X, which back in the day was an early Super Nintendo emulator.

1393
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:15,080
Uh, and what it did for certain games was for like the top 50 games, it had pre-established speed settings already in there for the top 50 games.

1394
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:22,440
And I think that was part of the problem with the emulation is that because it can really vary so much on Super Nintendo, some games will run too fast.

1395
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,360
Some games will run too slow.

1396
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:35,160
Uh, for example, you might try to go play The Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo and the Triforce animation in the beginning will be wrong because it rotates too fast, like that type of thing.

1397
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:49,560
So, I mean, from that perspective, I kind of get it, but I, here's the thing, a lot of what goes on in gaming, like it or not, a lot of what goes on in gaming is perception.

1398
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,080
Like it or not, perception goes a long way.

1399
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:06,120
And so the fact is when the 3DS can emulate Game Boy Advance, but it can't do Super Nintendo, the perception is Nintendo's holding off because they want more money.

1400
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,680
But the reality at this point for me and this story is I'm kind of like, there's really no debate left here.

1401
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,760
Like if you're telling me they can't do it from a technical standpoint, fine, I accept that.

1402
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:28,920
The reality is, was I going to buy this anyway? Was I going to buy Pilotwings for the third time anyway? No. I'm not going to pay full price for another game like that.

1403
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,240
Wait, buy Pilotwings for the third time? Why did you buy it for a second time?

1404
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,160
On the Wii and on the Wii U.

1405
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:39,000
But it's just Pilotwings. It's not worth the second purchase.

1406
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,440
But I'm just saying that the reality is that it was purchased twice.

1407
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:57,320
Anyway, so I'm not going to get, but even if it was the second time, I still wouldn't, because some might argue, but there was a discount that, okay, fine, whatever, I still wouldn't get it again just to play on the 3DS because it's just not.

1408
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:09,400
Now, if Nintendo was putting out more virtual console games or virtual console games that were kind of new and interesting, like I don't know, second Densetsu 3 or something that we never got to experience before,

1409
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:15,720
then maybe I would care a lot more, but the games they're putting out, and yes, I'm even saying this about EarthBound.

1410
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:21,880
I'm totally content with the fact that I can just play EarthBound on the Wii U. That's fine. I don't need it on my 3DS.

1411
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:31,240
Disagree. I'm like happy that, at least for some of those games, that they're going to be portable on 3DS now.

1412
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:38,040
Having Super Metroid on there, brilliant. Love that. Having Link to the Past, great.

1413
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:44,280
Having EarthBound, even better. When it came out on Wii U, I was like, man,

1414
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:51,000
I wish this was just on the 3DS instead because I actually prefer my RPGs handheld now for some reason.

1415
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:57,320
So I just want more games from Nintendo to come out. I want the Japanese list.

1416
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:04,200
Well, I have a Japanese 3DS, so it doesn't even matter, but that would have been so much better to have all those games.

1417
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:10,360
So here's the thing. If my old 3DS could have played them, would I be buying a few games here

1418
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:15,320
and there to check it out? Probably. I probably would have ended up picking up EarthBound and

1419
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:20,440
some of the, like Super Metroid, yeah. Okay, Super Metroid's a game I'll buy 50 times, let's be real.

1420
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:26,680
I probably would have bought that, but am I really, am I going, I think the question on the table is,

1421
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:31,800
am I going to buy a new 3DS just so I can play Super Nintendo games? No, but you should buy it

1422
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,600
for other reasons. What? What other reasons? Xenoblade. Which is playable on the Wii.

1423
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,920
Yeah, but it's not on your, it's not handheld. Like, I'm not convinced the new 3DS, but here's the

1424
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:49,560
other thing, Shane. The NX is how far away? I'm just gonna wait for the NX. That's the, that's the

1425
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:55,960
biggest thing right now against me getting the new 3DS is that we have a really good feeling, like,

1426
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:01,480
you know, our guts say the NX is going to be a partially portable system, so why would I drop

1427
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:06,520
200 bucks on a new 3DS right now when I know an NX is about to come out? I'm gonna wait. How much

1428
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,360
did you say you were gonna drop on it? I don't know, what are they even right now, 179? They're

1429
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:15,880
175 at some places for the XL and then, like, you can get deals on the regular. But I don't,

1430
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,760
I don't play enough portable gaming to justify that, like, why won't you accept the answer that

1431
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,880
I'm just not interested? Because, as somebody who buys every Nintendo handheld multiple times,

1432
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,680
I just don't understand. Great, then buy another one for me.

1433
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,520
Anyway, uh, all right, let's, uh, you know, in college I got two Game Boy Advance SPs,

1434
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,520
a blue one and a red one, because I was going to a university whose colors were blue and red.

1435
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,600
I'm with Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1436
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,360
I can't even with Shane right now.

1437
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,720
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Country Radio at vognetwork.com,

1438
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:01,880
use the passphrase, tooth. So, all right, uh, let's, let's travel around the world and check

1439
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,880
out some release dates. Let's check out some games that you can play on a variety of platforms,

1440
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:10,360
and we'll start with the US. Were you able to get the US dates in Loki's absence, Shane?

1441
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,520
Yeah, I'm just using the, the link you told me to go to, so if they're wrong it's your fault.

1442
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,240
All right, cool.

1443
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:22,760
All right, um, so this week, on the 15th, for Xbox One and PS4 you've got EA Sports

1444
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:30,920
UFC 2. Uh, on PC you've got Need for Speed. On PS4 you've got something called Salt and Sanctuary.

1445
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:38,520
On Win- or on PC, PS4 and Xbox One you have Sheltered. On the 16th, on Xbox One you have

1446
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:45,160
Dungeon of the Endless. On Xbox One you also have Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.

1447
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:53,560
On the 18th you have, on the 3DS, Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. And then the big,

1448
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:58,200
probably released for Nintendo this week, really, on Wii U will be Pokken Tournament.

1449
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,200
That's this week.

1450
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:00,920
Kind of a big deal.

1451
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,920
Yes, and remember to buy your early copies so you can get your Shadow Mew Two card.

1452
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,960
Or don't.

1453
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,240
But you probably will.

1454
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:09,880
You probably will.

1455
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,600
All right, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

1456
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,160
On the PlayStation 4 this week, Battlefield 4 gets a premium edition into the Best Hits

1457
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:24,520
collection, so a little price reduction on that. As far as new stuff goes, though, there is

1458
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:33,400
Senran Kagura Estival vs. Shoujo Tachi no Sentaku Regular and Sakura edition come out this week,

1459
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:41,000
on the 17th. Over on the Wii U, Pokken Tournament gets its release in Japan as well this week,

1460
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
and you can get a tournament controller or a Pro Pad that goes with that if you want,

1461
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,760
over in Japan. On the Vita this week in Japan, Wanda Fortune R comes out on the Vita. Also,

1462
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:59,080
Omerta Code, Tycoon Kai, and Digimon World Next Order comes out in Japan this week.

1463
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,600
Which reminds me, I forgot to watch the new episodes of Digimon Try.

1464
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,880
I did not even know new stuff for Digimon was airing.

1465
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,840
It's set after Digimon Zero 2, so it's the original team.

1466
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:17,560
I see. And then over on the 3DS this week, there's really not a lot of new games,

1467
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,600
but Japan is getting that same... You know how we got a bunch of price reduced games here on

1468
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,000
Nintendo platforms? What are they calling that, Shane? Do you remember?

1469
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,720
Nintendo Selects.

1470
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,800
That's it, Nintendo Selects. In Japan, they're calling it the Happy Price Selection.

1471
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,600
So the Happy Price Selection is getting releases such as Luigi's Mansion 2,

1472
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,680
Kuma Tomo, Nintendogs Plus Cats, and what might be of interest to some people,

1473
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:47,000
Taiko no Tatsujin, Chibi Dragon 2, Fushijina Orb is also getting a price reduction.

1474
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,240
So check out some of those releases in Japan if you want.

1475
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,320
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1476
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,400
Well, I'm trying to still act deaf something, but fine.

1477
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,240
He can wait.

1478
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:05,080
Yeah. For the UK, we have, on the 16th, Dungeon of the Endless on Xbox One,

1479
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:11,160
the 17th Mutant Mud Super Challenge, Need for Speed, and Obscura Test for PC.

1480
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,840
And on the 18th, we have Pokken Tournament, and that's it.

1481
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:20,200
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1482
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,240
But first, Shane.

1483
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,680
Oh, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. What?

1484
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,280
Wake up, next story.

1485
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,520
Okay, and I don't know why I'm getting all the things being cancelled stories.

1486
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,000
So, also cancelled.

1487
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,840
You're a downer. Let's be real.

1488
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:39,000
Also cancelled is EverQuest Next. Sorry.

1489
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:47,480
And so, that's it. It's cancelled. I didn't read the story. I was watching dog video.

1490
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,360
Um, um, um, um.

1491
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:50,920
This is something-

1492
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,720
Hold on!

1493
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,180
Okay.

1494
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,160
You want more wine, Shane?

1495
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:55,720
What?

1496
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,840
You want more wine?

1497
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,600
I already poured me more wine. Thank you.

1498
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:05,480
Um, so, President of Daybreak Games Russell Shanks said,

1499
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:09,880
uh, when we decided to create the next chapter in the EverQuest journey, we didn't aim low.

1500
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,600
We set out to make something revolutionary.

1501
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,200
Unfortunately, as we put together the pieces, we found that it wasn't fun.

1502
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,680
That is the best reason to cancel games.

1503
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,680
Did he really just say, sorry guys, we didn't set the bar low enough?

1504
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,520
Is that what I'm hearing?

1505
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,720
No, no. You have- because you're drunk. No.

1506
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:34,440
He's saying that they were trying to make the best game they could, but what they made wasn't fun.

1507
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:40,280
I wish more developers would realize this, like, before they get too far into the process,

1508
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:45,400
because I have a story from Konami that is just hilarious that I probably shouldn't talk about.

1509
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,680
Um, anyway.

1510
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:54,120
So, while EverQuest Next is not going forward, Landmark, um, is.

1511
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,280
And it's going to launch this spring for 10 bucks.

1512
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:02,920
So, Landmark, I think, was the, uh, like, the build whatever you want sort of thing in EverQuest.

1513
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,120
Yeah, and some of the, like, all-star stuff from that game was supposed to make its way

1514
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,440
to EverQuest Next. Like, the two were supposed to kind of, uh, be in the same universe anyway,

1515
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,600
so maybe they can just fold whatever they had into Landmark, which would make sense.

1516
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,720
Maybe. Um, but hopefully they don't fold the un-fun things that he was talking about into it.

1517
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,840
Hopefully it's a pretty safe bet that those are not coming over.

1518
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:30,680
Mmm. All right, uh, well, let's get into this next story, and, uh, this is a tricky situation,

1519
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:36,520
and, um, it involves people we've had on this show before, and people that, um, may actually

1520
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:41,400
still listen to this show. Um, so I have to kind of be careful how I, how I, uh, approach this,

1521
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:46,280
because I'm going to admit, I don't really know a lot of what is going on here. I'm just seeing a

1522
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:50,920
lot of the fallout on what's happening on Twitter and so forth, and, uh, it's very interesting.

1523
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,600
And then, unfortunately, I think just shows the difficulty and what goes with

1524
01:20:54,600 --> 01:21:00,520
releasing a new console and putting out, um, new ideas out there. So, here's the deal. About a

1525
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:06,120
month ago, the Coleco Chameleon, do you remember what the Coleco Chameleon was? This was that retro

1526
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:11,720
video game console that was born of that retro magazine community, uh, ended up, I guess,

1527
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:15,800
teaming up and getting the rights with Coleco to put their name on it, and, uh, so it was going to

1528
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,800
end up being the Coleco Chameleon. I know we've talked about this on the show previously. So,

1529
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:26,680
the Coleco Chameleon actually showed up at a toy fair and people were able to, uh, check it out.

1530
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,720
That same toy fair that had all the Power Rangers toys. I was going crazy.

1531
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:36,440
Yes. And you didn't go to, and so you didn't get to do this. Um, Coleco ended up as a result of

1532
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:41,320
what happened at toy fair and showing the device at toy fair is that Coleco actually basically

1533
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:47,080
terminated the association they had with retro VGS and the whole Chameleon project in a statement

1534
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:52,040
saying, retro has decided that the work they have created is not sufficient to demonstrate at this

1535
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:56,760
time. Consequently, we can no longer proceed with the project and the Chameleon project will be

1536
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:02,760
terminated. This separation is amicable. We wish retro luck in the future. The thing is, this was

1537
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:08,840
a bit of a one, two punch because the managing editor of retro magazine actually announced on

1538
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:14,280
LinkedIn that he was going to be leaving the company and cited, in fact, the ongoing issues

1539
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:21,080
with Chameleon as part of the reason why they were leaving. I have to separate myself from

1540
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:28,120
everything associated with it. Retro VGS, the Facebook page, I guess suddenly disappeared.

1541
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,240
I haven't checked the Twitter today, but when I checked the Twitter the other day, it hadn't

1542
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:36,680
updated in a little bit. I will have to look into that. Um, and then, uh, yeah, so unfortunately

1543
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:42,280
it's, it's not looking too good over there. I will say this, since I do know that there are

1544
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:47,320
people involved with the project who may still be listening to OLR, uh, open fair forum. If you

1545
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:53,240
want to come on here and just, just tell us like it is what's going on, uh, happy to have that,

1546
01:22:53,240 --> 01:23:01,960
uh, open invite. Um, and with that, I kind of feel like, and again, this is perception. What did I

1547
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,840
say during a few stories ago? So I'm just going off perception. I don't know the inner workings

1548
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:12,600
of what, you know, happened with this, but my perception is that when you are creating a big,

1549
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,000
big project, and this can even be a video game and even tying into what we said about, you know,

1550
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,040
Microsoft and Lionhead Studios and all that earlier is that when you're making a big video

1551
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:24,120
game, there are certain steps along the way, certain hurdles you have to clear, certain

1552
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,280
deadlines you have to meet to be able to convince people that the project should continue to be

1553
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:34,840
funded. And the perception I'm getting is that maybe they had to cut some corners. We'll put it

1554
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:41,560
that way to get a device out at Toy Fair that would, uh, be able to get this out in the public

1555
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:46,360
and meet some of those goals. But unfortunately, when it kind of turned out that what they were

1556
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,520
showing at Toy Fair was not really the same thing that they were saying this device was going to be,

1557
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:56,520
that's when essentially the landmark was considered failed and Coleco had to pull out that

1558
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:02,120
that seems to be my perception of what's going on here. Um, anyway, I know people are looking

1559
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,800
forward to the device. I hope they're able to find a path forward and continue this,

1560
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:10,280
but I can certainly imagine that this one, two punch may be a little tricky to recover from,

1561
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:16,520
but maybe they can find another investor. Uh, who knows, uh, some comments from chat over at live.vog

1562
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:22,120
and network.com. Dark Tetsuya in chat says word was the proto was just a Super Nintendo and or

1563
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:27,960
a video capture card in the Coleco shell. Yeah, I was hearing that too. Um, I wasn't there, so I

1564
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:32,440
can't say. Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, I really don't know what to make of everything that happened. I

1565
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,320
heard a lot of things. Everything just seemed to go downhill since the Toy Fair fiasco. Um,

1566
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:44,120
well, I mean, if, if it was coming that Coleco was going to pull out, some people see that as,

1567
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:48,760
oh shit, I might be on a sinking ship. And that might be the cause of what's starting to snowball

1568
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:55,480
from this. But, um, I don't know. Again, this is, this is tricky. So I'm going to try and end this

1569
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:02,760
on a positive note with something that I think is kind of neat. The Coleco folks are coming out of

1570
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:07,320
this and pretty quickly getting around to asking on their Facebook. And they did this on Friday.

1571
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:13,800
They actually went to social media to ask the public, would they be interested in a mini arcade

1572
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:19,560
revival? Now I love these things when I was a kid and surely Dark Sakura has to know these little

1573
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:24,520
devices. They were the very tiny little tabletop devices that actually looked like arcade machines.

1574
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:30,120
There was Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Frogger, Donkey Kong. Yeah, I always wanted one too. And I never

1575
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:36,680
got one, but apparently Coleco is considering bringing those back. Um, and they use this thing

1576
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:42,040
called a VFD, a vacuum fluorescent display, which sort of, you know, they're able to do color with

1577
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:45,960
it, although it's still kind of limited, like an old LCD game, like a Mr. Game and Watch type of

1578
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:52,120
thing, but it actually looked kind of cool. So, uh, anyway, they're actually having a discussion

1579
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:56,120
on their Facebook page. Uh, and you can check that out over on the Coleco Facebook page. That

1580
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,560
might be an interesting thing that might come out of this. Uh, I would like to see those games. I

1581
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:05,400
don't know about you. Anyhow, uh, let's move on. We're going to get to the classic game of the

1582
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:11,480
week. Every week, uh, Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1583
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:17,240
hey, you brats ought to check this game out this week. Uh, sadly not a Coleco game this week,

1584
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:22,040
but a very good game nevertheless. So Dark Sakura, what did you decide that the kids need to play

1585
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:27,000
this week? The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening. No need to break out the brick for this.

1586
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:38,760
It's just sound familiar. Um, in Japan, it was called, um, Zelda no Densetsu Yume no- Yumeo

1587
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:48,120
Mirishima, which was, uh, Legend of Zelda Dream Island. Um, it came out in 1993, um, developed by

1588
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:54,360
Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, and it was published for the Game Boy. It was the,

1589
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:01,320
uh, fourth installment in the Legend of Zelda series. Um, it was also the first portable

1590
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:09,800
version. Um, so it actually began as a port of Link to the Past, uh, developed just after hours

1591
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:16,680
by Nintendo. Um, and the project then, uh, grew into an original one. Um,

1592
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:25,400
and, uh, basically it did a few more firsts. It was the first one not set in Hyrule.

1593
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:33,000
Didn't include Zelda or the Triforce. So it starts off with Link stranded on, um, an island,

1594
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:41,720
uh, guarded by, uh, the Wind Fish. And so basically you fight through puzzles and

1595
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:48,440
search for these different musical instruments so that you can wake the Wind Fish and escape from

1596
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:57,560
the island. Um, it did, uh, so well. It was so, uh, so loved that there was a remake for the Game Boy

1597
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:05,160
Color in 1998, um, called The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening DX, and it had full color graphics,

1598
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:12,760
and you could use the Game Boy Printer with it, and had an exclusive color-based dungeon. Um,

1599
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:19,160
the two together, the two versions have sold more than six million units around the world, and it's,

1600
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:28,280
uh, a classic. I mean, really it is. Um, as far as, uh, you know, more of the story, you do have,

1601
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:35,480
like, a mention of Zelda but not too much else. Um, the game also, interesting, has, uh,

1602
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:42,840
advice given to you by other NPCs, um, that, like, there's actually a character who communicates with

1603
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:50,680
Link by the telephone. Um, there also are cameos from other Nintendo titles. There's Wart, Yoshi,

1604
01:28:50,680 --> 01:29:01,320
Kirby, um, Dr. Wright from SimCity, who's called Mr. Wright, and, um, uh, another, uh,

1605
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:09,960
character from a, uh, looks like a Japanese-only game. Um, his name is, uh, Richard, and he's from,

1606
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:17,720
uh, Karunotame ni Kanewanaru, so, which, yeah, that looks like old school Game Boy.

1607
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:24,680
It's called For Frog the Bell Tolls, to translate it. Um, you also have Chomp. You remember Chomp

1608
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:33,800
from the various Mario games. He's so cute. Um, there's also a glitch involving the,

1609
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:39,960
the Chain Chomp, from what I understand. You also see Goombas and all kinds of other things, so

1610
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:48,760
it's basically just kind of out there for a Legend of Zelda game. In fact, the director, um,

1611
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:56,360
uh, Tezuka Takashi said that it's supposed to be, it makes it feel more like a parody of the

1612
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:02,440
Zelda series. Um, including characters even breaking the fourth wall, um, like the little

1613
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:09,160
children telling you how to save the game, but then they don't admit that they understand what

1614
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:16,120
they're talking about. So, it's a pretty, pretty interesting one. It's, you know, it's again

1615
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:23,880
another, uh, overhead perspective, a Zelda game, but there's also jumping mechanics and

1616
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:30,680
side-scrolling sequences that are kind of like, um, Zelda 2, and, you know, special items and

1617
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:37,880
different things like that. And, uh, you can also fish in it and play songs on an ocarina,

1618
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:45,000
um, so different type of, you know, stuff like that. And it is a classic, but, you know, the

1619
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,480
other thing too is it really did, the DX version did make advantage of that old Game Boy printer.

1620
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:57,240
Who remembers that? You could print out, like, really bad pixelated pictures that you would take.

1621
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:06,120
Um, so there you go. That's the game. I remember playing this on Game Boy Color,

1622
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:09,560
because I think that's the only way you can do it is on Game Boy Color. I could not do it on the

1623
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,160
black and white one. Did you know that this game also has, um, a Guinness World Record award?

1624
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:20,200
No, I didn't. Um, it's 42nd place in the Guinness World Records 2009 list of top 50 most

1625
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:26,600
influential and important video games of all times. Interesting. I wonder how many Zelda

1626
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:34,840
games made that list. I'm sure a lot of them did. So there it is, your classic game of the week,

1627
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:41,160
Link's Awakening, the classic one in the Zelda series. And of course, with the whole, uh,

1628
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,800
Twilight Princess being re-released on Wii U, it's very timely as well. All right, we're going to

1629
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,800
take a quick break, everybody. Uh, but when we come back, there is plenty more OLR to come.

1630
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,600
We'll get to the Fugu question of the week. We'll get to, uh, an acquisition in the gaming industry

1631
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,320
and, uh, Ooh, the latest in copyright infringement on YouTube. That should be fun.

1632
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:04,280
We'll talk about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1633
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:17,320
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with the continuation of our 634th

1634
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:25,000
episode for this March the 13th of 2016. Myself, Dark Sakura here in studio with Shane filling in

1635
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,960
for Loki tonight, who is home with a sick kid and we hope they are feeling better soon. Uh,

1636
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:35,800
this week, St. Patrick's day. Uh, do you guys do anything to celebrate St. Patrick's day? No. I

1637
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,640
know some cities have big events and things like that. I was seeing some pictures from my friends

1638
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:43,400
in Chicago that were having a good old time this weekend. Which is purely an American holiday

1639
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:50,920
anyway. Well, it is. Let's be real. We've, we've ruined a lot of holidays here. I'm sure, uh,

1640
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:55,960
Cinco de Mayo here is probably not like what it is other places. Let's be real.

1641
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,800
Well, and I'll, I'll tell you this. Cinco de Mayo is not really celebrated anywhere else in the

1642
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:08,440
country. No, I'm serious. I had never even known it was an actual holiday. Um, until I moved to

1643
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:14,520
California. And then again, we had Mardi Gras first. People just use it for $5 margarita

1644
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:20,440
specials. Mobile, Alabama had Mardi Gras first. Don't let anyone tell you differently because

1645
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:25,160
they're lying. But was it the kind of Mardi Gras where you showed your boobies for beads?

1646
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:31,800
No, because New Orleans took that and ruined the holiday. And for that, by the way, I guarantee

1647
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,920
you anyone who does that for real in New Orleans will end up arrested within the next 10 minutes.

1648
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:42,360
I kid you not. They have the entire force out in patrol.

1649
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:47,320
All right. Uh, enough holidays. Let's, uh, let's get back into some gaming news with some rapid

1650
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,200
fire news. We're going to get to the Fugu question of the week after this. And of course,

1651
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:55,000
your phone calls coming up later in the show at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype,

1652
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,320
orange lounge radio. Skype is probably the best way to do it. Since everybody has that on their

1653
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:03,640
smartphones at this point, you can add us on Skype, orange lounge radio. That's all one word.

1654
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,840
Meanwhile, let's get into some rapid fire news. Shane.

1655
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:11,240
Okay. I'm just going to talk about them super quick because they're rapid fire. Uh, there is

1656
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:17,320
a Xenoblade Chronicles X, a little model kit coming out for one of the scales. Uh, the formula

1657
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:24,920
zero frame looks like it's going around for about $70. It's super cute. The scales are awesome in

1658
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:32,520
that game and it can transform into the vehicle mode. So that's cool. Okay. Enough about that.

1659
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:40,600
Next, uh, round one is expanding into other places, New York, Georgia, Colorado,

1660
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:45,400
and Pennsylvania. Um, I still haven't been to a round one. We have one in San Jose.

1661
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:50,360
Why haven't we gone? Anybody? This is up for like anybody can answer this.

1662
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:56,520
It's got to have given me enough incentive to go. No, I'm just kidding. I don't have a good reason.

1663
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:02,360
Is that what you want? I keep wanting to go there. Um, but in San Jose this weekend,

1664
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,880
we could have made a trip of it because rockage was this weekend in San Jose.

1665
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:12,360
And I really wanted to go, but a the weather be just, I've been like, nonstop, go, go, go. I was

1666
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:19,000
like, I need a down weekend or I'm going to just crack. So anyway, we'll go eventually.

1667
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:29,480
Sure. Um, lastly, harmonics has ditched, um, mad cats and is now working with PDP or performance

1668
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:36,600
design products. Um, they are going to be, uh, working with them to make the instruments for

1669
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:44,840
rock band. And, uh, this is apparently going to, um, come out alongside a major update coming this

1670
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:52,200
fall for rock band four. So as much crap as everybody's given mad cats over the past,

1671
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:58,760
I don't know, whenever they started putting stuff out, um, I felt for the most part,

1672
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:06,840
their rock band stuff was pretty quality. So it's not surprising that they are moving on since

1673
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:13,240
I think mad cats lost like so many like high up people recently because they had a bad, bad, uh,

1674
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:20,600
financials, but, um, maybe PDP can make even better instruments. And I'm kind of curious

1675
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:25,080
about what this major rock band four feature update this fall is going to be.

1676
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:29,000
It almost sounds like they're going to relaunch the game in a way for this holiday season.

1677
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,840
Like you had last holiday rock band four and there'll be like the real rock band for this

1678
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:38,920
holiday. Well then what's next year, the real, real rock band for maybe rock band 4.5. Well,

1679
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:44,360
maybe that'll be this year. Maybe. All right. Um, Hey, how about rocket league? Are you guys

1680
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:48,840
enjoying rocket league? Cause that game's a lot of fun and there's a new mode that's being teased

1681
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:55,640
for the game. Rocket league is going to get a basketball mode as if, uh, hitting the ball into

1682
01:36:55,640 --> 01:37:01,080
the goal was not enough to soccer base mode. Now there's going to be a basketball mode and yes,

1683
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:06,760
uh, you are going to have a big wide net on the ground. It's not very tiny. It's actually a huge

1684
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,000
wide net, but you do have to get the ball in the net, which means you're going to have to know the

1685
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,920
skills with your car to be able to launch the ball into the air. So it's going to be even more

1686
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:20,920
of a cluster fuck, honestly. Um, now we don't know when this is coming out, but considering

1687
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:25,160
March madness starts March 15th, it's a pretty good guess that it's probably going to be time

1688
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:30,520
for this month. We'll see. Um, we talked a lot about Twitch earlier in the show, but it's

1689
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:35,240
important to note there are other places to stream games and YouTube gaming of course is one of them

1690
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,880
that's been trying to gain more and more traction. Well, YouTube gaming is actually now in some more

1691
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:44,360
countries. Uh, YouTube gaming earlier this week made its way to Canada, which I didn't realize

1692
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:49,480
it wasn't in Canada. Like usually, usually they're pretty good about getting most stuff that we get

1693
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:53,800
here in the U S but YouTube gaming finally expanded to Canada and three more countries,

1694
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:59,160
Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Of course, that is the mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

1695
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:05,000
Um, and YouTube is saying it will go into many more countries soon. Uh, there's also some updates

1696
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,480
that went with that. The Android app now supports the 60 frames per second playback. So that's

1697
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:15,000
pretty cool. Uh, and also an update on desktops. The homepage is simplified with no more sidebars.

1698
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,240
There's a live tab on the homepage that will take you to a lineup of all the top streams and games

1699
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:23,400
that are on the air. And then you can manage games and, excuse me, and channels that you are

1700
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:31,400
subscribed to. Uh, and lastly, if you are looking for a place to buy Japanese video games, like let's

1701
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:35,400
say maybe there used to be a retailer that you used to use, and then they kind of went cuckoo

1702
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:40,280
bananas on social media. And so you've been looking for somebody else to use, uh, Amazon

1703
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:46,440
may now be a resource for you guys. That's so cool. Uh, Amazon, Japan will now ship video game

1704
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:51,240
hardware and software international. Wait, wait, wait. Hardware's go. I heard last I heard hardware

1705
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:57,720
was not working. Uh, according to this story, it's hardware, but, uh, cause the, the NeoGaf

1706
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:03,960
post I was reading, um, people were trying to get a PS4 consoles. Interesting. And those weren't

1707
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:09,880
working, but anything software related. What about Amiibo? Why there's like plenty of places

1708
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:17,320
that sell them for just as cheap. I was worth asking. Excuse me. I don't know. I, I would assume

1709
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:22,840
yes, but anyhow, uh, shipping is less than $10 a game. It should be noted. It doesn't matter if

1710
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:28,600
you're an Amazon prime member. Amazon, Japan is a little bit separate. So keep that in mind. It'll

1711
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:33,080
be interesting to see how that shifts the dynamic, uh, around, uh, dark Sakura.

1712
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:42,360
Well, we have some interesting, uh, news from, uh, about the BAFTA. Um, there are nominations,

1713
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:49,880
uh, out for the, uh, Academy, British Academy games award in 2016. We have, um, everybody's

1714
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:56,200
gone to the rapture. Yay. It should win her story and the Witcher three, not Witcher three.

1715
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:01,800
Um, well, uh, actually let me do by, uh, the number of nominations. Everybody's gone to the

1716
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:08,440
rapture has 10 it's the leader. Oh, um, her story and the Witcher three have seven Batman,

1717
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:15,400
Arkham Knight, life is strange and rocket league. I'll have five. And, um, they also said that

1718
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:22,920
Dara O'Brien is to return as the host for the award ceremony. So that's cool. And then, um,

1719
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:30,520
Rhapsody, which is a music streaming service is going to be coming for the Wii U, um,

1720
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:39,160
sneaking ahead of other services, such as Spotify. Um, you can also get a 30 day free

1721
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:46,280
trial directly through the Wii U. Um, and if you live outside the U S Rhapsody operates as

1722
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:53,960
Napster. I remember Napster over here. When it was really good and when you can get useful.

1723
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:59,480
Yes. I got so much Eurobeat that way. That's how long ago that was. Yeah. I'm like,

1724
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:04,600
I think I got a lot of dance mania albums out of hamster. I'd also like to ask if I'm like the

1725
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:11,160
only one of us in the room that got the meat Omo invite. I didn't get an invite, but I signed up

1726
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:18,200
for their little network. Yeah. Um, well, Nintendo, um, has announced that the app, uh,

1727
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:24,920
me Tomo is going to be, um, launching in Japan on March 17th. We don't have the U S state,

1728
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:30,680
but you can register for it. I got an email for that for the Japanese one. Um,

1729
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:34,680
since I have a Japanese Nintendo account, but I didn't pay attention.

1730
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:43,320
Oh, is that it? Uh, yeah. All right. That's what I said. That's it. Oh, I didn't hear,

1731
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:47,400
I didn't hear that. I'm multitasking. Takes a lot to do a radio show over here. I'm here.

1732
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:54,360
I thought I was the old one. Anyhow, let's get to the foogle question of the week. Every week,

1733
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:57,960
uh, we ask you guys a question on our Facebook community and our Google plus community.

1734
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,280
You slam those words together and you get foogle.

1735
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,720
Uh, this week we decided to ask, how do you get your gaming news?

1736
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:16,600
Uh, do you use a popular or indie website that you get your news from?

1737
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:20,520
Does it come from social media? Cause I don't know about you guys. I get a lot from Twitter,

1738
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:24,920
uh, podcasts or YouTube. I swear. I'm not like self promoting or what I'm generally

1739
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:29,160
curious. Do you use podcasts or YouTube even or what have you? How do you stay informed on your

1740
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,280
favorite games and development? So it's just kind of curious what sort of answers we'd get with

1741
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:37,640
this. So, uh, Mike B starts us off saying I use YouTube. It's awesome. I used to watch G4 back

1742
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:42,360
in the day. Now I don't think cable TV has a game show like X play, et cetera. Kind of sad since it's

1743
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:47,800
a billion dollar industry. Uh, Bryce H says, I usually get my gaming news from my Nintendo news,

1744
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:51,720
whenever someone posts to Twitter. And of course you guys. Oh, shucks. Uh,

1745
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:55,320
Dark Tetsuya says, I also want to shout out my Nintendo news, especially in recent months. And

1746
01:42:55,320 --> 01:43:00,520
with the NX rumblings, they've been keeping us busy with news rumors. Uh, Winston H says,

1747
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:04,920
I used to get most of it from joystick before it became a part of Engadget. Otherwise now pretty

1748
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,960
much from OLR and the co-optional podcast, uh, other games websites just simply have been copying

1749
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,360
and pasting articles from other websites, which has become a disturbing trend, not just in games

1750
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:19,880
news outlets, but also mainstream. I could go on a tangent on that, but I'm going to try really hard

1751
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:24,440
not to. Okay. I'll say a little bit. The part that gets me is that somebody will copy and

1752
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:28,840
paste one of those articles and then they'll put it on Facebook with one of those stupid,

1753
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:34,280
like, here's the top six reasons why Donald Trump is a fucking asshole. As if we didn't already

1754
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:40,280
know you won't believe number five. And it's like kind of playing on that emotion where it's like,

1755
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:44,280
Oh, I got to see this hideous accident or whatever, you know, what's going on. It's just,

1756
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:50,520
it's crazy. Anyway, that's just a side tangent. Um, let's see. Renji221 says, well, if I don't

1757
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:55,320
get my gaming news from you guys at OLR, I usually get it from Facebook. Critical Myths says

1758
01:43:55,320 --> 01:44:00,360
combination of podcasts and Facebook mostly. Andrew S says, my gaming news mostly comes from

1759
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:05,640
OLR. Otherwise it's the little bit of advertising I see on Facebook and then look into on YouTube or

1760
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:11,640
word of mouth. SSU100Matt says, I mostly follow a few indie people and a few of the major gaming

1761
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:16,280
news sites on Twitter, but I leave it up to OLR and Bobby Black Wolf to give me the full detailed

1762
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:21,000
rundown of everything I miss. Redertainment says, I like to get my news from a diverse number of

1763
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,200
sources, not leaning towards one outlet over any others. I do avoid getting any news from Kotaku.

1764
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:31,480
Kotaku is the only Gawker outlet I expressly avoid. Veronica Isabel says, I get my gaming

1765
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,240
news from Go Nintendo, VOG Network and word of mouth. Andy R says, pretty much all social media

1766
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:41,160
and podcasts and occasionally straight from company press releases thanks to the site I write

1767
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:45,560
for. Well, you have a little bit of a different perspective if you're actually working in the

1768
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:51,960
media. Raginator says, I tend to check epic bundle.com, a deals aggregate site to find out

1769
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:57,240
about any freebie games that are being given away for free. That's an interesting response because

1770
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:02,760
instead of following gaming news, Raginator is following gaming deals. And it's like,

1771
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,720
that's the part I care about. Show me where it's cheap right now. And I imagine, you know, sites

1772
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:11,880
like CheapAssGamer and a lot of the similar sites probably have a lot of fans that do that exact

1773
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:16,280
same thing. That's what they're in it for is the deals. We do have a couple answers over on Google

1774
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:21,000
Plus as well, where Act F says, I get my news from Reddit, Facebook and Twitter, news outlets

1775
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:26,840
or blogs. And of course, podcasts. And lastly, Prince Peach Fuzz says, I like to watch Total

1776
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:31,800
Biscuit or Angry Joe on YouTube. Podcasts are the easiest way to get it, especially for when you

1777
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:37,000
have long drives and radio stations suck here in SAC. Well, except Jack FM. I had no idea that

1778
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,360
Prince Peach Fuzz was a local. Go figure. All this time, I had no idea. So there you go. And

1779
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:45,880
yeah, most of the radio stations do suck. I will say that. I'll say a shout out. I don't mind

1780
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:52,200
saying, I like 94.7. They play a good mix of music there. So. That's like the only station I have

1781
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:58,680
on my car. But, but usually. I listen to the USB stick station. Yeah. I just listen to my,

1782
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:04,200
my iPhone. Honestly, most of the time it's Spotify or podcasts for me, but once in a while,

1783
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:09,000
it's like, okay, I'll listen to the radio. And actually, what even surprises me is that sometimes

1784
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,040
I listen to talk radio. And for some reason, even though the talk radio station here is a hugely

1785
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:18,040
conservative slant, which is not my political leaning. So I usually don't have interest in it.

1786
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:22,200
But I still can't help but listen to it because it's also where you get the,

1787
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:28,600
it's also where you get the traffic and weather updates and all that stuff.

1788
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:35,080
So, anyhow, that is it for the FUGL question of the week. Let's get to, actually, I'm curious

1789
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:41,160
about you guys. What do you use for your news? For me, it is like all social media. I am so

1790
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:48,520
informed thanks to Twitter. That is what I use is social media for news. What do you use, Dark Sakura?

1791
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:57,880
I like, I don't really, I usually pick it up here and there. Believe it or not, I actually get

1792
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:04,920
information from Forbes, from Fortune, because that's the financial side of it. I really like

1793
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:13,320
Game Politics. I like the announcements from, there's actually a couple of

1794
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:19,160
mailing lists I'm still on, press release mailing lists from some of the contacts I made at E3 years

1795
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:26,680
ago. So I'll get some of that. But mostly, I'll also get a few of them from Rocket News,

1796
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:32,520
actually, which is a more like a Japanese cultural news site, but I'll get like game

1797
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:38,200
information and things like that. And then also just from my friends. So.

1798
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:41,800
Shane, what about you? How do you get your gaming news?

1799
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:45,800
Most of mine come from websites. I go to, am I allowed to list them?

1800
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:47,800
I don't really care. Whatever.

1801
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:53,960
So I go to Destructoid, Silicon Era, and Kotaku. And that's it. I don't go to

1802
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:57,800
any other video game sites, really. And then Twitter, I get my stuff from.

1803
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,200
And those are my four things.

1804
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:05,480
You know, what's interesting is that I wasn't, I swear I was not fishing for people to say,

1805
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:09,880
Oh, LR, I love Oh LR for my news. I'm very flattered that a lot of you mentioned Oh LR.

1806
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:16,120
But the thing about that is that I actually don't consider this a new show. Yes, we do go over video

1807
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:19,960
game news. And so I'm flattered that some of you kind of rely on us to get that. But I always

1808
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:27,000
thought of us more as a discussion show. I sort of set the bar at that people who tune into this

1809
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:33,240
show probably already have an idea of what's going on in the gaming world. So I like to sort

1810
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,800
of give bullet points and then talk about it. And you know, and I've mentioned that before is that

1811
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:44,520
this show was born of, we used to go to the arcade, play DDR and Soul Calibur 2 and whatever

1812
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:49,240
else was out. And then we would go to the diner that was in the parking lot, eat those fucking

1813
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:53,960
delicious mozzarella sticks and talk shit about video games. And when I say talk shit, I mean,

1814
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:58,120
you know, the good and the bad. And so that was always what I wanted to bring onto the radio was

1815
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:02,120
that, you know, we would kind of have that same atmosphere where we're just at this virtual table

1816
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:07,480
that we're all sitting at just talking about video games, but we're all informed through whatever

1817
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:11,880
means. Although, and again, I'm not saying like, Oh, you can't be here if you're not informed.

1818
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,480
We still try to give the high level bullet points just in case you hadn't heard. I mean,

1819
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:19,320
usually there's a couple stories here that, Oh, I didn't know that until OLR brought it up. Like

1820
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:22,840
some of you probably don't follow Twitch stuff. So you probably had no idea about that divorce

1821
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:27,160
thing we talked about in the beginning, but you know, some of you probably knew more about that

1822
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:32,760
than we did. So anything you want to add to that DarkSucker? I was going to say though,

1823
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:42,520
informed commentary is very welcome though. Yeah. Uninformed out of your ass comments. Right.

1824
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:48,520
Not so much. Yeah. I mean, as far as our banter and response with other individuals, I should

1825
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:53,720
say. Sure. And I'm always for, you know, there's going to be times when we disagree. We all

1826
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:59,240
disagree here in studio. Except you're wrong. And we can have that respectful disagreement. And even

1827
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:03,480
with the listeners, you know, like for example, Bobby and I disagree on a lot of stuff out there,

1828
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:08,360
but we can have a respectful dialogue and even listeners will call in and, you know, might say,

1829
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:12,120
Hey, I think you guys are wrong on such and such topic. And I'll kind of hear that out.

1830
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:15,640
I might needle them a little bit and get them to express their viewpoint a little more,

1831
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:20,760
but I'm all about hearing the different opinions. I just demand we keep it respectful when we get

1832
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:28,200
into the whole, like, you know, F you and the, the just disrespectful name calling and all that

1833
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:32,760
stuff. I can't, I can't really deal with that. Like it's just, I'm too old for that. I am actually

1834
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:38,760
too old for that. I really am. So what am I older than that? No, you are also too old for that.

1835
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:45,240
There's a certain bar around the age. I don't know that you just, you just get too old for this

1836
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:54,520
shit. What? I think that was like 25. Uh, yeah, probably, probably. All right. Anyhow. Uh, let's,

1837
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:58,520
let's see. I just leave you in chat over at live.vog network.com. Uh,

1838
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:03,560
Kaijuto in chat says everyone has an agenda. So I pretty much stay away from video game news and

1839
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:10,200
just check out release dates and try myself. Or if it's PC, I read steam reviews. Kaijuto in chat

1840
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:15,560
says sometimes a good F you is all you need to say. There there's an appropriate way and an

1841
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:21,160
inappropriate way to say, fuck you. Like there, there really is. There's, there's a way you can

1842
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:27,560
say it respectfully, but it's an art. Um, you guys know I love and I take most of my cues in life

1843
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:33,320
from RuPaul, right? And RuPaul has a great quote that I think is very appropriate. I don't care if

1844
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:37,480
you're straight, gay, wherever on the sexuality spectrum you are, gender spectrum. I don't give

1845
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:45,960
a fuck because I think this, this quote applies to everything. Throwing shade takes creativity.

1846
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:53,000
Being a bitch takes none that, and I owe that one to RuPaul. Would you agree to our soccer?

1847
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:00,040
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. All right. I should just end the show with a RuPaul quote every week. No, I

1848
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:04,600
don't know. All right. Uh, let's move on. Let's, uh, get to some more stories and then we'll get to,

1849
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:09,800
uh, the, um, phone calls. So you can call in and disagree over at, uh, Oren Santerio.

1850
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:13,480
We'll get to the mailbag too. Maybe we'll have some disagreements in the mailbag.

1851
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:17,560
If I'm, if I can. Well, let's try to get there. Let's, uh, let's get back into some news. We'll

1852
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:26,360
start off with Shane. So Diablo 2 got a patch. Um, now they're trying to make it so, uh, more

1853
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:36,120
people can play it. So they patched it to work on modern platforms. Um, who cares? There's Diablo 3.

1854
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:41,560
Go play that. You know, a game that's really supported. And don't even play that because

1855
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:48,200
Blizzard fired Zarem. And what's the point? Just, I don't understand. You're very salty

1856
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:53,320
about that. Aren't you? We don't know he was fired by the way. Yes, we do because he didn't get a

1857
01:52:53,320 --> 01:53:04,120
blue post saying goodbye. He just left and that's fired. So all that personal business aside,

1858
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:07,880
you're not going to go back and visit Diablo 2. I've never played Diablo 2. I don't care about

1859
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:13,240
Diablo 2. Also, I'm not playing video games, so that doesn't matter. But, um, no. Who cares about

1860
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:19,880
Diablo 2? Diablo 3 is fine enough and that's it. Sometimes you have to know your roots in gaming.

1861
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:25,160
Nope. I'm never going to go play like old games that I've never played before. Well, something

1862
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:29,400
else you probably don't care about Warcraft 3. I don't. Is also supposed to be getting a patch.

1863
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:35,320
Like Blizzard's patching all their old games. Who cares? Some people still play those games.

1864
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:41,960
So they're patching the, um, crap. No, I forgot the name. The Three Vikings. Lost Vikings. That

1865
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:46,600
would be rad if they did. They're patching the Lost Vikings to work instead of the Super Nintendo.

1866
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:52,600
It'll work on, you know, El Capitan. I think they have to patch all these things so that they run

1867
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:57,480
better in Windows 10 since it's becoming more and more obvious that Microsoft will place you on

1868
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:03,080
Windows 10 one way or the other. That's not happening. They will physically remove you

1869
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:11,480
from your workstation and put you on 10. Unless, Rob. Buy a Mac, right? No. What? Turn off your

1870
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:16,040
updates. I heard that even if you turn off your updates, like somebody did that and then they

1871
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:19,480
woke up the next day and it was like, welcome to Windows 10. And the person like was going to

1872
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:25,640
throw their computer out a window. You know what? What? I still have Windows 7. Hang on. Well, I,

1873
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:31,080
I don't hate Windows 10 though. I really don't, but it's, I, every, everybody's different. I,

1874
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:36,440
I didn't care for Windows 8 and there's like one random laptop at work on Windows 8 and every time

1875
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:41,800
I have to use it, I'm like, how do I computer? Like, it's just so different for me, but Windows

1876
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:47,400
10 is fine. No, Windows 10 is garbage. Windows 8.1 was great. All right, whatever. We still use,

1877
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,440
do you guys know we're still, I'm not, I guess I'm not supposed to advertise. Somebody told me

1878
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:56,040
I shouldn't advertise this, but too late. I always run my big mouth. We still run Windows XP here on

1879
01:54:56,040 --> 01:55:03,160
the studio computer, but it works. I am scared to upgrade to even Windows 7 because this method,

1880
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:07,960
you heard about the crazy ordeal when I updated fucking Skype and it shut down the Skype line for

1881
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:14,760
like a month. I'm afraid to update to even Windows 7. But anyway, I probably will eventually. I just

1882
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:24,040
need to stop being a, a jerk. All right, let's move on. Other stories. How about League of

1883
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:27,720
Legends? Although this story isn't actually about League of Legends, but the parent company,

1884
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:32,200
Riot Games, who's had a lot of success with League of Legends. Well, Riot Games this week

1885
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:37,880
acquired Radiant Entertainment. Radiant Entertainment has fighting game technology.

1886
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:43,480
It's staffed by folks that are high up in the fighting game community, including Seth Killian,

1887
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:47,640
which was a former Capcom community manager and he used to do Street Fighter commentary.

1888
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:52,840
The studio originally created by Tom and Tony Cannon. They had also founded the Evolution

1889
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:57,800
Championship series. Radiant has the online fighting game Rising Thunder and the town

1890
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,840
building simulator Stonehearth. So anyhow, Rising Thunder is going to be going offline on March

1891
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:07,960
18th. So the team can start on a new game, but Stonehearth will continue development as planned,

1892
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:14,920
but now it will be under Riot Games. Riot Games, by the way, is not the end all be all because

1893
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:21,480
Riot Games in turn is owned by Tencent, which is a Chinese company. But it doesn't surprise me that

1894
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:26,040
Riot Games is trying to expand its portfolio a little bit. After all, Blizzard is much more

1895
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:30,680
than World of Warcraft and we've really seen them expand their portfolio in recent years with things

1896
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:34,520
like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm. So it makes sense that Riot Games wants to get into

1897
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:41,400
other places as well. And, you know, with League of Legends being such a huge esports game,

1898
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:45,640
I'm not surprised at all that they want to acquire a fighting game because that's a universe that

1899
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:50,920
Blizzard isn't in, for starters. And that's something that, you know, they could take all

1900
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:56,120
this expertise and try to get a fighter out there that will be at these, you know, Evolution

1901
01:56:56,120 --> 01:57:00,920
Championship Series and these huge fighting game tournaments that will make Riot a bigger

1902
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:05,240
competitor in that space. So I think that's very interesting, a very interesting turn of events

1903
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:13,400
there. And I will check that out. DarkSagra. Well, and Bobby alluded to this in the chat room.

1904
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:24,360
There, Nintendo had a claim open for a video. The video was called Captain Toad Head Butts Toad

1905
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:31,640
Out in the Crotch. Yeah. I'm not going to say the video is the classiest thing or the most mature,

1906
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:40,920
but it was posted under fair use and Nintendo basically put out a claim on it on copyright

1907
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:49,000
grounds that it used footage from Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. So the claim was disputed.

1908
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:58,040
And then four weeks after that, Nintendo rejected the dispute. So the person appealed,

1909
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:07,640
which gives them 30 days to release the claim or issue a takedown. And so 31 days later,

1910
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:15,960
they haven't said anything. They haven't done anything. So and even the thing about it is that

1911
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:24,920
the person who did it wasn't really doing it for any money. But the fact that Nintendo hasn't

1912
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:30,840
really pursued it might give an indication on just exactly how seriously they take these

1913
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:43,160
kind of things. I don't even think that Nintendo even watches any of these videos or tests them.

1914
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:48,680
They just look out for something that has a mention of it or has been reported as having

1915
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:52,840
content and they just try to take down as many of them as they can. So.

1916
01:58:52,840 --> 01:59:01,400
And on top of that, too, it looks like they also didn't give much of an explanation as to

1917
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:04,920
really why they did it or why they didn't even reply. So that's it.

1918
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:11,560
They really need to do something about that whole copyright system on YouTube. It is so

1919
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:16,920
jank right now. And I've gone off telling Blue in the face about it. So I'm going to really try to

1920
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:21,960
not do that again this week. But I'm glad to hear that when appropriate, they are backing off.

1921
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:26,200
Well, it's not a thing that they even backed off. I think they just didn't

1922
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:33,640
care enough to put out a comment on it. But I like what the person that wrote the article

1923
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:38,600
is the person that posted it. And I agree with this one line here. There should be some type

1924
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:44,680
of penalty for filing bogus bad faith copyright claims. Thank you. Absolutely. I stand by that.

1925
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:52,680
Absolutely. And he also suggests that claimants should be required, and I'm just quoting this,

1926
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:57,080
to actually respond to disputes and appeals, not just rejecting them with no explanation.

1927
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:02,360
So that's it. All right. Let's move on. Shane.

1928
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:10,920
So remember when Sony got hacked several years ago and it sucked for everybody? Well,

1929
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:18,120
they had a class action suit that was done in 2014 where you could actually

1930
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:24,520
sign up to get some free stuff from them. Apparently, since March 2nd, Sony's actually

1931
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:29,720
been compensating people for it. So if you filled out that really long form, which I'm pretty sure I

1932
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:37,000
did, you could be eligible to get free copies of Infamous, Big Planet, and the God of War HD

1933
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:46,760
collection on your PS3 or Vita. There was also account credits and PlayStation Network

1934
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:51,560
subscriptions. I haven't seen anything come through, but I could have also sworn

1935
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:56,680
that I already got compensated for this. I feel like this has happened already.

1936
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:02,760
We were, and this was some type of follow-up. The Sony thing was more of in good faith and not

1937
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:07,800
ordered by the court. But there was that class action anyway, which is why a lot of companies

1938
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:14,280
have updated their terms of use so that you can't do a class action anymore, if there's any legal

1939
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:22,600
standing to that. But I digress. All these claims essentially were filed with the class action,

1940
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:27,320
and now this is the official court response. But I guess if you participated in the prior

1941
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:32,840
reimbursement, you can't get as many games. I think you'd only get one game as opposed to two

1942
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:35,720
or something like that. I don't even care. It's whatever.

1943
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,800
NintendoManiac64 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1944
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:46,840
When Sony got hacked, which time? The 2011 time.

1945
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:54,360
No kidding. No kidding. All right. Let's move on to this story about

1946
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:59,080
Zelda Wii U. I know a lot of people very excited about that. Who knows if Zelda Wii U will stay

1947
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:03,800
on Wii U or if it's going to go to NX as well, although I'm sure it will at least be on Wii U,

1948
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:11,880
if nothing else. There was a new interview that Anuma, the producer behind Zelda, did with

1949
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:16,920
Famitsu this week. And he mentioned that the development is progressing well and that they

1950
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:21,640
are very busy. He says that the game has taken shape and things have gotten easier. This means

1951
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:27,000
things are progressing well. I think the base of our secret sauce has always been Ocarina of Time,

1952
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:33,560
but this time the change in flavor will be like going from Japanese food to Western style food.

1953
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:38,280
Perhaps players will be surprised. Look forward to it because I think we'll be able to make

1954
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:42,440
something new like Ocarina of Time was. So it really sounds like they're going to shake up

1955
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:48,360
the formula with Zelda, but this isn't completely out of line with, you know, what we are expecting

1956
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:53,080
because they've mentioned previously that they're taking more of a Skyrim influence this time and

1957
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,960
so things are going to be a little different. So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.

1958
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:05,720
Nintendo of course has this on the schedule for late 2016 and of course the rumors are out there

1959
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:10,920
that it could launch on Nintendo NX side by side, but I think they will have to release on Wii U

1960
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:14,600
because they've promised that. But it could be a Twilight Princess type of situation where they

1961
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:21,080
actually release on the GameCube and the Wii, so it'll be, you know, the Wii U and the NX.

1962
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:26,760
So we'll see. All right, we should have enough time to get in the mailbag. Yes, so Dark Soccer

1963
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:31,000
is going to dive into the mailbag and you guys can email us every week over at participate

1964
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:37,000
at orangeloungeradio.com. Again, that's participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an

1965
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:43,080
email. Dark Soccer is going to dive in head first and read the emails right now. Hi, this first one

1966
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:51,400
comes from, well it's unsigned and has no nickname, so I'm just gonna say Sam. Um, it's about Rock Band 4.

1967
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:57,240
I just, uh, just wanted to say back when music games were huge, I purchased Guitar Hero 3 for PC.

1968
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:03,080
The game was a port done by Aspire and when they added in graphics, and they added in graphics

1969
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:08,920
options. The game was a super, was super resource intense, but was gorgeous and ran so much better

1970
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:15,240
than the console options. The only thing that sucked was using the Xbox guitars, as that is what

1971
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:21,560
you had to do, wired ones at that. Just wanted to point out that sometimes the PC port can be badass,

1972
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:27,400
just depending on the port company expertise and love for the platform. Thank you, Sam.

1973
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:37,480
And then, hmm? No, that's it. You were lifting your mic. Oh, sorry. Okay. God, this is a long one. Okay.

1974
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:46,280
Hello, LR. Hi, YYR. Um, I don't normally do this, but back when the Fig campaign for the PC version

1975
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:52,600
of Rock Band 4 went up last week, I was, uh, browsing the site where many of us formally discussed

1976
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:57,960
music games and found a post that basically sums up my argument against it. It was made by user

1977
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:04,680
GTC and here it is. By the way, thinking, speaking of old music sites, you know what shirt I'm wearing

1978
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:13,000
tonight? My DDR spot shirt. That is old school. On top of that, this fit me when I initially got

1979
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,520
the shirt and now it's like a size too big, so. All right, a little reminder about their Amplitude

1980
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:23,400
Kickstarter. No physical rewards are out yet. No updates when they will be sent. The only preview

1981
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:28,760
we've had for physical rewards was a teaser clip of the vinyl test print a few days ago.

1982
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:32,520
Never released the digital art book that was supposed to launch with the game late December.

1983
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:36,440
They never even released the whole soundtrack digitally or even the full campaign soundtrack

1984
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:42,440
minus licenses. PS3 version was supposed to launch alongside or damn near to the PS4 release. No word

1985
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:49,000
on that still. Campaigns talked about the DLC. Now there are no plans for it. So, F-Harmonics,

1986
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:54,760
they're still trying to rebuild Rock Band 4 into something that won't even match Rock Band 3.

1987
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:59,640
They haven't fulfilled their previous campaign and now they're coming around again with their

1988
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:07,400
handout. Fuck that. All right, moving back to this. Back to my personal opinion, my belief is that

1989
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:12,360
it's just plain bad form to start asking for money again before fulfilling the commitments you made

1990
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:16,760
to the last time you asked for money. The only positive thing I saw in their sales pitch was the

1991
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:22,600
Sumo Digital is supposedly handling the port. They are fantastic, rest assured, and I'm certain that

1992
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:27,560
they will do a great job. But the whole thing just feels so disrespectful toward their previous

1993
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:33,560
supporters that I can't bring myself to get on board. On last week's show, you discussed

1994
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:39,640
Microsoft's announcement of rolling Xbox One hardware upgrades. But expressed skepticism

1995
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:44,600
regarding how consumers would receive them. I think there is an easy way to do this that is both

1996
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:50,920
easy to understand and consumer friendly. It takes after the way Capcom handled the last two

1997
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:56,280
Street Fighter IV upgrades, which were released as both a full retail disc and expensive DLC

1998
02:06:56,280 --> 02:07:02,440
for Super Street Fighter IV. Microsoft could call the first upgrade Xbox Two. They could sell it

1999
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:08,360
both as a new console, which would replace Xbox One at retail, and an upgrade module that would

2000
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:14,520
connect to the existing Xbox One, from which could sell for under $200. That makes me think of how

2001
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:25,000
the Famicon disc worked or the 64DD for the Nintendo 64. If they have the strategy in mind

2002
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,720
from the beginning, then they would already have designed the Xbox One to interface with such a

2003
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:36,440
module. Games could then be sold as Xbox One games, which would run on both. Xbox Two games would

2004
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:41,240
require the better hardware. Or games that would run on both with increased performance for Xbox

2005
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:46,840
Two. I would be shocked if in the future, Microsoft encourages developers to create games in the

2006
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:55,320
latter category. Right? Yeah. I think that that's an interesting concept. It still makes me think,

2007
02:07:55,320 --> 02:08:08,440
though, of the Nintendo 64DD or the Famicon disc. There's one paragraph. I didn't know if you were

2008
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:13,800
going to make a comment. I figured their vision of the future is one where a guy can walk into

2009
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:19,080
the store, buy a game that says Xbox, and run it on his console, regardless of which Xbox he has.

2010
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:24,200
But the better his hardware level, the better it will look. Though perhaps we might start thinking

2011
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:28,680
of labels like requires Xbox Two or better. What would you think of a future like this?

2012
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:35,880
Happy World Championship Xboxing YYR. That's it.

2013
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:41,240
All right. Sorry. I missed if there was a question. I got distracted with something

2014
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:44,280
else. Is there a question in there?

2015
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:51,320
I was talking about, first of all, that Harmonix has their handout asking for stuff

2016
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:59,400
when they haven't even fulfilled their previous commitments. So it's very disrespectful to their

2017
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:07,400
initial supporters. And then the second was that you have an Xbox One and then an Xbox Two that

2018
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:12,840
has a port for an upgrade, like an expansion module or something like the 64DD was,

2019
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,400
and that you market the games accordingly.

2020
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:22,200
You know, and I kind of mentioned last week about the whole fact that Nintendo

2021
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:28,360
isn't exactly completely different with the whole the Wii U is kind of an upgraded Wii

2022
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:32,440
is kind of an upgraded GameCube. And I think if they went that way with marketing it,

2023
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:38,120
it may be less confusing. But at the same time, a lot of people thought that the Wii U was just

2024
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:42,440
a Wii upgrade when it was a completely different system. So I think there will still be some

2025
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:48,120
confusion out there. But I think there's ways to do it. If Microsoft gives it a very traditional

2026
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:52,440
sort of naming convention, there's ways to do it. I just don't know if that necessarily means

2027
02:09:52,440 --> 02:10:00,760
they should. So anyway. All right, that's that does it for emails tonight. Participate

2028
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:07,240
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send an email to us in a future week. In the meantime,

2029
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:14,760
let's get to the FUs of the week. Sometimes we get really angry on this show. Why? Because.

2030
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:37,800
FU2 ongoing migraines and actually now adding sinus pain on top of it.

2031
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:44,440
So now I have like I feel what's the double headache, the sinus headache with my normal

2032
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:50,040
migraine. It's not good, but it's time for me to go home anyway. So I will bid everyone adieu.

2033
02:10:50,040 --> 02:11:01,080
Bye. Well, feel better and we'll see you next week here on the show. Shane, I have no FUs.

2034
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:11,000
I don't really have a big FU, just FU2. FU2 really wasting my day yesterday and the rain

2035
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,640
has been nonstop. And I know we need the rain. We're in a drought state and, you know, we need

2036
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:21,480
it. So I shouldn't be complaining about it, but my God, it has been terrible this week. So yeah,

2037
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:28,840
that's it. All right. Let's, uh, let's move on with, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys.

2038
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:34,360
Then we're going to get to phone calls. So Shane. Um, okay. I guess we have to talk about Blizzard

2039
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:41,880
again. There's an expansion coming out for Hearthstone. Uh, it starts, what's it tomorrow?

2040
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:51,880
The 14th. Um, it's called Whispers of the Old Gods. You can pre-purchase a 50 pack bundle of

2041
02:11:51,880 --> 02:12:04,120
cards for $50. You're an idiot if you do that. That's ridiculous. Um, so yeah, go, go, go do

2042
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:11,160
that. You'll play this crappy game. You're not a big fan of Hearthstone? It's fine. It's not a

2043
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:21,880
bad game really, but I just hate Blizzard cause they fired Xero. It's a bad game for bad people

2044
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:26,120
and you should feel bad. I think so. That's correct. You know, some people really enjoy

2045
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:30,680
Hearthstone though. Oh, I know. I have a friend that really, really, I have a couple of friends

2046
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:36,360
that really enjoy it. I know. I know. You can walk by practically anyone's desk and find them

2047
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:41,880
on their lunch playing Hearthstone. And by the way, I forgot to mention next week,

2048
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:46,600
um, I will be on my new schedule, so I will be able to stay for the whole show again.

2049
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:55,160
Hooray. Hey, bye. All right. Have a good one. All right. Uh, let's get to a story on Final Fantasy

2050
02:12:55,160 --> 02:13:02,600
15. Yeah. Final Fantasy 15 is supposed to be an emotional experience that will make you cry

2051
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:06,840
and hopefully not cry at how horrible it is. No, I'm just kidding. It should be great.

2052
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:12,600
But, um, there was a, uh, interview in Game Informer, uh, where, uh, Hajime Tabata,

2053
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:17,240
the director behind Final Fantasy 15 said that he wants to give a moving ending due to the time

2054
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:22,040
that you will invest or that folks will invest playing the game saying, quote, I want to create

2055
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:27,000
a very emotional ending to the game and want to make as many people cry as possible. You're

2056
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,160
spending so many hours playing the game. So when I finish a game and it ends on a sour note and it

2057
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:37,320
doesn't move me, it gets me disappointed. Um, uh, they're taking on the challenge of trying to

2058
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:43,240
exceed that title saying Final Fantasy 7 once more, that Final Fantasy 7 is an inspiration,

2059
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:50,280
uh, for the game. So there you go. Um, very curious to see, uh, uh, what turns out from this game.

2060
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:55,080
Uh, but I would say, you know, 13 had a really good ending. It was short, but I thought...

2061
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:58,520
Don't spoil it. I haven't seen it. I won't, I won't, but I'm just saying it's not,

2062
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:04,120
it's not like 13 was a bad game by any means. I, I really think it was great actually. So,

2063
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:09,880
um, you started talking about that and the whole opera scene from 6 went into my head. Yeah. And

2064
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:19,800
that was a better story than, than 8. I love 8. It's the WB, but in video game form. Uh,

2065
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:24,680
Nintendo maniac in chat says, how do we know that Final Fantasy 15 isn't just going to be an other

2066
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:31,880
M? Don't buy into any hype for anything. No, I suppose anything's possible. So, uh, there you go.

2067
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:38,200
Uh, also a rumor that Final Fantasy 15 is going to be releasing in September. And I would think

2068
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:44,760
a release for this year makes a lot of sense. Uh, September 30th is the date that is being rumored,

2069
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:50,760
uh, corroborated by three independent sources. Uh, there is an event by the way in Los Angeles

2070
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:54,920
on March 30th, where I would expect we're going to hear this date and price information,

2071
02:14:54,920 --> 02:15:00,120
um, September 30th as a launch day makes a lot of sense. It's before the holiday period,

2072
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:04,760
but far enough into it where it will still be on many, uh, Christmas and holiday lists. Um,

2073
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:10,280
but not like so far out, you know, it will compete with the other holiday stuff. So

2074
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:14,840
we'll see what happens. But everybody hopefully at that point will still be too engrossed in

2075
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:23,160
Persona 5 to care. We shall see. All right. Uh, let's get to the Skype line. Orange Lounge Radio,

2076
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:28,040
all one word on Skype is the place to call. Um, please give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio,

2077
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:34,680
all one word on Skype, or you can give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Uh, if you want to do it the old

2078
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:44,680
fashioned way, but the Skype line is open now. Um, so, oh, thank heavens the phone is already

2079
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:47,720
ringing. Cause usually Loki does last minute stories, but I don't think Shane's prepared

2080
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:53,640
for that. I would just play with my, my morpher and it'd be like this. All right. Uh, hi, you're

2081
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:58,040
on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Rama. Hey Rama, how you doing? Pretty good,

2082
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:04,440
but I have an interesting question for you before we begin. Okay, try me. You listen to

2083
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:13,480
mainstream radio? Once in a while, not like all the time. Yeah. I mean, the only time I actually

2084
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:18,600
listen to mainstream radio is when I'm hanging out with Mako-chan because there's only one decent

2085
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:23,080
rock station in her area that we listen to. And then when we get out of the area for that,

2086
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:26,200
we actually pull up the app and continue streaming from there.

2087
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:34,680
I, I love that. Um, yeah. And you know, I, I don't get me wrong. Like I do listen mostly

2088
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:40,200
to Spotify and podcasts and VOG, especially when there's like live stuff and premiere stuff, but,

2089
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:45,560
you know, once in a while I have to stay on task on what's on the radios and so forth. So.

2090
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:52,920
I guess, I mean, at work, since we do have like access to groove radio throughout the store,

2091
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:58,520
everyone has like a different playlist and I'm not one for mainstream radio and I hear this

2092
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:04,280
music. I'm just like, this is what's going for music. And then I just go into the break room,

2093
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:09,160
put my headphones on. Am I listening to J-pop or I'm listening to something from the 80s

2094
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:19,240
or the 90s, or I'm just like deep into my 3DS. Hmm. Well, I, I apologize that I, uh, I'm sticking

2095
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:26,760
with the, uh, uh, terrestrial radio, but whatever. Well, Hey, somebody has to, like I said,

2096
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:31,000
in a blue moon, I will do the same thing. Yeah. So what else is on your mind tonight?

2097
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,640
I just also want to say in regards to the beginning of the show, if Shane is going to go

2098
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:41,000
on his video game, uh, drought, he's going to switch over to ranger toys. You, you know, this.

2099
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:45,240
What do you mean switch? Yeah. That's naughty. Like that's its own thing. That's never going to

2100
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:51,640
go away. That already happened. I spent so much on Jojo already. Like I have all the

2101
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:56,920
toys that have come out that are important. And we went to like four targets and two

2102
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:03,320
toys or us is today. Yeah. He won't give that up. Okay, fine. He'll increase the budget for it.

2103
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:11,480
Yeah, I can see that. Yeah. I'm fine with that. That's great. That just means I can get a cube

2104
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:19,320
gorilla when it comes out and a cube rhinos. That works for me. Fair enough. Fair enough.

2105
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:26,760
So is that you just called into a taunt chain? Uh, no, no, no. Well that, and it was my turn,

2106
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:31,880
but one more thing and I'm going to just, I'm gonna get up on out of here. Now in regards to

2107
02:18:32,440 --> 02:18:38,280
Twitch, you mentioned earlier, I have noticed that within my circle, there are people who

2108
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:45,000
Twitch stream, but they do more than just Twitch stream. They're on there doing commentary with

2109
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:50,920
programming that they're watching or they're working on costumes, doing artwork and stuff

2110
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:56,600
like that. It's getting to the point where if they stream five days a week, maybe three,

2111
02:18:56,600 --> 02:19:01,320
four of those days, they'll be Twitch game streaming. And the other day they'll be doing

2112
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:06,440
other hobbies and stuff. And I'm like, that kind of sort of defeats the purpose of what

2113
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:13,640
Twitch TV is for, but I get it, you know? Well, Twitch TV also kind of expanded not that

2114
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:17,960
long ago into the more creative outlets, which is why the Bob Ross thing had happened in the

2115
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:26,520
first place. So Twitch wants people to expand more into that and do that. But, you know,

2116
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:30,360
it's kind of like one of those, where do you draw the line? Because I can definitely see where

2117
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:35,960
costume making, video game talk shows, that's all part of the gaming community,

2118
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:41,160
certainly doing the artwork and so forth, but is watching a movie and doing live commentary?

2119
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:48,440
Probably not. So, no, I mean, if I really want to watch a movie, do commentary. I can just

2120
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:53,720
round up people, my friends on Skype, turn my webcam towards my TV and put something on and

2121
02:19:53,720 --> 02:20:01,800
we can all have a field day doing it. Yeah. But, you know, that's up to Twitch, I guess,

2122
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:06,600
to draw the line. But it's interesting because a lot of this stuff was on Justin TV before,

2123
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:10,520
and then they ended up closing that down. But Justin TV also did a lot of life stuff,

2124
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:16,200
which was just, hey, here's the webcam pointed at me doing actually nothing. So, I don't know.

2125
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:24,760
Point taken. So, yeah, it'll be up to Twitch to draw the line on that stuff. But, you know,

2126
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:29,160
if people are having fun and making content that people seem to enjoy, I think that personal stuff

2127
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:35,480
makes it more interesting. I don't necessarily like to just watch a game with nothing on it.

2128
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:38,920
Ironically, that's what I'll use YouTube for. I think YouTube's almost a little better just

2129
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:44,440
getting the plain game streaming, game play stuff, like long play, I guess you would call it. But,

2130
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:48,440
you know, if I'm going to watch Twitch and watch somebody doing it live with the chat room and all

2131
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:53,000
that stuff, I kind of want to be able to interact with people and get some more of that personality.

2132
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,000
You know what I mean? Yeah, I get what you're saying. I get what you're saying. Yeah. So,

2133
02:20:57,640 --> 02:21:02,600
all right. Interesting comment. Kaijuto in chat says Periscope kicks Twitch's ass.

2134
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:08,520
You know, I know Periscope is definitely a growing thing for the live video and Facebook badly wants

2135
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:14,760
a piece of that too. So, interesting. All right. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?

2136
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:21,800
Major Nelson says hi. I saw that on Facebook. He had no idea who we were. Come on.

2137
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:27,560
But still, I did say I would try and he did say hello. All right. Well, I appreciate that. He

2138
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:30,280
always said that because he had to and he didn't want to look like a jerk, but no, I seriously

2139
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:35,000
appreciate that. That's so funny that you did that. Are you kidding me? He was in the break room

2140
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:41,240
chilling out with us, having a good time. Okay. Well, that's cool. He's a normal human being. He

2141
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:46,200
will relax in the break room sometimes too. Yes. Yes. And next time I'll tell you a Major

2142
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:51,880
Nelson story. All right. Sounds good. Awesome. All right. Take care, buddy. You too. Yep. Bye.

2143
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:59,160
All right. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to do that the

2144
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:05,080
old fashioned way. Um, I don't really have any last minute stories tonight, unfortunately, but

2145
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:10,360
oh, good. The phone is going off. So let's get to it. Hello. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's

2146
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:17,000
this? Hello. It's Embryon. Hey, what's up? I am calling to say hello. Hello. Good to hear you.

2147
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Like, what's up? Yeah. So I was thinking about you, uh, this weekend because I found an old book

2148
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:30,440
of CDs in my, the trunk of my friend's car. I don't know how they got in there, but they were

2149
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:37,400
my book of CDs from like a decade ago. And among those CDs, I had all of these Bimani mixes in

2150
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:43,720
addition to these like unmarked MP3 CDs that were hundreds of tracks long. And, uh, I was listening

2151
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:51,160
to, one of them had the Erotic Hour Megamix on it. Oh my God. It is everything to this day.

2152
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:59,160
I cannot get enough of Erotic. That's, that type of music is why DDR was so fun. Is it brought

2153
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:03,960
that stupid cheese ball pop music? I say that in the best possible way. It brought all that stupid

2154
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:08,120
cheese ball pop music into my life. And for that, I'm always going to be thankful for DDR.

2155
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:12,680
I know, me too. It's just like, it's funny because I remember when I was younger, um,

2156
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:16,600
the question that kids like to ask you to suss out if you're cool or not, it's like,

2157
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:21,240
what kind of music do you listen to? Or who do you like? And I don't always be like, oh, um,

2158
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:27,880
you know, Erotic. Uh, I like, uh, Naoki Yoshida or not Naoki Yoshida. What's his name? Naoki.

2159
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:28,360
Midea.

2160
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:31,080
Midea. I'm thinking of the Final Fantasy producer.

2161
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:31,580
You are.

2162
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:36,280
I'm getting my Naoki's mixed up. I'd always come up with these, like these, uh,

2163
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:41,240
DDR in-house artists and be like, yeah, that's who I like. And they'd be like,

2164
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:43,640
oh, it sounds pretty underground. Cool.

2165
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:48,200
Dr. Tsuya in chat says, I think they're still around. I think referring to Erotic.

2166
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:52,680
Yeah. There was some video, uh, that they, they did a song called, I think, Murder Me.

2167
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:59,080
It was on Facebook. I just saw some random thing. So I think they are back. But of course those,

2168
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:03,640
those groups never had the same singers for more than like five years. So, you know,

2169
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:09,320
Like, uh, that happened with Etro Anime. They did the opening theme song to Digital Devil Saga,

2170
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:13,720
which is where my name is from. And, uh, they put out a second album years later with a different

2171
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:19,720
singer and I was like, man, it's just not the same. So Erotic, I guess suffers a similar fate.

2172
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:22,040
Suffers? I don't know. I haven't heard the new stuff. So maybe it's great.

2173
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:27,080
It's, it's just as silly as the old stuff. At least what I heard.

2174
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:29,640
Fritz really, really loves her tits.

2175
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:36,280
Man, some of that old school DDR music was so, so good and so silly though.

2176
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:40,440
I love how they're all like the same song with a different rap. Well, it's like this,

2177
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:43,880
it's almost the same rhythm and everything, but it's just different words.

2178
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:45,960
Anyway.

2179
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:51,240
Indeed. Actually, I was just going to say, I, I could for, for just, I can play a little clip

2180
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:55,320
just for listeners that have no idea what we're talking about, that missed the whole DDR thing.

2181
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:57,560
Here, here's, here's a sample of what you're missing. You ready?

2182
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:17,160
Like how stupid is that song? Seriously.

2183
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:18,600
And they're all like that.

2184
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,960
They are all like that.

2185
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:22,600
But I was totally doing the like head bobbing.

2186
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,960
I probably still remember the steps on DDR to that song.

2187
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:31,160
Oh yeah. Oh my God. Good times.

2188
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:35,080
Good times. I would definitely listen. You know what? If we ever go on a road trip someday,

2189
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:38,280
we'll have to jam to those CDs.

2190
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:39,640
Oh yeah. For sure.

2191
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,520
For sure.

2192
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:43,640
That's it. I just wanted to call in and reminisce a little bit about Erotic,

2193
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:45,320
my long forgotten love.

2194
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:48,520
No, I appreciate the walk down memory lane. And I think it's a good chance for all the

2195
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:53,640
old school DDR fans to just revisit or go listen. If you, if you happen to have them or have access

2196
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:58,120
to them, wink, wink, go listen to one of those old dance mania albums. It'll just take you back.

2197
02:25:58,120 --> 02:25:59,400
Oh, they're so good.

2198
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:01,320
Good times. All right. Take care of my friend.

2199
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:01,720
You too.

2200
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:02,600
Good to hear from you. Bye-bye.

2201
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:03,880
Bye.

2202
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:09,560
All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2203
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:12,920
Dark Tetsuya is hinting a road trip to round one. Hint, hint. You know,

2204
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:17,560
I think if I were to bust up that as the soundtrack on a round one road trip,

2205
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:20,920
I think Shane may have a problem with that.

2206
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:21,400
Yep.

2207
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:22,120
So yeah.

2208
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,160
Definitely.

2209
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:27,240
But I'll try. He makes me listen to a lot of weird stuff. Although we usually listen

2210
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,480
to the FOMMC 14 soundtrack and that's something...

2211
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,440
It just comes up a lot.

2212
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:34,520
We can kind of agree on that one. There's a lot of good stuff on that. Like the Alexander

2213
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:38,680
raid song and what was that you're playing today? The Separat song is great.

2214
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:38,920
Yes.

2215
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:40,760
Like industrial music. It's so good.

2216
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:42,360
It is.

2217
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:45,080
Like you don't even really need to play that game. The game is fine,

2218
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:50,040
but the music is where it's at for Final Fantasy 14. Just get the soundtracks.

2219
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:51,720
Sometimes that's actually better than the game.

2220
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:57,640
That guy, Soken, does such a good job with the soundtrack. He really does.

2221
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:05,640
Yes. I'm guessing that you're doing something, so I'm trying to fill time.

2222
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:09,960
No, I was actually trying to find... Here it is. Just so you guys could hear a little bit of it.

2223
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:22,200
This is actually battle music in 14.

2224
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:26,120
The fight is really fun.

2225
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:45,320
You like skip around a bit, don't you?

2226
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:49,320
And I'll tell you what, hearing that music when you're actually trying to do a boss fight...

2227
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:50,360
You did a good part.

2228
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,040
Love it. It's so good.

2229
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:05,080
It gets you going during one of these boss fights. Especially when you have no idea

2230
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:10,360
like what the F is going on in the fight. It's insane. You're just like,

2231
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:11,960
Oh my God. Oh my God. It's crazy.

2232
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:13,480
I'm going to listen to that as I drive.

2233
02:28:13,480 --> 02:28:18,440
Let's see. Embryon is actually in our chat room saying,

2234
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:22,200
The first time I heard that song, I screamed. Couldn't decide if it was hilarious or super

2235
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:26,040
energizing. Why not both? It's not hilarious. It's amazing.

2236
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:30,360
It is amazing. It's great. Let's see. Fifth Dream yells,

2237
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:33,320
This is what it's like when worlds collide. Yeah, I think we talked about that some time

2238
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:37,960
ago that Powerman 5000 took issue with that. Who knew that Powerman 5000 was still around?

2239
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:41,320
Who knew? It sounded more like a Nine Inch Nails song to me, but different singer.

2240
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:45,400
All right. Well, I guess nobody else is calling in, so that is going to do it for the Skype

2241
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:50,120
line tonight. But if you think of something late and you want to chime in later, you can always

2242
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:53,560
leave us an email. Participate at orangelandradio.com. You can also tweet at us,

2243
02:28:53,560 --> 02:28:56,760
twitter.com slash O-L-R. I do read all the tweets you guys send this week.

2244
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:00,680
But I believe that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Land Radio.

2245
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:04,600
If you like what you heard here at the show, please consider telling a friend or two about

2246
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:10,120
the show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we don't

2247
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:16,600
know the voice unless you guys actually use them. So send us your emails and so

2248
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:23,720
forth. We would really appreciate it. I think that is it. Shane, do you have any

2249
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:26,200
final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Thank you for being here and filling in.

2250
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:27,560
No problem. I appreciate that.

2251
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:30,840
No, I don't have any final thoughts.

2252
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:33,800
All right. Well, we'll probably see you again in a few weeks.

2253
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:38,120
No, because my schedule also changes at work, so this won't be a thing that will be happening.

2254
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:42,280
Oh, no. So we won't see you for a while. Well, nope. Good luck with Ranger Pride.

2255
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:43,640
Good riddance. Thank you.

2256
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:49,960
What do you mean good riddance? Screw you. I never liked you anyway. All right. That's it.

2257
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:53,640
We're done. We'll be back next week. Hopefully, Loki will be back and Dark Soccer will be here

2258
02:29:53,640 --> 02:30:00,840
as well. And we'll tackle the latest in news as we move on up to SAC Indie Game Arcade in April

2259
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:05,400
and lots of other great events coming up. So stay tuned with us here at Orange Land Radio.

2260
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:07,480
Thanks. We'll see you again in seven days. Goodbye.
