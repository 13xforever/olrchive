14000	27000	Tonight it's the return of IGDA Sacramento. Join us for an interview with Brianna and Gabe for all things gaming and indie game development. This more rumor mongering and rumor debunking are among just a few topics we'll cover tonight and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 636 of our show for March the 27th of 2016.
46000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts here to talk with you about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Live in studio with my co-hosts say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
57000	58000	Sup
58000	59000	Hey how you doing?
59000	60000	I'm full
60000	63000	Full of BS that she's going to spew all over the show tonight
63000	64000	Girl please
64000	65000	I'm just teasing you
65000	66000	After I bring you cookies
67000	72000	She didn't just bring me cookies, she brought me like my favorite cookies
72000	73000	Macaroons
73000	76000	Coconut and chocolate and I've already eaten four
76000	89000	That's okay I've had about as many today. We had Belgian waffles and muffins and like all of the carby things in the world. Like looking at it would just give you diabetes by association
90000	100000	Well it's a holiday we earned it I guess. My mom called today and we were talking a little bit and she said you're still doing a show on Easter?
100000	108000	And I'm like yeah? And she's like how are you? I said it's me and my Jewish girlfriend. She doesn't care about Easter
108000	118000	I think most people that do Easter stuff kind of get it over with in the morning so I think usually by the evening everybody's kind of pretty free
118000	124000	Except for unfortunately Techmaster Loki. He would be the exception of somebody that is doing something with Easter evening
124000	131000	Actually I think it's the fact I think he went to the Bay Area today for family stuff so sadly not joining us in the studio Techmaster Loki
131000	137000	But we do have filling in tonight we are happy to have somebody who doesn't have to work today due to the holiday
137000	139000	Say hello everybody to Alan
139000	140000	Hello

148000	149000	Yes
149000	157000	Because I can tell you first hand there is a game that he stays up until 3am playing every night and I'm always asking
157000	160000	How have you not finished this game yet? You are still playing it
160000	165000	I'll get into that there's a very specific reason I haven't finished the main story and I'll get into it
165000	171000	Alright fair enough I'll leave you guys guessing over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
171000	178000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

184000	191000	But we do have some other very special guests in the studio tonight I want to introduce here at the top of the show tonight before we get into our gaming weeks
191000	198000	I've been promoting this for a couple weeks so this shouldn't surprise anybody but maybe they're new to the show or what have you
198000	206000	Welcome back to the studio from the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA, International Game Developers Association
206000	208000	Say hello to Gabe
208000	210000	Good evening
210000	211000	And Brianna
211000	212000	Hi
212000	213000	Hi how's it going you guys?

214000	216000	Thank you for coming back
216000	217000	Thank you for letting us come back
217000	219000	I'm glad we didn't scare you off last time
219000	221000	Never you'll take a lot more than that
221000	227000	God they just left a mess at the Colonial and no I'm just kidding we always do our best to clean our stuff up
227000	228000	But welcome back to the show
228000	230000	Thank you so much it's an honor
230000	236000	I know you guys are here to talk about your big event here locally the Sacramento Indie Game Festival
236000	238000	Did I get that right or is it the Indie Game Expo?
238000	239000	I always mess that up
239000	243000	It's a bunch of different things but it is the Sacramento Indie Arcade Expo
243000	248000	You know what people need to know it's Indie Games and it's fun and just be there like it doesn't matter what it's called
248000	251000	They can call it like Rainbows and Kittens Fest and you should just still go
251000	253000	We should probably do that next year
253000	256000	Those are actually two wonderful things I think you might even you know
256000	261000	There's something we can roll with that I smell unicorns versus bunny rabbits we can do something
261000	262000	Well it is Easter so you know
262000	264000	That's true we totally could
264000	270000	But the SAC Indie Arcade is going to be in two weeks right now we won't be here next Sunday
270000	275000	I've told the listeners that I'm actually on a personal out of town trip so we won't be here next Sunday
275000	283000	But the Saturday after next which is April 9th is the event here in West Sacramento right?
283000	285000	Yup yup too big for Sacramento we gotta go West
285000	287000	Go West
287000	289000	Yes that's what I did
289000	290000	That's right
290000	291000	Yeah I came from New Jersey
291000	297000	That's right you came here from New Jersey settled a new life here in Sacramento and now it just keeps moving West
297000	301000	What do people have to look forward to at SAC Indie Arcade 2016?
301000	306000	I think the two words that and I've been trying to wrap my head around this
306000	308000	Professionally fun
308000	316000	I think that's going to be the main thing for this event because you're going to have you're going to see an incredible amount of indie game developers
316000	323000	But you're also going to learn how to be one of them or work with one of them you know if you want to
323000	329000	It's you know it's that's essentially what this event is all about it's going to be fun a huge amount of fun
329000	337000	You know good good music gaming tournaments you know a lot of nerd banter and then but you're also going to learn
337000	345000	You're going to hear from a lot of experts and leaders in the industry within Sacramento and the Bay Area and beyond
345000	353000	I learned honestly and this is not just a line I learned so much last year from attending just because you know
353000	358000	Look we do we do talk about games we've been talking about them a very long time here at Orange Mountains Radio
358000	363000	But I don't know a lot when it comes to how to actually sit down and make one
363000	368000	You know granted I've done levels in ZZT which I'm very proud of on the PC
368000	375000	A little big planet or some of those get Mario maker love that one you know things that enable you know with those easy
375000	380000	Creation tools, but it I and I have found because we tried to do this thing earlier in the year the vogjam
380000	384000	And I I really tried to sit down and learn unity for me in my time
384000	388000	It was just a beast like it's so much work that goes into it
388000	394000	And I think you kind of have to you know know a little bit about you got to know a little bit of logic to understand programming too
394000	398000	And yeah, you know that's like learning math some people are good at it some people need help
398000	402000	I think one of the you makes you makes it you made an interesting point
402000	405000	I don't it's it's not just the because for me
405000	409000	I thought it was all the animation the 3D graphics because that's what got my attention in the first place
409000	412000	But it's for but for me it's like what makes a fun game
412000	416000	You know like any you know the level design the level design aspect of it
416000	422000	And just knowing what game it starts with looking at a game that you that you adore with your heart
422000	429000	And then asking yourself how could I do better than that and then then coming to a lot of
429000	432000	Forced realities where you know on one end
432000	438000	Damn, I'm gonna make this more fun than this you know because this inspired me and then on the other end
438000	442000	It's gonna be well. I don't have the budget to make something this big
442000	445000	How do I do better with less
445000	450000	Well, but at the SAC indie arcade you know you can network with other people
450000	455000	And I know this is also through IGDA is that you know you don't necessarily have to be a unity beast
455000	461000	To be interested in IGDA because maybe you're somebody who wants to be a voice actor or a level designer
461000	463000	Or a musician I know is a big one too
463000	469000	Yes, there are so many other elements that go into games that you don't necessarily have to be a game
469000	472000	Like the actual game maker to get stuff out of IGDA
472000	478000	Yeah, and I'm living proof of that. I'm the idea person. That's me. I'm an idea man
478000	481000	I just I you know for me I came to
481000	486000	Accept and understand my limitations some years ago. You know I can't code. I can't do art
486000	489000	I can't do animation as much as I love those things. I can't do it
489000	494000	So what good am I if I want to make if I want to start a game studio make a game at all
494000	496000	So I said I can write and I can do a little bit of music
496000	501000	Write my ideas down and then find someone who can hopefully believe in what I'm doing and that's that
501000	509000	Yeah, I remember one really awesome speaker you guys had I mean you guys had Kate the president of IGDA
509000	514000	Last year it was wonderful to hear her speak and to you know we were talking with her too
514000	517000	And that was right at all the height of some of the like Twitter drama last year
517000	520000	Yeah, and so you know having a very frank conversation about that
520000	526000	You know it was great, and she was very eloquent in the way. She was speaking about that so she was very great
526000	531000	I remember one of my favorite speakers you guys had last year very dynamic was this lady that you had from
531000	536000	I think she was like a business association downtown. I want to say it was like a women's business
536000	542000	But like she made it very clear like you don't necessarily have to be a woman to be in this association
542000	546000	And she it made me think about like oh my gosh
546000	551000	If I'm a game designer and I make my product and I want to you know
551000	552000	You know put it on unity
552000	555640	And then it's like okay now I want to go on Steam Greenlight, and then all of a sudden. It's oh shit
555640	561000	I'm a business owner mmm-hmm. I didn't even think about this end of thing we don't we know we don't we never do
561000	564920	Yeah, never never we're so focused on the game. We're not thinking about the legalities
564920	567720	We're not thinking about anything else. You know like oh my god
567720	573000	I have to trademark my title because someone else is doing it in another country or in another state and whatever the case may be
573000	578280	So and it's happened so even some of our own people here in Sacramento people had to change names last minute
578280	580320	Oh, and and they would spend a good year
581280	585760	Talking to their game about you know talking to their you about their game and sharing it and everything like that and all of a
585760	589320	Sudden we see them again a couple months later, and it's a total different game title
589320	594960	They were like what just happened, and then they're like remember that session. We've had some time ago. Oh
595520	600040	Oh, I'm sorry so yeah, but but that's important like if we don't do that now
601040	607540	When so yeah um and I just remember and I didn't get the sense that she was a big gamer
607940	614020	But she was but she you know how I knew she was smart because she was really good at adapting and I swear she read
614020	618060	It off some dude's t-shirt in the front row. She did she started going cuz she even delivered the line
618060	625220	She goes it's dangerous to go alone and everybody in the audience cheers is like oh, yeah, this chick plays Zelda. She's hardcore, right?
625940	628180	She read it off the dude's t-shirt in the front row
628340	633740	She and she made it she made a point with it because she was right right and when you go into business
633740	636460	That is a scary thing to take on when you are
636460	642260	I just I love that she like made that up on the fly up. It was probably connected with the audience
642260	646180	Yeah, it was by far the greatest part of the entire event the entire event was fantastic
646180	651820	But when she said that I said we're not even an hour an hour and a half into this event and I'm done
651820	657500	I could leave that's right. We could leave because I was crying Brianna was crying. We were we were dying
658140	661740	We're done. Yeah, that's it ship at home all right awesome awesome
662300	666320	Brianna I know you guys have been busy booking guests and events for this year
666320	671480	Tell us a little bit about some of the things that people have to look forward to it sack indie arcade festival
671480	675860	So in addition to the professional aspect where you'll get to hear from a speaker
676540	683020	panel of speakers with from diverse areas of the game industry everything from education to
684240	686240	What is it motion capture?
687240	692160	Virtual reality even to some of the ethical portions you'll have a chance so if you just love playing games
692160	696200	That's also what the Sacramento indie arcade is about we want you to come out have fun
696840	704860	Bring your friends family cousins whoever you'll get to play some old retro console games by consolecade and cafe colonial
705200	711600	They're hosting a little exhibit, and then we also have our friend Bill Kendrick with Atari party at a Dave love Atari party
711600	713120	I went for the first time
713160	715640	Between the last time you guys were here and this year
715640	718160	I went for the first time what a great event that was Dan
718160	723920	And I always participate every year with bringing our 5200 yeah, so awesome. Love it. I love that Atari's gonna be there
723920	731500	Yes, Bill has been fantastic in helping us with them promotion for the event so he's gonna have a bigger setup this year
732080	734080	And he's bringing his own volunteers
736200	742980	So for people listening who may not have ever touched an Atari and you're local to Sacramento come on out and see what that's about
743640	745000	You know it always gets me
745000	749360	You know it always gets me in the fields as this like late 30-something jaded old gamer is
749800	753980	When I go to these events where the Atari's are around and like seven-year-old kids are
754680	757840	And I'm like oh my god. It's me, but like
758560	763640	That was us, but this kid is like seeing kind of like what we went through like type of thing
763640	769200	It's it's got to be the way like my parents feel when I watch like the Grapes of Wrath or something some old ass
770200	773360	I mean, he's gotta be John Wayne like similar, right?
773360	773840	I don't know
773840	777360	But it's like it gets me in the fields and I see the kids playing it and they're actually having fun
777360	780640	And they're not like going like it's all there
780640	786880	It's why is it all green you know and I think what you brought up now really hit me in the heart last year when?
786880	793160	I was just kind of observing our guests that came through is we have parents who have a you know background in Atari
793160	797960	And that's what they used to play and now they're bringing their kids. I didn't expect as many families to come out as they did
798640	804840	So that really you know melted my heart to see that and then we've also introduced board and card games this year
804840	810640	So you'll get a chance to play new games by local board and card game developers as well, so we've got any developers
810640	812640	We're gonna have capital fight district
813640	816240	Taking care of our game tournaments. We have Street Fighter
817160	823160	Super Smash Brothers, so it's gonna be an all-around are we having poking because I know how to button mash and poking
824160	826160	Gabriel
827320	834760	Well I don't think we might we might okay, yes can't confirm or deny okay cool come and find out
837680	839920	That's okay, that's okay, if nothing else
839920	843280	I'll bring my Wii U and you can find the poking over by vogue that works, too
843600	845040	And we will be there
845040	847160	We're gonna we're gonna be set up in the theater
847640	850980	Helping to run all the panels and thank you for asking us to do that
850980	852460	I'm so excited to be a part of that
852460	857580	I'm so glad to have found you guys and you found us and it's a beautiful thing that that came together
857580	858100	Yes
858100	863460	anything like I said anything we can do to help and I do want to because I know we have an international we're very fortunate that
863460	868020	We have an international audience that listens to Orange, Montreal. You know we do have a few listeners in Sacramento, and I'm always surprised
868020	869260	I'm like oh you're local
869260	875380	I never do that, but we have listeners that are in New York City or you know that are in Florida or you know Europe
875380	878460	You know possibly even so they might be wondering like okay well
879060	883300	Am I just am I gonna fast-forward through this cuz I don't live in Sacramento, so I can't go to this event
883300	885140	I would say no for to read
885140	889300	There's there's two very important reasons we still talk about this even though it might not be local for you
889300	891300	and you can't realistically attend a
891900	895840	You know I'm gonna pimp some sort of live stream. We're gonna be broadcasting this
896660	902580	Didn't I hear this year? We're gonna be doing our best to do the vlog stream again on Saturday fingers crossed
903020	909260	Our wife our Wi-Fi isn't it because it's a new location our Wi-Fi will not be having to go through a concrete wall this year
909700	915020	So we're a lot more you know and I was even like just tell me where the damn box is
915020	916660	I've got a 50-foot cord. We'll make it work
916660	919700	We'll put a nice rug so people don't trip, but anyway all that stuff aside
919700	922420	We're gonna do our best to do that, but I heard I don't know if this got worked out
922420	926660	We're gonna do some well not us, but you guys are gonna be doing some twitch stuff too, right?
926660	932100	Yes, our friend Jay with capital fight district is hopefully going to be streaming
932580	937300	His tournaments and the event on twitch this year nice. That'd be great
937740	941380	And then of course the second reason why I still think this is important is that okay?
941380	946280	So we're talking about this here in Sacramento, and you might be thinking. Oh, I can't really go to that event well chances
946280	949660	Are folks there's an IGDA chapter in your neck of the woods?
950300	952540	They're probably doing an event like this
952540	954540	Maybe not same time, but at some point
954620	960760	So you know if you have any type of interest in games you seek it out if you're I imagine any major city in America
960760	966300	There's probably an IGDA chapter there in addition to the IGDA chapters around the world if you are listening to
966820	972960	Olr anywhere in the world and you hear about a certain game that we might talk about tonight or that Rob
973560	978000	Mentions during the show you know our game developers sell their games internationally, too
978000	983260	You can download them from the App Store you can go on steam, so we're really just kind of promoting
983260	985900	What's here in Sacramento, but if you love Rob in the show?
987040	989720	You might love some of the games that they're gonna talk about too
990380	994460	Awesome yeah, I think I think that was the first place that Loki had done
994460	999880	VR ever was that Sakai GDA last year, so you know we all get to try things for the first time
999880	1005760	And there were some really great games that were at the festival last year, so I'm looking forward to seeing how they've evolved
1006360	1010040	Or what new stuff I'm gonna see this year. Do we get some new stuff this year?
1010040	1014100	We do get some new stuff. We have some developers coming up from Southern, California also
1014920	1019580	Nice yeah, we have one from yeah red the game is called red cobra
1019940	1023360	And they're coming all the way from San Diego, so yeah
1023360	1027460	I had connected with them a few times when they did some indie events down there
1028340	1033900	And pretty crazy move from you to just like you know oh going to San Diego to meet a bunch of strange people
1033900	1036760	I ain't never met before, but that's how determined I was to
1037340	1044020	Try to somehow create some sort of inner inner connectivity within the indie scene even if it meant me only going a couple of times
1044020	1047260	But they remember me we all stay in touch
1047260	1050060	And and now anytime they try to do something
1050060	1054180	They're like can you help us or are you coming down and you know the last couple times?
1054180	1059980	I wasn't able to but it's fine because now they're coming here, and that still says something that made my
1060580	1066460	Little investment in that trip worth it because now I've given them the opportunity where they would have not
1066620	1072220	Had an opportunity otherwise and now they're gonna be able to tell their people down there like well
1072380	1075940	It's not happening in San Diego. Why don't we go up here road trip?
1076260	1083940	So yeah, so we've got you know we definitely our arms have been stretched out a bit further this time, and it's it's wonderful well
1083940	1085720	Congratulations, that's awesome
1085720	1089560	And I know even there was some stuff that I remember going to an event up in Reno
1089700	1094240	Yes, I know you're in touch with them mm-hmm, so yeah, you kind of get get all over yep
1094240	1097180	You're making a name for Sacramento. Yeah, we're the cat. We're the capital
1097700	1099460	We have to
1099460	1103100	Going to our chat room over at live dot vog network calm
1103540	1106580	Why why are one of our favorite indie developers is in the chat room
1106580	1110820	We like why we are because he's actually made games based on inside jokes on orange on radio. I
1111740	1118700	I literally shit you not. It's he made a game called pixel shits. That was based off a joke here on olr
1118700	1121260	That's like an Atari remember how I came up with the name
1121260	1124760	I don't I don't either, but it was an attorney like he literally like it's this Atari
1125020	1129300	2600 style game where you actually like little dudes are running through a park
1129340	1134580	And you actually leave little shit piles for them to get stuck in and then they don't make it across the park
1134660	1142060	But the this is the this is the part that like like every game needs that twist that just makes it like oh my god
1142060	1149080	This is amazing the twist in this game is when you when your poo meter runs out you go to the Taco Bell in the corner
1155060	1157860	Yes, well wasn't that our White Castle I mean absolutely
1159300	1160620	That's wonderful
1160620	1165860	But also why we are he was actually showing at magfest and we just talked about last week his game
1166060	1171180	Multitasking got greenlit and a big part of that was because the word-of-mouth he got at magfest
1171180	1175460	Yeah, so getting your game out to these festivals. Yeah, you have to yeah, you have to yeah
1175980	1181640	there is a there is a challenge of course being you know I mean and I know this because I
1182420	1188560	co-run the department for magfest at the indie showcase, but you know because we had I think we had
1189300	1191300	for the latest round
1191620	1196500	Yeah for this latest event. We I think had hundred fifty two hundred submissions
1196500	1201400	Oh my god, and we only accepted like it probably a third of them. If that how do you say? No
1201940	1206780	There you know and and and I mean this for any and I apologize
1206780	1211460	Well, I sort of apologize to any developers out there who really work hard but may have missed things
1211460	1215140	But I don't apologize to those developers who really never bothered to make the effort
1215500	1222100	Because for some it was very easy to say no because they just never bothered sure and I mean that in the nicest most adult
1222100	1224500	Mature way possible. You have to have a little bit of enthusiasm
1224940	1226300	Yeah, yeah
1226300	1226820	Yeah
1226820	1234020	and you know when when someone's doing it for the actual reason and when whether it's is if
1234020	1236100	Are they just trying to make a quick buck?
1236100	1243460	You're gonna you can tell you can absolutely tell but when there's heart in it you you definitely see that that's when it gets difficult
1243460	1247700	Because then when you see others that have maybe one game was made with heart
1247700	1252540	But then there was another one made with heart but more fully fleshed out then. Yeah it that's where it becomes a little difficult
1252540	1258180	So yeah, very very challenging and and you know, fortunately for us at the indie arcade
1258620	1262000	For for our event we haven't I haven't gone there yet
1262000	1266140	I've essentially put blind faith in my people because a lot of them I already know what they're doing
1266420	1268380	So it's not it's not a challenge
1268380	1272900	So it's to see who's doing what and I just I have to make this clear in chat because why we are is like is
1272900	1274900	This why I got wait-listed at magfest
1275580	1280620	Gabe did not do magfest this year. I didn't do that. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, he did not do magfest
1282060	1288340	No, where is why anyway he is out in New York. Yeah, my neighbor my old neighbor cool
1288340	1292420	Well, have you ever come to Sacramento dude? Yeah, I'll let you you're accepted right right then and there
1293020	1295620	We will talk off air because my understanding is that could be happening
1296780	1299620	At least for a visit at least. Okay, so all right
1300380	1304280	Let's see also comments in chat actually why we're had said something else to that
1304280	1308180	I thought was worth repeating here over from our chat room live dog network calm
1308460	1314260	Why are say gameplay design level design art design story design if applicable game creation?
1314420	1317820	Involves all of those and then talking about the business
1317820	1323080	Why we are says it helps to have a business mindset or think about it in the back of your mind
1323960	1329200	SSJ 100 Matt says I just looked it up and I see a few IG DA New York City chapters
1329200	1331200	Yes, there's probably one in each borough
1332720	1337920	Yeah, I think there yeah, I think there might be I think there's one IG DA Brooklyn or something like that
1337920	1342400	Yeah, but even IG DA New Jersey they have they have their own and you know and Boston, you know
1342400	1346280	Not that far away everything so close up there. So yeah, just a couple hours away
1346280	1348680	So yeah, they have a whole ton of options out that way
1348680	1352240	So and I like the point that he made though about all those other aspects
1352240	1356680	You know story level sound, you know, they're all all that adds up to
1357480	1361260	Cohesion cohesiveness and consistency. So yeah, beautiful good
1361360	1365960	You kind of have to have a good you also have to be a bit of a people person
1365960	1367960	I think to learn some of those skills
1370480	1377160	Even if you don't necessarily get a long hundred percent of the time like to be business professional in working with people like that
1377320	1381200	That that doesn't come naturally for everybody. No and you know something
1381200	1384400	I'm super relieved you said this because
1385080	1392000	Just yesterday we had our game jam and one at one of the one of the teammates on the progressive game
1392000	1398600	Jam team made a made a very striking remark and it's something that I've said for a very long time and I would typically get
1398600	1404920	The you know tilted face response like what are you talking about? But he said I'm an introvert. I
1405760	1407760	Under no circumstances
1407800	1413120	Want to deal with a bunch of people I just want to make my game and sell it and that's it
1413120	1419360	And he was like, I'm a programmer. I don't like having to deal with others like that. But that is
1420520	1427480	Absolutely, like I get that because I've said the same thing for a very very long time. We are all very nervous
1428040	1430040	To just get it out there
1430200	1436700	Because and that's why we forget so often about the legalities and the business aspect because we're so dead focused on hoping that
1437200	1439520	someone is gonna like what we've made and
1440640	1444640	And and I'm telling you and you know, we think when we hear about all these
1445080	1448080	I don't know if you know when we hear about these, you know
1448080	1454040	These sensitive comments and the sensitive reactions and and the people the person outside looking in says damn
1454040	1458960	They're really kind of overdramatic a little over theatrical about it all but not necessarily
1459520	1465820	Because we are so consumed by the fear of being accepted just once
1466440	1470760	Not consistently just once and even for me
1470760	1478720	That was a huge thing for me that I had to overcome as outgoing as I had been in other aspects of my life
1478720	1481540	But when it but when it comes to believing in your dream
1481800	1487120	It's you you're so focused on you believing in it because it took you so long to believe in it yourself
1487600	1492360	That you have to hope to God that someone else is gonna believe in it, too
1492360	1496120	That's a great point because I'm an extrovert by nature. All right, so
1497000	1499400	What a shot I have my moments
1499400	1503360	Well, you know, I'm an extrovert by nature and sometimes like I I even get the mindset where it's like
1503360	1505440	Why can't you just why you just get up there and talk about her?
1505440	1508480	Why can't you just make that call, you know those types of things and you know
1508480	1513320	So an Allen is usually the one that actually kind of grounds me a little bit and will you know?
1513320	1516800	because he's the introvert and we'll kind of remind me that like, you know, I
1517280	1519600	Doesn't come that way. It's not it's not like that all the time
1519600	1520200	Yeah
1520200	1525700	We want it to be if we want it because we're so excited and that and you'll see us because when an introvert gets super
1525700	1531520	Excited you can't stop us because it happens it happens to us because we just start we're on it and on it and on it
1531560	1537760	So yeah, I mean so when he so when when our colleagues said that yesterday, I was like, yeah
1538720	1544380	Absolutely, absolutely resounding. So yeah, you know, but that's why we that's why this our chapter is
1545220	1546580	To help
1546580	1550980	Relieve those issues, you know relieve those issues or at least give some balance to that
1550980	1555940	that's why the indie arcade is a celebration of those things because it's like we're giving you the
1556140	1557060	opportunity to
1557060	1563100	kind of break from your shell even just a little bit even if you just crack the shell just a little bit and then
1563340	1566380	give yourself we're gonna help you give you that courage to
1566940	1572140	Be able to show your game to the general public and and and feel have that bit of confidence
1572660	1575260	That holy crap, they actually do like it
1575660	1576700	We're at this
1576700	1580020	Conversation is getting a huge response in our chat over at live fog network calm
1580180	1584180	Dungeon buster saying there are quite a few devs that are amazingly savvy creators
1584180	1589060	But terrible a business part of a good Kickstarter pitch is to make everyone excited about your game
1589060	1592320	If you can't do that, then why should I fund you? Yep
1592820	1595820	Yyr says everything's being spoken is 100% true
1596220	1600460	It helps 200% if you love your game enough that even if nobody else loves it
1600460	1603740	You will still be satisfied with it. That way you have nothing to lose
1604740	1608140	Act F just says this applies on so many aspects
1608500	1614260	Very true. Same thing same thing even from my side where it's like I'm not really making a game, but I have like this podcast
1614260	1618060	But if I can't speak positively about the podcast if I'm like, yeah
1618060	1621140	I have this show and it's kind of it's kind of it's really nerdy
1621180	1625180	You know, it's no biggie, you know, if I if I sell it like that people gonna be okay, then I won't bother
1625500	1629980	But you know if I'm excited about like yeah, you know, we've been going a long time and we love games
1629980	1635580	You know, then people get more enthusiastic about it. So that's just that's just goes on anything. Sure. Absolutely. Absolutely
1636580	1640580	Brianna tell us a little bit about and I don't know if you know this off the top of your head
1640580	1646340	But I'm hoping you you know some of them tell us about some of the speakers that we're gonna hear from this year at IGDA
1646340	1648340	Cuz I know you have a new lineup this year. Yes
1648900	1651720	So our keynote speaker is going to be Kat went
1652320	1656940	She was the 2015 MVP as voted by the IGDA
1657740	1663340	She's one of the founders of the women in gaming for the International Game Developers Association
1664340	1666300	she's very
1666300	1674160	Proactive about diversity in games making sure that both genders are well represented. She's about community. So she's gonna be speaking on that
1675340	1681180	Next up. We'll have Ian Pollock. He is the director of the graduate program at CSU East Bay
1682100	1684900	he takes game designing and
1685380	1689220	Jant game jams to a whole different level. He's very big on
1690100	1693900	Well in the East Bay is like where a lot of your games come from. Yes
1693900	1696700	So it makes a lot of sense East Bay South Bay. It's like
1697220	1701260	Funny enough though the IGDA chapters out there haven't been too involved
1701260	1705500	But we've been mentoring at their game jams Gabriel and I have interesting
1705500	1710300	So Sacramento has been pouring into the East Bay and we invited Ian to come up
1710940	1717580	He is big on incorporating multiple disciplines whether you're a science major or you have an art background
1719000	1722280	We want he wants to create games based around things like that
1722700	1729300	We also have our local developer from rocktastic games. William Tan will be speaking to give a perspective on
1729940	1736580	What indie developers go through he's been in the industry for a while now and he's had a lot of success in the mobile side
1736580	1740620	So now he's developing for console and he's gonna share his perspective on things like that

1758620	1764700	She works in the bay, but is returning back home to give back to her local community. She'll be giving a speech
1765540	1772700	I'm sorry. It's very I got super excited about her because she's our first person from a triple-a studio
1773100	1778300	She's from 2k games. She's a technical animator for 2k games. She's actually working on
1778860	1780620	Oh my god

1788380	1793940	So she kind of knows her stuff and we had the pleasure of meeting her at the most recent GDC
1794020	1799940	so the fact that we have her speaking on both the benefit the pros and cons of working on indie and
1800460	1801460	triple-a
1801460	1807500	So yeah, we have someone for 2k games coming through for that which means we hope more from 2k game shows up down the road

1905020	1909900	I have a love for music but to hear and experience what all of these devs are going through
1909900	1911900	I don't have the patience for any of that
1911940	1919420	But if I can create a platform for everyone to show off what they are passionate about that makes me so happy

2019500	2023620	The rest of the show and the news and all that stuff real quick because you brought up GDC and that reminded me
2023620	2023980	Oh, yeah
2023980	2026540	We have people that went to GDC in the room because you know
2026540	2029660	We don't that's a little bit out of our scope for what we're able to do
2029700	2035260	But you guys actually both went and you got to take in everything at GDC just some quick impressions on this year's
2035860	2039380	GDC is something that really caught your attention that you really enjoyed or what have you
2039660	2044380	So I spent a lot of time in the GDC play area. They had some alternate
2045060	2051800	Alternative controllers they had a controller this year where you lick it and that's what moves I kid you not
2052580	2056880	The eyes and in the studio just their eyes got so big right now
2057200	2060240	Especially since I have a macaroon in my mouth, okay
2061120	2066600	Like when people use the oculus rift you have the sanitary wipes so you can wipe it down
2066600	2069100	So, you know, you don't give somebody Zika virus or whatever
2069640	2075680	But I don't want to lick something that some complete stranger especially at a gaming conference has licked
2075920	2080680	Do you want ants cuz that's how you get ants? Yeah, if you see a demo kiosk for that at Best Buy now

2163760	2165760	So
2166560	2173460	Yep, nope, not at all. Not at all. So not at all. So I can't even follow up on that one at all. I
2174240	2175480	I
2175480	2181000	Had the pleasure of experience of I shouldn't even say pleasure Jesus worries. Everything's gonna sound suggestive
2181000	2185160	I'm so sorry everybody, but so part of my experience with GDC
2185160	2191880	I had I got a got accepted into a new boot camp that they introduced called
2192160	2194640	amplifying voices and I and I
2195120	2202480	submitted for it for this boot camp and the idea behind it was it was about growing leaders within different communities and you know that
2202480	2207640	Were helped contributing to the industry somehow and so I submitted and I got accepted
2207640	2214200	So I would so we saw I was part of the very first class to you know of 30 to you know
2214200	2216080	actually beach be like
2216080	2218080	mentored and coached on how to
2218400	2223720	You know, you know speak better than you already do now be a better leader, you know
2223720	2226080	Continue to be a great leader in your community so on and so forth
2226520	2229480	My coach happened to be the marketing director for Oculus Rift
2229520	2233560	So so yes, I actually got to meet her and she was she was really cool
2233560	2239240	And you know, we got I got to meet Robin Robin Haniki from that game company who now runs her own
2239880	2247040	Fun phenomena so indie game studio you got to go to like the equivalent of like when a seven-year-old wants to go to space camp
2248440	2252640	Just got to do. Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was
2253360	2259400	It was extremely uplifting. It was extremely uplifting that day. And so and so with that, you know, yeah
2259440	2264560	So then I got to see you know when I was able to go, you know other other facets of the event
2264720	2266320	You know a couple different sessions
2266320	2266480	Oh
2266480	2272880	I a lot I actually invested a was a I was fortunate enough to have my my 3d art director of my NASA game studio
2272880	2276680	Team to attend the different animation boot camps that were that were there
2276680	2279700	And he said they were absolutely incredible. He got to meet some of like his biggest
2280440	2285520	Inspirations, you know for different game studios. I liked and this is me
2286040	2291720	With the whole pathless traveled mentality is you know where if I see something trendy?
2292360	2298300	Buzzwordy I get irritated real quick and I'm like, okay. I'm already tired of it
2298960	2301800	But yet we talked that you know, there's VR
2302360	2303800	alternate AR
2303800	2309080	Very that was the thing and it it was exciting but it got me super nervous
2309200	2310520	It's like okay
2310520	2312960	Are we really that ready yet?
2312960	2318880	I'm like because they kind of did the same thing with like the big with like the big TVs back in the day
2318880	2323460	It's like oh you got to watch this and you know, you gotta you gotta get this TV now and you know
2323800	2327800	Look what they're trying to do with 4k now. It's like not gonna happen for a while. So and
2328400	2330400	But anyway, you know all that all that aside
2331320	2333320	it was
2333440	2341280	Very incredible event and probably the best that that you know minus some funny antics that happened throughout the event
2342280	2346280	Thanks, Microsoft and things like that. And I think Bree wants to contribute on that. Oh, yeah
2346280	2348720	Well, it was their 30-year celebration, too
2349160	2354620	So they had a whole 80s section like a throwback to how GDC first started
2355200	2360200	You know the humble beginnings at someone's home. I think it was so they did a little throwback section
2360200	2367720	But yeah, Gabe was saying a lot more virtual reality. They did a combination GDC VR D VR DC
2367720	2374240	Yeah this year. So instead of just having one expo hall with you know, oculus and you know, the major game players
2374240	2375800	It was throughout the whole thing
2375800	2382960	So there was not a section that you could go without having a headset on someone lingering through the halls. I
2385040	2387620	Heard there was just a ton of VR GDC this year
2387620	2392460	So it's gonna be interesting to see how that plays out in the living room a year or two from now be very interesting
2392460	2394720	Well, your friend is all about it. That's right
2397300	2403900	Looking at chat over at live dog network comm sg 100 Matt says space camp and he didn't even have to play double dare
2404260	2409000	No, he didn't he didn't and I don't think there was a physical challenge at GDC
2409660	2414420	Actually, Bree might have done the physical challenge at the licking station that might have been yeah
2414420	2416760	It's kind of like they they were a team there anyway
2417940	2419940	No comment. Oh
2420300	2421900	My gosh. All right
2421900	2424500	This has been too much fun. So anyway, uh, sac I GDA
2425100	2430420	The indie game Expo is gonna be next or excuse me two weeks from yesterday

2457780	2461180	This week in gaming news and some of the latest and greatest what's going on

2468660	2471660	Let's start over with you tonight. What kinds of video games have you been playing this week?
2472580	2477300	Dan and I finally started the remaster of Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and
2478460	2481100	it's funny because I named my cat Midna and
2482500	2483780	she
2483780	2488120	hopped up on the TV while we played her introduction scene and
2489260	2493420	Just started looking at the TV and she hardly ever does that when we're home watching stuff
2493620	2500740	So she was up on the TV in front of the TV and behind our center speaker and she's like I'm in a video game
2501620	2503620	Yeah cat get down
2505140	2506500	So
2506500	2512460	And then I played a little bit more Dungan Rumpa. I had to take a little bit of a break
2512460	2514460	Just because I've had a really busy week
2514660	2519760	And I should change schedules at work. So like now I'm you know able to stay for the entire show
2520420	2525600	And I got my my new amiibo. I got my Timmy and Tommy nook
2526420	2529780	for Animal Crossing because the ones I'm collecting are on the Animal Crossing ones and
2529780	2536940	So I I haven't played them in happy home designer yet, but I did do Roper's house
2537540	2539060	so
2539060	2545980	The happy home designer is like stupidly fun. I'm also still playing Heroes of Dragon Age. Mm-hmm, and
2546660	2548100	I'm
2548100	2556300	Level seven in ingress now. Congrats. Thank you. And I have I think I might have pissed off that Smurf who?
2556300	2562700	Tried to take my home thing because in retaliation I took out eight of his
2564620	2568620	That's what the game is all about getting back at people sorry not sorry
2569340	2575260	And that's it. Awesome. All right, let's go over to Alan. Let's talk about let's talk about your gaming week
2575260	2577480	I'm low or year. How you doing?
2578020	2580740	Good good. What kind of games you've been playing this week fallout?
2581700	2585380	Fallout one. Yeah, I played and beat that did you yeah, that's right
2585380	2591020	You went back and actually played follow one and two because I have the discs from when I bought them from the early 90s
2591020	2595380	So no actually late 90s early 2000s. They still work, of course, and I was like
2595980	2601340	Apparently the first one if you have fought if you cheat and follow a walkthrough and I'm like, I'm I'm a grown adult
2601340	2603620	I don't have time. Just tell me tell me where to go
2604140	2606140	It's actually a fairly short game
2606460	2609600	The first fallout so I played that but I mostly been playing fallout 4
2609640	2615960	And all of the mods that have come out for it in spite of the fact that the creation kit isn't officially out yet
2615960	2617480	from Bethesda
2617480	2623560	So that's cool. So you will play this game till like 3 in the morning. Yeah, how have you not beat a game yet?
2624440	2627800	So without giving away too many spoilers
2629440	2630760	There are
2630760	2638200	four factions and the main story only goes so far and then you complete the main story by siding with one of these
2638600	2642040	Factions and then from that point on the how the main story
2642040	2647800	I mean ultimately it all goes to the same ending but it's just who's alive and who isn't there's the neutral faction
2648760	2653920	There's like faction a versus B that if you side with one you have to kill the other and then there's like the quote-unquote
2653960	2659800	evil faction all four my point is all four are lame and I don't know who I don't want I don't know who I want to
2659980	2661600	stake my claim with because I'm like
2661600	2668180	Who's the least guys are all boring or you always all have like really glaring moral problems that my character doesn't agree with
2668200	2670200	Where's the party faction?
2672120	2677120	Because there's the cool Marines in the iron armor suits
2677120	2685180	But they're like kill everybody that aren't that that isn't human including androids and then there's the the pro Android faction
2685180	2686680	but they like
2686680	2690440	Will like erase their memories and give them a new life and I'm like wolf the Android
2691360	2697020	Freed themselves because they have autonomy. Why would you want to delete who they are in the name of saving them?
2697020	2700460	So like everyone's it's so everyone's lame. So I love this
2700460	2707000	So, uh, so our chat room in response to you being like everybody's lame SG 100 Matt says so it's like the presidential race
2710340	2716540	Are we talking about the Republican side because that's like there is yeah, there isn't a single horse in that race. No politics
2716540	2718540	No politics now. All right
2719420	2725340	Yeah, so that's all so I'm I'm trying to get my affinity with all of the companions up
2725340	2727940	Oh you trying to romance everybody
2728460	2733220	well, not what you get a perk if you get someone to like really really like you and I have
2733580	2739700	Strong who's like the super mutant giant who just who basically likes it when you like if you take the cannibalism perk which no thanks
2739700	2741700	I'm not doing that if you eat
2741700	2746180	Like he likes that that that's the kind of stuff you have to do to get him to like you and you're trying to romance
2746180	2750840	Him no, he's not romanceable, but he's still a companion. Okay, but one thing about fallout
2751880	2754580	You can romance as many characters
2755340	2761180	There are 14 companions and I think like seven or eight of them are romanceable so you can be like sister wives
2761540	2767540	Yeah, you yeah, I'm I've I've maxed out McCready and Hancock and I'm in a relationship with both of them
2768980	2774420	Cuz modern cuz normally in Dragon Age, there's the there's the jealous bitch conversation
2775340	2781860	And with Mass Effect 1 with either Ashley and Liara or Liara and Caden. There's the jealous bitch conversation line
2782380	2785780	So we compared notes and we need to have a conversation with you
2786660	2792940	About what's going on and you need to pick and it's like okay $60 for this. Can I just you a ho?
2794140	2796140	Yeah
2797580	2800660	Yeah, exactly but with follow forks like do what you want
2802180	2807260	Do who you want whenever you want good times one of these days off to sit down and play that game
2807260	2810980	But I just I don't with all you know, you know, you're the best Allen
2810980	2816620	But I just don't want to become you when it comes to fall out and I'm worried that I might go down
2816620	2817980	You're totally not wired that way
2817980	2823340	I have that very I have very introverted an addictive personality that once I find a game that's doing it for me
2823340	2830180	That is all I play and then all of a sudden I get burned out. I'm like I've 500 hours of Skyrim is enough
2830180	2832180	I'm not gonna play Skyrim ever again
2832580	2837140	Then like with and then you'll be like, why aren't you playing this game? Oh that game. I'm not playing that anymore
2838020	2841060	What happened you've been playing that game non-stop for three months and I moved on
2841780	2846260	Yes, it's like something like he just dumps one and give another that's called binge gaming
2848900	2851540	Let's see why we are says the main quest is pretty long on
2853420	2858220	I had known this about any of those games that were just mentioned
2858220	2861460	I may have been more inclined to try playing them
2861460	2863460	Oh
2864620	2870460	Well, you're on the business side of things so, you know you get right down these marketing things following remark is not responsible of IGDA
2870460	2872460	Sacramento wives
2873220	2875220	Cannibalism. All right
2876020	2878540	Well, I was talking about what why oh, sorry
2878540	2883300	I thought there's a comment about fallout, but I guess why where has been playing guacamole, which you know, that's always that's a great
2883820	2885300	Great one
2885300	2888660	Raginator saying watched Alan play fallout for a little bit last night
2888660	2895540	Oh, yeah, you you don't really live stream, but you do he just will he'll be held on the steam notify
2896060	2900940	Raginator wants to watch your stream via this steam thing and I'm like, okay, so then steam takes care of it
2900940	2905100	It's all seamless. I don't even know what it's doing. You keep that steam thing open basically all the time. Yeah
2905100	2912420	Yeah, I I kind of do that like sometimes but as far as like routing it through twitch or whatever the play TV
2912420	2917500	I think is the new one that comes with the Raptor app. It's like a twitch competitor. Oh, I have that. Mm-hmm
2917500	2919500	I just never run it. Yeah
2919900	2924340	Cuz then I always feel like if I'm gonna stream a game then like I don't want to just stream gameplay
2924340	2929180	I have to be entertaining and like and I explain this to people when somebody asked me like why aren't you streaming your game?
2929180	2933860	Did it cuz I'm like sometimes I don't want to be on like talking about that whole like extrovert introvert thing, right?
2933940	2938280	like sometimes I just want to play the game and I don't necessarily want to be on because I do feel a
2938560	2943760	Responsibility when I'm live streaming a game to not just stream the gameplay but to be like
2944280	2949140	Commenting to talk about memories to talk about make jokes be funny. And so I was like, I don't want to be funny
2949140	2951680	I just want to vegetate in front of the game, but that's me
2951680	2956760	I'm not I'm not knocking other people because some people do stream just broad gameplay and that's totally fine
2956760	2960840	That's just not like like I want to kind of be consistent with my channel
2960840	2967320	And so that consistency would be me being on when I feel like it when reginator watches me stream
2967360	2970480	I don't even open up my headset mic so that I could talk to him through it
2970480	2975120	I mean he can hear the game obviously, but otherwise, there's no feedback from me. He's just watching me
2975120	2978640	It's just a real way to just like watch somebody play a game with no
2978820	2983320	BS and some people like that more in stream like everything I said about live stream
2983320	2986100	So people hate that some people want to just see the damn game
2986100	2991940	And so, you know, that's well like if you look if you look at the do's and don'ts of how to do stream like that
2991940	2997600	It'll be like the first rule do not read the dialogue on the screen people hate that
2997600	3001640	But then you'll see people that do it and they'll use silly voices and then it's suddenly it's funny
3001640	3004740	Okay. Well, this guy has a million subscribers and he reads the talk on the screen
3004740	3008620	So that's my that's my pet peeve is reading the dialogue on the screen
3009280	3014500	Well that and I'd say over-the-top acting. Yeah, that's why I do not like markiplier
3014780	3021000	Hmm at all. Mm-hmm and everyone will worship the ground he walks on and kiss the office chair
3021000	3023820	He sits in and no, I don't think he's funny
3023820	3028540	But over the years we've done this there have been people that are like I don't like olr cuz you guys do blank and I'm
3028540	3031080	Like, alright. Well, hope you found the show
3031080	3036860	You do like markiplier is sort of this safe respite that people ran to screaming from pewdiepie. So
3038520	3042360	Yeah, he's very when he takes a shirt off it's very nice I don't need to listen to him
3043540	3046260	Can we not? All right. Anyway, let's
3046260	3052400	How about how about our guests Gabe you get the mic what kind of games you've been playing this week? Oh goodness
3052400	3056400	I didn't let you pimp your game either. Oh, yeah. No, it's okay
3058400	3061900	Okay, so the games that I've been working on are my
3062880	3064880	crumple episode 1 and
3065000	3070420	Kinship now I will and this is how I will pimp it nice and ninja like youtube.com
3071460	3074000	slash nascent games and a s
3074500	3076500	C E N T
3076700	3082420	g-a-m-e-s I just uploaded two new gameplay videos for both games last week and
3083380	3089600	And for the first time you're actually able to see some early gameplay of kinship and updated gameplay for crumple
3089600	3095120	So yeah, we're doing really well with that. We recently announced that crumple will soon
3095420	3101340	Well at some point this year will be also available on an additional platform the Amazon fire
3101940	3103020	So
3103020	3106200	So yeah, so that so we've started implementing early touch controls
3107080	3110720	Yeah, so it's it's it's really really exciting unexpected stuff
3111480	3117240	Anyway, so yeah youtube.com slash nascent games check us out and we're on Twitter too at nascent games
3118080	3123060	Now the games that I've been playing. Um, I've normally I mean for a very long time
3123060	3129680	it's normally Xbox one always has my soul and I rarely touch my PlayStation 4 but
3130220	3132220	Earth Defense Force 4.1
3132920	3137420	The game I was yelling and screaming about that needed to be out because it because you know
3137420	3141220	There was the shadows of new despair only in Japan, but they brought it here
3141740	3143740	Finally, although it was delayed
3144100	3147600	Finally, it finally came out. So I'd been all over that game
3148460	3153420	Just earning whatever weapons I possibly can because that game is crazy crazy fun
3153980	3155140	and
3155140	3158900	Been playing that I had I started playing
3159820	3160820	Oh
3160820	3165180	goodness, what else I finally started messing around with Killzone Shadowfall because I'm just like
3165320	3170860	You know because I finally beat last of us remaster because I never played last of us only until the remake for the ps4
3170860	3176440	And my god, what an astounding game, but most of you probably peed it already. So I still haven't played it
3177720	3179720	Astounding game absolutely astounding game
3180140	3185160	But the game I'm you know, so I've been messing with those and of course force of six force of horizon two sometimes
3185160	3191140	But then I will but I'm waiting for quantum break quantum break comes out next just pre-ordered it today. Yeah
3191140	3197620	Yeah, I pre-ordered that months ago cuz anything from Alan Wake developer. I'm ready for that. Yes
3197620	3199980	So yeah, so that's what I've been messing around with
3199980	3204500	Yeah, Alan Wake is actually on my list to go revisit because Xbox one the backwards
3205340	3210860	Compatibility thing has been like this really awesome like rediscover games you played like literally it's been a godsend
3210860	3214480	And I'm gonna talk about that in just a minute because actually the game I've been playing almost
3214760	3217600	Exclusively this week has been one of those games. Thanks. We'll talk about that a minute
3217600	3219100	I want to check in with Bri too
3219100	3223940	But first I want to go to a chat room over at live dot vog network calm because why we are points out
3224080	3228880	That is ironic a game about a scrap of paper on a device called fire
3231000	3233080	But if you actually play the little demo
3233680	3240360	There's there's like actually fire is kind of a big deal in this game spot-on spot-on remark. Actually, I love it
3241280	3246760	In the chat room. There are people fussing at me because markiplier does all this great work for other people
3246760	3250480	That's not what I was talking about at all. Mm-hmm. I was just saying he's not funny, right?
3250640	3255840	So you can still appreciate like oh this person does good charity work, but I don't really like well
3255840	3257920	I don't watch their TV show, you know that type of exactly
3258800	3262280	Exactly. It's kind of like I feel like there's like actors and actresses like that
3262280	3268480	I would say Angelina Jolie, but actually I really do love her and I will watch anything she's in so I can't that's not the best
3268500	3274100	It's like everyone on the cast of Big Bang Theory may be great brilliant wonderful people, but I don't watch the show
3274100	3277260	There's a great exam because it's fake nerd. Yes
3277860	3279220	Perfect. I love that
3279220	3286580	It's it's nerd humor for people who aren't you can love Mayim bialik and think that show is she I love her so much
3286580	3292620	You can love will we and not like I have learned so much from her about neuroscience and being Jewish
3293580	3294700	fantastic
3294720	3298900	Bree your gaming week how what kind of video get I I know I know you're no more the business
3299320	3301760	Surely you take a break with a game once in a while. Yes
3301760	3305640	I am reminded that I need to play the games and just promote the games
3306840	3308560	so I
3308560	3313560	Participated in my first marathon last year and that did not end. Well, so what did I do to console myself?
3313560	3317520	I bought a game and that was Yoshi's wooly world. I
3318760	3324420	Love Yoshi's wooly world. Why are we why are we like confessing this like we're at an alcohol rehabilitation clinic
3324420	3326420	It's so cute
3329200	3335200	You know what it doesn't it does not matter gamers are gamers and I have to show Bree what I got hold on keep talking
3335340	3339280	So I I've been playing Yoshi's wooly world and I'm actually progressing through it
3339280	3345640	And I'm really proud because my gameplay lasts all of 20 minutes and then I get frustrated and then I stop
3345640	3350000	it doesn't matter if it's a mobile game or if I'm playing on my Xbox one and
3355280	3360620	Make a yarn Yoshi and it's the first time I see it and I want to just cuddle with it
3362520	3364120	How cool
3364120	3367220	See, so I was gifted a Wii U for my birthday
3367220	3371360	But I don't have any fun amiibo or anything. Like I don't even know what to do with that. I
3374160	3376700	Here's a tiny one you can cuddle with that's out of the box
3377540	3384780	And I also started playing never alone on my Xbox one and I really admire that game because of the
3385240	3391600	Story behind it and the purpose behind its creation. So I would love if I were to get into game development
3391600	3396740	I would love to do something that represents my Hawaiian culture because there is a whole story there
3396740	3400280	That's not told hula is not like a sexual dance at all
3400920	3404620	But you know not a lot of people know about those things. So that's what I'm playing now
3405600	3411400	That is an awesome like I never alone was was really cool in that regard like that it kind of blended the whole like
3411760	3415860	Education, I don't want to say you're not education in the way like Carmen Sandiego did education
3415860	3418820	But you know like just like you kind of like oh, I'm learning something about
3419540	3425720	You know, maybe something I would have experienced otherwise, which is why diversity is. Yes. It is important in games. Yes. So anyway
3426300	3428560	Great. Thank you for sharing about your week. All right
3429100	3434540	My gaming week, so I mentioned there's been a game that I've been playing a lot on Xbox packers compatibility
3434540	3439360	So here it is. Here's the funny thing. It was on the Xbox 360, but it actually didn't start there
3439360	3443760	This game is like 20 years old and it's I really believe this is like
3444160	3448060	One of the best video games ever made and we talked about it a lot on the show
3448060	3451020	But I haven't really revisited this game in a long time
3451440	3455560	But I have fallen in love in love again with Castlevania Symphony of the night
3457560	3462560	That is a game that I'm sure most of the people listening have bought at least one
3462560	3469180	I'm sure I'm sure and I've like three copies. It's not the first time I've played it people. Oh, yes star Sakura
3470920	3472560	For copies of it
3472560	3474320	No, and I actually you know what?
3474320	3478480	I was actually thinking today as I was playing through the game again because you know again
3478480	3483240	It's been when was the last time you went for two hundred point six percent in the game or more?
3483400	3485320	It's probably been a long time for most of you
3485320	3490700	So I think I really love that this backwards compatibility has made me revisit some things and what was funny is that I got a new
3490880	3494740	Achievement in the game today, right and I looked at my history
3494780	3500880	Okay, here's the here's the hilarious thing. My other achievements in the game were unlocked on
3501580	3502860	March
3502860	3504860	27th tomorrow, right
3505400	3511780	2007 oh wow. Oh my god, if if leap year. Mm-hmm
3512500	3515620	Existed. Mm-hmm. It would have been two days before I know
3516060	3519040	But anyway, I was thinking as I was playing today
3519120	3523080	I was like I really need to harass dark Sakura to figure out how to get a
3523160	3527040	Saturn from her for a little bit and a copy of the other I could just give Alan back his
3527560	3529560	Perfect so I can
3530280	3536560	Okay, so yeah so I can experience this because I've never played the Saturn version and I like I must play Maria's story
3536560	3542840	It's all Maria is like the most overpowered character in the history of anything. That's okay
3542840	3548760	All you have to do is stand in a corner and do the Santa you attack over and over and it's this big
3549080	3554680	Blue dragon that just flies all over the screen and you can control it too. So it's like hi
3554680	3558520	I'm completely overpowered and she has I don't did you did you play?
3559540	3565720	Dracula X any at all. Uh, I played a little bit. I played the the Super Nintendo port, which wasn't
3566640	3571480	Maria as playable in that one. I played a little bit you brought it to an episode of all our ones I did but
3572040	3578180	She's like kind of hard. She's easy and hard at the same time because her attacks are really useful and she has her animal friends
3578660	3579780	but
3579780	3586780	She's way overpowered in in not turn in the moonlight. Mm-hmm. I have that on the turbo graphic 16 actually
3588660	3591700	So, yeah a person owed us a hundred bucks and paid us back with that
3593260	3595780	So that that's just like rediscovering
3596500	3602160	Castlevania Symphony Night because I don't I find that you know, it's been what like nine years since the last time I played I don't
3602460	3605980	Remember where I like it. I remember. Oh, yeah, I have to get missed for this
3605980	3609420	I have to get the bat which came first we get the miss first the bat first
3609420	3614100	I don't remember it's been so long. So I had to you know, and actually at one point I was like Alan
3614420	3620740	Do you remember where the miss thing is? Cuz I can't find it. What we still have a strategy guide for it
3620740	3625780	Oh, yeah heat. Well, he just went to game facts or something. Yeah, so I cheated for you so that you had plausible
3625780	3629780	Yeah ability exactly. So I'm I have I haven't looked at a single guide
3630340	3632340	there's only two things only two
3632340	3634020	A
3634020	3639300	Armor only two things you ever need in that game. One of them is the walk armor
3640180	3642180	The second one is the Yota tuna
3642940	3648500	Which you can only get from one creature and it has a 1% drop rate. Oh, yeah, I've heard about that
3648820	3654680	But when you have the Yota tuna, it may not be the strongest weapon, but it's the fastest and it hits multiple
3654680	3657900	Yeah, that's awesome. I spent three hours getting one
3658900	3662300	It's when you were revisiting that game we noticed that
3662940	3667740	One of the things that's so fun about it is that the eat the monsters they're all so melodramatic
3668380	3675060	Like when you kill them, they're like bones everywhere in flames and whining and crying. It's like this is a little plant creature
3675060	3677760	There's 20 of them on the screen and they're all gonna go through this
3678300	3683580	Oscar performance because just because they die like a thousand bones very very little stem
3683660	3690060	Yeah, or you killed the little the little sword lady ladies, yeah, yeah, they'll go and then when you kill
3692420	3697460	Noises and then like they they fall over in these big explosion anybody this place
3697460	3698700	Are you like your best fight?
3698700	3702780	Anybody this place to be tonight recently knows exactly what the hell I'm talking about the blood zombies
3702780	3706220	I hate them that noise they make when the blood fountains out, but I'm like, that's so gross
3706740	3708740	And they all do it every time
3709140	3711140	What is a man so?
3712020	3719020	Miserable pile of secrets the horrific voice acting of the PlayStation 1 era just I'm interested in this
3719060	3724060	I'm interested in this. I'm interested in this. It's like can I just buy potions without having to hear you?
3724980	3727780	Alucard, I'm interested in this shut up
3728900	3734820	Little fairy flying around with you. There is something funny about this wall and you want to know what's funny
3734980	3736980	It's actually just as annoying in Japanese
3737780	3739780	it literally is just
3740100	3745380	Alucard still has this gorgeous rich voice and it's really annoying either way
3745980	3747980	It's just like they talk too much
3748980	3755060	Stopped so yeah, I just you know, I know we've talked about this game on other episodes and it's a classic
3755060	3758180	But just I'm just reminded this week. There's a damn good reason for that
3758180	3761300	you know, you can go back to this game and just fall in love with it all over again and
3761700	3763700	You know the 50,000
3764100	3766420	Games like it that have come since you know what?
3766660	3773660	Even close which you know which but I see my other the castle thing is probably honestly in like my top three games of all
3773660	3777540	time but like the number one is going to be Super Metroid and it's like
3778000	3782780	You might as well have just named like two of the same thing for your name
3782780	3787420	It's because they have so much in common, but yet they don't you know, so I just so so good
3787420	3793580	Nothing had the ending of Super Metroid. No, nothing especially the first time I saw that I I almost cry
3793580	3797980	Yeah, the end of that like save the animals. Yep save the Metroids
3799300	3802820	So there was that and that is honestly taking up a big chunk of my gaming week
3802820	3806940	But there's been some other stuff too actually on Steam, you know, I'm a retro guy. I love my retro stuff
3806940	3808940	So on Steam this week, I actually did pick up
3809340	3813860	Atari vault came out this we heard about steam how much is that it is
3813860	3820140	I think they have a discount this week only where it's 1699 as opposed to 1999 for all of the Atari for all of it
3820140	3824420	So here it's like a hundred it's a hundred different Atari games arcade and 2600
3824500	3830280	So here's the thing. They took that iPad app and iPhone app they have and they ported it to the PC
3830280	3836500	It's that so at first glance I was like, oh they just ported the app and they got rid of all the mini
3836900	3839380	Transactions you just pay for the whole damn thing in one swoop
3839420	3842460	But the good thing is as opposed to my iPad or iPhone
3842460	3845940	I actually have tangible controls like the way this thing is meant to be played
3845940	3851220	I have to use my thumb or anything ridiculous like that, right? So that part's cool. Um, but
3852820	3858300	Yeah, I feel like they actually have added to it as well because the cool thing is on Steam
3858300	3863540	You can actually do multiplayer through Steam and that in itself is like, okay shoot. This is cool
3863540	3867820	This is different and there's leaderboards, you know achievements things like that
3867820	3872420	so and the achievements are not easy like the only one I've gotten so far because
3872660	3875860	I have played a shitload of yards revenge one of the greatest
3876020	3881240	600 games ever made right? Yes, one of the achievements is you have to be able to shoot the flying spiral
3881700	3885700	Not just kill the base, but shoot the flying spiral and that I get that I can do
3885700	3886700	Oh my goodness
3886700	3892660	That's how you unlock Howard Scott workshop initials you have to shoot the flying spiral then you fly into the pixel the dead pixel
3892660	3894660	That's like on the right hand side of the screen
3895300	3897580	muscle memory from when I was like seven this is
3898580	3903460	It's that's been the cool part about Atari vault is almost called that Atari party
3903460	3909940	But you might as well it might as well as well. It was sorry party is kind of getting to revisit all that
3909940	3913580	So yeah, so I'll try vaults on Steam if you are a retro whore like me
3913580	3916680	You're probably gonna love it if you're not then
3917260	3920340	Don't but I think I think there's a lot of good stuff in it
3920340	3924760	Or I would say if you did buy the whole thing on iPad or iPhone or I'm sure it's on Android, too
3925160	3928600	Maybe you don't need it twice depends on what you want if you want it on Steam
3928600	3930720	I think it's I think it's still a good deal. So check that out
3930720	3936400	But that's really made up the bulk of my gimme week. I guess I've had a very retro week screw new games
3936920	3943800	Not really. Hey, if it's any consolation I played I played Little Nemo Dream Master on my NES sweet
3943800	3946040	I just got picked it up last week. So yeah
3947920	3950720	What's funny is that Castlevania Symphony of the Night has also made me go I
3951520	3953520	Really want to play Simon's Quest again?
3954200	3957720	Only on the Wii U because you could save it whenever you want that is because otherwise
3960080	3963360	God forbid you didn't find the red jewel now, you got to go back
3965760	3968080	Alan do you wanna say something real quick? No. No, I thought you were
3968960	3974520	Know that you mentioned Little Nemo the Dream Master. Now. The first level music is in my head. I
3975320	3979220	Love the music in that Capcom. Why can't you be that awesome anymore? Oh
3980800	3982800	Because Street Fighter 5
3982880	3988500	Which is a disappointment. Oh, thank you for reminding me the other game. I played this week Pokken tournament. Ah
3989200	3991280	nice
3991280	3993240	You thought I was gonna say Street Fighter 5
3993240	3998600	No, I've been playing the game that everybody quit Street Fighter 5 to play which is which is Pokken boss
3998600	4000880	Which I fight I beat the Green League. Whoo
4001440	4006520	I'm better than beginner. Yeah, I'm not so beginner, but it's still kind of bad
4006880	4012960	There you go, and then Alan for some reason doesn't like Alan thinks I'm very cheap when I play Pokken
4013600	4015980	Right. It's just the character that you play
4017680	4024400	Braxian Brax, there's lots of projectiles and you just sort of spit fire at them and the enemy just kind of maybe it's the difficulty
4024400	4028240	You're playing on but they really just kind of get the shit kicked out of them. I'm like they can't even move Alan
4028240	4030240	I'm just that good. Yeah that guy
4031080	4032440	I
4032440	4035320	Just like Braxian because she's funny. So there you go
4035320	4041440	I do like her super where it's all like hearts and rainbows and pretty princess magic and then why I had the player and then
4041440	4045620	It's like okay. Well that just blew up and killed that person. So great job. Thanks rainbows
4046480	4048480	Thanks killer rainbows
4048480	4053920	Anyhow, some quick housekeeping then we're gonna get into news tonight. So we will not be here next week
4053920	4059200	There will be no show next Sunday because Alan and I will be out of town and we're like getting back at six o'clock
4059200	4061240	So we'll be back too late for orange lounge radio
4061680	4064920	But you know, we'll we'll see you guys in two weeks
4064920	4071440	And actually it's gonna be a double weekend because sack IG sack IG DA in the arcade is going to be that
4071600	4075580	Saturday and then that Sunday there will be a new OLR. So that's gonna be a very busy weekend
4075580	4080480	So you get no OLR next week, but you get like twice the broadcasting the week after to make up for it

4084160	4088120	Alright, so that's that's really uh, that's really all we have for housekeeping
4088120	4095000	Otherwise, follow us on twitter twitter.com slash OLR. We're all we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio
4095240	4099640	We are overdue for some news. We're only an hour and eight minutes. We haven't touched a single news story yet
4099640	4104220	So let's get to it Alan starting us off tonight within the last week
4104320	4110560	The internet was all a flit a buzz about yet another leak of the Nintendo NX
4110720	4116620	Controller and allegedly what it what it looked like like whether it was a proof of concept or developers kit or whatever
4117380	4121700	So all of these sites, you know when a leak like that is released
4122980	4124980	If it's hard to verify
4126060	4127060	They're like, okay
4127060	4132860	Well, our competitor sites are getting clicks on this so we need to run this story too so that we're not
4133580	4134860	behind
4134860	4139500	but the whole thing was fake and that was confirmed by the two people that um
4141020	4146120	Did the mock-up of it? It's just all fake. It was all fake. It was an incredibly elaborate fake, too
4146120	4147440	Yeah, like it was very well done
4147440	4152520	I mean you could have fooled me and we did we talked about it last week on this show and we entertained it and I'm
4152520	4156680	Sure, there's some people that want to be like haha you fell for it, especially like because you know
4157160	4162580	there are some things about that leak device that lends reason to be critical of Nintendo and even I
4163040	4165160	Was not a fan of the fact that there were no buttons
4165480	4167120	But I still think you know
4167120	4172240	There's a lot of people in the community that are talking about this right now and we don't necessarily break news on this show
4172240	4174920	We discuss what's being talked about in the gaming community
4174920	4178480	So, you know, I kind of kind of don't apologize in that regard for talking about it last week
4178480	4180720	But I think we've all learned, you know
4180720	4184640	We've got to be a little more cautious with some of these leaks is that Wow
4184960	4189160	Photographs are getting more and more and more convincing because I mean if you think about it
4189400	4195000	Even though like the reddit team and I'm not singling them out on purpose, but it's just who comes to mind
4195000	4196480	You know, they were trying to figure out
4196480	4199560	Oh, it was this particular developer office in Sweden based on the tree
4199560	4204040	That's for a reflected in this and the fact of the keyboard all this shit. Okay, it's like Mulder calm down
4204040	4209120	Yeah, there's all this no but my point is there's all this detective work going into it and still couldn't tell it was a fake
4209920	4211400	so
4211400	4215640	You know, and I'm sure there's some people out there. They're like, I knew it was a fake the whole time
4215640	4222080	Yeah, well, you know, we didn't have the receipts really so, you know now that they've come out and said that it was fake
4222080	4224520	It is what it is, but I hope if nothing else
4225720	4228120	maybe Nintendo because they're
4228920	4233840	The reason why a lot of people were so ready to believe what was seen is because it matched
4234160	4236920	The patent that had been filed previously, right?
4236920	4241200	So that's why there were so many people that were ready to believe what they were seeing because it was in line with the patent
4241200	4242000	That Nintendo had filed
4242000	4243640	So I hope if nothing else
4243640	4249560	Maybe Nintendo at least did hear some of that feedback and so that they do make sure whatever it is
4249560	4251440	They're doing does have
4251440	4257400	Buttons or you know some of the other, you know things that people were complaining about last week me for me
4257400	4259320	It's really the buttons. I don't it's cool
4259320	4262000	If they want to do the whole thing a touchscreen or whatever and they want to change the shape
4262000	4268880	I don't really care about any of that. I just I need tangible buttons. That's what separates my console from my iPhone, honestly, so
4269560	4271000	but I
4271000	4276200	I really wish I really wish Loki was here to give us a follow-up
4276200	4278560	But we'll have to check in with him in a couple weeks when we're all back
4280840	4286520	Let's see going to our chat room over at live dot vog network comm yyr said this dude on neo gaff made a mock-up with
4286520	4290200	a 3d printer s class troll lol lol lol
4291840	4296680	Dark Tetsuya says I just don't get the motive for going that far out of their way to deceive people
4296680	4301560	But that's just me. Well that dark Tetsuya. The answer is because the internet
4302280	4305880	For three whole days or however long you got one over on all of the internet
4305880	4312280	Yeah, and you got to see all these sites running your bullshit. I literally that dude was masturbating to those Kotaku articles
4312280	4313320	I'm sorry to be so vile
4313320	4318360	but that's why people do it because they're just like oh man Kotaku just ran or
4319920	4321920	Some people like boobs
4323600	4325600	Like attention
4325600	4331840	Other people that's right for stealing my joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry other people like buttonless controllers
4332680	4334680	some people like fakes
4335920	4337920	Some people like fake boobs
4339280	4342440	All right, I just hurt my eyes rolling them
4344200	4345640	Anyhow
4345640	4351720	Let's see s 200 Matt says buttons are not just preferable for some people. It's necessary for disabled gamers
4351720	4354740	I hope Nintendo considers this. Hmm. That is an interesting
4355560	4358920	Conversation that came out of it came out of it. Kai judo says I don't mind it
4358920	4362360	They fool us for a few days than say it was a joke. No harm done
4362360	4367980	That is a good point. At least they did come out and say okay before y'all get too crazy. We're done
4368440	4371720	You know, we got what we needed out of it. We've had a good laugh. It was fake
4371920	4375880	Fooled you April Fool's. Yeah, I was gonna say stay the hell off the internet day
4376400	4378400	aka April Fool's is
4378440	4382080	Next week this whole but I'm glad we're not having a show
4382680	4388560	Are we gonna be in the air in the plane on the first cuz I can't view the internet when I'm 30,000 feet in
4388560	4394700	The air so that's fine with me. Yes, you can now. Well, we'll be we'll be hanging out with our buddies in Tucson
4394700	4399280	This is the day before our nerd thing on Saturday. So we'll be hanging out with our buddies in Tucson all day
4399560	4402360	Eating copious amount of Mexican food. Yeah, however
4403040	4406560	Please go to mass affecting dot tumblr.com
4407560	4411200	And look at the glorious joke. I made making a mockery of
4412040	4414040	April 1st, I
4415280	4419780	Always always one to self-promote here on the show. All right, because my blog is amazing
4421040	4424480	so let's talk about some other rumors and things that have a lot of
4425360	4427120	Attraction on the internet this week
4427120	4429000	the Nikkei
4429000	4432600	Japanese news publication was reporting that Nintendo is going to cease
4432920	4439220	Wii U production at the end of the year to make way for their next platform the Nintendo NX
4439540	4445840	The publication saying that poorly selling software and lack of interest in the hardware is the reason why production is ceasing
4446320	4449240	Nintendo of course pretty swiftly denied this
4449240	4456220	In a statement here, I'm trying to see where the actual quote is here on the statement
4457280	4459720	The news did not come from Nintendo
4459720	4466080	Of course and the company is still going to produce more hardware units during the next fiscal term and beyond
4466720	4474140	So they said Nintendo said the Wii U is seen hit titles recently such as Splatoon and Super Mario maker and Nintendo is going to continue
4474140	4476680	with shipments so yeah, and I
4477280	4482520	When I saw that thing I was like there's got to be a mistranslation here or something like why a
4483040	4487800	Why would Nintendo possible? Well, I don't think it was something it was meant to be announced. It was a leak or whatever
4488520	4492680	But Nintendo is still planning to release games through holiday
4492800	4496880	We know that Zelda is going to be a holiday release now granted
4496880	4500780	I know there's the whole thing like well, it could be an NX game as well as a Wii U game
4500840	4503040	Well, okay, then if it's a Wii U game
4503040	4509200	It's still going to necessitate more Wii U units because the Wii U is going to become the budget system
4509240	4513680	That's what always happens at the end of the life cycle of the games is that you know
4513680	4515280	They didn't just you know
4515280	4522080	Kill off the PlayStation 3 the minute the PlayStation 4 came out the PlayStation 3 simply became the budget system
4522080	4527580	It was the one that was significantly cheaper so you could buy one for your kids bedroom to babysit them all day
4527720	4529460	That's what's gonna happen with the Wii U
4529460	4534220	So I had a really hard time believing they would just kill production this year
4534220	4539740	You would at least have another year or two. That would really be unheard of to just end production the same year
4539740	4546860	I mean, I would they be trying to force more people to buy the new and I it just seems ridiculous to me
4547300	4551940	Unless there's something about the NX that makes the Wii U
4552460	4556140	Redundant, but I I can't really figure that out
4556140	4558860	I just it would be out of character for Nintendo
4558860	4563860	There has to be a backwards compatibility thing perhaps on that thing because I mean they did it so well with the Wii and the GameCube
4564460	4567660	You know, I mean, we're the Wii U and the Wii. Yeah. Yeah precisely
4567780	4574700	They didn't just murder the Wii now what it could be and I'll give this maybe there's going to be a new
4574980	4576420	Skew at the end of yeah
4576420	4582240	They're gonna kill off the existing bundles and they'll have like a and they did this with the Wii
4582240	4588560	They had a Wii that didn't have what DVD playback or something. Yeah, it didn't have backwards compatibility either just yeah
4588560	4592800	Something there's something like to like drive down the price even for it's super tiny, too
4592800	4599280	Yeah, so that I would believe and I think that's where the mistranslation is is that maybe it's not going to be the same Wii U
4599400	4604120	But there's gonna still be a Wii U and it might just be a different color or a different, you know
4604120	4607320	It'll just be something a little different. So that's all
4608120	4615380	Let's see over in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com YYR says the Wii Mini actually had no internet. Oh, that's right internet
4615380	4617380	That's what it was. Didn't it still have the Wii shop?
4617640	4621440	Like you have to have the Wii shop. Come on. Well, they stopped the Wii shop
4621440	4624920	Well, you still access it, but they didn't put anything new on there. Yeah, it's
4625920	4628160	They'll still happily take your money if you'll give it to them
4628160	4631580	Oh, yeah, and there's still virtual console things on the Wii shop that aren't on Wii U. Yeah
4631580	4638140	Um, wow YYR says yeah, no Wii, no Wii shop, no anything. Well, that's crazy
4639140	4641500	Dungeon Buster says I wasn't sure the Wii U news either
4641900	4647680	Nintendo had usually ended production of the previous hardware gen after the introduction of a new one. Yeah, so
4648200	4652360	Anyway, we really don't know anything until E3 happens. That's for sure
4653060	4655140	Anyhow, Dark Sakura on a different note
4655940	4658660	Well, there are some interesting things going on
4659340	4663380	Especially since we've been talking about the whole let's play controversy and the
4664620	4671320	Copywriting and everything, but there's actually been a copyright filed for that dragon cancer
4671820	4677220	let's plays in particular and the big reason is that because the game itself is
4677740	4679140	short and
4679140	4684760	Rather linear. It's not something that you're going to play again and again and so
4685660	4687660	Having a let's play of it out
4687940	4690620	Sort of eliminates the need to have to someone buy it themselves
4692140	4698540	Especially since they had a small development team and you know need to actually pay their developers
4700620	4704220	You know for games that have it was actually quoted on here for games that have
4705020	4711260	More expansive and replayable gameplay having let's plays can directly benefit their developers
4711260	4713540	And then here's where the actual quote is
4713540	4718300	However, for a short relatively linear experience like us for millions of users viewers
4718300	4724860	Let's play recordings of our content satisfy their interest and they never go on to interact with the game in the personal way
4724860	4726860	We intend it for it to be experienced
4728820	4733020	They go on to say later on is that people have been posting the entire
4733780	4735420	soundtrack online
4735420	4738020	without even linking back to where to buy it from or
4738220	4742740	even to the game a lot of the let's plays don't link to where they they can get the game or
4743500	4750380	Soundtracks for themselves. So this actually in a case like this. It does take money from an indie developers pocket
4750500	4753220	This is money that likely is
4753780	4756240	What they're trying to live on, you know
4756900	4760860	so in that way that the let's play ends up being a
4761580	4766220	Detriment and I will go ahead and read this quote because I really do like it
4766220	4768220	We
4768660	4773340	Are asking that you return the favor by creating let's play videos that don't
4773700	4777500	Just rebroadcast the entirety of our content with minimal commentary
4777540	4784900	But instead use portions of our content as a context to share your own stories and start conversations with your viewers
4785140	4790500	Isn't that interesting because I literally had just talked about I believe let's play streams should be this
4791220	4797780	Versus just flat gameplay that people want to see and here's a game developer kind of saying that is that we want to hear the
4797940	4803500	Commentary and the talk and the discussion about what this game makes you feel don't just do a straight rip of our game
4803500	4811140	Well, that's a little different though from a game that talks about the experience of people dealing with cancer in their lives
4811980	4813780	versus
4813780	4815780	Mario maker, you know
4816580	4821680	I was gonna say Borderlands, you know going around shooting people in zero gravity, you know or
4822380	4828000	Low gravity, you know, it's it's a different story. I don't think that Borderlands really has a
4828820	4832400	Very or Mario maker has a very deep story
4832980	4836580	To tell that relates to human experience. Those are escapism
4837060	4842820	this is trying to get a story across to share an experience and to get a dialogue started and
4842820	4845060	Doing
4845060	4848060	The let's plays with no commentary or minimal commentary
4848420	4854380	Does defeat the purpose the point is to talk about it and start a conversation and I also do agree
4854380	4856180	You know when you're dealing with
4856180	4858860	with independent development for games
4860380	4862620	The let's plays can be good
4863300	4868740	Advertising to an extent but you have to make it a vehicle for for that, you know
4868780	4874260	In their quote they really just said can you just link back to where people can buy the game and I was like that is
4874260	4880260	Really not too much to ask people. Well, see that's that's one another one that they asked is, you know
4880260	4885720	If you're gonna do something like this donate a dollar or two to the studio if you believe and I'm gonna say that what we
4885720	4889100	Did has value the small act will allow us to continue to work
4889780	4892260	So I would actually encourage everyone right now
4892980	4894980	That's listening to this
4895060	4899500	You've got a dollar I'm sure you have a dollar if you can pay for your internet access you have a dollar
4900520	4906220	Go to that dragons cancer calm that dragon cancer calm and give them a dollar
4906820	4911380	Right now do it. I want to see your receipt. Wow. I think this is the first time in
4912180	4917100	13 years that Jamie hasn't said give me a dollar. She's saying give somebody else a dollar
4917660	4920040	You know, it's because I'm actually employed now
4920640	4924960	And I have been for two years fair enough, you know, you can get me a taco
4925920	4932000	But I want you I will I will donate all of my I want everyone to donate the taco money
4932840	4936680	To that dragon cancer calm, um, you know
4936680	4941940	I'm gonna ask the indie dev in the house your thoughts on this whole situation with the let's plays and everything
4942400	4945480	Has crumple had let's plays because I know you have a demo out there
4945640	4950560	There's um, I know a couple of and a couple of folks had had done some twitch streams
4950560	4955480	The beauty is that my you know, my demo is what I have out there. So that's that
4955480	4961160	So what they've played in the demo is essentially maybe a quarter of the entire episode
4961160	4965600	And I think that's where I'm really happy. I I went that I went that route
4966600	4972160	But you know because what they're playing now, I mean what was in that demo compared to what's in it now
4972480	4976320	It's not even there's so much more so I'm not even sad about it
4976720	4981040	But I do I do think it it it's a huge problem
4981040	4985600	I think it's a huge problem because I mean, let's look I mean, let's look at yeah
4985600	4990320	Let's look at the steam the steam refund policy, you know, they're trying they're trying to
4990880	4994740	Extend the the length of time again, you know one can play, you know
4994740	4998320	Two hours is enough because what if I beat the game in under two hours and I didn't like it
4998320	5000560	Even though I beat the game. I want my money back
5000760	5001760	You know what I'm saying?
5001760	5008020	And it's it's really it's it's so so it's so so tough right now to be able to do that
5008020	5011880	I thought you have to I mean, I don't want to spend too much time trying to figure out
5012720	5019120	Suggest other ways that they're like, you know, make you know make up cut those losses. But yeah, it's
5020200	5025700	We in the chapter we you know, even with myself. We just try to say how else can we can we get?
5026120	5030240	You know, how else can we market our product how you know, what else can we do apparel?
5030440	5036560	And things like, you know, you know apparel art things like that, you know other little things that are tangible
5036640	5039600	This has been my thing with digital versus physical
5040240	5047080	You know, what's funny what you're saying there that used to be the line that people used to use to justify stealing music
5047080	5053800	Mm-hmm was the whole well, I bought the poster about the t-shirts with the concert. So I'm gonna take the album
5054400	5060040	Right, you know or I only want these two songs from this album because the sorry because the rest of the album
5060040	5065600	Is just awful. So that's why I only style. I downloaded these two songs. These are the only two songs I wanted
5065600	5067200	I didn't want to pay $15 for it
5067200	5072520	and and yeah, and you know, but but it's so funny because now we seem to be going back to
5073360	5081240	That old way of things because you know, it's like how do I prevent you know, my digital product being?
5082360	5089720	pirated and copied and I had mentioned I affect I sent Brianna a big article about that there was a particular game studio that
5090440	5093040	can't remember the name of the game off the top of my head, but
5093440	5096160	They had hit a milestone where they sold 300,000 copies
5096520	5103280	but they had they had a but there was a pirated amount of 1.6 million and
5103760	5109600	Most of them were from Russia Brazil Wow, and that that's that's insanity
5109800	5115480	That's utter insane. So you so they're like, yeah, we've sold we've met, you know, we've sold over 300 grand
5115960	5120920	In our game, but 1.6 million have sexually stolen it. So it's like what do you put on the box?
5121560	5125080	Sold 300,000 copies or played by two million, right?
5125960	5130280	By played by two million pirates. What do you do about that? Yeah. Yeah
5131400	5134040	Going to our chat over at live dog network calm our pal
5134040	5138800	Bobby black wolf says there was even that one guy who liked the game, but it was less than two hours
5138800	5141560	So they wanted their money back. Anyway, I think with firewatch
5141880	5146520	Yeah firewatch game but like I view it see I view the short games
5146800	5151040	Especially the ones that tell a story like that like firewatch. I enjoyed firewatch
5151040	5158200	I didn't like firewatch as much as like gone home or I think everybody's gone to the rapture was my favorite of those
5158400	5160200	Walking simulators. Yeah
5160200	5163000	But I still view them as movies
5163560	5167600	Right movies are only gonna be like two hours and you my god
5167600	5169840	Do you know how much you fucking pay to go to a movie these days?
5169840	5174360	But that's the expert but I think that's the thing, you know, it's that perception and that expectation
5174360	5181040	What we have we sold us have we as indie game developers sold ourselves so desperately short
5181480	5183520	Because it's like we have to make it free
5183760	5187840	Otherwise, no one's gonna give a crap about our game and because even my game
5187840	5190040	I know my crumple game is gonna be short
5190120	5194820	Hope probably depending on how it's played, but I'm gonna sell it for a dollar this so
5195240	5198640	This is what blows my fucking mind. You ready? Okay, so
5199120	5205240	What what was said right there the guy who sold back firewatch because it was too damn short or whatever it I bet
5205440	5208360	that son of a bitch went this weekend and
5209040	5216320	Went and saw Batman vs Superman. Mm-hmm, even when they probably read all over the internet. Oh god
5216320	5221060	I'm gonna fucking hate this movie. It's gonna be garbage and sad Ben Affleck and oh god
5221060	5224040	It's gonna be look at the Metacritic rating. It's gonna be so fucking terrible
5224040	5227020	And yeah, give me a $5 soda and popcorn with that, right? Yeah
5227020	5232020	Yeah, but then went to Starbucks before that and it's like look and I'm not saying I didn't see Batman vs Superman
5232020	5233500	I don't know if it's good or bad
5233500	5239140	My whole thing is that like dude probably talk shit about the movie on the internet went and paid the money to see it
5239140	5244260	Anyway, but yet wants a refund on firewatch. Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah, apparently it's so bad. It's hilarious
5244260	5248300	I don't I've heard some people like it. Some people think whatever I haven't seen it yet
5248300	5254620	I have no I know I'm just saying based based on Twitter, which I judge a lot of things based on what I see on Twitter
5254620	5256620	It's my perception of the entire world
5257860	5260300	It was about Batman vs Superman, but we don't need to go down
5261380	5268220	And and funny enough this happened to um, there was a guy in the news about someone someone had pirated. I think it was
5269000	5275660	Diablo 2 or something like that Diablo 2 and finally actually like paid for it like 19 years later or something like that
5275660	5279360	I don't know if it was Diablo 2, but they did that. Okay, since you brought that up
5279360	5284220	Do you know what's fucking crazy about that story Jamie? Did you did you hear about that story? Huh?
5288020	5289500	So apparently
5289500	5294340	Someone I think it was Diablo 2 someone had pirated a copy of Diablo 2 like 19 years ago
5294340	5299180	And they and they just put in the news like a dick couple days ago that that person who pirated it
5299400	5303860	Finally bought the game. Okay, you know, yeah, here's the punchline. It was shivam
5304900	5310460	Why really? Yes, our old pal that we used to play DDR with what that was him. Oh
5311020	5316860	My god, yes, cuz I saw I read about it on his Twitter feed on his that was not
5316860	5318860	That was not what I was expecting you to say
5319380	5323260	These years later and I'm like, oh my god, like he yeah, he's been all over the
5323980	5328740	Tacos and all that stuff like dude pays Diablo developer 40 bucks. Yeah, it's our old pal show him
5328740	5332540	We just play DDR with oh my good. Oh, I just outed him as a DDR player, too
5333300	5335060	Sorry
5335060	5341420	Now looking up his name no, I was okay with people knowing that I was a thief but a DER person
5341420	5346900	Yeah, I have I have limits don't put my business in the street wrong
5348300	5351200	You're just in Sacramento. Stop doing that
5351740	5357300	But that scares me though, like that scared that scares me as a developer that scares the hell out of me
5357300	5362660	It's like how much super impressed after years of actually not talking to him that I remember his last name. Yeah
5363180	5366580	Right, and it's it's one of those things were like if you know the guy like, you know
5366580	5370480	We just played either are with him like when I read that this didn't surprise me whatsoever. Like this is just
5371000	5373180	Like when I when I heard he did this I was like, oh, yeah
5374280	5379380	Even though I probably last like saw him in person probably like ten years ago. This is still doesn't surprise me whatsoever
5380540	5386040	Anyway, it's funny. Yeah. Well, I mean again it you know, I think just as a
5386700	5392640	As a you know as a chair for the chapter, you know, you know and Brianna and I we just we just
5392660	5397100	Try to give all the suggestions that we possibly can to just market your stuff
5397100	5402740	I mean, I have to remind myself Brianna has to tell me sometimes Gabriel, by the way, don't forget this
5402740	5408140	Don't forget that because it's the only way you know, that's gonna help you get that word out there
5408180	5414660	So, I mean, it's yeah, it's a meant that digital meant to help us, but it's biting us in the ass
5416220	5421240	All right. Well, let's let's move on. I this let's play thing really doesn't have an easy solution
5421360	5428440	I'm really curious to see what's gonna happen legally with this stuff as something like twitch gains more and more and more traction
5428440	5432520	But honestly and like I I do a little bit of streaming myself. I don't do a lot of it
5432520	5437240	I really need to do more admittedly as a media personality or whatever the hell you want to call it
5437400	5443140	I need to do more of it, but I have no problem like linking back to buy the game
5444040	5447640	Duh, like why not? Yeah, that's give me good reasons
5447640	5452180	Why not because I can't think of any so anyway, let's move on with some more news Alan
5453480	5459120	So it has been rumored that they a Sony is making a PlayStation 4.5
5460120	5463920	Console, which is that sort of the pet name that the rumor Mills given it
5465160	5471040	Digital Foundry released a report that says that the existence of this thing has been corroborated
5471560	5477320	From independent sources and it's been independent which sort of sounds like my friend who I can't tell you who he is
5477320	5480200	But he's like super serious and he works there like it sounds like one of those
5481760	5487040	But apparently a prototype exists and Sony devs do have it and are messing with it
5488320	5495420	The speculation now is what would a PlayStation 4.5 be in relation to the current one?
5495420	5501120	Would it be a replacement like it would be the PlayStation slim where they're just like if you buy a PlayStation 4 it will be
5501120	5502660	this version
5502660	5508980	Will it be something that is only advertised to those that have the technology like a 4k TV that can use it
5508980	5514760	Like you absolutely do not need this unless you're goddamn loaded and you have the TV then we've made this for you
5515100	5520020	To cater to the the bleeding-edge people or will it be a weird sort of?
5520500	5524860	3ds versus new 3ds type console where it's like a side grade
5525460	5532260	But then I guess from the Digital Foundry report the see the GPU that they would put in it is so powerful
5533260	5538360	It really is something that could wait for like a next generation release
5538660	5543960	So why would they spend the money? It wouldn't be very affordable to put that in for something that would just be a side grade
5552860	5554860	It's better than 4.5
5562260	5564260	And Gabe can probably attest to this a little bit
5564260	5569260	Even programming for HD and doing graphics for HD is a bitch
5569260	5571260	Can you imagine 4k?
5571260	5578340	Well, that's just it because you know and again you you touched upon this earlier when you were talking about
5578700	5584580	The the NX controller without the buttons all we know when someone said in the in the in the room about you know
5584580	5590020	What about those who need the buttons because you know of disabled players and such it would be the same thing here
5590020	5593420	you know like people can barely see you know, like
5594700	5597900	Okay, watch out watch the my and by the way most like my I am funny
5597900	5602340	I shouldn't be complaining my my thumb had hit the switch and my mic was off and I was talking a minute ago
5606060	5613000	Thank you, so because yeah, it takes so much and what and the problem is is that you know for for reading
5613000	5619780	It's really difficult for the just the the average person just really like what is that saying in there? Oh my god
5619780	5624000	I need I need a tube TV. So yeah. Yeah 4k. No, thank you. We're not ready yet
5624820	5630180	Why why are in chat did say that the rumor is that it's going to be capable of 4k media playback
5630180	5634800	But it's not gonna do anything for the games that makes a little more sense since yeah
5634800	5641100	You know the devices in your living room aren't just for games anymore and that makes a lot more sense. Mm-hmm
5642300	5646540	All right. Well, let's move on and talk about some more rumors
5647540	5649540	It's like an all rumor edition of
5650140	5654300	Orange lounge radio, but apparently actually I think Microsoft is actually
5654940	5656940	Clarified this one here. So
5657380	5663020	Microsoft recently did a customer survey talking about digital trade-in which started this whole thing that all
5663340	5667260	Microsoft's looking at doing digital trade-ins. Well Xbox games marketing
5667700	5670220	Aaron Greenberg actually mentioned on Twitter
5670220	5675740	We are not actively planning such a thing always asking questions to understand the needs of our fans
5675900	5683620	No need to worry and in a reply to games analyst Michael patcher. I'm sorry. I always say it wrong games analyst
5684180	5688640	Michael patcher said we are not actively planning such a thing surprised
5688640	5695460	It was even asked in a survey not fire being played with so if you were excited about the digital trade-ins just wait longer
5695460	5697460	Isn't that what they got?
5697480	5701060	Obliterated over the that's sort of the theme. Oh, no, no
5701060	5704260	No, nobody would have cared if you could actually trade in your digital games
5704260	5709660	But it was the whole fact that it was going to be that the disk things would still be tied to your console
5709660	5713260	That was the whole it was like a license that was bound. Yeah, exactly exactly
5713980	5718400	That was the thing that was getting rubbing people the wrong way. But what do you three was that?
5719340	5722780	2013 12. Yeah, I think 13. Yeah
5723820	5731580	Because then there was the one where like well that was in the whole pre build-up and that nothing was out yet. Yeah, and then
5732060	5734620	Sony came out on the stage and
5735140	5741140	Literally punched them in the face with the whole video that said they literally did it like you came out with a big
5741940	5747780	Honestly, that's what it felt like did you all did you all not see Microsoft getting punched in the face of that e3?
5747780	5750540	That's gonna be awesome. We look back at the decade in gaming
5750540	5755540	That's gonna be one of the top ten moments easy for the record. Hmm the misuse of the world literal
5756060	5758060	Figurally makes my head explode. I
5759460	5761460	Literally am not sorry
5761580	5762900	I
5762900	5765800	Agree with you. I agree with you Jamie
5767240	5771580	Well, then why don't why don't you tell us a literal news story over there at our soccer
5774500	5775820	Well
5775820	5781500	You know, it would actually help if it had pulled up and not frozen on me. There we go. Okay, so minecraft stuff
5782020	5783940	We like minecraft only
5783940	5789020	Yes, I used to like my I've never played it and I'm not I'm not trolling sort of goodness
5789660	5794940	Never played minecraft and I thought I was living under a rock not playing the last of us
5795540	5797540	Minecraft for me is just oh
5797980	5804980	Happy quiet music dig holes dig holes. It's a Zen game. It's a very Zen game to play is
5805540	5806820	so
5806820	5810740	Minecraft is getting another real-world crossover
5810740	5812740	There
5813100	5819540	Is a tech conference in Norway called the gathering and they're hosting a live concert in
5820020	5828180	Real life actually know they already did this according to this. Sorry. They hosted a concert in real life and in Minecraft
5829020	5830060	so
5830060	5832060	They have volunteers
5832060	5834060	Um
5834140	5838940	Mimicking the artists in Minecraft that you know, the ones that were parading on the stage
5838940	5842340	They're having it do it in Minecraft with people playing it
5842740	5846380	So and it was a pretty big deal from what I can tell
5846900	5848440	so
5848440	5852840	Yeah, there apparently was only room for like 3,000 people on the server for that
5852840	5856920	I'd love to know if anyone actually watched this thing and what they thought of it. So
5857920	5862560	That sounds awesome, yeah, I think so kind of like Second Life and almost sounds like what's second
5867960	5869460	Flying dicks
5869460	5871460	Show up in Second Life
5871840	5874920	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
5874920	5878040	Let's look at some video games coming out this week around the world
5878280	5881460	Starting off with Allen's gonna help out with the US States since Loki's not here
5881460	5885680	So it looks like a shit ton of oculus drift games are coming out this week
5885680	5889900	Oh, could that be because the oculus rift retail release is happening. I think so
5889900	5894620	I'm sorry not oops scratch that not retail release, but the like the first
5896880	5902000	Version is finally hitting the hands of like real people. Okay, so for the oculus rift

6021660	6025820	Don't think so, I think that game knows the lyrics to I will survive
6026460	6031660	Anyway, not everybody's gonna understand that that's okay. Is that it? Yeah, I finally get that
6033040	6036800	Moving on let's go to Japan. Let's all go in a plane right now

6049780	6054560	2016 please note. This is not actually a game about post horses. That's right
6054560	6061900	It's a horsey game and they love horsey games in Japan in chat ikuma son says, oh, yay. Welcome to Japan
6061980	6063840	That's right. We're all staying at your place
6063840	6068740	Yeah, I think you missed the episode of Kuma where we actually talked about we're coming to Japan and crashing at your place
6068740	6070740	So hope there's room. All right anyway
6071220	6076460	On the Vita Kona Ozora needs to bust out. Whoa, he'll get a cruise sign
6077140	6082820	Comes out in regular and limited edition. I'm assuming this is based off an anime called cruise sign
6082820	6085160	I am NOT up to up on my anime
6085780	6087780	But that's what this kind of looks like here

6105740	6110580	Yokai watch this is oh, no, it is it is the characters from yokai. Well, I take that back
6110620	6113620	it is the characters in yokai watch in a
6115180	6118540	Different type of game this looks a little bit more like some type of
6119420	6123380	Tactical type of the romance of the three kingdoms. It actually means
6123980	6129880	Records of the three empires. So it's yokai watch three romances. Well, that's an interesting little crossover there
6129880	6134640	So yeah, I'm assuming that's gonna be the big release in Japan this week then because yokai. Yep
6135160	6141920	So coming out in the UK just a few things on the 28th. We have a drift for PC and

6182080	6184720	Game stop for their shareholders having a rough time
6185720	6193440	A game shop share game stop shares are collapsing after the company said it expects sales to fall this quarter
6193560	6197720	So they put out, you know a release saying hey, we know what our numbers are looking like
6198880	6205080	So we're you know, it's not gonna be a surprise. This is what's happening. And of course
6206320	6211360	Shares fell as much as 7% I don't really actually to see if this has
6211360	6213360	This
6214960	6219920	Story caught me by surprise so close after the release dates, so
6222080	6224080	So game stops in trouble, basically
6224080	6229440	yeah, they're losing money which I don't want to say yay cuz like people work there and a lot of people who love video games
6229440	6232160	get their foot in the door by working at GameStop until they
6232840	6238540	Become jaded and miserable and leave because they're apparently not really a good place to work for really
6238540	6242460	I'm not gonna shit on the employees really because do you know what I was gonna say about GameStop?
6250820	6257220	Regardless of what they represent like people who absolutely have to buy their groceries at Walmart because that's what they can afford
6257620	6261100	Don't hate on them hate the fact that just Walmart's a big gross company. All right. All right
6262740	6266160	Yeah, I think as of March 24th they were
6267040	6273800	They they were 30 bucks a share which doesn't really seem all that bad to me but
6275400	6281760	Well, if the company used to be like $60 a share now, they're $30 a sure it actually would be so it's not even like
6282280	6284720	They're there in their death throes, you know
6284720	6289280	Get get ready to put them on a boat and set them on fire and kick them out to see it's not to that point
6289280	6291280	Yet they're just they're not doing well
6291280	6293080	But
6293080	6299240	But but they're gonna they're gonna make all that money through nerd licensing and they're gonna they're basically gonna become hot topic
6299400	6303320	But instead of like shirts for your favorite topic is the video game hot topic
6303320	6309200	You know, it's like half kirby t-shirt Zelda t-shirts. That's true. It's like instead of the metal band t-shirts
6309200	6313760	It'll be like oh and here's our used. It's all Kingdom Hearts and Adventure Time, which I'm all for that's true
6313760	6318140	I'm like, I'm fucking 37 years old still shop a hot topic cuz that's where I get some really funny shirts
6318380	6324660	So, what can you do and they got think geek now too, I think yeah, they're thinking with merchandise soon
6324660	6330340	Well, I know GameStop's also been getting into that whole like use tablet and like, you know devices
6330340	6333600	so, you know that I will give them at least that as much as you know,
6333600	6338860	I have to razz on in a little bit cuz you know GameStop at least they are trying like they can kind of see the
6338860	6340980	end coming so they're really trying to
6341740	6343220	like
6343220	6345220	Think fast and not have that happen
6345700	6347700	So, all right
6347740	6352180	Well, anyhow, let's move on one more story here and then we'll get to the classic game of the week
6352180	6356420	And this has to do with making your own steam controller. That's right
6356420	6362140	You can just if you have the technical know-how, why don't just build your own damn controller. You think it's so easy
6363180	6368140	You think you think we charge too much of this controller here go build your own damn controller because valve
6368500	6373980	Actually released the CAD files the computer-aided design CAD files for the steam controller
6373980	6380900	They actually post it on Steam. Here's a zip file. And if you have the technical know-how, you can actually use a 3d printer and
6381780	6383540	Be on your way like you know
6383540	6386420	You're gonna have to know the technical know-how to like wire it together and shit
6386420	6391000	But if you are that person go ye forth and build your own steam controller
6391380	6399100	That is kind of crazy for a company that is first getting into hardware like valve to be doing that but I found that
6399660	6400580	fascinating
6400580	6407360	But valve does say as far as commercial use goes valve will have to approve designs and give permission
6408020	6412960	Before users are allowed to sell their work because you know right now somebody is like, okay
6412960	6418780	Well now these CAD design is out here. How do I place these two directional pads right on top of tits?
6422860	6424540	Somebody is thinking that right now
6424540	6426620	So if they want to be able to sell that commercially
6426660	6431100	They're gonna have to get valves permission and I can think I think Lord gave him in his temple Michael
6432660	6440460	No, so, you know, I I don't think I don't think the tit controller will actually be available or balls whatever you're into
6440460	6446060	You know, there's some somebody's trying to figure. I will allow a half-life episode 3 before I let those things
6447420	6449420	We all know how that's gonna go down
6449580	6455100	Akuma JP in our chat over at live dot vog network comm says darn there goes my idea. Well, I'm sorry. Sorry
6455900	6460580	Sometimes we break the difficult news here on this show. I'm sorry to say. All right
6461100	6465580	Let's get to the classic game of the week every week dark soccer steps into the gaming vault
6466700	6473600	And she finds a game that she thinks hey you insufferable little brats of the world. I mean you adorable children
6474020	6481960	Why don't you take a take a look back on a classic game at least 10 years old that you need to respect?
6481960	6483280	Respect
6483280	6487300	Because all future games have this game to thank for where they come from
6487680	6490320	And I think that's especially true about this week's game
6490720	6496560	Which I'm so glad you decided when we have such esteemed guests here from the Sacramento IGDA
6496560	6502200	I'm so glad you picked this dark soccer this we had to pick it out the classic game
6502200	6506160	I had to pick it out from a bin under the bed that was covered in dust bunnies
6507040	6512320	And then I like how to make sure the cat didn't pee on it so so what is it what is this week's classic game?
6512320	6514780	Of the week shy swirled. I mean spice world
6520480	6527500	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah, it's appropriate because we had the the news of the 20th anniversary tour this week
6527880	6530240	So this is this is by the way
6531160	6534120	Hello, by the way. Hi there. How are you doing?
6534800	6536800	By the way
6537000	6541500	This game. I'm sorry. The Spice Girls are celebrating their 20th anniversary this year
6542640	6544560	How old are you?
6544560	6551400	All right quiet. We're trying to do a segment here. He's my segment. I was only three years old when wannabe came out. Yeah, right
6553120	6558240	This game well, I believe that this was what 1998 yeah
6559240	6565520	Yeah, well the Spice Girls were really only around for about four years so yeah, I had to be he was hilarious
6565520	6567920	I love the movie. It's so bad. It's
6569680	6575960	Meatloaf and back before like he was like fucking crazy meatloaf and Richard O'Brien and ab fab girls
6575960	6581800	Like it's oh my god. You showed me that movie when we started dating and he didn't dump me on the spot
6581800	6586440	I was really I was super on board with it until the aliens showed up and I was like, okay
6586440	6591160	Is this for real? Is this really happening in this movie when the flying saucer came?
6591160	6594960	I was hook line and sinker and that that was what broke it for me
6597600	6599600	So
6601200	6603000	To move on
6603000	6606540	Basically in this game you have to prepare the Spice Girls for a live
6607200	6612120	Television concert and you have to teach them their dance steps because they don't know this by heart
6612480	6619160	You have to choose what song to perform and the sequence in which the songs lyrics will be sung because without
6619560	6622040	Teleprompters, how are they ever gonna remember their lyrics?
6622760	6624720	you know, so
6624720	6628280	So then you play once you get all of that put together
6628440	6634320	You play as the camera person and you pick what shots will go and the angle and everything
6634320	6636320	So you were basically their manager designer?
6636840	6638840	camera person and PR
6639640	6641640	and then
6642120	6646700	You also get instructed by it says a disco King
6647320	6652080	let's do so anyway, the Spice Girls all it's all their voices in here and
6652840	6655760	Who cares about the game because the Easter eggs are hilarious
6656640	6658360	so first of all
6658360	6666120	In the menu, you have the mixing room dance practice dance record television studio spice network and options the songs in the game
6666800	6668800	Are wannabes say you'll be there
6669160	6675920	Who do you think you are spice up your life move over and if you can't dance is in the intro to become one is
6675920	6681120	Only in the spice Network and naked is only in the spice Network. So this game
6681760	6683760	got a
6684120	6686120	Two out of ten from IGN
6687680	6690940	3 because you can't spell ignorant without IGN
6690940	6697620	It got a 2.3 from EGM electronic game monthly gaming monthly
6698340	6702140	There's a reason why they're out of this game. We know why they're gone
6702140	6708020	I'll blow low gave them 2.3 out of 10 now a gamer which I don't think I've ever heard of
6708380	6711900	Was 2.5 out of 10 and the New York Times said it was unfavorable
6714020	6716020	New York to reach that rag
6716940	6718940	And
6718980	6722860	Out of the game rankings site they got
6723860	6731900	40% out of four whole reviews. So what about all the good things spice world did it's still better than et apparently
6732820	6738260	It kept meatloaf relevant for a while. I have had some of the biggest laughs
6738260	6744080	I have never liked some of my best gaming memories are actually with this game because I laughed so hard that I
6744400	6749600	Actually peed my pants like it is just this game. Is that funny? I'm sorry
6750200	6754520	Not so I have to give you the codes for this the cheat codes because they're hilarious
6755320	6757560	There's one called spiffy you dance moves
6758120	6765800	So you get new moves by holding start and then square triangle circle triangle and you get dance studio and just dance a lot
6765800	6770520	And then of course, this is PlayStation 1. Okay, then you get naked spice
6770520	6772120	Ooh
6772120	6776200	so if you do the hidden messages code and then you do
6777080	6780200	L1 l2 r1 r2 select and start
6780600	6787580	Simultaneously to reset the game and you get an alternate title screen that has them all naked except for sitting in chairs covering their bits
6788320	6790880	Get out. That was a thing. That was a thing. I
6792080	6794080	shit you not I
6794880	6796880	Somebody just put that on Wikipedia. Oh
6796880	6801200	Oh my god, I never knew that was the thing that you could actually do
6803320	6808640	Rob has to see this. That's okay. You just I'll see you during break. Well, I'm gonna put it in the chat room
6808640	6814520	Oh, will you now? Oh boy. All right, check that out over at live dog network calm. Here comes some naked spice girls
6816720	6822480	Naked spice so the premise is that you have to help them with their dance moves and they're remembering the lyrics
6823360	6825520	Oh my god, cuz it sounds like
6826280	6828280	it sounds like the game starts off as
6828560	6830480	The Spice Girls aren't very bright
6830480	6836780	You need to you need to help them like with their with what they do for a living the part that's killing me
6836780	6840660	I am like I'm like laughing crying over here. Look at the
6841180	6845680	expressions on like Jerry's face and like scary space like
6845960	6849520	fucking scary spice is like spread-eagle in that chair going
6853160	6855160	No, that's posh in the middle oh
6855880	6860760	My god, I'm scary is the one on the left looking like a rabbit, honey. I know my Spice Girls
6864760	6867440	Scarier anyhow, go ahead. Sorry. Sorry, go ahead and finish
6872400	6875280	Anyway other codes you can get a new title screen
6876160	6878640	With codes you can get giant spice
6879360	6880440	So
6880440	6886440	At the main menu when your characters walking across the globe if you hold start and press circle square circle square
6887080	6890200	Then they'll grow up to giant size
6890840	6895660	You also can get the hidden messages. This was the thing that takes you to the naked spice
6897800	6903080	Where when your characters walking across the globe you hold start button circle triangle triangle circle
6903080	6906040	And then you'll get a code to confirm and you enter in more shit
6906040	6910160	You can look this up for yourselves and then the handbag code. This is great
6910680	6915260	Set the globe you press the start square triangle circle triangle
6915760	6919240	After that when you go to the television studio when your act is ready
6919800	6925880	Instead of everyone standing in a line all the Spice Girls will be crowded around a pile of handbags on the floor
6927000	6929000	That's it
6929760	6931040	Ah
6931040	6936040	Game of the year game of the millennia. Really? I mean, is there is there a more important?
6936040	6940560	I mean, I know I just said that whole thing about Symphony of the Night, but then I'm like, oh, yeah Spice World shit
6940720	6948160	Like Castlevania doesn't even fucking matter anymore. No, no, what is a man a miserable pile of naked spice girl codes?
6950520	6954960	Alan I feel like you're dying to say something over there about Spice World. No. No, did you play?
6954960	6958000	Did you play this game when it was first out? No, you will you know, it's hilarious
6958040	6962800	Is that our buddy Brad from pod culture celebrated 500 episodes last week in here?
6963520	6970000	They Brad actually sent me a copy of Spice World for PlayStation 1 and I have yet to do a live stream of it
6970000	6974560	Cuz I didn't get my PlayStation 3 cuz you have to do like some bypass protection on PlayStation 3 so long story short
6974560	6977360	I haven't done it yet, but I really think Alan
6977360	6982040	I think we should sit down and take some serious time to actually play through the game. What do you think? Sure sound like
6983120	6985120	You're so easy to please
6986080	6990480	Hello what what I have another game that is
6991680	6995160	Not oh, yeah, it's it's kind of I guess the same theory
6995560	6999080	But I'll tell you what at the time I couldn't make my way through the game
6999080	7005720	but it's on Dreamcast called super producers and it's basically you're controlling a pop idols career and
7006720	7009960	It kind of makes me think cuz these came out like around the same time
7010120	7013800	That I wonder if one or the other wasn't the inspiration or something
7013800	7015720	All
7015720	7019720	Right. Well, we're gonna take a quick break guys. We're running a maybe a little bit long tonight
7019720	7022920	But when we come back, I think our guests are still gonna be here you guys do you stay?
7022920	7024040	Okay, so they're gonna stay a little longer
7024040	7029400	We'll talk to them a little more and we'll get your calls at one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange

7050480	7051640	2016
7051640	7058620	Joined tonight with our special guests here in studio Gabe and Brianna from the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA
7058680	7060080	Thanks for having fun with us tonight
7060080	7064460	I know I know you guys must have loved the spice world pick their classic game of the week. That was
7065360	7066320	hilarious
7066320	7067840	Yes
7067840	7072200	Educational too. Yeah, it was it was educational. It was better than chubby cherub
7072200	7076480	how how is spice world inspired you as a game designer, um, I
7080800	7082800	Yes that answer
7083480	7089640	That's all I've got. Yes. I'm still convinced to this day that the Jerry at that time
7090120	7092120	Would have probably qualified as a bioqueen
7093720	7098320	You you have been like all like like drag-queening your life this past week
7098320	7102860	Not that I'm gonna complain, but I feel like you like just now finally suddenly figured out. Oh, yeah
7102860	7107440	I should be watching RuPaul's Drag Race. No, it's not just that it's that I appreciate art
7108160	7109200	and
7109200	7111200	I have discovered this is an art
7111880	7114200	And so I have absolutely fall in love with it because you know
7114200	7118160	I pick an obsession like that lasts me for six months and then I'd move on to something else
7118160	7120160	It's like Alan playing games
7120960	7123780	But am I wrong no, I would recommend
7124320	7126320	It's 25 minutes long
7126520	7130380	Which is actually sped up from the normal to our process of just watching
7130920	7135280	Trixie talk through putting on her makeup. Oh, I have and it's a couple times
7135280	7141760	It's incredible and doing makeup on that other guy the bald guy st. James. Yeah, who is one of the club kids
7141960	7146400	So I knew him from that. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Okay, so if
7147400	7149400	Drag queens are art
7149920	7152680	And if video games are art
7153360	7157440	Where is my RuPaul's Drag Race video game?
7158200	7161600	This is not like I feel like this is an SAT equation
7161600	7166760	That has not been accurately based channel 5 came out for the second recast in 1999
7168120	7174440	What's that from here out? I am going to combine dragon cosplay. Oh
7176400	7181640	Okay, interesting starting with my cosplay this year for gamer X are you are you going as ooh la la
7181640	7187320	This is a bad list. Okay. All right. I am going I've already decided to do my moto kuma outfit
7187920	7189840	It's gonna be
7189840	7195560	I'm actually going to invest in a good wig. I'm going to buy makeup specifically for this
7196040	7201200	Just remember if you're not wearing nails, you're not doing drag. I'm having bear gloves. All right
7201920	7208160	Anyway, I'll paint the nails on them fifth dream in chat says drag in age get it
7210600	7212600	Over here dying over here
7212960	7214640	maybe
7214640	7216640	Well, I was not in the first game before
7217800	7224520	Corrects me with an email. I do know there was an iPhone game that like I think was calling dragopolis or something
7224520	7229200	Yeah, because I know they were advertising going gamer X but I know it was a runner, right?
7230200	7237400	Dorian's contour work, but but here's my thing. I need my full like immersive we you
7238320	7242520	Tablet actually know now I want to aim for PlayStation VR now
7242520	7245320	I think we should be able to actually walk the main stage
7248040	7251280	No, just have it on ps4 with an option for VR
7251920	7257640	No, right for those of us who get completely motion sick and would throw up on the heels. All right, fine fine
7257640	7262160	Maybe ps4 K. This is this is a use. This is a justifiable use of 4k
7262160	7267680	I need to see all of the colors and Kim she'll you murder face says it perfectly a drag race MMO. I
7268360	7275800	Love it. I love it. Why not? But see I I think the cosplay in and of itself is related
7275800	7281120	I think any dude that's playing a female tune in an MMO is kind of doing a drag race
7281480	7283480	To begin with
7285640	7287640	That's just the way I approach things I
7288240	7292920	Have been considering that cosplay really isn't that far of a step off. It's not
7293640	7300200	Especially for cross players. Mm-hmm, you know, it's art dress-up is fun period dress-up is fun. That's it
7300200	7302200	Yeah, and putting on a lot of makeup
7302720	7307400	That takes an hour. Mm-hmm is very satisfying when you're done with it and even more to wash it off
7307400	7310400	Why don't you cross play for a sack indie arcade? I bet they'd love that
7311640	7316480	I don't have a costume for that right now. Just have my I just have my Grey Warden
7317120	7321800	And I ain't wearing that it then when it's hot. I was gonna say Grey Warden. Yes
7321800	7329120	I do have my Joker outfit from Mass Effect 3, but if I'm gonna be working all day, I probably it's so it's such a
7330440	7333160	Like actually it makes me not like night. Hey bitch, I'm hot
7333160	7337060	Like I know like I'm physically hot and sweaty and fucking nasty
7337640	7342680	Well, the thing is that as warm as your outfit is I've got more layers on mine
7342680	7348440	Yeah, yeah, and I was hot in the middle of December at the beginning of December in that thing. So
7349640	7356200	All right. I I am I am really pleased at how the chat room is really engaging in this whole conversation
7356200	7360340	I love our listeners fifth dream in chat says I want a rocky horror picture show game
7360700	7367060	They made two based off the play believe it or not. There was one in on like the Apple to eat all those years ago
7367300	7373420	Yeah, well it had graphics but it was like derpy graphics. Yeah, it was like the original King's Quest type of graph. Yeah
7374780	7381260	And then they made one for the revival on CD-ROM in like the late 90s
7381260	7387220	But it was what you would expect on early CD-ROM games. First double six says drag racing star
7388060	7392340	A drag racing star. That's actually it's called sing star Abba. I don't know if any of you have it
7392340	7397540	I do I own that and sing star Queen. So it's kind of I'm kind of already there. I'm one step ahead of you, buddy
7398540	7402120	Tiger conscious is the drag race game should be Mario Kart style
7402900	7404900	Sold. I
7404900	7406900	Agree, I oh man. I
7407860	7412100	Take a road to a whole new level as I say rainbow road blue shells. Oh
7412740	7415820	Yes, seriously, like when you blue shell somebody it could be bitch
7417940	7418940	a
7418940	7422180	Kuma son says that they wish that they had drag race over there
7423420	7426220	Yeah, there are ways of obtaining that's right
7426220	7432060	You gotta you gotta use especially even when we whitelist the logo site and it still won't let us pass the commercials
7432060	7437360	All right, that was five minutes of drag queen talk here on the show. So there we've met our quota for tonight
7437460	7443700	Let's go around the gaming industry and do some rapid-fire gaming news help coming late to it. It's fine. It's fine
7443700	7446780	I'm fashionably late to nobody's perfect. Except me. I understand
7447220	7449220	All right
7449260	7451820	Let's do some news real quick very quickly
7451820	7459020	I believe Ubisoft has Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell movies coming out historically video game movies
7459780	7463820	Don't do as well because they're generally not good
7464540	7470020	a lot of hype is riding on the World of Warcraft movie, but Ubisoft has made it clear that
7470940	7475260	once Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell once they come out if really if there's
7475420	7478700	If it looks like they're gonna make their money back and there's any positive buzz
7478940	7485000	They're just gonna bankroll the sequels almost immediately. Like they're very interested in making both of those franchises or both of those
7486420	7493340	IPs franchises, so there's gonna be an Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell 2 movie unless of course it bombs
7493860	7495860	Spectacularly and maybe they'll probably make them anyway
7496460	7501860	As an aside there have been like three or four hitman movies and I've they've had a different dude play
7502100	7506140	Because I was at Target and I saw the hitman blu-ray and I was like
7506140	7511540	I thought the drug dealer from go or whatever that guy's name is was the hitman but it's like no they've they made another one
7511540	7513540	With a different dude in it. Yeah, that's very true. Yep
7515580	7521240	Again quickly the founder and creator of the oculus rift Palmer lucky
7522260	7528460	Has worked, you know blood sweat and tears and getting this thing developed and working and to make it a viable
7529220	7535660	Consumer product that it was just available via retail and wasn't some weird exclusive dev kit and he said damn it
7535660	7537660	This has been you know, my life's work
7537860	7540420	I'm not gonna let some scrub at UPS
7541060	7543160	delivery guy give the first customer
7543780	7550940	This this baby of mine, so he flew to Alaska to give a pre-order to a dude like two days before everyone else
7552400	7557220	Making great use of Facebook's billions. Just no I it's cool. I think that's cool
7557260	7560500	So yeah, everyone else I guess gets theirs tomorrow, but he made a point to fly out
7561340	7563340	To give this random
7563340	7565340	Alaska dude his rift
7565900	7568820	Rock band for say I didn't even know about this rock band for
7569520	7573700	PC which I believe it's not a Kickstarter. It's a fig. I think it said
7574580	7581020	Crowd crowdfunding thing harmonics is trying to get a rock band for released unlike previous
7581660	7583660	licenses on let's say the
7584460	7586460	PlayStation or Xbox
7586580	7588580	none of the DLC or
7589420	7594280	a la carte songs that you would buy for it would carry over even if you own one of those previous licenses because all the
7594340	7596060	PC is a different
7596060	7597380	method of
7597380	7601780	Delivery every iteration of how you could play a piece of IP has to be licensed
7601940	7605740	Well, if you are willing to give twenty five hundred dollars
7606340	7614260	To this fig campaign for rock band for to come out on PC. You will get every single a la carte song
7614980	7617620	That has been that is available on the rock band store
7618340	7620940	every single song and I imagine that's possible because
7621620	7624500	What medium or what platform is?
7625740	7630300	Dot saw song on dogs songs digitally licensed for first
7631860	7635660	iTunes Amazon Google which are all PC
7637300	7638460	Methods of
7638500	7640420	Purchase or Mac or whatever
7640420	7644660	So I imagine that's how they're able to do that so you can scroll through the entire list and go
7644660	7646020	I don't know what I want to play
7646020	7651860	Yes, so for if you have $2,500 you and this game is made as a super hella donor
7651860	7657660	Whatever you will get every single DLC a la carte song for rock band. All right, I'll get right on that
7657660	7664620	How's that sound take some of our savings and buy every DLC song ever. Is that sound good? Yes. Yay. I don't need a car. I
7664620	7666300	I
7666300	7668300	Need a rock band. I don't need a car
7668620	7675100	Let's talk about game trailers. I remember it was about a month or two ago game trailers kind of shut their doors suddenly
7675100	7680040	Well, guess what happened? Some of the team has actually reassembled and now they are called easy allies
7680580	7682460	You can find that on you know
7682460	7685340	Twitch and Twitter and all that good stuff and of course
7685340	7689900	They're on patreon because that's the way a lot of these companies are doing business these days
7690420	7695300	So, there you go, if you want to check out the personalities from game trailers, they're probably over easy allies now
7695300	7702720	So check that out killer instinct season 3 is on the way and season 3 can be purchased either through a combo breaker
7703100	7705100	ultra-edition and supreme edition
7705940	7710860	Apparently the windows 10 players are gonna get the supreme edition for $10 less than the Xbox one
7710940	7717500	This is because there is no killer instinct classic or killer instinct 2 classic in the PC version of the bundle
7717900	7722380	So anyhow, the combo breaker will have eight new fighters including rash arbiter
7722380	7729340	Kim Wu and tusk that will be available on Xbox one for $20 and then the ultra edition has a VIP
7729860	7732680	double XP booster retro costumes accessory sets
7733140	7740160	And a bunch of other crap for 40 bucks and then the supreme edition is crap upon crap in the game for $60 for a lot
7740160	7741380	of crap
7741380	7743620	Anyhow, you might be interested
7743620	7749500	We've talked a lot about Castlevania tonight. And if you are a fan of old-school Castlevania, I'm talking to 8-bit Castlevania
7749500	7751660	You might want to check out brave earth
7752220	7756700	prologue brave earth prologue was first announced in 2011 and
7757220	7760720	This is from the same developer as I want to be the guy
7761500	7767740	And he's actually went over to steam greenlight to kind of pitch this game and get the game greenlit
7768140	7770840	So you can check that out over on steam greenlight
7771440	7777760	Inspired by Castlevania Ninja Gaiden these old games a 2016 release is almost assured
7778400	7783840	For difficulty settings in the game from I'm assuming easy to dear God make it stop
7785080	7787080	Let's move on dark soccer
7787080	7790440	Well, there is gonna be a new gaming show in the UK
7791120	7798180	Well, it will be on UK TV later this year called Dara O'Brien's go 8-bit and it could suck
7798180	7804700	It could be good. But basically it's combining retro gaming with the latest technology and
7805300	7810300	Viewers of all ages so should come out autumn 2016. So
7811520	7813520	okay, and then
7815860	7819500	David hater has words to say about Kojima
7822660	7824660	Basically
7824780	7830360	He was asked if he was going to play the phantom pain his response was yeah
7830360	7836700	That'll be 60 hours of humiliation that I can't get to I haven't played the latest two iterations because it's just too painful
7837220	7843440	And he asked if you would work with Kojima again, and he says I've got no particular love for Kojima
7843440	7845440	I don't feel any need to go back and work with him again
7846180	7847220	and
7847220	7849220	Then last but not least
7849340	7851620	There we were really quick on the Kojima thing
7851620	7855980	I think especially because now you actually know the backstory behind this dark Sakura
7855980	7861700	I think after you talk about like what David hater said about Hideo Kojima you need this
7867260	7872020	It's the shade button people it's the shade button when you throw when you throw shade, you know
7872120	7876220	You got to use the little button there. So if I you know say a little zinger like, you know
7876900	7878820	well, you know we we
7879060	7881060	Breakups are very hard to get over anyway
7881900	7883900	so
7884020	7888780	Also, it could be possible that we may have Tekken 7 on
7891140	7893140	Home computers on PC
7894100	7896900	So there were there was a poll out
7898140	7902200	This one was a very extensive poll asking for impressions of fighters
7902380	7906500	but also there was a mention about seeing if
7907020	7912740	There would be any interest in having it on PC, I think this was
7915220	7917220	Japan only so far
7918420	7919540	but
7919540	7923640	Who knows I wouldn't mind it and then we'd all get to mod it and I could have you know
7924340	7927900	All kinds of pretty things happen on the screen then
7930220	7933420	All right, we're gonna get to our frugal question of the week
7933460	7939860	But first I want to point out a kaijuto and chat talking about the shade button says if you have to explain the sound effect
7939860	7941860	It's not a good sound effect
7944160	7948180	Thank you for that kaijuto appreciate that you're just feeling left out by the way
7948180	7950660	I want to apologize some folks in the chat room are complaining
7950660	7955300	I guess some mic is making some weird noises and unfortunately, one of the things about live radio is that
7956340	7958740	No, I think it might it's either mine or it's Alan's
7958740	7961200	I don't know because I know Alan's mic has been having some issues. But anyway
7961840	7962600	Sorry about that
7962600	7964520	If you are hearing like crackling or something
7964520	7970680	It sounds like one of these wires might be dying and to be fair these mics which were graciously donated by our buddy Brad from
7970680	7972680	Podculture they are reaching
7973480	7976160	Several years old at this point. I mean they were in the last studio
7976720	7978720	Yeah, it might be time for a shopping spree
7979200	7981400	Time to buy ourselves something fancy
7981840	7986920	Can't wait. So sorry for sorry that you guys are putting up with that. So we'll we'll work on that
7987400	7991720	Meanwhile, let's get to the frugal question of the week every week
7991720	7997520	You guys go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and google.com
7997920	8001280	Slash plus orange lounge radio and we ask a question and you answer it
8001280	8019920	Over on Facebook and Google Plus we asked we have our special guests tonight from the Sacramento IGDA to talk to us about the indie arcade gaming expo
8019920	8021920	So we thought we'd ask about indie games
8021960	8027220	What is your favorite indie or underground game that you've played that you don't think many people have heard about?
8027560	8030800	So we did a little thing for indie games. So, let's see
8031320	8036640	Andy are actually replied over on Facebook and said I think a lot of people have heard about it
8036640	8041760	But guacamelee is probably one of my favorite indie games hand of fate might be a little more obscure
8041760	8044520	It is one I'd recommend to anyone who is intrigued by a roguelike
8044900	8049400	where you build a deck of cards that determines the pieces that the roguelike builds on as
8049720	8053080	G100 Matt says for a long time. I was playing the forest on Steam
8053080	8056920	The game is a survival horror game with plenty of crafting and jump scares
8056920	8059400	The game has been in early access for the past 20 months
8059400	8064720	But excuse me, the creators and dev team updated at least one to two times a month and chat with fans frequently
8064800	8067880	The game has gone through a lot of changes, but it's a lot of fun
8067880	8073360	Even though there's no real ending to it yet. I would definitely recommend it to people but keep in mind that it's still in early access
8074960	8082240	Retertainment says I just got into her story on iOS her stories narrative and presentation hooked me in a way that no other iOS game
8082240	8086640	Has I don't know how well-known her story is considering the awards at one last year
8086640	8089520	But her story is a game that should be more well-known than it is
8090360	8095880	Ragenator says the closest thing that fits the bill for me would be super stardust HD a PSN game on PlayStation 3
8096120	8097580	When I was a console gamer
8097580	8101000	This is an early PSN purchase for me and ended up being one of my favorites
8101080	8106660	Being played regularly up until my system was stolen very addicting. That's a shitty ending though. Sorry to hear about that
8107400	8110620	Degenerate I remember hearing about that when it happened, but it sucks hearing about it now
8111140	8118020	Jenner Johnny says I think everyone shouldn't be surprised with my choice. Although many have heard of its controversies and a successful Kickstarter
8118020	8122900	It's apparent that very few have actually experienced the MMO card game hex shards of fate
8123020	8126700	It's well thought-out RPG elements strategically structured campaign
8126980	8131420	Beautiful artwork on its vast library of cards and it's extremely flexible tournament schedules
8131500	8137780	Hex trading card game has been placed as my favorite indie underground game as well as favorite card game of all time
8138660	8141700	Fifth dream says I love a game called chroma squad
8141700	8147340	It's a strategy RPG that simulates running a TV studio shooting a super sentai series
8147380	8154020	You are the director and customize your team manage their costumes weapons sponsors insurance, even their giant robot
8154020	8155300	You have to keep awesome
8155300	8159040	You have to keep your ratings up and fulfill fan requests during TV episodes
8159140	8164980	One of the fans in the game is me since I pledged to a kickstarter way back when it's a really funny and fun game
8165020	8169580	And dar Tetsuya on Facebook says I actually completed labulana on Steam a few weeks ago
8169580	8173940	I can't recommend it enough though. You may want to walk through or some guide to help you if you get stuck
8173940	8179460	It's very much like Simon's quest as far as hints go my last completion clocked in at 60 hours
8179460	8186620	So you'll be getting a lot of playtime for the asking price and lastly over on Google+. Josh why said our lux
8187340	8192300	This is the very essence of an RTS and I think it's the AI that makes it
8192300	8196460	It doesn't give any quarter and it's always in the balance if you can make it through
8197300	8204300	So it's available there on Windows and Android and iOS. So you left some little links there over on our Google+. page
8204540	8210440	So there it is our frugal question of the week any guy anything you guys want to plug here a great indie game
8210440	8212440	You think more people need to know about?
8213380	8220660	Without your own game. Sorry Gabe. Yeah, you have to plug that Alan anything that I can think of like for example hotline
8220660	8223020	Miami incredible soundtrack very violent
8223700	8227460	There's tons of hype for that game. So everything indie that I can think of
8228620	8230420	Already has you know?
8230420	8234540	Momenta behind it like there are no real sleeper hits that no one knows about that. I've played
8236820	8238820	Hot duffel boyfriend
8240340	8243040	Because it's great and pigeons
8243700	8248740	And I know this one is is huge and it's gaining a lot of steam lately
8248740	8254780	But I still think there are some people maybe in this room dark soccer that very badly need to play stardew Valley
8255060	8258820	So I'm just saying well and don't forget though about off
8259460	8261460	mm-hmm and
8262660	8267580	Great now, I just forgot the name of it and I know the game and I gave it to you Undertale Undertale. Yes
8267580	8269580	Oh, yeah Undertale
8269900	8275140	Yeah, everybody knows Undertale. Yeah, but off was really good. It was kind of big on tumblr for a while
8275140	8279060	Yeah, but I still like my bird dating game. Mm-hmm
8281100	8284260	Jamie mentioned how to full boyfriend there is a game
8285580	8287580	that
8287700	8290740	I'm kind of hesitant to recommend because it is
8292420	8296300	It's an adult game and the fact that it has sexual elements and it really does hurt
8296620	8301020	What the game otherwise would be it's called Super Health Club. You've seen me play this game Rob
8301220	8306980	It's a gay visual novel slash romance simulator where you're at a gym and there are four different guys at the gym
8307980	8309980	and there is
8311300	8313300	Explicit there are porny moments. Yes
8313860	8318300	And it's like if there was a game like that when I was 15
8318780	8324260	Minus the porn it would have been incredibly important to me to play a game where I could like be a boy flirting with other
8324260	8326260	boys
8326660	8329180	Yeah, that's Philip that's the guy who I romance first
8330100	8332980	So that I think is definitely a game
8333580	8336140	An indie game that doesn't have really a lot of hype to it
8336140	8340340	But it would help to be gay and it would be it would help to be okay with that type of content
8340340	8342540	What was that a Super Health Club Super Health Club? Okay
8344060	8346820	Indie game Gabe, I mean you've obviously played a lot of them
8348780	8350780	Yeah, there's so many
8350820	8355180	I'm gonna I'm gonna totally name something like not recent at all
8355180	8360260	It's it's actual physical this game on the 360. It's called the El Shaddai
8361820	8363540	Yeah
8363540	8365340	Awesome. Yeah
8365340	8367340	Yeah, that that is um
8367780	8370140	That was a game. I did not expect whatsoever
8370740	8378220	Wow, what a game what a game it touches upon a lot of historical religious references, which is something I'd you know, it's
8378780	8384700	Never it where it's rarely ever executed really well, but El Shaddai on the 360. Oh my goodness
8384740	8386180	I think it may be on the ps3 also
8386180	8391660	but but yeah, that was I think it was sort of a sleeper hit because it plays just like
8393620	8395620	Devil may cry with like the gameplay
8395700	8402520	But it's a whole different whole different other ball of wax of what's involved and stuff. Nice. Yeah
8402520	8404520	All right. Yeah, cool. All right
8404700	8406140	Well, let's move on
8406140	8411320	We're gonna get back into some other news and then we're gonna open up the skype line here before too long over at
8411960	8419000	1877 game olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio, but first Alan with another news story. I
8420960	8422960	Was talking in chat and I got distracted
8425180	8427840	How about now you good yes, I'm good now, right
8429480	8432480	Nintendo has applied for a trademark on
8433240	8436240	Actually, Rob, you may be able to help me with this story and pull it up on YouTube
8436240	8439560	I'm not putting you on the spot Nintendo apply totally are
8440280	8443480	Nintendo applies for trademark on the iconic
8444160	8447560	Mario coin sound which has been a
8448600	8455200	Notification on people's cell phones for when they get an email. It's a very very easily easily found on the internet
8455200	8457200	Just a little wave clip of that
8457280	8463100	Ding or I can't even which actually there isn't one on this story, but everybody knows the Nintendo coin noise. Everybody knows it
8463100	8468000	I love though that it's actually they have the musical notes written here. Yes, that's
8468720	8471280	Fantastic, so they're trying to get that trademark
8471280	8475680	They registered it in Japan first obviously on the J
8475680	8482720	Platt Pat website and the part of the trademark like you just said is the sheet music of the tone
8482840	8487460	It's because a lot of ROM hacks or like super super indie
8487920	8491720	Bike will use that sound effect because it's so recognizable and they kind of want to put
8492600	8497200	A pin in that and make it to where they can't just be used willy-nilly
8497280	8500120	Well, obviously the Mario coin sound is iconic
8500120	8505360	But you know what else to me is iconic is the sound that you get when you get a ring in Sonic the Hedgehog
8505360	8511600	Yeah, and if you go to a gas station, I swear to God the cast registers some gas station with the same damn noise
8511600	8515440	I throws me every time I'm like, no no, I'm giving you money
8516600	8520840	Yeah, it's their UPC scanner. So when they are doing your vitamin water and pack of gum
8520880	8522440	It's like the sonic ring noise
8522440	8527600	Yes me out now always throws me is that around the nation or is that just here that like I think chevron?
8527600	8531600	I feel like has that I don't know but it always throws me
8532720	8537680	Okay, some other folks in chatter like yes. Yes, they do it is around the nation. Thank you. Okay, it's not just here
8538200	8540200	Throws me every time
8540800	8546400	So, there you go, I guess they have to trademark it because the cell phones and people that want that type of stuff so
8546720	8547840	And
8547840	8550560	Probably for knockoff things to like, you know
8550560	8556400	When flappy bird had like pipes that like looked a lot like the pipes and Mario Brothers
8556400	8558060	Yeah, you know that whole type of thing
8558060	8563120	So they probably don't want the sound effects in other games because people may confuse it is
8563360	8570000	A Mario game when it is in fact not well, no Mario games will be available on the Xbox one
8570000	8571680	But if you do have an Xbox one
8571680	8576480	There were a bunch of new updates to the firmware that were released this past week
8577120	8583280	The Xbox a new firmware update went out and it improved Xbox elite wireless controller thumbstick precision
8583280	8585280	It launched the new Xbox
8585360	8592200	Accessories app where there's now a page that will show you the firmware version as well as battery status and other details about the controller
8592200	8597000	And now party chat can be included in twitch broadcasts
8597000	8598800	So if you're gonna broadcast your game on twitch
8598800	8604280	You want other people to be able to comment along with that you can now do that through the party chat on twitch
8604280	8610360	So that's pretty cool. If you're playing like a group game so you can all swear at each other across the entirety of the internet
8610360	8613880	You know what? I still miss the Netflix party chat
8613880	8619760	That was all that was probably next to that between that and one versus 100 on the Xbox 360
8619760	8625440	Don't get me started gay. Forget it. Forget it. Those are my two favorite things. I miss that
8625520	8626700	You had it yeah
8626700	8630200	couldn't for those who don't have no idea what I'm talking about Netflix had a
8630480	8636440	Had a feature where you and like what was it eight people up to eight people up to eight people can all sit in this
8636440	8640760	Little makeshift theater that Netflix created and you can all watch this movie together
8640760	8644680	Do you know how bad I know that for watching Pee Wee's big holiday?
8645200	8647080	Do you know how bad I needed something like that?
8647080	8650580	Cuz like I needed to be able to talk with Shane or something during that movie
8650580	8654560	Which by the way, I did watch a couple days. Did you finish it? Oh, yeah
8654640	8660560	It was it was corny but like there were parts where I like laughed till I cried like it was like really like it's like
8660560	8665920	Stupid funny. My only issue with it is that it's like pretty much the exact same formula as the first movie
8668560	8672080	Yeah, no, it's it's it's better than big top Pee Wee that's for sure
8672080	8678560	But it's probably not as good as Pee Wee's big adventure, but will anything ever be I forgot that the Italian lady in that one
8678600	8680600	Mm-hmm was also in
8681160	8682760	Escape from LA
8682760	8686240	Really no kidding. Yeah. Yeah, she got killed really quick
8686760	8693580	Well, and what's great is that the you know the waitress that Pee Wee falls in love with and goes to the big dinosaur
8693580	8696680	And Pee Wee's big adventure. Yeah, she's in this new one. Oh cool
8696680	8700120	Yeah, so it was really cool to like see but in a different role, obviously
8700120	8703880	So it was just really cool to see that but the part that killed me
8704520	8706440	Absolutely killed me for those that have seen the movie
8706440	8711360	I'm not gonna totally ruin it but it's the part where he goes to the Snake Ranch and they put him in the room and
8711600	8716920	With the with the the scary snake and that's all I'm gonna say is his reaction to the scary snake
8716920	8722640	I just I wasn't expecting that so I just cried like I was laughing so hard it was and it's so stupid
8723320	8728600	Anyway, that's all I'm gonna say those that have seen the movie know what I'm talking about those they haven't will we'll see it soon
8729120	8734640	Alright, uh, anyhow moving on also about hey Xbox one, not just my Netflix device
8735200	8739280	you can also do backwards compatibility, which I've been doing a lot of this past week because
8739520	8744880	Up next on my list after I beat Symphony of the Night is to go back and play Alan Wake before Quantum Break comes out
8745200	8748640	So anyhow, but other games you can check out right now, you know
8748640	8750740	Some folks want to go back and play Dark Souls
8751200	8756200	Before Dark Souls 3 comes out and you can do that now Dark Souls now on backwards compatibility
8756200	8762200	Yeah, that's good. Also released this past week Tekken tag tournament 2 was a part of the backwards compatibility update
8762200	8767280	So I got I gotta say a Microsoft's been doing a great job kind of doing the slow trickle on
8767400	8774640	It's almost like virtual console releases that I don't have to repay for I love it. Thank you Microsoft. Good guy Microsoft
8775160	8779840	All right. Let's move on Dark Soccer. I think you have another story for us. I
8781000	8783000	Do indeed?
8783200	8786560	So there is a study that went out from Ohio State University
8787600	8789100	basically
8789100	8791400	293 female gamers who play online games
8792320	8800040	Were surveyed on this and they were asked if they received abuse in online games and what they and if they thought about it
8800040	8802040	Or how much they thought about it offline?
8803000	8809840	And how the companies that produce these games are dealing with the harassment and then their own coping mechanisms
8809920	8816260	So as it turned out that basically they didn't like, you know, swearing and name-calling or skill based insults
8816260	8820600	But they they dealt with it. They put it aside. It wasn't a big deal
8821600	8823600	Sexual harassment on the other hand
8824200	8827180	Definitely sexist comments rape jokes rape threats
8828120	8830640	did cause a lot of trauma and
8831480	8836480	Almost made sure that they didn't want to go back and play the game again. It ruined the experience
8838520	8844000	You know and it was that they they get trash talking for what it is, but when you make it personal
8845000	8851460	That it lingers it makes you really uncomfortable and then it becomes associated with the game
8851460	8853620	Not with the people playing it. So
8856200	8858200	Hopefully
8858580	8862960	You know, it's something that the game companies will take into account or try to help with a filter
8863040	8868340	But they also said that they didn't blame the they didn't hold the companies accountable for it
8869520	8872760	But they did blame them for not doing more to curtail it. So
8873360	8874760	yeah, and I
8874760	8880200	Imagine it's got to be tough to when you're the game developer and there's this open environment like Xbox Live and yeah
8880200	8885240	I can totally see where if I'm playing a game online and the community is just really awful to me
8885240	8890180	like I'm gonna blame the game and I'm not I'm probably not gonna go back because I don't want to see those people and
8890520	8895040	It might kind of suck for the developer who quote-unquote may not have control over it
8895040	8899280	Although granted you got a police your environment a little bit make sure it's not happening
8899320	8902840	But I mean Xbox Live voice chat can be a very very difficult thing to
8903560	8909320	Police, I think people just need to like fucking act mature a little bit mature on these games
8909820	8912840	It's like Kai judo says in our chat room over at live.vog network.com
8912880	8916800	Some guys go full-on dumbass when a girl gets on a game. It's so weird
8916800	8919440	I was hanging out with a dude online for like two weeks
8919440	8923560	The guy was cool. Then one day a girl beat him in Halo 2 and he went batshit. I was shocked
8923560	8927740	It was the same guy like that's the problem dude needs to fucking
8928380	8935020	Learn to be a human being well, I've had you know, things like that happen with me just a few times
8935020	8936540	I've played online games
8936540	8940420	I got one guy to shut up by telling him at stick a centipede in his dick hole
8941700	8943700	Wow
8945380	8948100	Yum Brianna's applauding over here. I
8949900	8955060	Mean, you know I can give back cuz I'm not really gonna do it and he's probably you know
8955380	8959100	Wouldn't and the other one I was like, so this is your username
8959100	8961440	I bet I can find you on the database and tell your mother
8964700	8968060	Taking a hint from the girl who did do that when she was harassed online
8968300	8973380	She found every single one of those guys copied and pasted the conversation with their parents
8973980	8974940	It's awesome
8974940	8980660	a lot of times these guys's emails will be like first initial dot last name at the place where they work and it's like I
8980660	8985260	Can find you so easily and you're saying the most nasty shit on the internet
8985860	8990860	Or or you know when I will remember when that happened even in a forum
8991660	8995020	It was a certain somebody we used to play DDR with his friend
8995540	9002300	Mmm, and so I tracked down, you know, I basically looked up their IP found out where they lived and said so you live here. Oh
9003020	9005020	I'm sorry. This will never happen again
9005020	9007020	It's
9007140	9011380	The internet we can find everything we need to yeah people just need to
9012020	9015980	Just need to be a little a little bit mature is a little maturity too much to ask online
9016460	9021460	Apparently, well, this is why I rarely play with strangers if I play with strangers. I don't have voice chat on here
9021460	9025820	Yeah, I hardly do it anymore either. I think I'm trying to remember what game it was
9025820	9029780	I think the centipede when I remember what that was that was fantasy star online
9035100	9037100	That explains
9037300	9042140	It was just random group. I was running through rooms with mm-hmm
9042140	9047980	And I don't even remember the situation, but he said just the most vile thing
9047980	9053580	So and that was the first vile comeback I could come up with it's pretty good. Well, thank you. I'm pleased with that one
9053580	9056940	I've been keeping it in my arsenal in case I ever needed the Rolodex of hate
9059300	9064120	No, no, no, no, I can't I can't steal that from the fabulous Bianca del Rio, however
9065020	9068920	I would probably have like the speed dial of pissiness
9069740	9071340	about that
9071340	9073180	All right
9073180	9077220	Let's move on. We got some more news. We want to cover before we open up the skype line. So Allen
9078820	9080820	Footage of
9080820	9083560	Pokemon go the smartphone game was
9084300	9087180	Leaked from South by Southwest that just happened. It's
9087700	9094500	Niantic, which is an offshoot of Google which is made of the game ingress, which I know if Matt was here Loki Robin
9095240	9100380	Him would go on and Jamie we play to um, don't act innocent. Yeah, I know we just had to do a lot
9100380	9105380	Ton of farm level 10. Why are we going? Why are we going to Tucson? Can we not? Okay, that was that
9105380	9107380	Has that been revealed? Oh
9110540	9115340	There may or may not be a very big ingress event happening in Tucson that I may also
9115740	9122500	We're only real reason to go to Arizona for anything and hold up hold up hold up and some really good
9122540	9128420	We are meetings of my internet friends that you've already met. Yeah, I met a play ingress. No, they don't play
9128420	9131980	Okay, so we had to get them hooked on ingress. Well if they're willing
9132420	9137700	But so like Friday is friend day Saturday is nerd day. So, you know what?
9138220	9139380	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right
9139380	9145620	Anyway, so the Pokemon go the way it's gonna work is if you have the notifications turned on your phone will buzz or beep when?
9145620	9149900	There's a Pokemon near you you load up the game if you have any pokeballs and you decide you want this
9150180	9153740	Pokemon you could tap the screen and throw the ball at it. Yeah, you have another Pokemon
9154340	9158420	You get your gear. I believe this is with the in-game currency
9158940	9161320	It says that the stores are gonna be at museums
9162260	9168660	Monuments so in order to buy stuff in game you can't it's not just like you go to an NPC
9168900	9172980	From the comfort of your living room. It sounds like you have to actually go out to get your Pokemon gear
9173940	9178700	Also types of Pokemon will be specific to the environment that you go to
9178700	9180700	So if you want a water or ocean
9180980	9186820	Pokemon if there's a park that you go to that has a lake go there if you live on if you're lucky enough to live
9186820	9188820	Coastside go to the beach. I
9189180	9191380	imagined for landlocked areas a
9191940	9197740	Public pool anything of like a fountain at a bank, you know, if you want to squirtle that's where he'd be. So
9198540	9200540	Really excited for this
9202820	9204420	There's a video of it
9204420	9210060	You can actually I think you go on Engadget and see their embed of the footage that was leaked from South by Southwest
9210540	9213980	But yeah, if you want to stock up on stuff you need to go
9214540	9219800	To a place of significance and also just go out and if you want a certain type of Pokemon
9219800	9221800	It's it's all based on your geography
9222380	9227880	I'm still curious and a lot of people on the the various forums that are out there are like so what about the battles?
9227880	9232580	What about the battle because they haven't really said a lot about that yet. Yeah the PvP, but I'm I'm curious enough
9232620	9234420	I mean, I'm definitely gonna check out Pokemon go
9234420	9237180	I don't know if it's gonna be make be enough to make me quit ingress
9237180	9243860	But I mean if they are have a decent battle system in it, I I may not be playing ingress as much
9243860	9244060	Yeah
9244060	9249820	I just want to know like the people over there what their timeline is for the monetization because they haven't really revealed
9249940	9254420	Mm-hmm what the cash shop is gonna feature. I mean, there's that little wrist
9255140	9257140	doodad thing that you get
9257420	9259140	That I imagine you buy separately
9259140	9263260	But that's I really want to see because ingress their cash shop
9263260	9267300	Which I think the game was out for nearly three years before they even put a monetization
9267420	9272580	Well, they were a part of Google in the beginning. So Google was just you know, it was an experiment
9272580	9278660	Yeah, but then after the separation when Google split into alphabet that Niantic is no longer a Google company
9278660	9281060	They are now financed by Nintendo
9281060	9284580	I think Google is also still a financier but Niantic had to come up with new ways to make money
9284580	9286660	So gotcha enter cash shop
9287180	9293020	Which has done very well and hell we paid what 45 bucks for super VIP tickets to this thing
9293020	9298260	We're going to and in Tucson, but worth every penny. I don't want to hear it. Well, it comes with souvenirs and eat stuff
9298260	9301380	That's right. You all spend money on dumb shit, too. So, you know what? I don't want to hear it
9303180	9305220	Right, that's all. All right, awesome
9306260	9314120	Okay, less awesome though is the news that a studio is closing and Sony did confirm this week that evolution studios
9314620	9318460	was shut down and evolution studios latest game was drive club which
9318900	9322660	You know not gonna lie drive club kind of had a rough, you know
9322660	9329820	It was big expectations for it and then it came out late and then the online was kind of a fucking mess
9329820	9331820	Like there's no nice way to say it
9331860	9335860	So unfortunately, I think because the game ended up being a comedy of errors
9336740	9341320	Unfortunately, people are now out of a job because of it. I see you sighing over there Gabe
9342180	9344180	Yeah
9344540	9346540	Yeah
9346740	9351580	Yeah, I felt this same way about drive club although graphically speaking
9351580	9355060	I thought I thought it was a beautiful game, but there was
9355740	9361720	I fell in love, you know racing games are racing driving games are like my favorite of all time
9361740	9367960	Like outrun on the Sega arcade was the game that wanted that got me to want to make games in the first place
9368700	9370700	yeah, and
9370740	9373660	But you know fell in love a Gran Turismo need for speed games
9373660	9379900	but then I played Forza and then force a horizon and I never looked back and I when I play drive colors say it is
9379900	9385620	trying too hard and that's not good because they have a so much potential but
9385860	9388860	It's in four. It's really really unfortunate. So yeah, that's why I kind of
9390780	9392780	Well some other stuff that
9393220	9398420	Evolution had done they were also responsible for World Rally Championship on the PlayStation 2 is them
9398420	9402020	But I think the game that you know, a lot of people were like, oh, yeah
9402020	9406180	This was a great game was Motorstorm on PlayStation 3. That was that was a release
9406180	9409940	That was a release team. I think with with the system system release. Yeah
9410940	9414520	Yeah, it's a bummer. But unfortunately some of those things where you go
9414520	9417340	Well, you know and it's it's so shocking like one
9418100	9419260	I mean and again
9419260	9424940	this doesn't happen in the movie industry one dud doesn't kill a studio in the movie industry or we would have never had Batman as
9424940	9426940	Superman in the first place even though it's making buku bucks
9426940	9429820	Yeah, but then though I hear it's a festering pilot crowd
9429820	9434660	But that studio did also what the Jupiter ascending which didn't make any money back
9434660	9438680	I wanted to see there was something else that they had done to that
9439420	9441120	so
9441120	9444740	Everyone I know on Facebook that has seen Batman vs. Superman has said
9446620	9450900	It's not great but it was entertaining
9452180	9454180	Like it was fine
9454420	9457460	Honestly, I want to see it well, I love Batman so I'll see anything about it
9457460	9461540	I want to see it just for Wonder Woman to be honest. I want to see everyone
9461540	9467380	Yeah, the critics are like it's the worst thing. It's like showgirls but superhero movies and most people are like no, it's
9469380	9473660	Is going through a case of oh us to us to we'll have gritty characters everyone likes Batman
9473660	9475660	We'll make all of our characters Batman
9476140	9481860	Including like normal, you know, oh, I'm a hero and classic hero. No, I'm gonna be Batman. Mm-hmm
9484540	9486420	Let's get to the mailbag

9529900	9533740	Had shown up in a store. I would've been like, yes, they have all the crazy flavors now like Oreos
9533900	9536260	Yeah, you know what? I still want to find you a peep plushie
9537260	9540900	I've seen them. I mean there were two of them at Hannah's house today
9540900	9545580	There was an official peep store like two blocks from magfest. You better believe I went there
9546060	9550140	Hi, there's a picture of me somewhere in front of the peeps car. So anyway
9550580	9551380	All right
9551380	9556980	Well, no emails but maybe next time participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to participate with our show
9556980	9560380	Well now we definitely have a reason to get angsty here on orange lounge radio. So
9561220	9564120	Hold my earrings. Here comes the F use of the week
9567260	9569260	I
9582300	9586620	Really don't I guess I really don't have a major as you other than
9588380	9590380	Holiday related for medical
9591300	9592940	issues as
9592940	9599260	People on my facebook have probably read by now, which I don't mean it to have a problem with people's religious preference
9599260	9601260	I just don't get the grammar
9601780	9605100	Don't get it. I hate misuse of any word and
9605740	9612420	This use of tense and it's really getting on my nerves because I've started writing again you believe in the one true grammar God. I
9613540	9617580	Believe I am a follower of sir Oxford of comma
9617580	9619580	Because
9620300	9622260	It's the difference between
9622260	9628340	The hookers JFK and Stalin and the hookers comma JFK comma and Stalin
9628820	9633160	Instead of JFK and Stalin wearing pasties of my favorite is actually
9634060	9636860	Let's eat grandma and let's see grandma
9638900	9640900	And when you're talking about
9640900	9642580	Your
9642580	9647660	Pet you don't say you are pet you say your pet
9648820	9650820	when you're saying and
9651620	9656100	Rob I love you to death, but you do this and it gets on my nerves a lot
9657640	9659380	When you use
9659380	9661380	so and such and eyes
9661700	9665540	That's grammatically incorrect. The tea is hot. The tea is scalding
9665540	9669380	I think he means like eyeballs it should be so and so and mine
9670060	9672060	well
9672100	9677260	You're not the only person I know that doesn't all those mistaken people and I don't give a fuck
9679800	9681800	That was grammatically correct
9682940	9686500	The most grammatically correct insult to the most smartest
9688020	9690020	Smart asses
9690260	9695680	Alan do you have better to be a smartest than a dumbass Alan you have any of use of the week that do not pick on me
9695680	9697120	I
9697120	9700160	Not not anymore because of that last caveat. No
9700680	9704640	I guess it's a little gross, but I'm getting like a blister on my foot
9705160	9708480	And I'm like, why am I even getting this blister?
9708480	9712200	And I just need to figure out what I need to do about it before it gets gross
9713160	9715320	Self-diagnosed on WebMD. That's everybody else does
9716080	9718080	It's cancer. No
9718080	9721080	Yeah foot foot blisters gross you why?
9721080	9723080	Is it your shoes may be lying out?
9723760	9727280	That's the thing. My shoes are fine. And it's in a weird really weird spot
9730880	9732880	That's what I'm thinking
9736040	9739840	All right, I broke his toe by the way speaking of medical conditions
9739840	9746340	Sorry to hear that see you medical conditions a few of the week goes to my sunburn. I got a sunburn yesterday
9746340	9748860	You're a real ed actual redneck. Yes
9749700	9751140	Okay
9751140	9753140	fuck that but
9753300	9759540	Just also the fact that you know, I am usually like, you know, if it's if it's like, you know the summertime
9759540	9764300	I think oh, I gotta put some walk off work outside today. It's fucking March. It is fucking March
9765300	9770460	This is like the time. I got sunburned in Canada. It's fucking March and it's 80 degrees during the day
9771220	9775620	Only in Northern California when it'll it'll hit like 99 or 100 degrees in April
9775660	9782700	Like oh the summer's here early and I'm like, I'm scared because I'm thinking about July and August if it's 99 degrees in April
9782860	9784860	I'm not about that 108 degree life
9786360	9790380	No, but just at some point there's gonna be a wave and then everyone's gonna joke about it
9790380	9792260	And I'm like and then like I don't want to die
9792260	9798100	The air conditioner wasn't like working in my car yesterday and I was like son of a motherfucker. It was fine
9798860	9803220	But I wanted to take everybody who was complaining about the rain and kick them in the nose
9804060	9807220	Because it's not hard enough to maim them and you can fix a broken nose
9807940	9813260	And tell them we have a drought and on top of that
9814940	9816900	Important I
9816900	9823820	Want to tell whoever created that law that says that when Folsom Dam it reaches higher than earth when Folsom Lake
9823820	9829740	We just higher than 60% that they have to drain it. We're in a fucking drought. We need it. Okay
9830060	9833140	No, obviously now I interrupted you I was gonna say we were just it
9833180	9840280	Mathur Lake Park Rob and I earlier for angry stuff Lake was full beautiful green everywhere grass is growing. All the rain is great
9840820	9842820	It's very pretty right now in California
9843620	9848220	Do our guests have any F use they'd like to get out of their system game. What are the rules with the F use?
9848220	9850220	Is it just anything at all?
9851820	9856760	Okay, well keep it like nothing that you want we're already go back to your co-workers
9856760	9862540	Oh, yeah, we're already five minutes into this segment. So, you know, I'll be Jonas
9862580	9864660	I know you don't understand what that rule means, but don't be Jonas
9866140	9869060	I'll have I'll just say one wouldn't one quick thing then
9870700	9877460	Drivers in the left lane going 55 miles an hour get out of there get the hell out of there. That's enough
9877580	9882060	That is enough. And I said the price I joke with Brianna one day I said I said recently
9882820	9885920	Being from New Jersey. I want to build a massive
9886640	9892640	Racing rate racetrack and I want to place all the drivers all the bad drivers in Northern Southern, California
9893400	9900800	versus New York, New Jersey and Connecticut drivers and just go to war in this big thing in the middle of Kansas and in the
9900800	9902080	middle of nowhere and
9902080	9907120	Yeah, because God helped me. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They don't know what the hell they're doing
9907120	9913240	Okay, it cracks me and even work even better when it they're normally going slow because they're using their phone
9913240	9916360	So once they put their phone down because someone blared the horn in them
9916360	9921480	They have the nerve to give the finger to that person to blue that who blared the horn and they haul ass doing 90
9921960	9928040	Crossing three lanes of traffic without signaling. So telling you I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do a twisted metal thing one day
9932880	9934880	Bri any F use from you
9935840	9937840	She's saying no you love everything
9938720	9940720	No comment
9941880	9947720	I'm learning to drive right now and I'm gonna get my license hopefully by the end of April and whenever I see someone do a
9947720	9951520	Dickish thing like what you've described I'll turn to Robin be like I'm not getting my license now
9952300	9955620	Because someone just cut across four lanes doing 90 without a blinker
9956320	9958080	It's like you you deal with it
9958080	9958880	I'm fine
9958880	9962120	And I always have to tell Alan like do as I say not as I do
9962640	9967960	When I'm teaching him how to drive like don't fucking do the things I do when driving because they're all illegal
9968360	9973240	Alright, by the way, may I make an announcement now that we've gotten the frustrations out of the way? Absolutely not
9973800	9975800	All right. Go ahead
9977760	9979440	My
9979440	9983760	Middle I would say of the three of us who my mother birthed from her loins
9984280	9989760	My brother Philip the middle child has given finally taking me off the hook
9990280	9998440	By spawning a little version of him who looks like a very small potato person with a 55 year old man comb-over
10002240	10007240	He looks like well Philip when Philip was a baby he also looked like a scrunchie potato with a bad comb-over
10007400	10012520	Actually, he didn't have the bad comb-over. He had the the frizzy spike. Mm-hmm. So anyway, I
10013240	10019200	I have a nephew now his name potato named potato slow Spuddy
10019960	10023920	Actually, it's funny cuz I've been just trying to decide whether that's call him tater tot
10024640	10026640	Because his last name is Tate
10027480	10030200	or if I'm gonna call him Minnie Phil
10031480	10039780	Minnie Phil, so I would like to say congratulations to my my brother Philip and congrats and his fiancee Ashley
10040540	10047420	For bringing Jackson into the world spell J ax so in it's a very millennial name up
10047540	10052460	What that's it's not a braid and jade and Kate and laden. So already they're
10053580	10061220	Having names names after Mortal Kombat character. That's what I was thinking. He's gonna grow up get bionic arms and kick ass
10061980	10068620	One can only hope but still he's a very very pretty little bundle of joy. He's adorable
10068620	10073940	Hey, I swear he looks just like my brother did as a baby. I was nine when my brother was born
10073980	10079740	No, I was a little younger than that. But anyway, and I remember him as a baby and this infant looks like my brother
10080420	10087100	And also several of my female friends who have had children say it's very unfair that she had such a smooth delivery
10088020	10089140	so
10089140	10091820	Much love. I'm so happy that I have a
10092380	10095860	Nephew and I don't have to produce children for my mother
10095860	10101520	Well, congratulations to Jamie's relatives who I know don't listen to this show. This is why I'm saying it. All right
10102940	10104940	Well, let's move on
10105580	10111380	With just a couple more stories and then we're gonna open up the skype line. I want to borrow him gonna unleash the floodgates. I'm
10112540	10116580	Borrow him and turn him into hash browns. No, I'm just gonna borrow him for a little bit go
10116580	10118580	Oh, he threw up here. You can have him back
10119420	10120860	Alright
10120860	10123200	Let's get to those stories Alan
10125100	10127260	Jackbox games has announced they are making
10128340	10134700	Jackbox party pack 3 just a surprise to no one because the first two are bugging incredible and they're tons of fun
10134700	10137500	And you don't even have to be drunk, which I'm sure it helps
10137780	10143620	but they are amazing games and they've already said that a drawful 2 which I think was the sleeper hit or
10143820	10150380	The most popular choice of the last party pack drawful 2 is coming out in spring of tooth of this year
10151540	10157820	which would make me think it'd be out now or very very soon is not going to be a part of the party pack 3
10157900	10162420	Because obviously they don't want you to buy a game twice. They're not sleazy like that
10162940	10164940	so look for
10166500	10171140	The jackbox party pack 3 as sometime during fall of this year
10172860	10178380	Awesome tons of fun. Yay. I'm looking forward to it because you know Jackbox they make some good stuff
10178380	10179980	Of course
10179980	10186860	They're such jokers those guys and here's what their press release says while we toyed with other names for this collection of party games
10187260	10195140	Koala saga happy birthday mom and Tokyo blood to name a few we decided the jackbox party pack 3 works best
10196540	10198540	All right, they're silly
10198820	10203780	Alright, well, let's do one more story here and it was funny because earlier in the show
10203780	10205940	You guys were talking about the Capcom of the old days
10205940	10212360	Well, isn't this interesting because Capcom is actually running a survey right now that asks. Would you like Megaman 11?
10213700	10215700	No shit. Yes, of course
10216060	10217460	but anyway
10217460	10221260	This is after you know, the success of the Megaman legacy collection
10221260	10226420	So Capcom is actually asking do you want to see a Megaman 11 the third set of questions asked?
10226420	10231780	Would you like future collections of Megaman games and what games would you like to see such as the X series zero?
10232300	10238100	Legends battle network ZX star for us. What do you want? By the way the surveys in Japanese? Sorry, you can't take it
10238100	10243140	So they're gonna come I can take it for us. Yes. So Akuma you need to represent all of us. They're
10244700	10249220	Making sure you take the survey. Enjoy. I would like to see Megaman 11. Why not?
10249980	10252260	Even for nothing else. I just want another soundtrack
10253060	10255740	Honestly, I could give or take the game. I just want another soundtrack
10255740	10259460	I'm just getting tired of them asking do you you know do you know should we make a mega?
10259940	10264060	Make the effing game. It's like Legends 3 you fucking fuck
10265860	10267860	That too that too
10268260	10272180	Alright, hey skype lines open one eight seven seven game
10272180	10278300	Oh LR or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word if you want to call in and talk to us or maybe have
10278300	10283100	A question for our guests that we have here in studio tonight. You can give us a call and we will
10283740	10288220	Take them. So guess what the skype line already lighting up. So let's get to it
10289180	10291260	Hello you are on orange lounge radio, who's this
10292820	10295140	Hey, buddy, how's it going Zaku? What's up?
10296700	10303300	Not much. I mean it's been a while like, you know, but well weeks months that last
10304380	10307900	Called in but everything's good. Everything's things solid
10309140	10312180	just try, you know paxies is coming up and
10313060	10320020	You know, even though you know trying to find rooming was in a it wasn't turned out as I expected
10320020	10322020	I did plan for the worse
10322140	10325580	Although it's a costly and you know costly endeavor that I will have to take
10326420	10328420	Nevertheless, I'm not gonna miss the packs for
10328940	10333820	You know for the world. Well, that sounds like that may end up being my dragon con. I don't know yet
10333820	10335980	I have to chat with some people see what's gonna happen. But
10336660	10340380	Yeah, I I get it. So so paxies we looking forward to it paxies
10341300	10344760	Hopefully some you know a little bit more swag or you know
10344860	10351860	Well from the show from the showroom the show floor, but aside from that, you know better at better like after parties
10352700	10356140	Although I probably missed the boat on like, you know, some of the you know
10356140	10362740	Some good ones that you know, probably are already sold out and or like booked up for free reg
10364940	10368180	Free shit is always a great perk to any convention. I'm sure
10368180	10375580	But I guess I guess more importantly like for some reason I've been on a buying spree for well
10375580	10380400	I guess in the past year for peripherals like obviously the headsets I got in a
10380940	10386560	taxi last year and then you know a couple of years back the joystick both the
10387340	10390660	Solid stick that I have if you could yeah, you probably see it right now
10392180	10397940	So, yeah, whatever is there but yeah as you can see I'm still into flight simming but
10398500	10400500	besides the point
10400540	10402540	Yeah, I
10402620	10406340	Guess I'm looking forward to like, you know, what you know
10406900	10414180	How this whole like VR thing's gonna play out because I do you do you think there's gonna be more VR to try like at
10414180	10417100	This show on the show floor than we've probably ever seen before
10417100	10421460	I mean I seem to remember it packs that like oculus would usually have a booth of there to be something to experience
10421540	10427100	But now with like so many people getting into VR and does Sony do packs that are sometimes they do sometimes they don't are
10427100	10430940	They gonna be there. Yeah, I don't know but I mean it's a hit or miss
10430940	10435460	I know Microsoft's there with without a shadow of a doubt. Well, maybe they'll show HoloLens or something
10435460	10441380	It's you know, although I know HoloLens is probably still early on but it'd be interesting to see especially with the PlayStation VR
10441380	10445140	around the corner if PlayStation is gonna make a push with the
10446060	10449780	VR and Bobby Blackwell in our chat over at live dot vog network comm reminding us
10449780	10452320	Oh, yeah, Sony has done packs prime in the past. No
10452320	10454980	Yeah, I know they but it's kind of hit and miss like they don't do it every year
10454980	10457740	It's like it seems like if they have something to promote they do it
10457740	10464540	Oh like as of recent like these past few paxis, you know, a lot of the major players have you know, a lot of the major
10465340	10471860	Developed, you know publishers have been pulling out, you know, obviously there's been in for me in the past where you know
10471860	10475380	the likes of like Ubisoft and or to well and
10476060	10481380	In the case of Sony. Yes, they pulled out and I believe Nintendo did it one year
10481380	10485740	I know I know squint, you know Square Enix is obviously a you know, it's a shoe in but
10486260	10492140	It's been kind of varying like I remember five years ago when I first went. Yes. It was it was huge
10492140	10499040	Not well, it was it would be like what I would imagine e3 being but that's just my that's just my wishful thinking
10499660	10504980	But now it's like geared towards like I don't know board, you know, like actual tabletop
10505260	10509460	It's kind of like a you know, because of the atmosphere around there
10509620	10514300	You know half the shows like tabletop the other half is just obviously video gaming
10515100	10521340	So it's it's having that, you know, it's trying to find that equilibrium that pleases every you know, every gamer
10521740	10524580	Yeah, and that's pretty much where it boils down to
10525260	10530220	Well, if nothing else Zaku, even if the convention hall doesn't end up having everything you're looking for
10530220	10533460	You can always sit in the hall with your 3ds and endlessly street
10533460	10536240	I don't have a 3ds. I have a tablet the 3ds
10536240	10540360	Do you know by the way tangent time the 3ds turned five years old today?
10540480	10545920	Can you believe that like what we were just talking about earlier in the show the Spice Girls are 20 BAM
10545920	10552040	You're old. The 3ds is now five years old BAM. You're still old. Yeah. Oh my god, but you know
10552040	10554040	I didn't catch on to the whole
10554240	10560900	DS 3ds thing and I guess that's probably because I was always a PSP guy even though mine is still collecting dust up there in
10560900	10564200	The bin well, yes, and they actually released a new system called the Vita
10564200	10566380	I don't know if you've heard of it it kind of good. Yes
10571400	10576920	Well, yeah, I get your point, all right, but yeah, but being even then the beat is just like
10577980	10581080	People have forgotten about it. Well Zaku Zaku
10581080	10583180	I expect a full wrap-up when you get back from
10583400	10586540	Paxis because I want to hear about the show since I'm not really gonna be able to go this year
10586540	10588540	So I want to hear about it when you get back
10588700	10592360	Also, I went to round one in Chicago earlier this month
10593240	10598840	This is the arcade that has a bunch of like Japanese import games and stuff they have one in San Jose
10598840	10600840	I have yet to go because
10601240	10607280	I'm lazy. I don't know actually though with Dark Sakura's birthday soiree in the Bay Area coming up
10607280	10612980	Mm-hmm. I may have to start going around one in San Jose. Oh, yeah, I just move the party there. I
10613600	10616080	Mean, I look into it like it's not
10616660	10620640	There will be a small person there. Yeah, and we need alcohol to be present
10620800	10626600	You know look into that anyway, sorry Zaku go ahead. Yeah, I mean it's not in Chicago proper per se
10626600	10633000	It's like 45 minutes out of like the inner loop, which is the big, you know, the Manhattan over there and you know
10633000	10637940	Thank God for lyft and the ability to expense these things in my expense report
10638920	10645460	Which you know, obviously I was able to expense, you know, the you know, the actual game card and every must be nice
10646300	10651180	Yeah, I mean when you work for a company that has a Chicago office and most of the Android developers
10651180	10656180	I work with are all out there. So I get to expense this fucking show. How do I how do I get new microphones?
10656180	10662100	Can I can I bill it to sack IGDA is there a budget over? No, no breeze give he's giving me the frown
10662260	10662860	All right
10662860	10666500	It's kind of like the I mean, it's kind of like the the Japanese one
10666500	10668860	Like I remember when I went to Japan almost two years ago
10668860	10674220	I remember round ones just being like huge in terms of like the other arcades
10674260	10680860	I went around, you know went to in Tokyo and this one was kind of like that, but it also had a mix of the American
10681620	10686980	Redemption games and whatnot. So you still have to have the gambling for children or it's just not an arcade
10687100	10691340	Yeah, plus the pool, you know, plus the pool tables pink ponte. Do they have to go?
10691860	10693860	Do they have a Chinko?
10694140	10698700	No, they do not that's separate. That's usually a dedicated
10699300	10701420	Chinko is kind of like a dedicated thing
10701420	10707660	You have to go to a dedicated place in in Japan or unless it's like in a certain floor of a Japanese
10707860	10712540	Arcade which is an average of like a few stories, but long story short. Yes
10712540	10716860	It's they had a lot of the bimani games that you know, I've been craving for a while
10716860	10722540	But you know, it's kind of like a marriage like there the American round ones are almost like a marriage between
10723140	10729380	The Japanese one and a Dave and Buster's with a little bit less of Dave and Buster's a little bit more of the round one
10729900	10734660	All right. Well Zaku, I gotta let you go so we get some more calls, but thank you for the phone call
10734660	10738340	I appreciate it and have a good night. Yep. Have a good night. I will talk to you soon. Bye
10738860	10744060	Alright one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call
10744180	10749760	I did want to point out because I've been informed that some of my pals that I play ingress with are actually listening right now
10750360	10754080	So I figured they could actually appreciate this joke that I'm about to say
10754120	10760080	which is that the reason why I would be in favor of you moving your birthday party is because I've already capped the portals at
10760080	10762060	The mall where your birthday party is originally scheduled
10762060	10767160	I have not kept the portals at round one and I fucking you need uniques then let's do this
10768160	10771560	I'm done. Don't move your birthday party because of my stupid ass
10771560	10777960	Don't get around one, but I told Becky that it would be okay for Julian there before they start kicking kids out. Mm-hmm
10778640	10781240	And Becky is my bestie. That's very sir
10781800	10784640	Really quickly since along those same lines. I'm Alan
10784640	10788120	Did you want to describe for our listeners without giving any of the James Bond secrets away?
10788120	10794440	I actually took you out on a late-night adventure last night our first big like ingress like op we did together
10794440	10799160	Did you did you want to share with the listeners what that was like like what what we did on Friday night?
10799160	10803640	What's all involved in it? Yes without giving any of the secrets away if you know what I mean, okay
10805200	10807120	Well
10807120	10811560	The the to get your team points and ingress you have to cover
10812600	10815680	Geography like you take three points and you make a triangle
10817360	10822160	Which you think all right you walk down to the supermarket the bank or wherever and you make a triangle there
10822160	10824960	But people will do a big-ass field that will cover
10825640	10827400	several states
10827400	10829880	like huge undertakings and
10831440	10837040	You when you link when you make the triangle you can't cross the lines with anything existing
10837240	10840600	So what we did for a field like that
10841360	10843360	It's my mic on. Yeah
10843560	10845560	for basically we were
10845840	10847040	I
10847040	10849560	Trying to decide what is too much or too little to say
10850520	10856200	we weren't throwing the field, but we were responsible for making sure the lane was cleared so that the
10857360	10860120	The connect the dots that they were trying to do wasn't blocked
10860400	10865600	Because even if it's a line from your team from your faction, you can't intersect a line, right?
10865600	10869760	So yeah, we went out drove out to the middle of nowhere and I'm on t-mobile
10870080	10876560	So I'm like we're gonna go out to the boonies to take down this, you know innocent link that you know
10876560	10879560	It's just in the way. It's just inconvenient. I may have no data
10879960	10884960	So luckily when we got there you you had data on your t-mobile connection and mine was the one that was yeah
10884960	10888840	You were on like one or two. We were like on one or two bars and I had five bars. It's really awful
10888840	10892040	I was just expecting does that you actually went way more into I was just expecting you to say yeah
10892040	10894680	It was really fun to sit in the dark for 45 minutes Rob. That was a lot of fun
10894840	10895240	Yeah, no
10895240	10901520	So you don't want the other team to know that something really major like that is going on because they'll throw links and block the
10901520	10906280	Path so yeah, we had to sit in a car in the dark, which is not creepy at all for like
10906880	10911140	45 minutes until the person that was running the operation
10911140	10917280	They're like there's like 15 to 20 people involved out there on their cell phones in their cars involved in operations like this
10917280	10919280	So yeah, we had to weigh. Okay
10919280	10924360	1040 it's gonna go up at 11 do it now like and we had to okay destroy it destroy it clear
10924360	10927520	Yay, and then have to see if they wanted you to drive anywhere else
10928280	10930280	Yeah
10931720	10933720	All right, but you had fun right? Yeah
10935800	10942440	All right, we're gonna take more calls one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word
10942440	10948280	I think we've got another call coming in. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi. This is raging leader
10948280	10953560	Hi rage nader who apparently is using that avatar software to actually call in as a cat tonight
10953560	10961160	I've seen Tiger Claw use this before but I guess rage nader now expressing your a kitty cat side here on the video stream that
10961160	10964000	Our radio listeners can't see but that's okay. What's on your mind, buddy?
10965000	10967120	not whole
10967120	10972560	Well, you know if I remember right you kind of sort of touched on something early in the show
10973160	10977760	Yeah, recently I bought a carry vault no real steam
10978280	10980280	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I
10982000	10987720	Know the one thing I don't remember you mentioning is what your thoughts are on that bundle
10989360	10991360	On which bundle I'm sorry
10993360	10994360	Vault
10994360	10996360	bundle Oh Atari vault, um
10997080	11000020	If you like classic games enough then yeah
11000020	11005400	I think it's worth the money especially because they put in the multiplayer where you can you know chat over the or I'm sorry
11005560	11007920	Actually play the games over the internet and all that stuff
11008520	11013040	But I they release something very similar to it already on iPad and iPhone
11013040	11016200	So I think if you already own that it may not be worth the money
11016200	11019680	But if you have an appreciation for old games, I think it is worth the money
11019680	11026800	Just remember a lot of the old games were kind of one-trick ponies, you know, but that's also what made them great
11026800	11031120	I think a game like kaboom is to which I don't think is in the pack because that was Activision
11031120	11035480	But a game like kaboom is kaboom is still fun to play today in my opinion
11036040	11041080	That's you know, and it's it's disgustingly simple. It's just collect the ball at the bombs and the little little pots of water
11041200	11044660	There's not a lot else to it. So, you know, it depends on
11045920	11050640	How much you can appreciate those old games, but if you're the type that only spends five seconds
11051240	11054240	On an old game, they're like, yeah, whatever done over it
11054240	11058320	Then I don't think there's gonna be enough value here for you or if you already have these Atari games some other way
11058800	11060800	Yeah, oh I kind of
11061760	11069100	Well, I just got the entire develop dollar day myself. Thanks to fifth ring. But uh, yeah
11069840	11074180	You know, it is a nice package, you know, they're falling because no
11074960	11081900	No, well two things. No, the target 2600 was my first system way back in day B
11082420	11085820	Now great. I did have some of these games via
11086740	11091480	Game room, but unfortunately, I can't read down the game room
11093660	11100220	Yeah, that's that I know I had a good guy Microsoft moment earlier, but that's a bad guy Microsoft moment to be honest
11100220	11104060	Yeah, but uh, no, it's a follow-up question
11104060	11109460	You know now that Atari well is out on Steam, you know, well, I were
11109980	11112820	Presumed is probably out for consoles as well. But
11113380	11115380	No
11116180	11119540	Is there any other anthologies that you would like to
11120060	11123180	See come out. No, like maybe a
11124060	11126560	version of the Capcom classics collections
11127180	11133660	Or something like that. I'm such a retro whore. I I'm I'll be happy. I'll be thrilled if they put anything out
11133660	11139340	I'm always adamant for my guardian legend release on PC, but you know
11140340	11142340	Someone never fucking get it
11142780	11144500	Do an update?
11144500	11146900	Like a really good one that won't get shut down
11146900	11152580	I would appreciate a like Commodore collection of like old Commodore 64 classics
11152580	11154760	I would like to see that on Steam some games like, you know
11154800	11157100	Good old jump man and jump man jr
11157100	11162380	And just this shit that we the temple as phi and and all these things that we used to play on
11163020	11165340	On the Commodore 64 would I would love that?
11166100	11166940	Ah
11166940	11168780	Cool. All right. Yeah
11168780	11174560	Yeah, I probably go with the konami collection now that they're ever actually do it
11175300	11177300	Cuz they're all there
11177540	11184220	Okay, they used to have a game tap one that was Contra and I want to say Castlevania was in it
11184220	11188420	So they did do so. No, what's the theme night? It was at the old 8-bit Castlevania's
11188420	11191340	I think we're on PC because you used to be able to play him through game tap
11192340	11195300	So it was sort of out there it was sort of out there
11195300	11201220	But yeah, I don't know you could do the whole thing where if you have an Xbox one you can play the game
11201220	11205500	But that's kind of cheating. That's not really playing the games on your PC. But anyway, all right. We're aging
11205500	11208620	I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call. I appreciate it. Sure
11209540	11215340	You two pets for the kitty. All right, I guess that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight
11215580	11218660	If you didn't get through but you yeah, I still have something to say
11219340	11224460	Participate at orange launch radio.com is a great place to do it. I know we're running a little long tonight
11224460	11228460	It's about time to wrap things up and thank you for putting up with the audio things this week
11228460	11231460	I will look into that over the next week and try to figure that out
11231580	11236180	Looks like I'm going on a shopping spree fix that. I want to get that fixed before the
11237540	11240620	Indie arcade event that's for sure. I don't want that on the stream
11240740	11245860	But anyhow Alan say this podcast is single-handedly keeping the Guitar Center in
11246540	11250860	Sacramento probably business because whenever you need studio mics
11251980	11254560	Now now that Radio Shack is gone
11255300	11260680	That's really the only reason to go to Guitar Center true. Well, I Gabe Brianna
11260680	11263980	I really want to thank you guys for being here tonight taking the time out to be on our show
11264220	11267920	Best of luck with the rest of the planning for Sacramento indie arcade
11268060	11273140	I am very thrilled and excited to be a part of it with my co-hosts and yeah
11273220	11278740	Looking forward to it in a couple weeks same here same here. Thank you so much. I want to play some games. Can't wait
11279260	11281860	Brianna I still look forward to the convention and thank you for being here
11283540	11285220	You're welcome you guys are welcome back anytime
11285220	11289380	You don't have to wait till next year if you have something update us on in a few months. Let us know. All right
11289940	11291820	Especially if you have any other big IGDA events
11291820	11295780	I would love to get to some more bring some of your dev friends in here and let's get them on the air
11295940	11297940	It'll be fun fun. All right
