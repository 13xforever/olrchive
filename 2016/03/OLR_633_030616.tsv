0	27000	This week, Microsoft hints at the homogenization of Xbox and PC gaming. Beyond one operating system to rule them all, it's suggested players may eventually be able to upgrade Xbox hardware over time. This is just one of the stories we're covering tonight, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	47000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 633 for this March the 6th of 2016.
47000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joined by my co-host here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California. Over there is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
60000	61000	How you doing, Jamie?
61000	62000	I'm alright.
62000	63000	Yeah?
63000	64000	Yeah.
64000	66000	And Jamie stopped to get a little food before the show tonight, and you never-
66000	67000	A little?
67000	69000	Yeah, I know. I was gonna say, you should've-
69000	70000	Do you want what's left?
70000	77000	No, maybe I'll have a bite, because that place is pretty good. She went to a little Chinese place. It's one of those, like, strip malls. It's a strip mall Chinese place.
77000	78000	Like Hong Kong Palace or something?
78000	80000	Yeah, like every- well, don't tell all the listeners where I live.
80000	84000	I don't know what that's called. I just made something up.
84000	85000	That's okay.
85000	87000	It's, like, got- it's either-
87000	90000	And let's be real, that could be any strip mall Chinese restaurant.
91000	100000	There's also, like, always- you always find Golden Palace and, like, Pagoda Inn or all kinds of typically, you know-
100000	113000	There's a place in town. It's not, like, Panda Express. It's, like, Panda- what do they call it? Panda Diner or something. It's, like, it tries to make you think it's Panda Express, but it's really not. It's just kind of funny.
113000	119000	However, if you see Panda Inn, that is the real restaurant that led to Panda Express.
119000	120000	I remember-
120000	121000	Because I read their cups.
121000	123000	It's amazing what you can learn.
123000	125000	When you're really bored.
125000	128000	Yes, I read an In-N-Out cup once and learned about the Bible.
128000	130000	If you look to the bottom of the cup.
130000	136000	But, yeah, I hope you've been having a good week, Dark Soccer. Happy to have you here as always.
136000	140000	Thank you. I'm gonna be having a better week when my schedule changes.
140000	142000	Yeah, I know you've been having to cut-
142000	143000	Very soon.
143000	150000	You've been having to cut out of the show early some nights just depending on how long we run because of your work schedule, so that'll be nice to have that all for you.
150000	159000	It's, like, between 815 and 830 so that I can go to bed on time, but I took a minor staycation and to take care of-
159000	166000	I'll just go ahead and say it. I've been having a migraine that's lasted since the Thursday before this past week.
166000	167000	That's no fun.
167000	171000	And even low level when they don't hurt so badly. It's still a migraine.
171000	172000	Yeah.
172000	179000	So, it just comes and goes and waves, so I'm, like, doing blood tests and stupid stuff to figure out what's causing it.
179000	182000	But I took a minor vacation to see if it was stress.
182000	183000	Uh-huh.
183000	185000	Nope. It's still there.
185000	186000	Ah, bummer.
186000	188000	That's okay because I went to San Francisco yesterday and it was great.
188000	189000	Oh, awesome.
189000	190000	Yeah.
190000	194000	I have not taken a trip to San Francisco in far too long. I need to do a day trip.
194000	199000	I've found that you avoid tolls if you leave by way of the 101.
200000	204000	Oh, yeah, because you can, yeah, go in the freeway and go out the freeway.
204000	207000	Also, people in California don't know how to drive in the rain.
207000	210000	That is- Oh, my gosh. The rain was crazy yesterday.
210000	211000	No, it wasn't.
211000	212000	For California, though.
212000	213000	Yeah.
213000	214000	It was crazy.
214000	215000	It got a little gusty and I drive a Fiat.
215000	222000	But, I mean, the only thing that really scared me all about the driving was when my headaches started to come back, like, on the way back.
222000	224000	So, Becky took over. She went with me.
224000	230000	But we also did the play with- I don't remember what street we were on. I'll have to look it up.
230000	235000	But it's one of those super, super high hilly ones. And then it even gives you a warning.
235000	237000	Steep decline.
237000	243000	And because you cannot see the rest of the road as you're approaching. It's like being on a roller coaster.
243000	244000	Yeah, yeah.
244000	248000	And I was like, ah, we're in a Fiat.
248000	252000	Were you like that scene out of the movie Clueless when they drive on the freeway accidentally?
252000	253000	Alright.
253000	254000	I think I whined.
254000	259000	I gotta say hi to the chat room. I'm, of course, gonna get to Loki in just a minute here. But I have to address the chat room.
259000	265000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
265000	267000	VogueNetwork.com. That's the Voice of Geeks Network.
267000	275000	VogueNetwork.com. And our chatters are giving me a little shit for overreacting to the whole name of the Chinese restaurant.
275000	288000	S2100Matt says, wow, Rob lives in every town in the US. Our awesome voice over dude VXJ6V says, hey guy, hey guys, Rob lives close to a subway in Sacramento, USA.
288000	294000	That is true. I do live near a subway. I also live near a McDonald's. Go figure.
294000	302000	I'm gonna say you probably live near like four subways because they're so close together. I personally live next to like probably three or four subways.
302000	306000	There he is, everybody. Tech master Loki has to comment when we get to food.
306000	308000	Because they're so close together.
308000	313000	I'm always blown away by how well subways do because there's so many of them.
313000	315000	It's not. They're the cheapest franchise.
315000	325000	Yeah, and I know I've asked this on the show before. I don't understand how subways make money 24 hours a day. Because some subways are open 24 hours a day.
325000	328000	I will point out that you don't live near a Starbucks. Not that near one.
328000	342000	I don't. That's kind of the crazy part. So, and then they're asking in chat, let's see, over at live.vongnover.com, SSG100Matt says, the real question is if he lives near any In-N-Out.
342000	344000	Not really. The Starbucks is probably closer.
344000	347000	Yeah, In-N-Out really kind of spread about.
347000	356000	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if it's one of those things where it's like I want to have In-N-Out for dinner, like which once in a blue moon.
356000	362000	I'm like, I want an Albert because I will say this. It is for fast food hamburger. It is really stinking good.
362000	368000	Like it is. We're spoiled being here in California, but you know, anyway, let's see.
368000	374000	Going to chat. Alan Alchemy says we live near a park and a gas station. All right.
374000	378000	All right. Enough. Enough talk about addresses and restaurants.
378000	379000	It's a house.
379000	380000	That's right.
380000	381000	On a street.
381000	382000	In a town.
382000	384000	In the middle of your street, actually.
384000	388000	Rob's house in the middle of the street.
388000	393000	Anyhow, Techmaster Loki, there he is. And you bought a new toy today, Techmaster Loki.
393000	395000	Yeah, I bought a Gear VR.
395000	400000	So you've been talking about buying one for a while, but you literally just opened it here in studio.
400000	402000	You must have went to Best Buy before you came to the show.
402000	406000	I did, and I haven't been there in like apparently a while.
406000	410000	And I'm like, where the fuck is everything? Like they have all these different kiosks now.
410000	415000	So many kiosks for different like sections, like differently. They have an Apple thing.
415000	420000	They have Samsung. They have like Windows and all this stuff.
420000	421000	Yet no one to help you.
421000	423000	Where did you go? The one by the mall?
423000	425000	I went by the Citrus Heights one.
425000	426000	Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.
426000	432000	So, and I got the last one that they had because I guess they're doing preorders for the Galaxy S7,
432000	437000	which they're giving away free VR headsets for everybody that preorders those.
437000	443000	Which would be cool if I didn't have a phone, but I do. So I'm not going to preorder a new phone for that.
443000	446000	Yeah. So what do you plan to use it for? Just for fun?
446000	449000	Oh, no. I'm like, I'm kind of pissed off because I'm not on your Wi-Fi right now.
449000	453000	And so it's eating up my data, downloading shit I probably don't need.
453000	456000	I would write down the password for you if you just need the password to the Wi-Fi.
456000	460000	Yeah, I will. I just got a thing from, you know, ping my phone saying,
460000	464000	you've used two thirds of your data or three quarters of your data.
465000	469000	How are you not already on? Oh, you're not in chat. I can't even send you a private message.
469000	475000	Sorry. Yeah, I'm behind. I was busy trying to figure out how to put everything together.
475000	478000	You're still arguing like what burger places are best.
478000	481000	And I just decided that it doesn't matter if it's fast food or not.
481000	483000	I mean, honestly, there's not a lot of apps for it, I think.
483000	488000	So I just want to try out because my Oculus Rift dev kit 2 does not run very well on my laptop.
488000	493000	And I want something that kind of, I would assume that this device is meant for my phone.
493000	497000	So it should run how it's supposed to run.
497000	502000	And so I kind of want to see what it's like and maybe develop an app for it or something like that.
502000	505000	You know, that'd be kind of fun. But right now it's just kind of a toy.
508000	512000	All right. So I guess, so there's no like must have game or experience on Gear VR.
512000	514000	No, there isn't. And that's the thing.
514000	518000	As I was even looking at before I came here, before I bought him, like, you know, looking at,
518000	522000	so where are the best apps to use on this? And everyone's like, yeah, you can watch Netflix on it.
523000	526000	I'm like, cool, I guess.
527000	533000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says the Gear VR installation does download a lot of data.
533000	536000	So get on the Wi-Fi ASAP, Loki.
536000	538000	I will be there right now.
538000	543000	Set him up with that. Now, did the chat room come to a consensus on the best burger in the States?
543000	544000	No.
544000	545000	No.
545000	549000	I'm personally, I prefer the Red Robin cheeseburger.
549000	553000	I know it's not fast food, but I love their cheeseburgers because they can give it to you.
553000	557000	The patty's good and you can ask for it. Like, you know, they ask you some pink or no pink.
557000	560000	I'm like as much pink as fucking possible. Thank you very much.
560000	562000	I voted for Flaming Grill.
562000	564000	I don't even know if I've been there.
564000	572000	You'll have to go because Flaming Grill is where I've eaten llama and camel and kangaroo.
572000	576000	But every time they run out of yak and I want to try yak.
576000	582000	You know what I miss? Like, well, it's there's still one in Davis if I want to go there, but it used to be Murder Burger.
582000	589000	And then they changed it to Red Rum Burger because you can't call a place murder even though that is what that's what they do to the cow.
589000	594000	No, no, you can't. You can't call that because of too many fucking politically correct people.
594000	600000	What I would have says, we don't like the name of your establishment. I would have said, fuck you. Get out of here.
600000	602000	You would have murdered them.
603000	607000	I just said, fuck off. I don't need you at my establishment. Thank you very much.
607000	612000	All right. Let's see. I don't like it still mooing. It needs to be ground up.
612000	614000	It can't move if it's ground up.
614000	616000	If it's mooing, that's too fresh.
616000	618000	You guys are disgusting.
618000	622000	All right. Clearly no vegetarians in the studio.
622000	626000	I would like to apologize to the cool guy that I ran into in Berkeley.
626000	628000	If you're listening live, I'm sorry.
628000	631000	Oh, Berkeley? Totally a vegetarian then.
631000	632000	I don't know.
632000	633000	You know, you never know.
633000	637000	We were at a place that sells all kinds of stuff.
638000	642000	I bought ginger, sea salt, dark chocolate.
642000	647000	Many, many years ago, this would actually be probably the year before O.L.R. started.
647000	649000	So that's how long ago it was, right?
649000	655000	I used to date a vegan and we would have to go to Berkeley all the time.
655000	658000	I wasn't vegan, but I also didn't cook.
658000	663000	So if he cooked, I mean, I was always eating really light.
663000	666000	That was when I was at the height of my DDR stuff, too.
666000	668000	I was never skinnier in my life than those few years.
668000	670000	It's because you were starving.
670000	671000	Yeah, a little bit.
671000	673000	Well, no, I wasn't vegan.
673000	677000	It's just if I would go to his house and he cooks dinner, then, yeah, I'm going to eat vegan that night.
677000	683000	And I would try anything that he cooked because you're not going to be like, surprise, it's a chicken brain.
683000	686000	Like you knew, OK, it's probably some type of tofu.
686000	689000	Like there's really only so much you can use, right?
689000	692000	There's actually all kinds of vegetarian meat options now.
692000	694000	Well, you remember when I was raw vegan?
694000	697000	Oh, that's no, too much, too much.
697000	698000	Two months of that.
698000	699000	Too extreme.
699000	704000	I, the one thing I'll say is that I don't have any digestion problems.
704000	706000	Is that where you can't cook the vegetables? Is that raw vegan?
706000	709000	Yeah, or you can't cook them past a certain amount, like you could blanch them.
709000	717000	But it was really well, I got really good at making avocado chocolate pudding.
717000	726000	It was actually really good. And I mean, I did really well for a while because I had all kinds of fun stuff that I would make and eat a lot of dehydrated things and nut milk.
726000	732000	And I made like frozen nut bars and everything with coconut oil and all this. It was really good.
732000	734000	But man, I wanted pizza.
734000	736000	In all seriousness, being a vegetarian is hard.
736000	739000	I tried it just for like health.
739000	743000	Being a vegetarian now is easy.
743000	746000	I still think it takes a lot of discipline. I really do.
746000	749000	But anyway, look, we're not here to talk about food. We're here to talk about video games.
749000	752000	But we do eat a lot of food when we play video games, let's be real.
752000	756000	But we want to get into gaming and we'll start off tonight with a kickoff topic.
756000	760000	And of course, some of the big, big news this week was the Nintendo Direct.
760000	766000	The Nintendo Direct happened this week, so I thought we'd take a minute to drill down some of the highlights from the Nintendo Direct here for our kickoff topic tonight.
766000	768000	See what you guys thought about that.
768000	774000	First off, Project Guard. Do you remember Project Guard, which was one of the Miyamoto projects that was shown?
774000	776000	Yes, I remember that.
776000	780000	And I think you even said, what the hell happened to those? Are those even going to be a thing?
780000	783000	Oh, I said, I just don't fucking care about it is what I said.
783000	787000	I said, I don't, it's, don't get me wrong. Miyamoto is fucking awesome.
787000	791000	If he wants to do these whole projects, I guess I should be supportive in that.
791000	796000	It's just not something that I was like, oh, I need to fucking buy it because Miyamoto made it. I just don't feel that way.
796000	803000	And I'm all for Miyamoto or whoever in Nintendo exploring new ideas because Splatoon, amazing new IP.
803000	805000	And I'm so happy that Nintendo went with that. Right.
805000	808000	So if they want to try new things, cool.
808000	813000	But, well, I guess it's not really going to be a new IP because Project Guard is now Star Fox Guard.
813000	817000	So they are going to inject the Star Fox universe into that. And now we're going to be getting that.
817000	819000	There's also Star Fox Zero.
819000	825000	Yeah, they really shoehorned that shit in there. I mean, it's just, it's so canon.
825000	830000	It's just like, we just need to tie this to some fucking franchise. Okay, done.
830000	832000	I don't think it's a big deal. I'm okay with it.
832000	839000	So, yeah. And of course, I mean, here, I'll tell you what, here's what here would have been a better implementation of that.
839000	845000	And it's I mean, it is a rip off in a sense. Fucking tied into Luigi's mansion.
845000	848000	You know, Luigi, he's a night guard, you know, at like a mansion.
848000	852000	And you have to watch out for the ghosts, you know, all of fucking Five Nights at Freddy's.
852000	857000	It would be a kidsy friendly, you know, Five Nights at Freddy's thing and people eat that shit up.
858000	860000	Why couldn't they do that?
860000	863000	I'll give you props, Loki. That's a cute idea. It really is.
863000	869000	More Splatoon updates. After all, even though apparently they said they were done updating Splatoon,
869000	871000	there are going to be some more Splatoon updates.
871000	876000	But I don't get your hopes too much up because I don't think they're talking about maps or anything more like that.
876000	879000	It's just more like quality of life improvements.
879000	886000	There's a patch coming March 8th that's going to have some lesser used abilities improved to make them more desirable.
886000	892000	There'll be matchmaking and team assignment changes for ranked battles and also new Splatfest elements.
892000	898000	And then in April, there's going to be tweaks for existing weapons and what they call weapon set recommendations.
898000	901000	So, I mean, they are making still some changes to Splatoon.
901000	904000	And I don't think they were ever intending on cutting off Splatoon completely,
904000	907000	but I think the major changes like maps were done with that.
907000	910000	But it's nice to hear about changes with Splatoon.
910000	916000	And then what I thought was really awesome is that Mario Maker getting some more big updates.
916000	920000	I kind of felt like there was going to still be more to come with Mario Maker,
920000	924000	but then when you see this, you're like, OK, wow, this is cool.
924000	927000	And they're not charging for it, which is, you know, again,
927000	928000	I think it's cool.
928000	934000	We can give Nintendo shit sometimes, but this is supporting your game done right.
934000	940000	So on March 9th, you're going to be able to do keys to unlock doors to gate progression in the game.
940000	945000	So kind of like what you had in Mario 2, which is interesting because Mario 2 is not supported.
945000	948000	But, yeah, we got that functionality.
948000	952000	The keys can be hidden or you can put them on enemies.
952000	955000	So now you have to fight the mandatory boss battles.
955000	960000	You can't just get past, you know, Bowser on top of Bowser and all the crazy shit people come up with.
960000	961000	So that's pretty cool.
961000	968000	Also, pink coins that you have to find before a level is complete.
968000	972000	So kind of a little twist on the red coin thing from, what, Yoshi's Island.
972000	974000	I think it was the first time that showed up.
974000	977000	So now with pink coins, you must find the coins before completing the level.
977000	986000	So this is going to make hell levels even worse because you know some of those coins are going to be in the stupidest places.
986000	990000	It's just like today where it's like you have a super hard level and you go into it and it's like,
990000	992000	oh, there's a hidden trap door somewhere.
992000	995000	Hopefully they don't go too crazy with that stuff.
995000	997000	But I love those ideas for level updates.
997000	1001000	And if they're done well, I think it will be a very exciting thing.
1001000	1005000	Shimagami Tensei Crossfire Emblem now has a name for the U.S.
1005000	1007000	And it will be coming out here in the U.S.
1007000	1012000	But they're calling it Tokyo Mirage Sessions hashtag FE.
1012000	1014000	So, hey, at least we're...
1014000	1018000	The reaction I'm seeing for most people is, hey, at least we're getting it.
1018000	1020000	And that is true. So at least we are getting that.
1020000	1022000	Some new stuff that was announced.
1022000	1025000	A new Paper Mario game is going to be coming out.
1025000	1029000	That was part of an earlier rumor set, so it didn't really surprise people.
1029000	1031000	But it's still nice to have that confirmed.
1031000	1036000	Rhythm Heaven Megamix is going to be coming to the west, which has a lot of people excited as well.
1036000	1042000	And I had to send the paramedics to Act Def's house because there was Kirby news.
1042000	1043000	Big Kirby news.
1043000	1047000	There's a brand new Kirby game for the 3DS on June 10th.
1047000	1050000	Kirby Planet Robobot is coming out.
1050000	1055000	And, of course, what better way to celebrate a new Kirby game than with Kirby Amiibo.
1055000	1057000	That's right, new Kirby Amiibo on its way out.
1057000	1061000	So there's a new Kirby and a new Dedede.
1061000	1065000	But then there's also like Waddle Dee and some of the enemies are going to be there as well.
1065000	1068000	So that's, you know, especially if you're a big Kirby fan, that's very exciting.
1068000	1070000	So, yeah, and that's not it.
1070000	1071000	I mean, there's more. I'm not even...
1071000	1075000	I didn't even get into the Bravely Second stuff and Catmancer and all the excitement about that.
1075000	1077000	But there was even more stuff in the Nintendo Direct.
1077000	1081000	So any thoughts on Nintendo Direct?
1081000	1083000	Was there anything in there that you thought, hmm, I want to get that?
1083000	1084000	Paper Mario game looks good.
1084000	1085000	Yeah.
1085000	1088000	It was very RPG heavy, which was interesting.
1088000	1089000	Really RPG heavy.
1089000	1091000	That is not a complaint, people.
1091000	1092000	I was surprised.
1092000	1094000	Well, that's how I think the original Paper Mario is.
1094000	1095000	Where I've never really played...
1095000	1099000	The only Paper Mario game I played was Super Paper Mario and I actually really liked that one.
1099000	1100000	No, I mean the Direct in general.
1100000	1102000	Like the Direct in general was a ton of RPGs.
1102000	1109000	Yeah, if you think about like, you know, the Shin Megami Tensei, the Bravely Default.
1109000	1111000	There was some Dragon Quest news in there.
1111000	1115000	I mean, if you like RPGs, Nintendo is really trying to...
1115000	1118000	I really loved how they're trying to assure the fans.
1118000	1123000	Listen, this Metroid game is fucking canon.
1123000	1127000	Seriously, it is a legit Metroid game.
1127000	1129000	We're just telling you it's legit.
1129000	1131000	So definitely check it out.
1131000	1134000	We totally didn't just shoehorn this shit onto this game.
1134000	1136000	It is completely legit.
1136000	1140000	It seriously is legit as a fucking Star Fox guard game.
1140000	1143000	I mean, absolutely 100% legit.
1143000	1145000	But Samus is in it.
1145000	1147000	So of course it's canon.
1147000	1149000	No thanks.
1149000	1152000	Here's the way I put it.
1152000	1155000	I don't have a problem with if they want to try something different.
1155000	1160000	But to me, this game, to make like a Marvel comparison,
1160000	1163000	they have the Marvel Avengers cartoons and stuff.
1163000	1166000	They're pretty... I think it handles the properties well.
1166000	1168000	It's mature.
1168000	1172000	It's something you can get behind that's respectable to the properties.
1172000	1174000	And then they also have Marvel Superhero Squad,
1174000	1177000	which is like fucking retarded fart jokes,
1177000	1181000	goddamn stupid Saturday morning cartoon bullshit.
1181000	1184000	That is this of the Metroid universe.
1184000	1187000	It's the Marvel Superhero Squad of the Metroid universe.
1187000	1191000	I'm not going to go that far until I have a chance to actually get my hands on it.
1191000	1195000	But I think the frustration for most people is that
1195000	1198000	when people want a new Metroid game,
1198000	1202000	they want either, and I think people would take either one at this point,
1202000	1205000	either a new Prime game or a new 2D Metroid,
1205000	1207000	I think a lot of people really want.
1207000	1209000	And that's not what we're getting.
1209000	1211000	And I think that's where a lot of the frustration comes in, honestly.
1211000	1216000	I think if they'd announced this alongside a more traditional Metroid game,
1216000	1220000	kind of like we have Star Fox Zero and Star Fox Guard,
1220000	1222000	I don't think people would be complaining as much.
1222000	1224000	And I really think that's what it boils down to.
1224000	1227000	I really think that's why some people are reacting so heavily
1227000	1231000	to the Metroid Federation Force thing,
1231000	1235000	is because it's not the Metroid game people wanted.
1235000	1239000	But that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a bad game, either.
1239000	1243000	So, you know, kind of like you said earlier, Loki,
1243000	1246000	you could put a different IP on some things.
1246000	1248000	The whole Star Fox Guard could have been Luigi's Mansion.
1248000	1251000	You never know what IP, you could have stamped on it.
1251000	1255000	Kaijuto in chat says, people want Retroid.
1255000	1260000	Although the indie scene does a pretty good job at giving us a ton of those.
1260000	1264000	Alex P Carson says, you know what we mean when we say we want a new Metroid game.
1264000	1267000	Ziba in chat says, the guy was like,
1267000	1270000	I've been wanting to make this game for ten plus years.
1270000	1272000	It's nice that he wants to do a side story game,
1272000	1275000	but it's not what people want.
1275000	1280000	So, you know, and I just, I hope it won't tick people off so much
1280000	1284000	that they won't even try it, because the game might be pretty rad.
1284000	1288000	It might suck, it might, but it might also be really rad.
1288000	1293000	So, I mean, don't, you know, don't get mad just because
1293000	1295000	it's not the Metroid game you want.
1295000	1298000	Maybe if this game does well, they'll think about revisiting the Metroid universe.
1298000	1302000	Who knows, but at the same time, if it doesn't do well,
1302000	1305000	then I think people are going to resent it even more
1305000	1306000	that Nintendo went down this path.
1306000	1310000	So, I think Nintendo's kind of in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.
1310000	1312000	But we'll see what happens. We will.
1312000	1315000	Anyway, that's all I really have to say about the Direct.
1315000	1318000	Dark Saga, I don't know if you saw any of the Direct,
1318000	1320000	but is there anything that you've been hearing about?
1320000	1322000	Like, especially, you know, you like your RPGs.
1322000	1323000	Is there anything you might check out?
1323000	1326000	Like the Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem?
1326000	1329000	No, I don't like Fire Emblem and I didn't play Shin Megami Tensei.
1329000	1331000	Bravely Second?
1331000	1333000	Maybe I haven't finished Bravely First.
1333000	1337000	I'm still stuck on Danganronpa. Don't make me think about other games.
1337000	1340000	Alright, fair enough.
1340000	1344000	Okay, let's get into it. Speaking of being stuck on certain games,
1344000	1346000	let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games
1346000	1348000	that we have been playing this week,
1348000	1351000	and then we'll get into the rest of the news from this week.
1351000	1353000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1353000	1355000	What types of games have you been playing this week?
1355000	1357000	I played a lot of Danganronpa.
1357000	1361000	Which I just finally got through the first trial.
1361000	1364000	I haven't had like a whole bunch of time to play,
1364000	1366000	even though I've been off of work for a little bit.
1366000	1376000	But I've also been doing that and doing the PVP on Heroes of Dragon Age off and on.
1377000	1382000	I've also been...
1382000	1384000	What else did I play?
1384000	1387000	Well, I guess...
1387000	1390000	Oh yeah, I picked up Final Fantasy Type 0.
1390000	1394000	It went on sale on Steam for a half price.
1394000	1396000	I haven't played it yet.
1396000	1400000	I also deleted like maybe 30 games out of my Steam library
1400000	1403000	that were taking up space that I'm not playing.
1403000	1408000	And then I also yelled at Super Hexagon.
1408000	1411000	And then cried for a little bit.
1411000	1413000	Oh, and Neko Atsume.
1413000	1415000	Although it's not really a game.
1415000	1419000	But Danganronpa is as good as everyone always told me it was.
1419000	1422000	And I didn't have anything to play it on in the day.
1422000	1425000	And now I'm glad I got it on Steam.
1425000	1427000	It's totally, totally fun.
1427000	1429000	And fucked up.
1430000	1435000	And I might have ordered a Monokuma plushie.
1436000	1438000	The fandom has begun.
1438000	1440000	The fandom has begun.
1440000	1441000	All right.
1441000	1442000	So screwed up.
1442000	1444000	You should see the shirt I ordered today.
1444000	1445000	I have to send it to you.
1445000	1446000	It's a mismatch.
1446000	1447000	Actually, I'll show you.
1447000	1449000	One of my buddies sent me a picture on text message
1449000	1450000	and told me about this.
1450000	1455000	It is a hybrid of Kermit meeting Bayonetta.
1455000	1456000	What?
1456000	1459000	It's a shirt called Kerminetta.
1460000	1461000	And it's amazing.
1461000	1462000	What?
1462000	1463000	No.
1463000	1464000	I'll show you the picture there.
1464000	1465000	Sorry for...
1465000	1466000	That is so weird.
1466000	1469000	I know this is horrible radio to be showing a visual in here.
1469000	1471000	But just imagine.
1471000	1472000	You can only imagine.
1472000	1473000	My brain.
1473000	1474000	Kermit meets Bayonetta.
1474000	1475000	And I had to have it.
1475000	1476000	So much.
1476000	1477000	Had to have it.
1477000	1479000	All right, Loki, how about your gaming week?
1479000	1481000	I didn't play a whole ton this week.
1481000	1486000	I just played a lot more stuff for Lego Avengers.
1486000	1490000	So I'm about 85% done now.
1490000	1492000	It's just kind of monotonous.
1492000	1495000	But I have most of the characters now.
1495000	1496000	Yay.
1496000	1497000	My son's happy.
1497000	1499000	That's really all he's doing it for.
1499000	1500000	Actually, no, he's not happy.
1500000	1501000	He's not...
1501000	1503000	He's like, did you get more Iron Man suits?
1503000	1505000	I'm like, I think you have them all already.
1505000	1506000	I want more.
1506000	1508000	I'm like, they don't do anything differently.
1508000	1510000	I get the sense your son really likes Iron Man
1510000	1512000	because I saw the outfit that he was wearing.
1512000	1514000	Yeah, well, that's the only one.
1514000	1516000	Yeah, he has that in...
1516000	1518000	Yeah, he likes Iron Man.
1518000	1519000	That's cool.
1519000	1521000	Iron Man's cool.
1521000	1522000	That's it?
1522000	1526000	Yeah, unfortunately, I mean...
1526000	1528000	I think that's it.
1528000	1530000	Yeah, because I didn't play any Fallout
1530000	1532000	because I haven't wanted my game to update yet.
1532000	1536000	Because I like cheating the way I was.
1536000	1538000	So I just haven't gotten around to playing that.
1538000	1542000	And I downloaded Broforce and that other Glax Z,
1542000	1543000	but I haven't played it yet.
1543000	1546000	So, yeah, that's it, unfortunately.
1546000	1549000	I played those two games both briefly.
1549000	1552000	I liked some of the effects in the Galax Z thing
1552000	1553000	with the whole, like, you know, when you pause it,
1553000	1556000	it looks like you paused a VCR tape and that whole thing.
1556000	1558000	But I didn't play a lot a lot of the games,
1558000	1560000	so I can't really talk about it in depth.
1560000	1563000	But it was interesting, and I liked some of the stylists.
1563000	1564000	Yeah.
1564000	1566000	Stylistic things they did with it.
1566000	1569000	All right, so getting into my gaming week.
1569000	1571000	I don't talk a lot about this anymore
1571000	1574000	because I kind of was talking about it ad nauseam.
1574000	1575000	But I will bring up quickly,
1575000	1577000	because today was a big Ingress day,
1577000	1580000	so I just want to mention real quick,
1580000	1584000	I was up at 4 in the morning today to go do a big thing
1584000	1588000	where we were going to throw a triangle over the entire city.
1588000	1590000	You were going to say Citadel.
1590000	1591000	Over the Citadel.
1591000	1594000	My favorite triangle on the Citadel.
1594000	1597000	Which, you know, it's funny because at first I was like,
1597000	1599000	all right, I'm going to stop talking about Ingress
1599000	1602000	as much on the show because people, you know,
1602000	1604000	either you're into it or you're not,
1604000	1606000	and it's kind of different than a lot of other video games.
1606000	1609000	But then Niantic announced they're going to make Pokemon Go,
1609000	1613000	so it's like, well, now Ingress, you know, what they do there,
1613000	1615000	you might see kind of come over to Pokemon Go,
1615000	1616000	so I think it's kind of relevant again.
1616000	1620000	But anyway, with Ingress, you know,
1620000	1622000	for such a simple kind of concept,
1622000	1624000	which is the whole fact that you connect these portals together
1624000	1626000	to draw triangles essentially,
1626000	1629000	and that is what gets you points for your team
1629000	1632000	depending on the population density inside the field.
1632000	1634000	So usually the bigger the better for the triangle,
1634000	1637000	but the more people you cover,
1637000	1640000	the more mind units you capture for your team.
1640000	1643000	So to do an effort like this where we triangle the whole town
1643000	1645000	takes a lot of people.
1645000	1649000	And so I was just, you know, for obvious reasons,
1649000	1651000	because I don't know who's listening to this program,
1651000	1653000	I can't get into too many of the details,
1653000	1657000	but I can just say it's amazing how the coordination
1657000	1660000	and the dedication for all these people play into this thing.
1660000	1663000	And it's so silly in a way because it's like
1663000	1666000	there's no tangible real-life reward for it.
1666000	1670000	But I think the best kind of analogy I can make it to
1670000	1674000	is like remember back in the day when World of Warcraft
1674000	1677000	had a 40-man raid in it, Molten Core,
1677000	1679000	and then the feeling you get when you beat the boss,
1679000	1681000	like everything goes to strategy
1681000	1683000	and you take out a new boss for the first time,
1683000	1686000	there's a lot of that exact same type of feeling,
1686000	1687000	I feel like, in Ingress,
1687000	1689000	when you have to get all those people together
1689000	1691000	to do something like that, and then, you know,
1691000	1695000	we got lucky and everything worked out just the way we wanted it to,
1695000	1698000	and it's like, okay, when we made the triangle and covered the town,
1698000	1701000	it's like that is like that same feeling
1701000	1703000	that you conquered this new raid boss.
1703000	1706000	So my point is I beat Ingress.
1706000	1711000	At least that's what it felt like today.
1711000	1713000	I don't know. Anyhow.
1713000	1716000	I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1716000	1717000	SSG100Matt says,
1717000	1720000	Cytangent was Ingress a mess at MAGFest?
1720000	1722000	I wouldn't say it was really a mess,
1722000	1725000	but to be honest, I wasn't checking it as much as you think.
1725000	1728000	I actually kind of consciously told myself like,
1728000	1730000	okay, don't just sit there and pew, pew, pew,
1730000	1732000	laser beam all the portals while you're here.
1732000	1736000	Hack once or twice a day, and then you're here for a convention.
1736000	1737000	Have fun with it.
1737000	1739000	So that's what I really tried to do with it.
1739000	1741000	But Bobby does point out,
1741000	1745000	I have a picture of Sky running around the National Mall to play Ingress.
1745000	1748000	Now that was different because when we left MAGFest,
1748000	1750000	now I was like, I'm at this place.
1750000	1752000	Lord knows I'm going to be here again.
1752000	1753000	I got to get all these uniques.
1753000	1755000	Hack this one, hack this one, hack this one, hack this one.
1755000	1757000	That was me in San Francisco,
1757000	1760000	and I actually now own the Conservatory of Flowers.
1760000	1761000	Congratulations.
1761000	1762000	Thanks.
1762000	1763000	Careful.
1763000	1766000	The other team might be listening, and they'll know it's your guardian.
1766000	1769000	Like, I'm going to get back there anytime soon.
1769000	1770000	Geez.
1770000	1771000	All right.
1771000	1772000	That's okay.
1772000	1774000	No one's touched my top secret home portal.
1774000	1775000	All right.
1775000	1776000	Good, good.
1776000	1777000	It's still mine.
1777000	1778000	You need to come put some eights on.
1778000	1779000	I was, you know, I forgot.
1779000	1781000	I was in your neighborhood like the other night,
1781000	1783000	and I just didn't even think about it.
1783000	1786000	We have maybe like, some of ours are like three away from being fully level eight.
1786000	1787000	Nice.
1787000	1788000	Yeah, so come help.
1788000	1790000	All right, well, Alan and I will take a road trip and do that.
1790000	1792000	Anyway, enough of that.
1792000	1797000	I had to share that story because the feeling I had today was like conquering a raid boss
1797000	1799000	and wow, and I think that's the best way I can put it.
1799000	1803000	If Pokemon Go has that type of stuff where you're going to have to coordinate people
1803000	1807000	and get people together to capture Mew or something really rare or something like that,
1807000	1811000	I think, like, you guys, shit's going to get real with Pokemon Go.
1811000	1816000	My expectations get higher and higher for Pokemon Go, which probably isn't a good thing.
1816000	1818000	I need to temper them a little bit.
1818000	1822000	Anyhow, other games I played this week that weren't on my phone.
1822000	1825000	I played Final Fantasy XIV.
1825000	1829000	There I go again with that, but to be fair, there is still that recent patch,
1829000	1830000	and there's a lot more to explore.
1830000	1833000	I still haven't finished the story, but I did the new.
1833000	1836000	Technically, it's not a primal fight, but it feels like one.
1836000	1840000	It might as well be a primal fight, and the music is so good.
1840000	1845000	I'm telling you guys, Soken, who does the music for XIV, is so awesome,
1845000	1846000	and he does so many different styles of music,
1846000	1849000	and this one's industrial, so it's like the song that plays.
1849000	1852000	In fact, actually, some of you guys might have seen her on the blogs.
1852000	1855000	I guess Powerman 5000 took issue with the song
1855000	1858000	because it sounded a lot like their single from years ago,
1858000	1861000	but to me it sounded more like an old-school Nine Inch Nails song
1861000	1865000	was what the boss fight sounded like, so that was awesome.
1865000	1867000	So yeah, I've been playing a lot more of that.
1867000	1871000	And then otherwise, not a lot on console,
1871000	1875000	although I did get my copy of Twilight Princess HD today.
1875000	1880000	I haven't had a chance to play it yet, but I will say the amiibo is gorgeous.
1880000	1882000	I swear the amiibo get better and better.
1882000	1886000	That amiibo is gorgeous. I love the wolf link.
1886000	1888000	So yeah, there's that amiibo.
1888000	1893000	Also, I will say this randomly, I played Pinball FX 2 this week on Steam
1893000	1896000	because there is a Humble Bundle right now
1896000	1899000	where you can get a ton of tables in the Humble Bundle,
1899000	1901000	and I was like, eh, why not?
1901000	1903000	I haven't played Pinball FX in a while,
1903000	1906000	but I picked up a bunch of tables through the Humble Bundle
1906000	1909000	and played that on Steam, and that was fun.
1909000	1911000	So there you go.
1911000	1913000	That was my gaming week.
1913000	1915000	So moving into housekeeping real fast.
1915000	1917000	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1917000	1921000	We are also on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1921000	1926000	And Google Plus, Google.com slash Plus, Orange Lounge Radio.
1926000	1931000	There will be no show here in studio April 3rd.
1931000	1933000	I know that's a very random day to be taking off,
1933000	1936000	but Alan and I are making a very random trip out of town,
1936000	1938000	so we will not be here.
1938000	1940000	Unfortunately, I tried to get a flight
1940000	1942000	that would still have us able to do the show,
1942000	1945000	and it was like $300 more when you consider there's two of us.
1945000	1948000	So I was like, all right, I love the show,
1948000	1952000	but do I love the show $300?
1952000	1954000	So yeah, we're not going to be back in time outside.
1954000	1957000	Plus it gives me a little more time on our trip,
1957000	1963000	so there will be no show on Sunday, April 3rd.
1963000	1966000	What's really exciting, though, not long after that.
1966000	1970000	See, here's the thing is that, okay, you don't get a show on the 3rd,
1970000	1973000	but you will get a lot of us the next weekend
1973000	1975000	because we will have a show on Sunday the 10th,
1975000	1980000	and on Saturday the 9th, SAC Indie Arcade is back.
1980000	1982000	Remember we did that last year?
1982000	1985000	I'm hoping we can get the folks from SAC IGDA back on the show
1985000	1987000	before the end of the month to talk about it,
1987000	1990000	but SAC IGDA is happening again on April 9th.
1990000	1993000	I do not know yet if we will have a live broadcast this year.
1993000	1996000	You may remember last year we had some issues with the Wi-Fi,
1996000	1999000	and this year they're looking at doing some video live streaming,
1999000	2001000	so we may unfortunately not be able to do that,
2001000	2005000	but we do want to figure out what we can do in some capacity,
2005000	2006000	so stay tuned.
2006000	2009000	We're still working out those details, and we'll have more for you.
2009000	2010000	Hopefully we can't.
2010000	2011000	Live stream is not off the table.
2011000	2013000	We may have a way that we can still do it,
2013000	2017000	so if that works out where we feel relatively secure
2017000	2019000	that we're not going to have a ton of dropouts,
2019000	2022000	we'll do a live stream on April 9th,
2022000	2023000	so more information to come on that.
2023000	2027000	So for what it's worth, okay, you lose a well on April 3rd,
2027000	2029000	but you're going to have a lot more stuff that weekend,
2029000	2032000	which will be very exciting, and more indie games,
2032000	2034000	which is always cool, from local people.
2034000	2036000	And just think, on the 17th,
2036000	2039000	we get to see if I really am still hangover resistant.
2039000	2041000	April's a busy month.
2041000	2045000	I know, because my birthday party, and then my birthday.
2045000	2048000	Yeah, that's a busy month, April.
2048000	2050000	I'm just probably going to be drinking so much the night before
2050000	2051000	I'm going to walk in drunk.
2051000	2053000	Dan will have to drop me off.
2053000	2058000	Well, that'll be a fun show guaranteed, so stay tuned for that.
2058000	2062000	All right, let's see, over at live.vognetwork.com,
2062000	2064000	Bobby Blackwell says, new vog videos.
2064000	2069000	Maybe if I can get my camera person to come visit and do that,
2069000	2070000	that would be fantastic.
2070000	2076000	Let's see, s2100matt also points out April 3rd is wrestling mania.
2076000	2077000	Oh, well, shit.
2077000	2081000	I wouldn't want to go up against that anyway, so what the hell.
2081000	2083000	But I'm not going out of town for WrestleMania.
2083000	2087000	Where are they even having WrestleMania this year?
2087000	2088000	I don't even know.
2088000	2090000	I'm sure somebody in chat knows anyway.
2090000	2096000	BobbyBlackWolf in chat wants also to point out that the vog videos
2096000	2098000	that we talked about briefly last week,
2098000	2101000	we saw some of the videos from MAGFest last week,
2101000	2103000	but now they're all up.
2103000	2105000	So if you did miss our video coverage of MAGFest,
2105000	2108000	just go to vognetwork.com, and it's right there on the front page,
2108000	2109000	a little splash.
2109000	2111000	I think you see a picture of me and YYR.
2111000	2114000	Just click on that, and you can actually see all the videos from MAGFest.
2114000	2120000	So speaking of indie games, we talked to four indie games developers
2120000	2122000	and one charity.
2122000	2124000	So check that out over at vognetwork.com
2124000	2126000	if you haven't seen those videos yet.
2127000	2130000	All right, I think we're ready to get back into some gaming news.
2130000	2131000	Let's do it.
2131000	2135000	Loki, start us off.
2135000	2137000	You had to get situated on the Wi-Fi.
2137000	2138000	You all good?
2138000	2139000	Yes, I'm all good.
2139000	2141000	I was trying to sideload stuff now,
2141000	2144000	because all the cool stuff is sideloaded, of course.
2144000	2145000	Of course.
2145000	2146000	That's how it works.
2146000	2148000	Anyways, speaking of cool stuff, No Man's Sky,
2148000	2150000	I've been looking forward to that for a while.
2150000	2152000	They finally announced the date that's going to be released,
2152000	2154000	which is on June 21st.
2154000	2157000	The other thing they announced was the price, which was $60.
2157000	2159000	It will be a full-price retail game,
2159000	2162000	and they also are going to have a collector's edition.
2162000	2165000	They'll be coming to consoles, including a comic steelbook case
2165000	2169000	and other digital items and a theme for the PlayStation 4.
2169000	2174000	And then an epic edition that's $150 limited from I Am 8-Bit,
2174000	2178000	which includes a statue of the ship and that kind of shit.
2181000	2183000	I don't know. $60 for the game.
2183000	2185000	It looks like it could be worth it. I hope it is.
2185000	2187000	So, I'm looking forward to it.
2189000	2190000	I know people are like,
2190000	2192000	Indie game? $60?
2192000	2194000	I don't care who makes the game.
2194000	2197000	If the content justifies the price, that's really all it comes down to.
2197000	2198000	Who gives a shit who makes it?
2198000	2202000	I don't understand the argument against the price tag, either.
2202000	2204000	I mean, if you don't like it, don't buy it.
2204000	2207000	It's funny, because I sit here and say,
2207000	2209000	I don't understand the argument against the price tag,
2209000	2211000	yet at the same time, just last week, I said,
2211000	2213000	I'm not paying $60 for Street Fighter V.
2213000	2216000	I'm not dropping that money on Street Fighter V this week.
2216000	2218000	Maybe I'll wait for a little while.
2218000	2220000	I did the same thing with Mortal Kombat X, too.
2220000	2224000	I said, you know there's going to be a best-of-the-year edition.
2224000	2227000	It'll be either $60 but come with a lot more,
2227000	2229000	or there'll be a cheaper price or something.
2229000	2231000	And sure enough, what are we getting?
2231000	2234000	A new Mortal Kombat X is coming out pretty soon.
2234000	2236000	But as far as No Man's Sky goes,
2236000	2239000	as much as I was kind of razzing that game
2239000	2241000	because I didn't understand what the hell the point was,
2241000	2245000	because I kind of felt like they were showing the same trailer for two years,
2245000	2248000	I understand there's reasons for that,
2248000	2250000	that they didn't want to over-hype it
2250000	2255000	and promise things that they couldn't deliver on, which I can respect.
2255000	2258000	And I also understand they had that flood that set them back.
2258000	2260000	So I'm trying to cut them a little slack here.
2260000	2262000	And now that we're starting to learn more about the game
2262000	2264000	and just how vast it's going to be,
2264000	2266000	I'm like, okay, it really sounds like they're aiming for a game
2266000	2269000	that's going to have hundreds of hours of gameplay
2269000	2271000	and not charge you a monthly fee.
2271000	2274000	$60 seems reasonable.
2274000	2277000	When you look at an indie game like Journey,
2277000	2280000	paying $60 for Journey,
2280000	2283000	I still kind of think that would have been worth it, honestly.
2283000	2285000	Journey is that effing good.
2285000	2289000	But Journey is also a game that you can beat in two hours.
2289000	2294000	So I don't think there's a lot of people crazy like me
2294000	2297000	that would sit here and say, yeah, $60 for Journey would have been totally...
2297000	2300000	Because Journey, at MAGFest,
2300000	2303000	we watch them play it start to finish in about 100 minutes
2303000	2306000	with the live soundtrack, which is an amazing experience.
2306000	2308000	Look how long this game has been in development
2308000	2311000	and look how vast of a world it is.
2311000	2316000	I look at Minecraft, how Minecraft is $30.
2316000	2320000	This may be more than that, but I'm hoping to get more time out of it.
2320000	2322000	I just hope it's not fucking boring.
2322000	2325000	I understand procedural generates sometimes can get kind of boring,
2325000	2328000	but it looks interesting.
2328000	2331000	My interest has peaked.
2331000	2335000	There's been $60 games that have not been worth my time.
2335000	2337000	I don't know. I'm worth it.
2337000	2339000	Or I think it's worth it.
2339000	2342000	ActDeft in chat says, it's all in the eye of the beholder.
2342000	2343000	That's true.
2343000	2344000	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
2344000	2349000	indie has become synonymous with retro-styled or nostalgia bait,
2349000	2352000	which generally commands a lower price point.
2352000	2355000	If an indie can make a sweeping 50-hour epic,
2355000	2358000	then they should be able to charge for it.
2358000	2360000	Alex P. Carson in chat says,
2360000	2362000	I gave Journey so much shit at first,
2362000	2364000	but then changed my tone real quick.
2364000	2367000	I wonder if some of these skeptics may change their tone real quick too,
2367000	2369000	if they actually kind of play the game and go,
2369000	2374000	okay, this feels like a game a AAA studio would have made.
2374000	2376000	What does that even fucking mean?
2376000	2377000	I don't know.
2377000	2382000	Because, admittedly, I have no idea what the hell I'm saying right now.
2382000	2386000	Because, you know, look at movies.
2386000	2391000	Big budget, dumb, fun movies can be really great.
2391000	2393000	Like the Marvel universe, right?
2393000	2396000	Those are all pretty much AAA budget movies,
2396000	2398000	but I think most would agree,
2398000	2400000	all the Marvel movies have been pretty effing good,
2400000	2402000	and they're a lot of fun, and they're good popcorn flicks, right?
2402000	2404000	Maybe one or two aside.
2404000	2405000	But for the most part,
2405000	2407000	everybody's losing their shit over Deadpool,
2407000	2408000	which I still haven't seen.
2408000	2410000	Guardians of the Galaxy, everybody loved.
2410000	2415000	But at the same time, there's also indie movies, right?
2415000	2417000	That are made for a lot less money,
2417000	2420000	that also, you know, they still charge you the same price as the theater.
2420000	2422000	It's, you know, I don't know.
2422000	2427000	So it's like, who says an indie can't make the same game a AAA developer can?
2427000	2432000	It's just, I think what the real difference comes down to is,
2432000	2435000	what's an indie game and what's a AAA game?
2435000	2440000	In part, it's just in the eyes of, you know, whoever's making the call.
2440000	2444000	I think it depends on the studio that's putting it out, I think,
2444000	2446000	which is kind of what it is in movies,
2446000	2449000	is that, oh, well, if it's a Warner Brothers or a 20th Century Fox movie,
2449000	2451000	then that's a big studio film.
2451000	2454000	But if it's a small indie developer,
2454000	2458000	even though most of those indie studios are owned by the big ones,
2458000	2462000	like what, Miramax was just a Disney thing, right?
2462000	2465000	Miramax was all those movies back in the day.
2465000	2468000	So anyway, this is interesting.
2468000	2472000	Let's see, Tiger Claw in chat says,
2472000	2475000	No Man's Sky has said to love a lot of planets.
2475000	2477000	I think that's supposed to be have a lot of planets and such,
2477000	2479000	but is it procedurally generated worlds?
2479000	2482000	Will they be different enough that you won't start seeing some of the same creatures
2482000	2484000	and planetary environments being recycled?
2485000	2488000	Oh, I'm sure that stuff will be recycled.
2488000	2493000	But the question is, how much variety will there be?
2493000	2496000	How many different combinations are there to make it feel, you know,
2496000	2498000	a little different?
2498000	2504000	And, you know, will there be certain planets that end up being generated
2504000	2507000	in just the right way that they become must-see planets?
2507000	2509000	Like, doesn't that happen in Minecraft where, like,
2509000	2511000	there's probably certain seeds out there where people are like,
2511000	2513000	oh, you got to try this seed because it does something really funny?
2513000	2515000	But I don't know if you're going to be able to jump to planets like that.
2515000	2520000	I think it's just you get randomly dumped into the universe and good luck.
2522000	2524000	I'm really interested to see how this works out.
2524000	2528000	So anyhow, let's move on and talk about Rock Band 4.
2528000	2534000	Rock Band 4 going to be potentially launching on the PC,
2534000	2539000	targeting a release in fall of 2016 on Steam.
2539000	2545000	The PC version of Rock Band 4 is being, I keep wanting to say Kickstarted,
2545000	2548000	but it's not Kickstarter. It's another website called Fig.
2548000	2549000	Crowdfunded.
2549000	2550000	Crowdfunded, thank you.
2550000	2553000	It's starting to be that thing where I say Kickstarter,
2553000	2556000	like we say we're going to make a Xerox instead of we're going to make a copy, right?
2556000	2558000	So got to be careful.
2558000	2563000	Anyway, so it's going to be crowdfunded on a site called Fig,
2563000	2566000	although isn't Fig's big thing the whole fact that you're actually an investor?
2566000	2567000	So it's not really crowdfunded here.
2567000	2568000	Yeah, you are an investor.
2568000	2573000	And it also happens to be founded by one of the people at Harmonix, ironically enough.
2573000	2576000	But this is also double-finded a game there recently, right?
2576000	2579000	And the Jay and Silent Bob game that we brought up last week was on there too.
2579000	2582000	So Fig's got a few of these games.
2582000	2586000	But anyway, Rock Band 4, it is being launched on Fig,
2586000	2592000	and they are going to have World Tour campaign mode, freestyle guitar solos,
2592000	2596000	65 songs out of the box, 33 additional songs for backers on Fig,
2596000	2600000	1700 additional playable songs through DLC.
2600000	2605000	They're talking about that it's going to support a lot of the different instruments
2605000	2608000	that are already out there through adapters and so forth.
2608000	2612000	$1.5 million they have to raise in 35 days.
2612000	2619000	And so far towards their $1.5 million goal in the first five days,
2619000	2623000	they've hit $350,000 about.
2623000	2629000	So they're 23% of their goal when they're about a seventh of the way through the campaign.
2629000	2631000	So, you know, it's pretty good.
2631000	2635000	But you tend to make the most of the money at the beginning and at the end.
2635000	2637000	So we'll see what happens for them.
2637000	2639000	Here's the thing.
2639000	2644000	I'm going to say it, and I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking it,
2644000	2646000	but I got to say it.
2646000	2650000	Rock Band 4 doesn't feel finished on consoles.
2651000	2655000	And so for me, this is a little early to be asking for this.
2655000	2659000	And sorry, I know a lot of you love harmonics dearly.
2659000	2661000	I do too.
2661000	2665000	But I have to be honest and you all know how I feel about Rock Band 4
2665000	2669000	because the same way a lot of you guys feel is that Rock Band 4 was kind of a step down from Rock Band 3.
2669000	2673000	Now I understand and part of the whole like justification they've been talking about this or whatever
2673000	2676000	is that it's not really harmonics doing this port.
2676000	2679000	Like they're going to be using somebody else to do the port.
2679000	2681000	Well that's always worked out well.
2683000	2686000	That's not really encouraging me, I'm sorry to say.
2686000	2692000	And that's to get people to realize that harmonics is not shifting resources to work on PC
2692000	2695000	when console is not still done or whatever.
2695000	2700000	It's just that these new guys are going to work on it while they continue to work on the console versions.
2700000	2705000	And I'm still kind of like, I'm sorry, I'm not convinced.
2705000	2711000	I feel like such an asshole, but it's just the reality.
2711000	2715000	I feel let down by amplitude and I feel let down by Rock Band 4.
2715000	2719000	I don't want to compare them to Konami, but it's like...
2719000	2722000	Don't go to that extreme!
2722000	2732000	Let's just say harmonics of now is not the harmonics of Rock Band 1 or 2 when that came out.
2732000	2735000	It's not the same, it's just not...
2735000	2738000	I don't know, the quality isn't quite there.
2738000	2745000	They thought that by name alone they would be able to be a success again and it just wasn't happening.
2745000	2750000	Yeah, and bonds006 in chat says, Rob is like, sorry, not sorry.
2750000	2754000	My honest feeling, I'm allowed to have feelings.
2754000	2759000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, hey at least Rock Band 4 is better than Rock Revolution, come on now.
2759000	2763000	Yeah, that's a good point. The Konami thing was way harsh, Loki. Very, very harsh.
2763000	2766000	No, Rock Revolution was shit. That was absolute shit.
2766000	2771000	Especially coming from a company that did develop their own music games. Come on.
2771000	2777000	Again, just blows my mind. You could have just, I don't know, given us Guitar Freaks.
2777000	2784000	Exactly, they could have just put out Guitar Freaks and put some US songs in there as well and done.
2784000	2788000	We're beating a horse that's been dead for like ten years.
2788000	2794000	We need to stop, but it's just the struggle of the music gaming fan for years and years and years.
2794000	2806000	But anyway, with this harmonic saying, look, I have a problem saying, sure I'm going to give you money to sit on for a long time while you make Rock Band 4 PC.
2806000	2811000	I just have a problem doing that when I don't believe Rock Band 4 was the game we were promised.
2811000	2816000	And so, no, I'm not going to give you money to continue it on PC.
2816000	2822000	And you can talk about this whole thing where it's like, but the developers are going to be different people and so forth all you want.
2822000	2828000	I'm sorry, I'm not investing more money in this game until we were given the game we were promised.
2828000	2834000	And that would be a game that was better than Rock Band 3, which it's not. Sorry. Not sorry.
2835000	2842000	Anyhow, all right, we need to change the topic, Dark Sakura. We need we need puppies and sunshine and rainbows. Can you deliver?
2842000	2843000	Nope.
2843000	2844000	Damn it.
2844000	2848000	I can deliver some ass hattery.
2848000	2855000	So basically, and we had even talked about this before about developers paying for reviews, right?
2855000	2870000	Well, a group called PC Games N did a big investigation on some people who are using Fiverr.com to sell Steam reviews to developers.
2870000	2880000	And they said they found they basically were looking for anything that had more than two positive reviews from Fiverr.com reviewers.
2880000	2889000	And the two that they've discounted because they're already really popular were Super Hexagon and Counter Strike Global Offensive.
2889000	2893000	But more, there's actually a list of games that fall into those.
2893000	2896000	So if you look at the reviews, consider the source.
2896000	2899000	But you ready for this list?
2899000	2908000	We have Advert City, Apocalypse Hotel, A ReWorld, Blood of Magic, Cat Simulator, which now I just want to look for that by name alone.
2908000	2918000	Sentari Sector, D3D Gear, Egyptian Senate, Epic Character Generator, Epic Showdown, Garfield Kart.
2918000	2920000	That just sounds not good.
2920000	2931000	Gods vs. Humans, Home Design 3D, Hospital Manager, Moto Racer Collection, Nostradamus The Last Prophecy, Prehistoric with a K, and Ship Lord.
2931000	2934000	So I'm going to be honest, most of these are games I've never heard of.
2934000	2937000	I've heard of Cat Simulator. It's garbage.
2938000	2942000	So, I'm sorry, I think I missed a portion.
2942000	2948000	So they were able to prove that these games had two or more reviews that came from the Fiverr source?
2948000	2952000	Yeah, and basically they even went and contacted the reviewers. Like, yeah, we were paid to do it.
2954000	2957000	Well, I kind of think legally they have to say that, don't they?
2957000	2958000	Yeah.
2958000	2960000	Wasn't there a whole, didn't, like...
2960000	2962000	But they didn't say it in the reviews.
2962000	2963000	Of course they did.
2963000	2968000	They were contracted, sorry, contacted by the PC Games N.
2968000	2973000	It's not so much official, it's just a Steam review. It's not like, it's supposed to be like a personal review.
2973000	2977000	But the better numbers you can look by rating.
2977000	2981000	Yeah, yeah, and I kind of see that end of it, especially when I just confessed.
2981000	2988000	I don't know any of these games, except the Cat Simulator, because inevitably the gaming blogs were like, LOL cats.
2988000	2998000	But for these games, I've not heard of them, so this whole thing was to bust up the rating so that, you know, you would see it there.
2998000	3004000	And it's, I don't know, like, that would be, I guess, similar to if I went on Fiverr and said,
3004000	3008000	if you rate OLR five stars on iTunes, I'll give you five bucks.
3008000	3013000	Which, I don't have that kind of money for the types of reviews we would need to be up there.
3013000	3016000	Those are the companies, but I don't know, I just feel weird about it.
3016000	3020000	A five star review means so much more when it's genuine. Does that make sense?
3020000	3027000	Like, when somebody wrote one because they wanted to, it's like, I don't know, I just, I wouldn't do that.
3027000	3031000	Okay, so here's what it was, is that basically the person did a quote, undercover thing.
3031000	3034000	Because I'm checking out their article more in depth.
3034000	3039000	The person says, hi, hope you're well, I'm interested in having you review a Steam game for me.
3039000	3044000	Could you fire over a few previous examples of your work? I have a Steam code, blah, blah, blah.
3044000	3050000	So, the person sends back 20 different games that they've reviewed for previous work.
3050000	3053000	And then all of them were for pay.
3056000	3063000	There's probably sites out there that will offer to write positive reviews on Steam for a set amount of money.
3063000	3065000	For five bucks a pop.
3065000	3067000	Yeah, well, Amazon had a huge issue with this.
3067000	3072000	I thought I heard something recently that Amazon actually, like, sued some of these companies.
3072000	3076000	I don't know if it was the reviewers or the companies that would pay the reviewers.
3076000	3080000	I apologize, I didn't read up on it beforehand, but I just remember hearing something about that with Amazon.
3080000	3084000	Here's the other thing, thanks for sending over the samples, would a review be possible?
3084000	3087000	The reply was, it's unspoken, but yes.
3087000	3090000	Huh. Interesting.
3090000	3097000	Well, I mean, that just goes to show, you gotta question some of those reviews, unfortunately, on Steam.
3097000	3101000	And one person said that he would do an honest review of the 13 that he contacted.
3102000	3107000	All right. Well, let's move on. More news. Loki.
3107000	3109000	All right, cool.
3109000	3113000	Yeah, and like I said, that cat singularium, terrible.
3113000	3117000	And I'm sure a lot of the, I can't speak with the rest of them, but I'm sure the rest are not very good.
3117000	3122000	Anyways, Microsoft, I don't know what they're doing, to be honest.
3122000	3128000	I mean, their new stance is that they may be introducing modular hardware and different add-ons,
3128000	3137000	basically saying that they're gonna come out with new hardware capabilities during a generation,
3137000	3140000	allowing the same games to run backwards and forwards compatible,
3140000	3146000	and they're gonna have the Universal Windows applications running on top of the Universal Windows platform.
3146000	3154000	And I'm not really sure what exactly that means, and to be honest, I don't know.
3154000	3157000	It just seems like fragmentation's gonna happen with that.
3157000	3167000	I don't know how you can do that on a console platform where you have hardware that runs better than the current hardware you have.
3167000	3171000	Is it just not gonna run with as many bells and whistles as the other stuff?
3171000	3174000	It just seems kind of weird that they would do that.
3174000	3179000	Although Microsoft is one to include a lot of add-ons for their systems,
3179000	3184000	hence the HD DVD player and all the other crap that they add to it.
3184000	3188000	So I just don't know.
3188000	3193000	I like the idea of adding, if you want to upgrade my hard drive,
3193000	3199000	Microsoft haven't really allowed us to do that, except for your proprietary shit.
3199000	3201000	Sure, yeah, that makes sense.
3201000	3202000	That's kind of cool.
3202000	3205000	I wouldn't even be cool with upgrading RAM and stuff like that,
3205000	3209000	but then again, once again, you have the fragmentation problem with that.
3209000	3217000	It's gonna get complicated now as a consumer because you have an Xbox One or whatever it may be,
3217000	3225000	and now you should never be at a point in a retail location where you go,
3225000	3227000	well, is this gonna run on my game system?
3227000	3232000	Yeah, that's the whole reason we get consoles is so that we don't have to ask that question.
3232000	3234000	So that is very strange.
3234000	3239000	And I guess if you think about it, we have been kind of in that position a few times already,
3239000	3243000	like with Nintendo 64 having the RAM cart in there.
3243000	3246000	It's like, oh, this doesn't run without that.
3246000	3249000	Or the whole, I didn't even get into this in the kickoff topic,
3249000	3254000	but the whole Super Nintendo games are only playable on the new 3DS that came out of Nintendo's Direct,
3254000	3256000	which kind of...
3256000	3258000	I think that that's stupid.
3258000	3261000	I think that they should just open it up and have some games,
3261000	3263000	sorry, these games are too processor intensive.
3263000	3265000	They can only run on the new 3DS.
3265000	3267000	The rest of these, we'll offer them to you.
3267000	3270000	If it runs fine on the system, I don't see why they locked it out.
3270000	3273000	I know why they're locking out because they can sell some more fucking systems.
3273000	3278000	Well, I got into some Twitter discussions about this because it blew my mind.
3278000	3281000	I was like, wait a minute, I have the Game Boy Advance Ambassador games.
3281000	3287000	So you're telling me Mario Kart on GBA is more intensive than Mario Kart on Super Nintendo?
3287000	3289000	That just blew my mind.
3289000	3292000	But some people were trying to tell me the technical lens of things,
3292000	3293000	so I'm like, okay, whatever.
3293000	3296000	I guess there's just more to it that my feeble mind doesn't understand or whatever.
3296000	3301000	But I just wasn't understanding why can it do Game Boy Advance games but not Super Nintendo games.
3301000	3305000	But it sounds like a lot of those Game Boy Advance games,
3305000	3309000	they really had to tailor it one at a time to make them work.
3309000	3316000	But then I'm like, okay, if they're not doing that now for virtual console games that they release,
3316000	3321000	where they're tailoring them one at a time, then they're coming out too fucking slow.
3321000	3328000	Virtual console, I'm starting to hit my over it point with it.
3328000	3335000	I only really get excited about virtual console now when it's big things we've never seen, like Earthbound.
3335000	3343000	Or if they were to say, we're going to put out Second Detsetsu 3, an English version, on virtual console,
3343000	3347000	I'd be like, fuck yes, I'm rubbing my wallet on the screen right now, where's my game?
3347000	3351000	Some of those types of things where it's like, okay, these long lost things we're finally going to bring out,
3351000	3359000	I am so about that. But do I need pilot wings on my DS when I already had it on the Wii and the Wii U?
3359000	3365000	Nah. What are they doing? What's going to make it worth it?
3365000	3372000	I'm going to need a little something more at a virtual console to justify to buy that thing again.
3372000	3374000	Does that make sense?
3374000	3375000	No, that makes sense.
3375000	3378000	I need online play. I need leaderboards. I need something.
3378000	3382000	Now, to be fair, maybe we're going to see that in NX.
3382000	3385000	And you might see a little clue about that.
3385000	3393000	And again, the last virtual console thing that I think was kind of exciting was the fact that Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow,
3393000	3401000	in its virtual console release, will use the Pokemon Bank to let you move those Pokemon to Sun and Moon.
3401000	3405000	There you go. That is exciting virtual console news.
3405000	3412000	To me, that news? More exciting than the Super Nintendo games on 3DS.
3412000	3419000	I realize some of you that have the big commutes and rely more on portable gaming are totally going to disagree with me, and that's cool.
3419000	3425000	Here's my thing. I was just confirming this because I thought I could do this before.
3425000	3434000	Mario Kart emulated perfectly on a PSP. Are you saying that the 3DS is not more powerful than a PSP?
3434000	3442000	I mean, that's what I'm saying. Isn't that hardware much newer and should be running much more smoothly, I would think.
3442000	3449000	And you can't run that? Hell, I just don't get it. I don't get how that's possible.
3450000	3453000	Looking at some comments through chat over at live.vognoteboard.com, AlphaKnanogram says,
3453000	3460000	The Game Boy Advance Ambassador games turned off all the 3DS features like StreetPass. I'm okay with that.
3460000	3471000	And here's the other thing, too. I understand. Let's say, hypothetically, Nintendo's tried and they can't get an emulator to run the game just fine.
3471000	3477000	I bet you, you can get one of these people that make the fucking homebrew emulators if you gave them full access to the fucking...
3477000	3482000	Because they're doing this in emulation mode with the Nintendo DS and that type of shit.
3482000	3488000	If you give them full access to the 3DS hardware as far as being able to use the full processor power and everything,
3488000	3493000	I bet you can get a fucking emulator running that would run all those games. You just don't want to do that.
3493000	3498000	You don't want to spend the time and effort to do that because you're just not going to make up enough money in the end.
3498000	3504000	I guess you would make up quite a bit of money since you're fucking selling the games every fucking platform that you put it out on.
3504000	3510000	Here's the thing, and I'm going to end it with it because we got way apart from the original story about Microsoft,
3510000	3513000	but I guess these stories aren't as far apart as they might seem.
3513000	3518000	But my whole thing with the Nintendo games is that...
3520000	3528000	Am I getting mad about it just to get mad? Because would I really be buying these games again on the 3DS? No.
3528000	3537000	So it really just boils down to this thing of, eh, I don't care. I don't get it, but okay, they can't do it, whatever. Am I going to get mad about it? No.
3537000	3544000	Because I was not going to buy Pilotwings or even Earthbound yet again on the 3DS. I wasn't going to do it.
3544000	3552000	Here's my thing. I think it's not necessarily because it's locked to that one system or that I have to rebuy them.
3552000	3560000	It's just that, come on, we're in 2016 and you still have to figure out a way to have cross-platform buys on your fucking platform?
3560000	3567000	I mean, you haven't figured that out yet? Something that has been available on the PlayStation 3 for years now?
3567000	3578000	I mean, on the Xbox? I mean, come on Nintendo, shit, man. This is fucking standard shit you should have on your platform.
3579000	3584000	Let me take this back to the Xbox story for a minute here, because we were talking about the whole modular Xbox and all this.
3584000	3588000	And we were talking about this a little bit with Bobby on his show at the end of the show.
3588000	3596000	And I mentioned, well, doesn't Nintendo kind of do the modular thing too? They're just way better about how they do it?
3596000	3597000	No, they're not.
3598000	3606000	I disagree, but how often do we sit here and go, haha, the Wii is just two Gamecubes stuck together.
3606000	3612000	I mean, in a way, it was a modular upgrade, but it brought the whole motion control thing.
3612000	3616000	That was a little different, the fact that the motion control in Wii Sports was revolutionary and all that.
3616000	3623000	And then the Wii U is kind of like, oh, and you've even heard this expression before, it's a souped up Wii.
3623000	3626000	It's a Wii with a little more infinite, and now it's the tablet thing.
3626000	3632000	So I kind of would argue that Nintendo does the modular thing already, and they do it very well.
3632000	3638000	I wouldn't say no. I wouldn't even compare the Wii. Let's look at the DS, the 3DS, the DSi.
3638000	3643000	That is the fucking modular bullshit, because those were updates that were necessary.
3643000	3648000	I mean, the 3DS, I understand the gimmick was, hey, it's 3D graphics and stuff, and that was pretty cool.
3648000	3655000	And then they're like, ah, fuck it, we're just, eh, 3D, no one wants to see that, you know, whatever, we're just not going to support it very well.
3655000	3664000	But the DSi was not fucking necessary, but they did it anyways because there's certain games that only run on the DSi and that kind of stuff, which is stupid.
3664000	3667000	And trying to explain that the consumers was dumb.
3667000	3676000	And the 3DS, yeah, the same thing now with the new 3DS, which that stupid little thumb-nub thing, which is fucking terrible, but whatever, they put it out.
3676000	3685000	And it runs games slightly better, I guess. I don't really see a justification to it, especially when they're like, oh yeah, we have a new platform coming out.
3685000	3691000	It's like, well, you can't just announce something or put something out and announce, oh, we've got something else coming out too.
3691000	3697000	I understand they kind of do that in the mobile space and stuff like that with phones, and is that what Microsoft's trying to do?
3697000	3701000	Are they trying to fucking new Xbox One? I mean, that's going to be stupid.
3701000	3709000	Damn, you stole the point I was just about to make because I was going to say, you know, at the same time, to be fair to Microsoft, aren't we all used to this in the mobile space?
3709000	3716000	And it doesn't matter if you're Apple or Android or whatever, but generally, I'll use Apple because their naming conventions are very easy.
3716000	3723000	You know, there's iPhone 4, and then there was the iPhone 4s? 4 with a letter after it.
3723000	3724000	4s.
3724000	3727000	4s, thank you. And then there was a 5, and then there was the 5s.
3727000	3733000	And so, you know, for me, I'm like, okay, I don't need the new one every year.
3733000	3739000	I'll get the, you know, my cell phone's on a two-year, so I'll get the 4 and then skip it, get the 5, which I think is what most people do.
3739000	3743000	And even if you're on Android, you do something similar over there, right?
3743000	3746000	So I'm kind of like, you know, in a way, we're kind of used to that.
3746000	3755000	Whereas some techie people, you know what, they will get the 4 and the 4s and the 5 and shell out that, you know, extra money to offset the subsidy and so forth,
3755000	3759000	or sell it on the third market or whatever they do, to get the newest one every year.
3759000	3760000	And some people will do that. I don't.
3760000	3767000	That makes sense, I guess, if they're making a, you know, making profit off of each one of those devices that they're selling.
3767000	3773000	Although Microsoft, and I think this goes the same for most consoles, they're selling those at a loss.
3773000	3775000	So to do that doesn't make any goddamn sense.
3775000	3778000	But, I mean, what would be the point of that?
3779000	3786000	I mean, because you're, are we really utilizing the hardware fully to the, I mean, can we not do, is there something that we're not able to do because of that?
3786000	3790000	I mean, what exactly is the point of upgrading the hardware right now?
3790000	3794000	Oh, have we hit the cap of what you can do on the Xbox One?
3794000	3798000	Is this because, like, they were fucking lagging behind, like, multi-platform stuff?
3798000	3803000	Like, games on the PlayStation 4 run better than they do on the Xbox One, is that the problem?
3803000	3805000	Is that why we're doing this now?
3805000	3807000	I just don't understand, what is the point?
3807000	3809000	Show me why we're doing this.
3809000	3816000	Because that's the other thing, is you're going to have to sell people on, you need this upgrade because of this.
3817000	3819000	Because HoloLens won't work without it.
3820000	3821000	Just kidding, I'm kidding.
3821000	3822000	Alright.
3822000	3825000	I mean, that's the reasoning.
3825000	3828000	Justify your reasoning, that's all I'm saying.
3828000	3834000	I have a feeling this conversation will continue, perhaps after E3, or perhaps the email we're going to get this week, but we'll see.
3835000	3838000	We're going to move on, though, for time. I've got to move on to the next story.
3838000	3842000	Oh, I was going to also say that they're continuing on backwards compatibility as well.
3842000	3844000	That's going to be a focus for them.
3844000	3845000	Good.
3845000	3846000	Which I think is great.
3846000	3855000	I enjoy opening up my Xbox One, then I go into my library, and then, like, oh, a random-ass arcade game I bought ten years ago is coming up in my library.
3855000	3856000	Yeah, I think that's fucking amazing.
3856000	3857000	It's cool.
3857000	3858000	Sony, hello?
3858000	3861000	Fucking dude, I've got a ton of fucking games on PlayStation 3.
3861000	3864000	I would love to be able to do this without fucking PlayStation Now.
3864000	3868000	Loki had kicked every other gaming company and then realized he left Sony out.
3868000	3869000	I mean, seriously, it's...
3869000	3871000	I got some for you too, asshole.
3871000	3872000	It is so fucking stupid.
3872000	3877000	Like, I'm, like, seriously, like, I got an email today because of that stupid class action lawsuit thing.
3877000	3884000	Because before I was like, I don't really want any more games because I've already gotten these from the last time they settled, but I'll take some more free games, whatever.
3884000	3889000	Like, sorry, you can't have any more PlayStation Plus time, but you can purchase one of these games.
3889000	3894000	I'm like, but then that means I have to hook up my PlayStation 3 to play this. I don't want to do that.
3894000	3901000	Loki, you've, in the scope of one news story, you have managed to hate on everybody. You've managed to do it.
3901000	3902000	And fuck Konami.
3906000	3910000	I have a feeling Dark Soccer is just sitting over there going, I can't. I'm just...
3911000	3914000	I'm taking a Neko Atsume quiz. I just stopped paying attention.
3915000	3921000	So, yeah, so I'm right. You can't. You can't. You're like, ah, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, how about cat butts?
3921000	3924000	Cat butts. Cat butts are the best butts.
3927000	3929000	I just kind of was like, the kitties.
3930000	3937000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Loki is all like, and Sega, don't think because you don't have a console, I don't have words for you too.
3939000	3942000	Seriously, what are you doing with Sonic? I mean, come on. That's just stupid.
3942000	3947000	Hey, Loki, you gonna check out Mario and Sonic Go to Rio? 2016 games?
3948000	3954000	Alright, no, no, no, no, seriously, stop, stop. No, I'm not saying... I think, honestly, they should do something.
3955000	3959000	The team up with Mario and Sonic is not a bad thing. I just think they should do something more than just...
3960000	3963000	If you want your Sonic franchise to do well, I think that's what you can do.
3963000	3970000	Team up with Mario in like a fucking RPG or something like that. That would be more, you know, beneficial, I think.
3970000	3973000	Or fuck, have Sonic and Mario Kart or something like that.
3974000	3980000	I got four words that can piss anyone off at Sega instantly. You ready? Four words.
3980000	3985000	Fantasy Star Online 2. Thank you. Done.
3985000	3993000	Alright, moving on. Let's get to a story about Nintendo.
3993000	3998000	But this one, Loki, I don't think can hate on this. It is a rumor, so we don't even know if this is true.
3998000	4005000	And it has to do with the game Beyond Good and Evil 2. Like, where did Beyond Good and Evil 2 go?
4005000	4011000	It was shown one year and then it disappeared and then the rumor was, eh, they're still kind of working on it.
4011000	4022000	Ubisoft does say the project has not been canned. But a rumor has just piped up that Nintendo may have pulled a Bayonetta 2
4022000	4028000	and gotten Beyond Good and Evil 2 as an NX exclusive in 2017.
4028000	4034000	Now, the source, because, you know, I could just, you know, literally write words down on a piece of paper and go,
4034000	4036000	look at this rumor that just arrived on my desk.
4036000	4043000	So, where they're trying to put a little stock in this rumor is that this comes from a dual pixels writer
4043000	4050000	who had recently published the NX hardware rumors that also, from the same guy that leaked Pokemon forms
4050000	4057000	and the Illumeroom project and all this stuff. So, it comes from that same library is that this is what's happened to this.
4057000	4063000	So, get your salt lick and your tinfoil hats and, you know, take that with this.
4063000	4070000	But this could be a very interesting turn of events, especially when, do we know how well Bayonetta 2 ended up doing?
4070000	4077000	I get the sense it didn't do that great, which is a tragedy because that game is outstanding.
4077000	4086000	But I think there were just so many people that were like, hmm, Bayonetta's not on Sony or Microsoft, Nintendo can suck it.
4086000	4094000	I don't know. Or maybe it just wasn't enough to pull that sort of audience over to Nintendo's platform
4094000	4097000	for those that still see Nintendo as a kiddie console or whatever.
4097000	4101000	But maybe Bayonetta 2 did better than I think.
4101000	4102000	No, I'm checking.
4102000	4104000	I have this weird feeling it didn't.
4104000	4108000	Let's see. Damn you. I have to wait five seconds.
4108000	4111000	But the NX is going to be another story, hopefully.
4111000	4116000	You know, I think the Wii U made its biggest mistake with the launch lineup.
4116000	4120000	Apparently, globally, they said it sold just under one million units.
4120000	4125000	So, and that's as of February 20th, or not February, yeah, February 20th.
4125000	4130000	And then North America, looks like 550,000.
4130000	4133000	Okay, that's not a bomb, but it's not like...
4133000	4134000	It's not great.
4134000	4136000	Run and make number three, yeah.
4136000	4140000	Which is kind of sad that half a million is okay.
4140000	4151000	Well, to give you a comparison of what 5.5 million, or not 5.5, 0.55 million, what that means.
4151000	4159000	For example, Disney Infinity sold 0.57 million, the original Disney Infinity.
4160000	4164000	Let's see here, and how about for Nintendo.
4164000	4167000	Let's see, a Nintendo first party game.
4167000	4170000	Wonderful 101 was 390,000.
4171000	4176000	Huh. Yeah, but Wonderful 101, I don't think they were, like, really didn't...
4176000	4179000	Yeah, I'm not surprised that Bayonetta sold better than 101.
4179000	4181000	It sold slightly better than Lego Jurassic World.
4181000	4182000	Wow. Okay.
4182000	4188000	I think it's just the platform. It's just very limited, like, with who has it.
4188000	4193000	Well, but NX is a way to kind of hit the reset button, lol.
4193000	4197000	It's kind of a way to do that, so, I mean, we'll see what happens.
4197000	4202000	Especially considering, you know, if this is an Ubisoft title coming over, it's kind of a big deal.
4202000	4208000	And I know we had joked about that, you know, they say Nintendo is in bed with one of the companies out there for NX,
4208000	4214000	and we kind of just assumed it was Square Enix through deduction, but maybe it's Ubisoft.
4215000	4216000	Hmm.
4216000	4218000	Zynga. It's totally Zynga.
4218000	4221000	I don't know, did you hear Zynga is selling that infamous Sega building?
4221000	4224000	They're leaving that building.
4224000	4227000	Yeah. Anyway, speaking of Sega.
4227000	4232000	Alright, anyhow, I will be very interested to see if that happens.
4232000	4238000	I would like to see Nintendo be able to really prove these solid third party partnerships,
4238000	4242000	and this seems to be a really good way to do it, but we'll see. We'll see what develops.
4242000	4245000	Moving on, Dark Sakura, please tell me you have some good news.
4245000	4247000	We need some good news that we can all celebrate.
4247000	4248000	Yes.
4248000	4249000	Yay! What are you going to talk about?
4249000	4259000	Well, MAME was always free and always available, but now it's actually available under an OSI compliance, an FSF approved license.
4259000	4271000	So, meaning that they, before they had a choice of three that people could code with, and now it's fully open.
4271000	4273000	So, yay, MAME.
4273000	4275000	MAME, of course, being the very popular-
4275000	4277000	Multi-arcade machine emulator.
4277000	4283000	Thank you very much. Which, you know, questionable legalities, shifty eyes, for some stuff.
4283000	4288000	But for other stuff, I mean, some of the classic 80s games, I've heard some of those developers say,
4288000	4295000	I like MAME because it allows these games to live on when the cabinets are long since dead.
4295000	4302000	And some of those original authors have released their programs into the public domain, essentially, to kind of live on.
4302000	4305000	So, I think MAME has done a lot of great stuff for gaming in that regard.
4305000	4314000	So, that's cool that, you know, it's a little more open now and everybody can kind of jump in there and use it.
4314000	4317000	Is the source still open? I know it used to be.
4317000	4319000	The source is open.
4320000	4325000	I was surprised that they had a little footnote on there that, I'm sorry, the name is trademarked, though.
4325000	4328000	So, you gotta, you know, get permission to use the name.
4328000	4332000	Which, I'm surprised that they were able to trademark that.
4332000	4336000	Sure, well, anything can have a trademark on it, really.
4336000	4341000	Yeah, I understand that, but I thought that was one of the things, like, there was in there a big, like, thing, you know,
4341000	4345000	if everyone was in a big huff about, oh my god, someone's trying to trademark MAME, you know?
4345000	4350000	And then, here it's been done. I guess they just kind of slipped it under the radar there.
4353000	4355000	Is it only for certain things, though?
4355000	4356000	I don't know.
4356000	4359000	Because sometimes they do trademarks, but it's only for certain things, anyway.
4361000	4367000	Moving on. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are coming to a living room near you soon.
4367000	4369000	Loki, starting in the US.
4370000	4376000	So, this week we've got The Division coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
4376000	4383000	And also the Hitman, the new Hitman game.
4383000	4388000	They've got, you know, a few different ways you can purchase the first intro pack or whatever.
4388000	4392000	Because, remember, it's episodic now. Thank you, Square Enix.
4392000	4396000	That's gonna be coming out if you want the first episode for $14.99.
4396000	4399000	Otherwise, the full experience would be $60.
4399000	4404000	And, of course, the full experience, meaning that they'll eventually release those experiences later on.
4405000	4406000	Let's see.
4408000	4412000	And then, also this week...
4412000	4414000	Actually, I think that was it.
4414000	4415000	Nope, that is it.
4415000	4418000	So, that's those two games. Pretty light week.
4418000	4419000	Pretty light week.
4419000	4422000	Japan, I think it's a pretty light week over there as well.
4422000	4426000	Batman Arkham Knight Special Edition releases on PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.
4426000	4431000	Also, Summon Knight 6 Lost Borders comes out from Bandai Namco this week in Japan.
4431000	4435000	And Tom Clancy's The Division gets its Japanese release on March the 10th.
4435000	4438000	So, those are all out this week on PlayStation 4.
4438000	4440000	I believe the Wii U...
4440000	4445000	Yeah, the Zelda Twilight Princess HD thing we just got here will also be in Japan this week on March the 10th.
4445000	4447000	So, that's pretty cool.
4447000	4451000	And then going to the Vita, because we still have a lot of Vita stuff in Japan.
4451000	4455000	We also have Summon Knight 6 Lost Borders is out over there as well.
4455000	4459000	Kinero no Korda 4 is out in Japan in a regular Platinum and Treasure box,
4459000	4462000	because, you know, we love those collector's editions over in Japan.
4462000	4464000	Those are all out on March the 10th.
4464000	4470000	Also, Luminous Arc Infinity Complete Pack comes out as well on the Vita this week.
4470000	4473000	And then on the 3DS this week,
4473000	4476000	Metarot Girls, I don't know if that's Metarot or Metaro Girls,
4476000	4481000	Mission, Kabuto version, and Kuwagata version come out this week.
4481000	4484000	On the 3DS, there's your Japanese releases.
4484000	4486000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4486000	4488000	Wow, a few things, actually.
4488000	4492000	On the 8th, we have the Culling, the PC...
4492000	4493000	Wait, the PC.
4493000	4496000	I meant the Culling on PC.
4496000	4499000	The Division on everything else.
4499000	4504000	On the 6th, we have Tesla Grad on Xbox One on the 9th.
4504000	4509000	On the 10th, Death Smiles for PC, which I have the Xbox 360 version of.
4509000	4510000	That's pretty fun.
4510000	4512000	The Guest.
4512000	4515000	And then on the 11th, we have Hitman.
4515000	4519000	We have Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition.
4519000	4522000	Samurai Warriors 4 Empires.
4522000	4525000	Revolution, the 25th Anniversary Collection.
4525000	4528000	And WWE 2K16.
4528000	4529000	So there you go.
4538000	4540000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.
4540000	4543000	And then the classic game of the week.
4543000	4544000	But first, Loki.
4544000	4550000	So E3's got two more publishers that are not going to be there.
4550000	4552000	So Disney is not going to be there.
4552000	4556000	And I think the main reason for that is that they don't have another game coming out this year.
4556000	4559000	They were not going to release Disney Infinity 4.0.
4559000	4561000	They've just got more 3.0 content.
4561000	4566000	So they're going to be doing other shows or events throughout the year in other locations.
4566000	4573000	And then of course, also, I was going to say, Wargaming is not going to be there as well.
4573000	4580000	So both of those companies are not at E3.
4580000	4583000	I don't think they're normally there in a large presence anyways.
4583000	4588000	Because Disney, they've kind of narrowed it down to putting out one game a year.
4588000	4592000	But they do have other things coming out for Disney Infinity 3.0.
4592000	4594000	There's three more character packs.
4594000	4600000	And I want to say a Marvel Battlegrounds thing that's going to be coming out pretty soon.
4600000	4602000	I think in the next couple months.
4602000	4605000	So that'll be something to look forward to.
4605000	4608000	My son keeps bugging me to get him the Hulkbuster armor.
4608000	4610000	I'm like, you hardly play Disney Infinity.
4610000	4612000	I'm not going to buy you anymore figures.
4612000	4614000	But the Ant-Man one looks pretty cool, so I may have to get that.
4616000	4620000	Very interesting, all these companies that are just deciding to skip E3 this year.
4620000	4624000	I mean, that's now four, three big companies in one kind of big one.
4624000	4629000	Yeah, well Activision, they're going to be at E3, but they're not going to have a booth.
4629000	4631000	So they're going to be there for meetings.
4631000	4635000	And they're doing their thing, I think, wasn't it across the street or something like that?
4635000	4636000	That's EA.
4636000	4637000	That's EA, I'm sorry.
4637000	4642000	I can't keep track of all these different companies, not at E3, but slightly at E3.
4642000	4645000	So EA is doing the thing across the street.
4645000	4649000	Activision is something.
4649000	4651000	They're like, hey, we got Call of Duty.
4651000	4655000	And to be honest, even though they're not going to be E3, I'm sure they'll have Call of Duty.
4655000	4658000	It'll be a part of either Microsoft or Sony's presentation.
4658000	4659000	It always fucking is.
4661000	4664000	I'm really interested to see what E3 looks like this year.
4664000	4670000	I mean, I'm not going to be going to see firsthand, but I'm very curious to see how the dynamic of this E3 might be different.
4670000	4673000	I have a really interesting feeling it's going to be a different show this year.
4673000	4679000	But, I mean, as much as you can say, oh, doom, gloom for E3 and all that stuff,
4679000	4683000	Nintendo is inevitably going to be putting out a new console.
4683000	4686000	And that's going to be a huge draw at E3 this year.
4686000	4692000	You know the NX, whatever it is, that's going to be the huge line generator must-see thing at E3 this year.
4692000	4698000	And to be fair, probably one of the only things to line up for because nobody else will have a booth.
4700000	4706000	I don't know. I'm assuming Microsoft will bring HoloLens again for more people to try.
4706000	4712000	And who knows what Sony might have under their hat because VR will be out before E3, right?
4712000	4716000	Or no, we don't know. We'll find out much if we will or not.
4716000	4717000	Hopefully?
4717000	4719000	Yeah, we'll find out soon.
4720000	4725000	Yeah, I want PlayStation VR. I'm kind of holding some funds aside for that.
4725000	4729000	So, you know, hopefully that they have good games for it.
4730000	4734000	Alright, well, you know, since some of us are going to be saving money not going to E3 this year,
4734000	4739000	maybe we can start to plan a trip to Japan, especially by the year 2020.
4739000	4741000	Start saving now.
4741000	4743000	Why would you want to go to Japan in the year 2020?
4743000	4746000	Well, I mean, why not, you guys?
4746000	4748000	I want to go there eventually myself.
4748000	4756000	But here's the deal. Universal Studios Japan has said that they will be spending 40 billion yen on Nintendo attractions.
4756000	4759000	Remember the deal between Universal and Nintendo?
4759000	4761000	This is kind of the next step in that.
4761000	4764000	So Universal Studios Japan is going to be spending that money on Nintendo attractions.
4764000	4767000	They will be on the left side of the park's main gate.
4767000	4775000	So I'm assuming kind of like how Universal Studios Hollywood just got the Harry Potter Wizarding World thing,
4775000	4777000	which Florida's had for a couple years.
4777000	4780000	Then they just got that at Hollywood.
4780000	4786000	I'm assuming instead of Harry Potter World in Japan, this is what they're going to get instead of some type of Nintendo thing.
4786000	4788000	Which, fine by me.
4788000	4792000	Don't get me wrong, I like Harry Potter, but I really like Nintendo.
4792000	4793000	So this will be exciting.
4793000	4801000	The plan is to have the work done by 2020 in time for the Summer Olympics, which are also in Japan in the year 2020.
4801000	4806000	And they are saying it is about the same scale as the Harry Potter themed area.
4806000	4808000	Oh, I guess Japan. Does Japan have one?
4808000	4811000	The story indicates that it might already have one in Japan.
4811000	4813000	I don't know. I have not been to Universal Studios Japan.
4813000	4815000	But perhaps they have the Harry Potter World there too.
4815000	4817000	But this is going to be similar to that.
4817000	4823000	And Universal does have an agreement with Nintendo in a cooperative effort to expand business.
4823000	4825000	That's going to be pretty awesome.
4825000	4827000	Oh man, I'd love to go.
4827000	4832000	Oh, of course. Then I think about how old I am going to be when this opens up, but whatever.
4832000	4835000	You know, some things are timeless.
4835000	4839000	So, what do you say Dark Sakura? You want to go to Japan in the year 2020?
4839000	4842000	I actually am already saving up. So, for real.
4842000	4843000	Yeah?
4843000	4847000	Looking into all kinds of things because I actually have a big trip that I'd like to take around 2020.
4847000	4851000	Nice. Let's go. Let's go to Universal Studios Japan.
4851000	4853000	I want to go to Universal Studios now.
4853000	4855000	Akuma JP, we're crashing at your place, alright?
4856000	4858000	Actually, I may have crashed space already.
4858000	4859000	Oh, nice.
4859000	4860000	But...
4860000	4863000	No, we know a few people over there too. Even if not.
4863000	4866000	I have a list of things I want to do.
4866000	4869000	I want to go to a fighter's baseball game.
4869000	4873000	I want to go to Tokyo DisneySea.
4873000	4876000	Yes, I'd love to go to DisneySea.
4876000	4879000	And I want to go to Kyoto.
4879000	4882000	That's my list. That's it. That's my list.
4882000	4883000	Alright.
4883000	4887000	I just want to go, like, hang out in Kyoto for, like, a month.
4888000	4897000	Alright, well, instead of flashing the clock forward, I think it's time we go backward a little bit in a segment called the Classic Game of the Week.
4898000	4904000	Every week, here at Orange Nana's Radio Dark, Sakura steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks,
4904000	4915000	hey, listen, you kids and your holographic lenses and your cell phone VR and your technology, F that.
4915000	4919000	The classroom actually inspired me.
4919000	4920000	Oh, yeah?
4920000	4922000	Because of the discussion last week about it.
4922000	4926000	When I saw what you picked this week, I was like, didn't we talk about that recently?
4926000	4928000	We talked about it, but I've never picked it before.
4928000	4930000	Yeah, no, no. I, then I was like...
4930000	4934000	And every time I look at this game, it makes me think of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
4935000	4939000	Because they were playing this in the warehouse. Do you remember?
4939000	4941000	Yes. Yes, I do. I do.
4941000	4947000	And so because you finally listened to the chat room, this means that you finally picked Halo as your Classic Game of the Week, right?
4947000	4948000	No.
4948000	4951000	Alright. Then what is the Classic Game of the Week?
4951000	4952000	NARC.
4953000	4958000	So, yeah, NARC is the Classic Game of the Week. It came out in 1988.
4958000	4965000	And it was designed by Eugene Jarvis for Williams Electronics, programmed by George Petro.
4965000	4969000	And it is one of the first ultra-violent video games.
4969000	4977000	And it was also one of the first games that really got the parental backlash.
4978000	4986000	Basically, the point of the game was to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, defeat Mr. Big.
4986000	4996000	And it was the newly reborn Williams Electronics coin-op division after they were acquired by Midway.
4996000	5000000	So, NARC also did see a few ports.
5001000	5010000	The NES port was done by Rare in 1990. And then it was relaunched in 2005.
5010000	5024000	So, basically, you play as two characters, one of two characters, Hitman or Max Force, who got a memo from the Narcotics Opposition Chairman,
5025000	5030000	who sends them off on Project NARC so they can capture Mr. Big.
5030000	5033000	Big underground drug trafficking and terrorist.
5035000	5045000	So, basically, you go around and you shoot or arrest junkies, drug dealers, crime leaders, that type of thing.
5045000	5047000	They have an automatic weapon and a missile launcher.
5047000	5055000	Because, I mean, maybe it's prophetic, you know, now having a very militarized police force, you know.
5055000	5058000	NARC solved the future, apparently.
5058000	5072000	So, some enemies will surrender and then they will float away into the air with the word busted over them.
5073000	5081000	And you get a tally of how much you've confiscated in drugs and money every time an enemy is killed.
5081000	5092000	And when an enemy is killed, well, at least with the missile launcher, they explode into, like, bloody arms and legs and fire and stuff.
5093000	5107000	The game has a medium resolution monitor, which was higher than TVs and normal arcade monitors at the time, but in a smaller size.
5107000	5120000	And it also is the first arcade game that used the TMS-34010, which is a 32-bit processor for graphics.
5121000	5140000	As far as the many, many other versions of this, there was the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, there was, what else was on this?
5140000	5148000	In 1990, there was a NES version of NARC published by Acclaim and developed by Rare.
5148000	5153000	And it was, quote, the first video game with a strong anti-drug message.
5153000	5156000	It was also crap. Sorry.
5156000	5160000	But Nintendo actually forced all the drug references to be removed.
5160000	5162000	So, yeah.
5162000	5166000	This game is so anti-drug, we removed all the drugs.
5166000	5168000	Exactly.
5168000	5174000	It did retain most of the gore and the violent aspects of it.
5174000	5182000	And it also was really handicapped by the NES controller because the arcade version had four buttons.
5182000	5186000	You could still jump and shoot missiles.
5186000	5191000	Acclaim also did a NARC LCD game.
5191000	5193000	Like, why bother?
5194000	5202000	In the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2 had an emulated version of the arcade games.
5202000	5208000	But, like, the sound would drift out and there were some glitches in the game.
5208000	5217000	And it would cause a stage to end suddenly and go to the tally screen just because of how bad the emulation was.
5218000	5225000	And then in 2005, there was a relaunch of the game.
5225000	5232000	And that was an updated version for Xbox, PC, and PS2.
5232000	5238000	And there was a GameCube version that had been announced but was cancelled.
5238000	5240000	It had voice acting in this particular one.
5240000	5245000	It had Michael Madsen, Bill Bellamy, Ron Parleman.
5245000	5254000	A pretty nice soundtrack. It included Curtis Mayfield, Cypress Hill, Grandmaster Flash, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
5254000	5257000	A few indie artists as well.
5260000	5264000	Sorry, I forgot about the car sequences in this game. It was hilarious.
5266000	5270000	Just running over people with a car, backing over them.
5270000	5275000	Well, here's the other thing too. And this was kind of a controversy in the newer versions.
5275000	5284000	Is that after you confiscated the stock from the drug dealers, you could either take it to the evidence room or keep it for future use.
5288000	5293000	Like, do you have better weapons accuracy by using the drugs?
5293000	5298000	So, it was just bad.
5298000	5303000	It was no longer teaching people that drugs are bad. It was teaching, oh, there could be positive effects too, though.
5303000	5308000	Yeah, take this thief. Take this cocaine and you won't care.
5308000	5312000	So, yeah, no. That was it. That was NARC.
5312000	5315000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5315000	5319000	Which, I don't know. I kind of always thought it was kind of crap.
5319000	5324000	But, NARC. But, I also understand this was kind of like a big game of childhood.
5324000	5330000	Sometimes these picks are not necessarily just about, oh, these are all good games, but they're important games.
5330000	5333000	NARC was pretty fun.
5333000	5340000	For me, I was always like, but it was also, I thought it was dumb, but it was that type of game because it was so over the top.
5340000	5343000	If a pizza parlor had it, you still ended up putting a quarter in it.
5343000	5350000	You want to know what, though? The person behind the whole Say No to Drugs campaign is dead.
5350000	5352000	No, Nancy Reagan.
5352000	5358000	I know. I'm just like, wow, she didn't waste any time.
5358000	5361000	Is that why you picked NARC today?
5361000	5364000	Not really, but it was sort of ironic that I picked NARC.
5364000	5365000	I know.
5365000	5366000	Even though, you know.
5366000	5368000	It is ironic.
5368000	5371000	The First Lady of Taxpayer Dollar Wasting is dead, so.
5371000	5375000	Bond's 006 in chat says, wow, dark.
5375000	5378000	I was like, this show just took a dark turn.
5378000	5381000	Maybe it was dark because there's a capital D on that.
5381000	5383000	It's maybe referring to dark sacra.
5383000	5384000	Could be, could be.
5384000	5386000	All right, we're going to take a break.
5386000	5391000	We're going to, I don't know, we're going to read the Bible and pet some kitties and.
5391000	5392000	You can read the Bible.
5392000	5394000	Go look at a rainbow during the break.
5394000	5399000	I'm going to look at this part and go, nope, that's wrong, nope, that's wrong, nope, that's wrong, nope, that's wrong.
5399000	5406000	We're going to take a break, and when we come back, we'll get into some rapid fire news, as well as the Fookle Question of the Week.
5406000	5411000	And some more news stories and, of course, your emails and FUs of the Week.
5411000	5421000	And Skype Line 1877 GameOLR, her username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, Rama in chat says, dark sacras, dank memes.
5423000	5425000	Coming up after the break.
5425000	5427000	I don't see what I said was so bad.
5429000	5433000	I was just tying things into what's going on in the real world.
5434000	5435000	Seriously.
5435000	5436000	It's fine.
5436000	5437000	All right.
5438000	5442000	And I didn't know that she had died when she, when I picked the game.
5442000	5451000	I picked it like last night when I came back from San Francisco eating my strawberry cheesecake Kit Kats that I got in Japan town.
5451000	5452000	Did you bring me Kit Kats?
5452000	5453000	No.
5453000	5455000	I might have eaten them all.
5456000	5459000	When we come back, dark sacra may or may not be here.
5459000	5460000	All right.
5460000	5461000	We'll be back.
5461000	5464000	We'll be back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5465000	5481000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio live with our 633rd episode in progress, March the 6th of 2016.
5481000	5483000	Fun show so far tonight.
5483000	5486000	We've had Loki hating on literally everything.
5486000	5488000	My name is Thad earlier in the show.
5488000	5492000	But we're going to get to some more news as we move on throughout the night.
5492000	5494000	And, of course, your call is coming up in a little bit.
5494000	5497000	At Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
5497000	5500000	Add us if you haven't already so that you can get through tonight.
5500000	5503000	Let's go to some rapid fire news, some quick news tonight.
5503000	5504000	Loki.
5504000	5505000	All right.
5505000	5506000	So this is kind of cool.
5506000	5508000	I haven't actually seen a new update for Minecraft recently.
5508000	5512000	But they're adding some big changes to the combat in the game.
5512000	5521000	So now with each weapon that you have, instead of just being able to slash like crazy, you actually do have different techniques you can do.
5521000	5523000	So swords now you can do sweep attacks.
5523000	5525000	Axes have a crushing attack.
5525000	5529000	Also there's some cool down between swings as well.
5529000	5532000	They've got, they added shields to the game.
5532000	5542000	Also a new type of like chest plate that you can have that you can actually glide from higher places, which is kind of cool.
5542000	5544000	And a new mob, which is the Shulker.
5544000	5547000	And some new blocks and additional enchantments and stuff.
5547000	5551000	Guys, you know in chat says they fuck Minecraft up with that shit.
5551000	5553000	Is that everywhere or is it only PC?
5553000	5555000	Yeah, this is the PC one right now.
5555000	5558000	And eventually it's going to be up to you with everything else.
5558000	5559000	Interesting.
5559000	5560000	I don't know. I'm willing to check it out.
5560000	5561000	I mean, we'll see.
5561000	5565000	I mean, if you don't like it, I'm sure there's mods to change it back to the way it was.
5565000	5567000	So, I don't know.
5567000	5576000	Also, Melior Solid, they had a fan remake that was being worked on called Project Shadow Moses.
5576000	5578000	It has been cancelled.
5579000	5584000	And apparently, you know, this is coming from the Shadow Moses Project Facebook page.
5584000	5587000	Basically saying, hey guys, we have an important announcement to make today.
5587000	5590000	We have cancelled the Shadow Moses Project for reasons beyond our control.
5590000	5592000	Sounds like a cease and desist.
5592000	5599000	We would like to thank everyone for the tremendous support we have received from the Shadow Moses team.
5599000	5603000	So, yeah, that sounds like a cease and desist to me.
5603000	5605000	I'm going to assume that was Konami.
5605000	5607000	Fuck Konami.
5607000	5609000	That sounds like Konami.
5609000	5610000	Yeah.
5610000	5616000	And last but not least, there is not going to be VR for the Xbox One.
5616000	5620000	Which makes sense because which platform would actually be on it?
5620000	5622000	You know, they're not going to support probably Oculus.
5622000	5627000	And they've got their own, you know, shit that they're doing with HoloLens, so I'm not surprised.
5627000	5633000	But, you know, we're not really focusing on adding a VR device to the Xbox One right now.
5633000	5638000	Now, of course, they may change their mind if VR really takes off, you know, kind of a me too thing like they did with the Kinect.
5638000	5640000	But we'll see.
5640000	5643000	The Kinect was integral to the Xbox.
5643000	5645000	Totally integral.
5645000	5647000	I believe that one.
5647000	5651000	It was integral to their sales plan.
5654000	5659000	Whatever happened to being able to scan the thing and then actually move it into the world?
5659000	5666000	That never happened, but you were supposed to be able to do it with Kinect 2.0 or whatever it was for the Xbox One and then that still didn't happen.
5666000	5668000	So, you know, fuck it.
5668000	5670000	All right. Let's move on to some other news.
5670000	5673000	How about Super Meat Boy coming to the Wii U?
5673000	5678000	Which, you know, God, this game is still going all these years later showing up on new platforms.
5678000	5683000	But if you've never played it, it is a fun yet frustrating little platformer.
5683000	5687000	So Super Meat Boy is coming to the Wii U.
5687000	5689000	This is from Team Meat.
5689000	5695000	They retweeted a tweet by Tommy Refens who is one of the developers of the game.
5695000	5700000	So the Wii U port of the game is being handled by Blitworks and it'll be available in the coming months.
5700000	5711000	My assumption is that it's going to have the new soundtrack like the PlayStation 4 version did because of the issues they had had with the former composer and of the 360 version.
5711000	5716000	Which, in my personal opinion, the old soundtrack was way better.
5716000	5719000	Sorry. And I know there's some talented people on the new one.
5719000	5723000	I just, the old one, it changed too much for me.
5723000	5738000	Hey, if you're like really good at Rocket League, like really, really good at Rocket League, then maybe you should consider joining up with the Rocket League Championship Series which is going to have a $75,000 prize pool.
5738000	5741000	You want to get paid $75,000 for playing Rocket League?
5741000	5743000	Well, you have to be good at it.
5743000	5750000	But competitors can register in March in groups of three to enter the qualifiers for the inaugural season.
5750000	5757000	You must play these matches on PC or PlayStation 4 although they are looking at opening up more platforms in the future.
5757000	5760000	So yeah, those qualifiers will be available.
5760000	5765000	And it's a partnership with Twitch so you know a lot of this is going to be streamed live for everybody to watch.
5765000	5770000	You can look at twitch.tv slash rocket league for more details.
5770000	5776000	And if you happen to be the one that wins the $75,000, don't forget about your friends here at OLR.
5776000	5781000	Super Mario Maker, we talked a little bit about some of the changes coming to the game.
5781000	5787000	But you know what? Those changes are not going to affect you if you are a dirty stinking cheater because you will be blocked.
5787000	5788000	We'll ban you.
5788000	5794000	That's right. There was some information that was posted on Miiverse saying,
5794000	5796000	Hey, here's an update for the Mario Maker team.
5796000	5801000	Users may be restricted from connecting to Course World in the following cases.
5801000	5805000	The user requested stars from other users.
5805000	5807000	So don't be begging for stars.
5807000	5812000	And I'm assuming you can't go on Fiverr and get the stars that way either.
5812000	5814000	Do you like how I tied that together?
5814000	5822000	The user took advantage of bugs that were unintended by either the course creator or the developers to obtain new world records.
5822000	5825000	That sounds like a really big gray area to me, though.
5825000	5830000	I'm assuming this is about that bug we talked about a couple weeks ago that Nintendo had to squash eventually.
5830000	5836000	Because I'm like, OK, well, if you exploit some bad course design, you shouldn't be punished for that.
5836000	5845000	But if you inject items that aren't supposed to be in the level into the level like that bug a couple weeks ago, well, then, yeah, that's cheating.
5845000	5852000	I think that that kind of actually would be detrimental to people who eventually speed run these games.
5852000	5854000	That's a good point.
5854000	5859000	And then the other behavior is in violation of the Nintendo Network code of conduct.
5859000	5869000	So I'm assuming if you just make a level and the level just has a bunch of bricks that spell out cunt, you're going to get banned from the Nintendo Network.
5870000	5875000	But hilariously, maybe not.
5875000	5879000	So, yeah, don't do stupid things online or you might get banned.
5879000	5883000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, can you beg for stars on your podcast?
5883000	5888000	I don't know. Can you? I don't know the way it says you can't beg other users.
5888000	5892000	So maybe Bobby, you might get banned. I don't know what to tell you.
5892000	5895000	Can you beg for stars?
5895000	5903000	Can I can I just say for your consideration? I would I would love some stars, please.
5903000	5906000	Maybe that would be different. I don't know. All right.
5906000	5910000	And Act F says, I think one of my levels does ask for stars in its title.
5910000	5914000	Well, you better be talking about invincibility power ups or you might be in trouble.
5914000	5918000	Go change it. All right. Let's move on to our Sakura.
5918000	5925000	There is a new partnership. It's between Feminist Frequency and Crash Override Network.
5925000	5933000	They are now partners. Feminist Frequency is the nonprofit that's run by tropes versus women in video games.
5933000	5944000	Producer Anita Sarkeesian and now saying that the group is a fiscal sponsor of Zoe Quinn's Crash Override Network.
5944000	5952000	So, yeah, he's in the pot. Well, I'd say.
5952000	5960000	Strength in numbers. Also, there's actually hope for any dark suckers.
5960000	5965000	Capcom wasn't too happy with their experience with the attempted revival,
5965000	5975000	but Yoshinori Ono is saying that he is working hard or striving hard to make that happen.
5975000	5979000	So not a confirmation, but not a denial.
5979000	5989000	And then last but not least, Mass Effect Andromeda has been moved away from late 2016 to early 2017.
5989000	5997000	I would rather that they make it later than sooner and have it be complete without having to patch the ending and stuff like that.
5997000	6003000	I know it's one of those things where it's like, yes, that's what they have to do to make it better.
6003000	6010000	I support it, but I don't like it. I'm smiling. Really, I am.
6010000	6017000	That's how I feel about it. It's like, well, I mean, the Lord is testing me.
6017000	6024000	Does Rob really mean it when he says delay the game if it'll make it better? I know a way to test him.
6024000	6033000	Think of how great F-Zero is gonna be. Fuck off.
6033000	6042000	That was below the belt. Alright, I'm hoping the game will be plenty fine and if they have to take the extra time.
6042000	6049000	Like Dark Sakura said, if that's the time they have to take to make sure it doesn't have bugs and the ending's all good, then whatever.
6049000	6056000	Alright, speaking of Dark Sakura, I know you have to go with the whole work arrangements and all that stuff, so you are bowing out.
6056000	6057000	I am.
6057000	6062000	So would you like to give any final thoughts to our listeners tonight?
6062000	6065000	Not that I want to go political on things.
6065000	6066000	Oh, Lord.
6066000	6077000	But if you want a particular candidate to win and you don't show up to vote, you're part of the problem.
6077000	6079000	You should vote. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
6079000	6080000	So everyone should vote.
6080000	6081000	Yep.
6081000	6083000	I think voting should be compulsory, but...
6083000	6088000	I don't know if I go that far, but I think you should vote or you don't get to complain about it.
6088000	6089000	Yeah.
6089000	6090000	No. Alright.
6090000	6092000	Voting unless you're underage.
6092000	6096000	That should be the compulsory thing. There are no complaints allowed if you didn't vote.
6096000	6103000	Yeah. And by the way, YYR, I did peek through the mailbag a little bit, but real life.
6103000	6104000	Yep.
6104000	6105000	It must intrude.
6105000	6107000	That's okay. I'll do emails.
6107000	6110000	Rob, you need to do them in Mr. Spanky's voice.
6110000	6111000	No.
6111000	6112000	Which is why I'm glad I won't be here.
6112000	6116000	I value my voice and I can't talk like that.
6116000	6118000	So what would Betty sound like, by the way?
6118000	6119000	What would what?
6119000	6120000	Betty sound like.
6120000	6121000	Betty?
6121000	6122000	Betty.
6122000	6123000	Mr. Spanky.
6123000	6124000	Oh, yeah.
6124000	6125000	Oh, was that her?
6125000	6126000	God, it's been so long.
6126000	6127000	Wasn't her name Betty?
6127000	6128000	Was her name Betty?
6128000	6129000	Is Mr. Spanky and...
6129000	6130000	And Betty.
6130000	6131000	I thought she was Betty.
6131000	6132000	Was it Betty?
6132000	6133000	That seems so plain.
6133000	6134000	I know, but it's also...
6134000	6136000	For his little Dom friend.
6136000	6138000	Somebody in chat has to know.
6138000	6141000	Well, Dark Tatsuya says it was probably that.
6141000	6144000	I'm going to look it up before I leave.
6144000	6146000	Alright, fair enough.
6146000	6151000	Alright, we're going to move on with the foogle question of the week.
6151000	6152000	Let's get to it.
6152000	6158000	Every week you guys answer a question we put up on Facebook and Google and you throw those
6158000	6160000	words together and you get foogle.
6160000	6161000	Yes, it was Spanky.
6161000	6162000	I mean, Betty.
6162000	6163000	It was Betty.
6163000	6164000	Betty.
6164000	6165000	Okay.
6165000	6167000	DDRPC for those who have no idea what we're talking about right now.
6167000	6168000	Characters that run DDRPC.
6168000	6170000	This is literally a 15 year old joke.
6170000	6173000	As you know, our show isn't 15 yet, but it's close.
6173000	6174000	It's close.
6174000	6186000	Alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6186000	6191000	You know, I have to admit, I couldn't really find anything topical tonight I really want
6191000	6192000	to ask about.
6192000	6196000	So I thought, let's just dip into like a general question.
6196000	6200000	Something I've been wanting to ask the listeners just because I want to just talk about games
6200000	6201000	randomly with you guys.
6201000	6205000	So this week we asked, what do you think about racing games?
6205000	6207000	I love racing games.
6207000	6209000	Dark Soccer's husband really loves racing games.
6209000	6210000	I know that.
6210000	6212000	Uh, Loki likes racing games.
6212000	6213000	They're pretty good.
6213000	6214000	Pretty good.
6214000	6215000	Uh, so we want to know, do you enjoy racing games?
6215000	6217000	Do you have a favorite game or series?
6217000	6223000	Do you find there are certain types of racing games you prefer more than others and why?
6223000	6227000	And by the way, I had no idea that Loki was going to be a dick about the F-Zero thing
6227000	6230000	before I asked this question, but I'm glad he did because it kind of tied it together.
6230000	6231000	Kind of tied it together.
6231000	6232000	All right, let's get to it.
6232000	6236000	Some of the answers over on Facebook, starting with Andy R saying, I'm not huge on racing
6236000	6237000	games.
6237000	6239000	Uh, especially sim ones.
6239000	6242000	Arcade ones I enjoy time to time.
6242000	6245000	Kart racers are probably my favorite of the kinds of racing games.
6245000	6248000	Uh, Fabrice A says, I've always been into racing games.
6248000	6251000	The Outrun series being my absolute favorite.
6251000	6253000	I still consider Outrun the best game ever.
6253000	6255000	Metropolis Street Racing is a decent second.
6255000	6257000	Perfect blend between arcade and simulation.
6257000	6261000	Sega Rally coming in a nice third place for excellent playability.
6261000	6264000	Crazy Taxi is just plain fun.
6264000	6267000	Tiger Claw says, I enjoy racing games, but never been particularly good at them.
6267000	6271000	As for my favorite racing game series, I would have to go with the Mario Kart series.
6271000	6273000	It's the kind of racing games casual players will enjoy for hours.
6273000	6277000	It's not too complex like those other racing games that are more like racing simulators.
6277000	6278000	You can just pick up and play.
6278000	6280000	There's hardly any learning curve.
6280000	6284000	Retertainment says, there are few things better than just being on the edge of being,
6284000	6289000	or excuse me, than being just on the edge of being in control while taking a curve at 175 miles an hour.
6289000	6291000	Even if you only experience that in digital reality.
6291000	6296000	While I do adore games like Forza and Gran Turismo, I wish the games had a different career structure.
6296000	6301000	Something like NASCAR or IRL, but for top flight sports cars.
6301000	6306000	Perhaps I'm just angling to see a Heineken sponsored Bugatti, but still that would be so cool.
6306000	6311000	Guillermo R says, I'm a sucker for a good arcade style racer, especially if it's futuristic.
6311000	6317000	The Wipeout series is the long standing favorite by which I judge all others, and I'll always have a soft spot for the original F-Zero.
6317000	6322000	Dark Tetsuya says, I do love me some racing games, including Wangan Midnight.
6322000	6324000	It's all about Yuzo Koshiro's epic soundtrack.
6324000	6326000	Truth, I agree.
6326000	6330000	Sega, basically anything from Daytona to Outrun, two is awesome.
6330000	6332000	Super GT or Initial D, you can't go wrong.
6332000	6339000	Need for Speed, I think Carbon is my favorite of that series, because in addition to racing your cars, you can customize them with different parts, decals, and paint jobs.
6339000	6340000	It's a lot of fun.
6340000	6346000	Winston H says, I don't really play too many racing games, but if you have the racing wheel, I found the Gran Turismo series to be enjoyable.
6346000	6350000	That's only if you have the wheel.
6350000	6359000	Jordan T says, I was 15 when Fast and Furious the movie came out, which was cashing in on the huge modding underground culture.
6359000	6365000	Because of this, I've really enjoyed the games with a heavy emphasis on car modification and upgrades, while still keeping a bit of the arcade feel to them.
6366000	6369000	Midnight Club was my favorite, with Need for Speed Underground coming in close second.
6369000	6376000	Games with a heavy simulator focus seemed to translate poorly for me without a high-end wheel setup, and cart novelty racers never really hit home.
6376000	6381000	As a biker, I'm also still searching for decent motorcycle game.
6381000	6383000	Suggestions?
6383000	6385000	Find a Suzuka 8-hour.
6385000	6387000	Road Rash?
6387000	6389000	Just kidding.
6389000	6391000	I did want to add my two cents on that before I leave.
6391000	6393000	Nothing beats R4.
6394000	6398000	R4 is the best of the Ridge Racer series, without a doubt.
6398000	6400000	I don't believe it at that.
6400000	6403000	I'm surprised nobody's brought up Ridge Racer yet, but we'll see. I've still got some more answers to go.
6403000	6408000	YYR in chat says, Super Hang On is the suggestion there for motorcycle games.
6408000	6411000	YYR saying R4 is the worst.
6411000	6413000	Uh oh, uh oh.
6413000	6415000	You better be glad she's on her way out.
6415000	6417000	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
6417000	6418000	It's for horses.
6418000	6420000	Bite my butt.
6420000	6426000	And s2100man on Facebook says, Maybe it's the simplicity of this, but I've always been a fan of the arcade-style racing games.
6426000	6430000	Realistic car games like Gran Turismo or Forza have never really held my interest.
6430000	6434000	In the arcade, I would pour quarters into Initial D and even earlier.
6434000	6436000	Daytona, USA.
6436000	6441000	Early on with consoles, I fell in love with the Kart Racers, Mario Kart and Sonic All-Stars, and Burnout games.
6441000	6444000	And Rageinator says, Yeah, I enjoy racing games.
6444000	6448000	I flip-flop between Sims and arcade-style racing depending on what kind of mood I'm in.
6448000	6451000	One series that I tend to like is the FlatOut series.
6451000	6456000	I also enjoy Burnout Paradise still, as well as the Need for Speed series.
6456000	6463000	And then over on Google+, we have ActDeaf saying, I love racing games a lot.
6463000	6466000	I don't have a particular taste in racing games. I like to play them all.
6466000	6469000	From Mario Kart to Gran Turismo.
6469000	6475000	Though if I have a particular series as a favorite, it would probably be a tie between Forza and the Dirt or Colin McRae Rally series.
6475000	6479000	And lastly, Prince Peach Fuzz says, I do enjoy racing games.
6479000	6483000	Burnout 3 is one of my favorites. I prefer arcade-style to simulation.
6483000	6486000	Nothing like boosting around corners, taking out opponents.
6486000	6490000	Favorite racing game for you, Loki? You a big racing game fan?
6490000	6492000	I'm trying to think.
6492000	6498000	I liked R4, but I'm trying to think what my favorite game would be.
6498000	6504000	Well, mine is easy and only like one person even half-referred to it.
6504000	6508000	F-Zero G-X-A-X. Thank you very much.
6508000	6510000	Man, that was so...
6510000	6517000	Especially for Nintendo at the time, to have to take your memory card to the arcade to get those extra tracks.
6517000	6519000	Ah, yes. Burnout Paradise would be pretty good, too.
6519000	6521000	Burnout Paradise was pretty good.
6521000	6526000	Man, they really need to do a new one. Forza Horizon, I think, is pretty good.
6526000	6529000	Forza Horizon is a great series. I like the arcade racer as well.
6529000	6531000	I always thought Blur was a little bit underrated.
6531000	6533000	I'm really sad that that didn't work out.
6533000	6536000	Anyway, thank you guys for the answers. Appreciate it.
6536000	6541000	And I thought we had it on the show roll, but now that I'm looking at it again, I don't see it.
6541000	6544000	But part of the reason I thought about it this week was because...
6544000	6545000	The Forza 6.
6545000	6549000	The Forza 6. Or the Forza that's going to be free on Windows 10.
6549000	6550000	Yeah.
6552000	6554000	Alright, anyhow. Moving on.
6554000	6556000	Loki, how about some more news?
6556000	6560000	Yeah, I would never be able to run Forza 6 on my system.
6560000	6565000	So we talked a little bit about PlayStation TV and how it was being discontinued in Japan.
6565000	6566000	Well...
6567000	6572000	Well, it's also being discontinued in North America and Europe.
6572000	6573000	So...
6574000	6580000	Not even it is being discontinued. It was discontinued at the end of 2015.
6580000	6582000	So, yeah.
6584000	6586000	They're not supporting that anymore, unfortunately.
6586000	6592000	On top of that, another system that they're not supporting, which is also able to emulate games better than the 3DS...
6592000	6597000	The PlayStation Portable is having its PlayStation Store shut down as well.
6597000	6601000	So you won't be able to download past purchases.
6601000	6604000	Or, no, you will still be able to download past purchases.
6606000	6608000	Good. I was going to say, that sucks.
6608000	6612000	Yeah, you just won't be able to use the sort of pay for new games.
6612000	6615000	I'm wondering if you can still do that through...
6615000	6620000	Oh, you can still purchase games through the PlayStation 3 to transfer them over or through the web.
6620000	6621000	Oh, interesting.
6621000	6622000	So you can do it that way as well.
6622000	6631000	That's kind of weird that they have to shut down the PSP Store, even though they're really still going to kind of be allowing you to buy stuff for it. That's weird.
6631000	6635000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I'm kind of cool with it and stuff, but...
6635000	6641000	I guess that's one way to do it, though, is that if they have to shut the store down, at least you can still get your purchases through a console.
6641000	6642000	Might be a way to do it.
6642000	6650000	Yeah, it's able to play PlayStation 1 games, which are probably more processor and graphically intensive than Super Nintendo games.
6650000	6652000	Alright, here we go. Here we go. Let it go.
6652000	6656000	It's just so impossible for, you know...
6656000	6661000	Can we talk about the PlayStation TV discontinuation, though? I mean, I guess it's not that surprising.
6661000	6666000	I'm kind of disappointed with that. I thought they could have done a lot more with it, but they didn't.
6666000	6674000	It's kind of like, I don't know, they put it out there and it's like, okay, well, that's it. There was no marketing behind it. There was no nothing.
6674000	6680000	It was just kind of like, you know, they've been trying to tell, oh, the Vita, it's kind of a good accessory for the PlayStation 4.
6680000	6684000	It just never happened. It didn't work out.
6684000	6692000	I feel like maybe they just don't want to saturate the market. They just want people to own a PlayStation 4.
6692000	6700000	Like, why would they be pushing the cheaper TV that does some of the stuff the PlayStation 4 does? Why not just get people to buy the PlayStation 4?
6700000	6702000	I feel like that's what it really is.
6702000	6705000	Because they were, you know, to sell more Vita titles, I think.
6705000	6711000	I mean, because they were putting out, you know, no one was buying the Vita, and they're not making anything really off the hardware.
6711000	6718000	So if it gets you onto the platform for $30, you know, you might make some money off the software.
6718000	6725000	And again, they're not supporting the Vita as far as first-party Vita titles either. So, I don't know.
6725000	6732000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat is reading you a little bit, Loki, saying, the PSP and the Super Nintendo have completely different chipsets.
6732000	6735000	You would think Tech Master would understand that.
6735000	6740000	Yes, I completely understand it, as does the 3DS have a completely different chipset as well.
6741000	6750000	You know, my old fucking 2.0 Android phone could probably emulate the Super Nintendo, yet this complicated piece of hardware, the 3DS, just can't fucking do it.
6750000	6752000	Stop. Stop it. Can't handle it.
6752000	6762000	What I'm saying is, my point is that they could do it if they put the effort into it, but they don't want to do it because it's not going to be much of a return on it. That's the issue.
6762000	6773000	Moving on. Stop, stop, stop. Moving on. Hey, PlayStation 4 update. I'm excited for a new update to the PlayStation 4 because it sounds like a kind of neat feature.
6773000	6775000	I want this so bad.
6775000	6786000	It is in beta right now, but not this feature. So the 3.5 update is in beta, but not this feature. What is that feature? It is remote play.
6787000	6800000	Basically, the fact that you can stream PlayStation 4 to your PC or your Mac. So this is an interesting... I kind of assumed this would never happen from Sony, and this would always be something that was kind of exclusive to Xbox One, but this is an interesting little...
6800000	6804000	I'm going to totally use the crap out of this. I mean, because now I...
6804000	6805000	Oh yeah, because now the life...
6805000	6807000	Because my wife watches the TV and like the Do It Now...
6807000	6809000	You watch Grey's Anatomy and you can play whatever.
6809000	6810000	Well, she doesn't know.
6810000	6811000	Whatever.
6811000	6812000	Whatever she's watching.
6812000	6813000	Whatever Shonda wrote this week.
6814000	6822000	But she watches TV and like I'm stuck. If I want to do it, I have to try doing it through the PlayStation TV and through my USB.
6822000	6829000	Oh, I have a USB second monitor, which actually doesn't work with that. So I'd have to set up a second monitor to do it and it's a pain in the ass.
6829000	6834000	So this would be perfect because I have my laptop anyways in the living room.
6835000	6841000	Hey, want to play SM Fallout? She wants to play Netflix? Cool. I'm just going to stream Fallout 4.
6842000	6845000	I'm down with that. I'm totally down with that.
6845000	6851000	Some other features besides this, which is obviously the big highlight, but you can also appear offline.
6851000	6861000	So you can kind of do that whole fake offline thing, which I actually think will be useful because sometimes I get game invites when I'm trying to marathon Fuller House on Netflix.
6862000	6872000	So, you know, I don't necessarily want to, I don't want to be disturbed from my touching family moment scenes in Fuller House.
6872000	6876000	So, which by the way, I'm like through episode seven now. Did you finish the series yet?
6876000	6877000	Yeah, we're done.
6877000	6880000	I missed the last episode. She watched it without me, but meh.
6880000	6885000	Yeah, we can watch it with everyone on Netflix. Are you happy that it's coming back for season two?
6885000	6888000	It was all right. I mean, I don't know.
6889000	6896000	She's trying to figure out something else to watch now. What I kind of want more of is Black Mirror because that was a fucking amazing series. Have you watched that yet?
6896000	6897000	I haven't.
6897000	6905000	You need to watch it. It's pretty amazing. They're like little short stories. Think of it like Twilight Zone for like tech Twilight Zone, if you will.
6905000	6910000	How long is it? Because one thing I like about Fuller House is that it's like 30 minutes.
6910000	6925000	They're like 45 minute long movies. It's not very long. It's pretty good, but like each one has like a twist in it that's really fucked. I thought they were pretty fucked up, but it's awesome. It's like you don't really see it coming and you're just like, that's pretty cool.
6925000	6935000	You can also schedule playtime with friends. So, you can actually arrange like, oh, we're going to play Rocket League or whatever at this particular time. That's pretty cool.
6935000	6950000	And then lastly, now Dailymotion is another site you can stream to, including Twitch and YouTube. And I think Ustream is still an option as well, but Dailymotion is joining the group. So, those are all new features coming to PlayStation.
6950000	6963000	All right, moving on. We just have a few more stories for you guys than the mailbag. I guess Dark Soccer was going to do this one, but do you want me to do this? I guess I'll take it. Why not?
6963000	6964000	Which one? This one?
6964000	6965000	The Sega survey?
6965000	6976000	Sega survey to help out to make better games? Let's see, it's the first question. Should Sonic have more friends? That should be no. Please answer that no.
6976000	6984000	All right, look. Sega put out a survey to give them feedback to enable them to make games that you want to see. So, you can actually access this survey.
6984000	6986000	I'm doing it right now. What is my age?
6986000	6988000	Okay, what is my age? 69.
6988000	6990000	69, yes.
6990000	6997000	We'd like to learn more about our players. Oh my god, which of the following devices have you ever owned? Do you see how huge this list is?
6997000	6999000	I've only owned a PlayStation 4.
6999000	7008000	You can mark off a Commodore 64, and that's the only one I'm going to mark off. I only ever owned a Commodore 64 because I'm 69 years old.
7008000	7015000	I've only owned a, whatever the SG-1000 is, is what I've owned.
7015000	7025000	All right, it's too much. The next question I got to was, what are the top three games you're playing? And I was about to put in Not Fantasy Star Online 2.
7025000	7029000	I'm going to put Not Fantasy Star Online 2.
7029000	7030000	I'm bitter.
7030000	7031000	No.
7031000	7037000	All right, let's move on to another story, Loki.
7037000	7040000	All right, anyways.
7040000	7051000	So, apparently the head of Epic is not too happy with Microsoft's new stance with the Universal Windows Platform Initiative.
7051000	7064000	Basically saying that this is like a closed platform on PC, like they're basically trying to lock down PC like they are kind of with consoles, I guess.
7064000	7077000	So, what they're doing with this, basically saying that, they're not questioning the idea of having a Windows store, but it's the fact that in order to be able to put stuff on, they have, I guess, giving control to Microsoft.
7077000	7087000	There's no way to have an app that's a Universal Windows Platform app, but being able to, say, download that other places, you can't offer that.
7087000	7092000	You're thinking how you have games on Steam and stuff, and there's multiple different platforms you can purchase those on.
7092000	7094000	You can't offer those anywhere else.
7094000	7099000	It has to only be on these platforms or the certain version of the game in order to gain support for it.
7099000	7113000	Plus, it seems like they're locking it down a little bit, but one of the things that they brought up also that because of this, you can't obviously have those other marketplaces.
7113000	7118000	Also, there's not a lot of third-party support already on the Windows Store.
7118000	7121000	I mean, you're not seeing a lot of major games that are on there.
7121000	7133000	It's just, I think the idea of the platform is an interesting idea, and I get where they're trying to do with it because they're basically saying, hey, you purchased this game on, say, Windows 10.
7133000	7135000	You're going to get it on your Xbox.
7135000	7139000	You're going to get it on your Windows Phone or whatever other platforms.
7139000	7150000	Granted that those are completely fucking different hardware platforms that are going to have different capabilities as far as running these apps, but you can have it tied in with everything.
7150000	7153000	It's a neat idea, but I don't know how it's going to be implemented.
7153000	7160000	And if that means that they're going to lock it down for developers being able to only put out things on this certain platform, that kind of sucks.
7160000	7168000	Hasn't Microsoft kind of gotten in trouble for antitrust things in the past?
7168000	7170000	Yeah, they did with their whole internet browser and stuff.
7170000	7176000	With the whole Internet Explorer, wasn't that a big deal not that long ago?
7176000	7180000	I don't know why, but this just feels like we're going down a similar path, doesn't it?
7180000	7187000	Sort of. And the other thing, too, they're saying that one thing with this platform is it's not open source.
7188000	7201000	Games might not run as well on their operating system that are not a part of this platform.
7201000	7208000	They could lock out, say, hypothetically, DirectX 12 support or whatever it could be.
7208000	7220000	Or 13, and let's say in the future could be only games that are part of this platform or have this sort of API can use fully utilize this hardware, whatever the case may be.
7220000	7224000	I mean, that might be a fear, but I don't know.
7224000	7229000	Personally, I'm just not interested in purchasing stuff from the Windows Store.
7229000	7236000	So, plus since I don't really have any other Microsoft devices, it's kind of a non-issue for me right now.
7236000	7241000	But, I mean, when I do purchase an Xbox, eventually, I guess I might be interested in that kind of stuff.
7241000	7249000	But they haven't really shown what's going to be kind of, what am I going to be using these universal apps for?
7249000	7252000	I mean, it's kind of neat that you have, I guess, Skype on all of them.
7252000	7254000	But, I mean, that's just like sharing an account.
7254000	7259000	I don't understand really how this is going to kind of work with each other.
7259000	7261000	How's it going to work with the Windows phones?
7261000	7263000	Who the fuck's going to have a Windows phone for one?
7263000	7267000	I mean, no one really owns a Windows phone, nor do they have interest in doing that.
7267000	7272000	I just don't see that happening, but I don't know how it's going to play with PC and my console.
7272000	7275000	How are they going to talk together?
7275000	7276000	How are these apps?
7276000	7278000	Why do I need this platform?
7278000	7279000	Why do I need these tied together?
7279000	7282000	What is this going to do for me as a consumer?
7282000	7283000	Yeah.
7283000	7287000	I'm reading some of the comments in chat, because obviously this is lighting chat up a little bit here.
7287000	7291000	Bobby Blackwolf has a lot to say on this over at live.vognetwork.com, saying,
7291000	7294000	The UWP is a great idea. The problem is limiting features only to the Windows 10 store,
7294000	7296000	which is the path they seem to want to go down.
7296000	7299000	But they changed their mind with the Xbox One feature set,
7299000	7302000	so maybe they will change their mind on this too if people like Tim Sweeney yell out enough.
7302000	7306000	That's true. We've seen Microsoft do a little dance around stuff before.
7306000	7310000	Kaijuto in chat says, Microsoft needs to just get out of the video game biz.
7310000	7311000	Enough with their shit.
7311000	7313000	That might be a little strong for me.
7313000	7315000	Well, here's the other thing too.
7315000	7320000	Let's just say, hypothetically, because I haven't really downloaded that much stuff on the Windows store,
7320000	7325000	aside from the Twitter app and fucking Minecraft, because it's free.
7325000	7332000	If they do their updates, like they do with Windows 10, where basically,
7332000	7336000	hey, we're going to fucking update your shit, whether you want us to or not.
7336000	7340000	You're going to bend over. It's happening.
7340000	7344000	If that's the way they're going to do it, especially with some PC titles,
7344000	7348000	not saying that everything on the store is going to be perfect,
7348000	7351000	some PC updates can really fuck shit up.
7351000	7357000	It doesn't seem to be a way to roll that shit back, like they do at least with Steam sometimes.
7357000	7360000	In other platforms, they can patch that.
7360000	7364000	If you're locking everything down in this marketplace,
7364000	7368000	what's that going to do as far as modding support and that kind of thing?
7368000	7371000	I don't know. I just don't like it.
7371000	7374000	I mean, Windows Store didn't work for the...
7374000	7379000	The whole Windows Store... Not even Windows Store. What was the fucking web...
7379000	7382000	Not Xbox Live. It was the...
7382000	7385000	What was their fucking... Yeah, maybe it was the Windows Store that I was thinking of.
7385000	7390000	The original Windows Store. That did not fuck and work very well to begin with.
7390000	7392000	Windows Live, I think that's what it was.
7392000	7393000	Games for Windows Live?
7393000	7395000	Games for Windows Live. Thank you. That's what I was thinking.
7395000	7396000	You're welcome.
7396000	7400000	Yes, Games for Windows Live did not fucking work out very well. It was just a piece of shit.
7400000	7406000	And this is kind of... It's a little bit better, but it's kind of going down that path of shittiness.
7406000	7408000	Well, let's wait and see what happens.
7408000	7412000	But I can't go the whole thing where Microsoft should just stop.
7412000	7415000	Because, yes, they've made some bad choices sometimes,
7415000	7420000	like the Xbox One initial reveal, which we've talked about before.
7420000	7425000	But, I mean, Microsoft also transformed gaming with Xbox Live.
7425000	7427000	That was Microsoft. Microsoft did that.
7427000	7432000	So you can't say that they don't do anything good.
7432000	7436000	But I just... Let's see what develops with this.
7436000	7438000	I think Bobby is on to that.
7438000	7441000	If enough people kind of speak up and say,
7441000	7446000	you're going to have a problem, then Microsoft will probably shift course before it becomes too much of a problem.
7446000	7448000	But we'll see what happens. We'll see.
7448000	7449000	I hope so.
7449000	7452000	Alright. Let's move on.
7452000	7456000	This is interesting. I did not even know that something like this was coming.
7457000	7461000	That there is a spiritual successor to Myst in the making.
7461000	7464000	And that game is called Abduction.
7464000	7469000	Not like being kidnapped, but it's OBduction. Abduction.
7469000	7472000	It's the spiritual successor to Myst.
7472000	7476000	This is after a Kickstarter that happened a few years ago.
7476000	7478000	But this is about to come out.
7478000	7481000	And there's a trailer out there if you want to take a look at what this looks like.
7482000	7486000	It is set for a June 2016 release on PC and Mac.
7486000	7491000	So if you guys are excited about this, I might have to check this out.
7491000	7493000	Because I remember the old school Myst game.
7493000	7499000	But you can also, in this game, choose to have full gamer control or simplify with a simple click of the mouse.
7499000	7503000	So in other words, it sounds like you're going to be able to go between classic Myst,
7503000	7506000	where you clicked forward and it would jump a screen,
7506000	7509000	or real Myst, where you could freely move around.
7509000	7511000	So this would be very interesting.
7511000	7514000	And VXJ6V says, OLR has covered Abduction before.
7514000	7517000	Yeah, well, you know, when we've been around for 14 years,
7517000	7520000	I imagine we talked about this Kickstarter when it first launched.
7520000	7524000	But it is nice to see that it is actually coming out.
7524000	7526000	Because unfortunately, we've had some bad news Kickstarter.
7526000	7529000	So there was the Ant Simulator thing a couple weeks ago, right?
7529000	7532000	So it's nice to be able to say, hey, some of them work out too,
7532000	7534000	and this game looks like it might be kind of rad.
7535000	7541000	Well, speaking of simulator games, Bear Simulator was another one that we were talking about the other day,
7541000	7543000	that was on Steam's page.
7543000	7549000	They had a Kickstarter as well, and the game did come out in early access.
7549000	7551000	But the guy's going to put out one patch and then he's done.
7551000	7555000	He's like, I can't make this any better, and I'm done working on this.
7555000	7559000	So they're not going to fill some of the stretch goals that they did either.
7559000	7561000	At least you got a game, I guess.
7564000	7565000	Something.
7565000	7566000	All right.
7566000	7569000	Let's get to, I guess we're going to do the mailbag now.
7569000	7570000	It's about that time.
7570000	7571000	Let's open it up.
7576000	7582000	Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7582000	7586000	And we choose some of our favorite emails and read them here on the show.
7588000	7589000	And sorry, I'm opening up the mail.
7589000	7593000	Usually, Dar Sakura does this, but since she left, I'm opening it up right now.
7593000	7595000	And I will say, we got a ton of email this week,
7595000	7599000	so I am going to have to abbreviate some of this this week for time.
7599000	7602000	So I'm going to kind of touch on just a few of these.
7602000	7606000	Some of these I'll read in full, but some of these I'm going to abbreviate a little bit here.
7606000	7611000	So I want to get to one email here from DDR Mike, who still listens to this show.
7611000	7612000	Go figure.
7612000	7613000	What's up, DDR Mike?
7613000	7620000	Well, DDR Mike sent a very long email about the whole Digimon and Pokemon thing,
7620000	7623000	because remember that came up last week, like what came out first?
7623000	7624000	Yeah.
7624000	7627000	So basically kind of went into, and again, just for time's sake,
7627000	7631000	I'm not going to get into the whole detailed bullet list here,
7631000	7636000	but it has to do with that for most people, Digimon's introduction was the anime Digimon Adventure,
7636000	7639000	which aired in the States in August 1999.
7639000	7643000	But he's saying that the Digimon virtual pet was June 26.
7643000	7649000	That's my birthday, 1997 in Japan, so that technically it was a little bit before.
7649000	7652000	But anyway, and then it gets into all this other stuff.
7652000	7656000	But with all due respect, DDR Mike, I let Jamie read it,
7656000	7659000	and unfortunately she's not here to tell you what she thought.
7659000	7668000	But I think it's kind of one of those things where it's probably something like what happened
7668000	7670000	where there's DDR and then there's Pump It Up,
7670000	7672000	and they were kind of both made around the same time,
7672000	7677000	probably because the same designer sold his idea to two different companies in two different places.
7677000	7681000	But, you know, we got what we got.
7681000	7683000	Anyway, let's get to another email here.
7683000	7689000	We're going to get to an email from EA Skizie, who we haven't heard from in a while,
7689000	7692000	saying, what's up, Orange Launch? I haven't written to you guys in a while, and I feel bad about it.
7692000	7697000	It's okay. Sometimes you can't email us every week, and we understand.
7697000	7699000	Anyways, I hope things are going well for you guys.
7699000	7702000	How is Loki's game coming?
7702000	7706000	Well, okay. No, I did sort of work on it.
7706000	7712000	Basically, I have stopped working on It's Time to Car for now.
7712000	7716000	I went back to my original project that I actually was working on prior to that,
7716000	7724000	and one of the things I'm doing now is researching because it's basically like it has a voxel element to it.
7724000	7730000	It's not like a Minecraft game or anything like that, but there is a voxel element to it.
7730000	7735000	And so I am researching right now the ways to optimize like a voxel engine
7735000	7741000	because I've rewritten it a couple times already, and so now I'm just trying to figure out how I can optimize it further
7741000	7745000	and how to make it work a little bit better, and also it may run better in Unity 5.
7745000	7748000	I've got to update everything because my code's from Unity 4.
7748000	7753000	So that's what I've been working on right now is going back to that old project because it was one...
7753000	7758000	I was even thinking of starting up a completely separate project whatsoever and starting new.
7758000	7764000	I had a gimmick that would be kind of interesting, but I just didn't want to...
7764000	7769000	I didn't know how to go with it beyond that, and so this one I have more developed on it.
7769000	7774000	I have more of a story developed for it and ideas, and so I'm just going to kind of go back to it
7774000	7778000	because that's the one I really started with and one I've been kind of going back to.
7778000	7781000	The It's Time to Car thing will come at some point.
7782000	7788000	I wanted to do so much with it, and I just don't have the time, and I don't want to put out something that's half-finished.
7788000	7793000	It's just not... The gameplay wasn't where I wanted it to be, and that's kind of the main point.
7793000	7798000	I needed to kind of focus on gameplay first other than... I don't know.
7798000	7802000	I just kind of got it lost, what I wanted to do with it.
7802000	7803000	He's a perfectionist.
7803000	7809000	I'm not a perfectionist, but it just wasn't... The controls are all kind of weird, and it just didn't feel right.
7809000	7814000	It didn't play like I wanted it to, so I'm going to start over or do something different with that.
7814000	7821000	Skeezy also wants to know if we threw a party for just the Orange Sounds Radio crew and me, what kinds of...
7821000	7824000	Because we're not inviting anybody else. It's just going to be the four of us.
7824000	7830000	What kind of drinks would we make all night? I'm very curious what you'd mess me up with.
7830000	7834000	This question might be going to a very weird place, but we'll entertain it anyway.
7834000	7837000	What drinks would we be having at the OLR party?
7838000	7841000	I'm going to guess that Loki would make screwdrivers, but that's just my guess.
7841000	7842000	That's pretty much what I drink, yeah.
7842000	7843000	There it is.
7845000	7848000	Here's the thing. I could go to two different extremes, Skeezy.
7848000	7852000	You know we love the wine here at Orange Sounds Radio, so I have a feeling it would be wine.
7852000	7855000	Especially if Shane's coming over, it's definitely going to be wine.
7855000	7864000	But if we just want to get, like, fucked up, then we'll go downtown to one of the places I know down there,
7864000	7871000	and we'll get a drink called an adios motherfucker, which is kind of like a Long Island iced tea, but it's blue.
7871000	7877000	So that's, you know, it just depends. Which extreme are we going for here?
7877000	7881000	Are we just sipping, or are we going to just say goodbye?
7882000	7885000	Dar Tetsuya in chat says, how about a warp core breach?
7885000	7893000	I could go for that. I miss the Star Trek experience. Very sad.
7893000	7899000	And Brad from Pod Culture says, fuck that, fireball.
7899000	7901000	Hey, fireball's pretty good.
7901000	7908000	Hey, you know what, though? Skeezy, if you do want to just watch some of VOG drink, it's not really OLR,
7908000	7911000	because sadly Loki and Dark Sock are yet to go to this con,
7911000	7916000	but if you want to come and drink with myself and Bobby Blackwolf and Jon from Critical Myth,
7916000	7920000	and hopefully Brad from Pod Culture again this year, and some of those, just come to Dragon Con,
7920000	7923000	because that's actually what will happen there.
7923000	7927000	And I don't bring the wine to Dragon Con. Fireball, that'll be Dragon Con.
7927000	7931000	All right. Let's get to some more emails here.
7931000	7938000	I want to go to this one. We had a lot of emails about Street Fighter V,
7938000	7941000	and so I want to read this one from AZHP, who said,
7941000	7943000	I just want to weigh in on the debate that happened on last week's episode,
7943000	7946000	where people were debating whether or not it's okay to release an incomplete game
7947000	7950000	with the promise of additional content at no charge on a timeline.
7950000	7954000	There were three points that were not brought up by either side that I feel should be factored in
7954000	7958000	when considering whether or not this course of action should be considered acceptable.
7958000	7961000	The first point is that while this move may be fine for enthusiasts,
7961000	7965000	who only want the base game and don't care about the frills or need to train for EVO,
7965000	7970000	or the well-informed consumer who understands that there is a timeline for additional content,
7970000	7975000	what about the average consumer or newcomer to fighting games who purchases the game at Walmart on launch day,
7975000	7979000	is confused as to why they spent 60 bucks on the game and brings it back to the store saying,
7979000	7982000	this game was terrible, I want my money back, and never touches the series again.
7982000	7987000	You only get one chance to make a first impression, and it seems short-sighted of Capcom
7987000	7991000	to push out a game that is completely inaccessible with no challenge mode to learn combos,
7991000	7995000	a bare-bones tutorial, and a terrible story mode just for the sake of its hardcore fans.
7995000	7998000	The second point is how do you review a game like that?
7998000	8001000	Game review outlets that need to put out a review of the game when it launches
8001000	8003000	have no choice but to review the game they're given,
8003000	8006000	but do they give the game a pass on content that doesn't exist yet?
8006000	8009000	Do they dock the game points for not having any substance?
8009000	8013000	If you review the game highly based on promise of content and the content doesn't make it out,
8013000	8017000	or comes out and is poorly implemented, do you change the review?
8017000	8022000	If you dock the game points out the gate and it becomes a masterpiece through additional content,
8022000	8023000	do you change the review?
8023000	8027000	Most sites have a policy of not altering their review score after the game is out,
8027000	8030000	meaning that people who seek out reviews for the game a year after release
8030000	8034000	will see a litany of mediocre reviews based on the outdated version of the game.
8034000	8039000	And just a quick side note, I kind of agree that if you write a review,
8039000	8044000	you can't factor in what's supposed to come or what they're promising is coming,
8044000	8046000	you can't factor that into the review.
8046000	8048000	You have to evaluate the game as is.
8048000	8052000	I understand this is why some sites go back and will re-score the game,
8052000	8057000	but I think what's really appropriate to do in a situation like, let's say, Diablo III
8057000	8061000	is to maybe re-review the game a year later.
8061000	8066000	If it's really that big, that necessitates a whole other review.
8066000	8069000	But I also know sometimes this is done with the expansion,
8069000	8072000	because not that I think Street Fighter V will get an expansion,
8072000	8076000	but I think Diablo III, most people re-approached it because,
8076000	8078000	oh, they're asking for your money again with Reaper of Souls,
8078000	8080000	and hey, you know what, they did fix a lot of problems.
8080000	8086000	Or with Final Fantasy XIV, God, the first one was terrible,
8086000	8088000	but then people re-approached it when the expansion came out
8088000	8091000	that really fixed everything, made it one of the better MMOs out there.
8091000	8095000	Anyway, back to ACHP's email.
8095000	8097000	Finally, what does one do with an offline console?
8097000	8099000	In Street Fighter V's case, when you get the game for $60,
8099000	8102000	you can only enter training mode or fight someone locally.
8102000	8105000	Even when the game eventually receives updates to address the content issues,
8105000	8108000	are players without internet connections just screwed?
8108000	8110000	They will never receive those updates.
8110000	8112000	There should be some sort of warning when you purchase the game
8112000	8115000	that you need to have an internet connection to receive the entire game.
8115000	8118000	Do we just go with what Don Mattrick said during the release of the Xbox One?
8118000	8120000	We have a system for people without internet connections.
8120000	8123000	It's called the Xbox 360. That's crazy to me.
8123000	8126000	Sorry for the long email, but I need to get these points off my chest
8126000	8129000	since I felt last week's discussion lacked some key points
8129000	8130000	that would add to the discussion.
8130000	8133000	Well, that is what email is for, so I am fine with that,
8133000	8135000	except we got a lot of emails on it,
8135000	8138000	so I'm going to try to do at least a couple more here with time.
8138000	8143000	Andrew R. saying, not to be that guy, but I do want to point out something.
8143000	8146000	DarkSoccer made a comment that you have to win 2,000 matches
8146000	8148000	to unlock a character in Street Fighter V.
8148000	8150000	While this is true, if you only play online matches,
8150000	8152000	it's not the only way to get the currency.
8152000	8154000	As it is right now, you can get more than enough
8154000	8156000	to buy the first character when he's out
8156000	8159000	simply by playing the single-player modes that are already in the game.
8159000	8161000	And by the time the other characters come out,
8161000	8164000	it seems like there will be more ways to earn in-game currency
8164000	8167000	like the daily weekly challenges and probably arcade mode story mode.
8167000	8170000	It'll be a bit of a grind, but not nearly on the level
8170000	8172000	of having to make it through 2,000 online winch,
8172000	8175000	which is currently impossible thanks to all the rage quitters.
8175000	8179000	See, I have to jump in here, though, real quick and say,
8179000	8182000	that's all fine and good, and that sounds like a real nice plan,
8182000	8186000	but here we are talking about things that are supposed to be there
8186000	8189000	but aren't there now, so we can only talk about what's there now.
8189000	8193000	I know they're promising other stuff, but until it's there, things change.
8193000	8196000	Anyway, Andrew continues and says,
8196000	8199000	I'm sure this sounds like I'm defending the game, and I guess I am,
8199000	8200000	but I did want to address it.
8200000	8203000	Mechanically, I think Street Fighter V is very solid, and I like it,
8203000	8206000	but it's definitely annoying how much of the game outside the mechanics
8206000	8208000	is still waiting on updates.
8208000	8210000	I certainly don't fault people like Sky who want to wait
8210000	8213000	until more of the updates are out and the game is cheaper,
8213000	8215000	but I guess I was just too impatient myself.
8215000	8217000	And who knows, maybe Capcom will see the outrage
8217000	8220000	and reward their early adopters.
8220000	8222000	Ha ha ha, never mind, it's Capcom.
8222000	8224000	Thank you for the email.
8224000	8229000	And, you know, these are all fair points to consider,
8229000	8233000	but just for me, it's one of those things where I can't,
8233000	8236000	you know, I give Rock Band 4 a hard time for the same thing.
8236000	8238000	It's like there's all these things that are supposed to be there,
8238000	8244000	but until they're there, I don't consider it a part of the game.
8244000	8247000	Let's see, we've got more emails here.
8247000	8251000	I'm going to get to this one, another Street Fighter V email
8251000	8255000	from our pal YYR saying,
8255000	8257000	the Street Fighter V situation is interesting.
8257000	8260000	I've been saying for years that story modes and fighting games don't matter.
8260000	8263000	They're like chess or checkers or a backgammon,
8263000	8265000	games designed to be played by two human players.
8265000	8267000	You can play those games against a computer,
8267000	8269000	but that's just not the way they're meant to be played.
8269000	8271000	For anyone who agrees with this philosophy,
8271000	8274000	Street Fighter V was absolutely 100% ready to be released and played.
8274000	8277000	For Capcom to say, we're adding the story mode later
8277000	8279000	feels similar to an RPG maker saying,
8279000	8281000	we're adding the side quests later.
8281000	8283000	I grossly underestimated the number of folks that would be upset
8283000	8285000	by the lack of single player content.
8285000	8287000	On one hand, I feel like that's not what the game is for,
8287000	8290000	but on the other, I fully realize that the features people are asking for,
8290000	8293000	arcade mode versus CPU, better training, tutorial,
8293000	8296000	are all things that are present in almost every other fighting game released
8296000	8298000	over the last decade.
8298000	8300000	Whether they're essential to the game or not, the precedent was set.
8300000	8303000	It's unfortunate that the game was released in this state.
8303000	8305000	The fact of the matter, though, is Capcom wasn't as interested
8305000	8307000	in the sales numbers as everyone else.
8307000	8310000	The reason they rushed this to market was the Capcom Pro Tour.
8310000	8313000	Capcom isn't looking for the revenue from early Street Fighter V buyers
8313000	8317000	as much as they are the long-term revenue from an increased focus on esports.
8317000	8320000	Capcom badly wants a chunk of the esports pie,
8320000	8322000	and Street Fighter V is the game they want that chunk with,
8322000	8325000	in large part because the competitive scene is tired of Street Fighter IV.
8325000	8327000	Capcom has set their priorities.
8327000	8330000	The casual Street Fighter fans are not their priorities anymore.
8330000	8332000	We can look at the sales numbers and shake our heads,
8332000	8335000	but in truth, we're not going to know whether this was the success
8335000	8337000	Capcom wanted until a few years from now.
8337000	8340000	What worries me more than the initial reception
8340000	8343000	is actually the steep cost increase of the game over the long run.
8343000	8346000	Currently, there have been six DLC characters announced.
8346000	8348000	They can be obtained with a $30 season pass.
8348000	8352000	They can announce six more characters next year and six more after that.
8352000	8355000	And for all we know, each set could come with a $30 price tag.
8355000	8358000	And while they will all be purchasable with in-game currency,
8358000	8361000	that doesn't help someone who wants to get into the game a few years from now
8361000	8363000	and is starting from square one.
8363000	8367000	Rather than being able to buy all DLC included re-release on a disc for $20 to $40,
8367000	8372000	this new player will be 18 characters behind unless they want to drop $90 right out the gate.
8372000	8376000	I really feel like, even though Capcom says one thing,
8376000	8380000	I really feel like you're going to have bundles that are deep discounted on Black Friday.
8380000	8384000	I think they are going to have a catch-up way,
8384000	8386000	even though, of course, they don't want to tell you that
8386000	8388000	because they want people to pay full price up front.
8388000	8391000	I'll end this with a reply to what Jamie said last week
8391000	8394000	about Street Fighter V feeling different than previous titles.
8394000	8396000	This is absolutely by design.
8396000	8399000	Street Fighter II, III, and IV all felt very different from their predecessors
8399000	8402000	and used different rules. V is no exception.
8402000	8403000	We're all starting from scratch.
8403000	8407000	And by the way, V is pretty fantastic gameplay-wise, at least in my opinion.
8407000	8409000	Thanks once again for supporting my efforts. I really appreciate it.
8409000	8410000	Have a great week.
8410000	8412000	Well, thank you very much for that email.
8412000	8414000	And yeah, I will say this.
8414000	8418000	I mean, you know, for at least what little of Street Fighter V I did play during the beta,
8418000	8421000	it did seem like there was a solid fighter in there.
8421000	8422000	It's just the whole...
8422000	8426000	It's kind of like, I don't know, it's like having a cake without any frosting.
8426000	8428000	I guess it's still kind of good.
8430000	8432000	But it's not the same. I want the frosting.
8432000	8433000	No.
8433000	8435000	If you're going to charge me all that money for a cake, I want the frosting.
8435000	8436000	All right, anyway.
8436000	8439000	YYR chat says, but it's so moist.
8441000	8443000	All right, that's going to do it for emails tonight.
8443000	8446000	I'm sorry to the emails I didn't get to tonight, but we actually got a lot this week.
8446000	8449000	But we do always read them all, so please send your emails.
8449000	8453000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
8453000	8455000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8455000	8457000	Every week on this show we get a little angsty.
8457000	8459000	Why? Because...
8459000	8481000	I guess FU2 just how busy things have been at work.
8481000	8482000	I don't know.
8482000	8486000	I haven't been able to mentally focus a lot in game programming.
8486000	8491000	You know, normally I get a few minutes in between things, but not so much.
8491000	8493000	But it wasn't so bad on Friday.
8493000	8495000	Hopefully it just stays the way.
8495000	8499000	My FU of the week goes to getting up at four in the morning today.
8499000	8501000	Although, to be fair, I volunteered for that.
8501000	8505000	So I'm not actually, I'm not like mad that I got up at four because I knew that's what I said I'd do.
8505000	8510000	I'm mad because I didn't sleep a wink last night at all.
8510000	8515000	And I don't know if that was the rain or what that was, but like, yeah, I tried to go to bed at 10 o'clock
8515000	8517000	because I was going to have six hours sleep. That'll be enough.
8517000	8522000	I remember seeing the clock at 11, seeing it at midnight, seeing it at 1, seeing it at 2.30.
8522000	8525000	I didn't sleep last night at all.
8525000	8531000	So, thankfully, I took a nap before OLR so I'd be able to function on today's show.
8531000	8533000	But I'm probably going to sleep pretty hard tonight.
8533000	8536000	So, looking forward to that.
8536000	8539000	So FU2 is super insomnia, I suppose.
8539000	8544000	Alright, let's get to a couple more stories and then we are going to open up that Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
8544000	8548000	All one word on Skype, the old fashioned way at 877-GAME-OLR.
8548000	8549000	Loki.
8549000	8555000	So, even though I did get the Gear VR today, there are other VR things coming out.
8555000	8561000	Including, of course, we have some information now on the HTC Vive.
8561000	8565000	And they're going to be releasing that for $800.
8565000	8568000	And you can actually preorder that now as well.
8568000	8572000	And it's going to be starting to ship in April.
8572000	8578000	And, of course, that $800 gets you the Vive with all the two controllers.
8578000	8579000	So that looks pretty awesome.
8579000	8583000	The thing is, I watched some videos on the Vive, actually, this week.
8583000	8589000	One of those being the portal robot repair demo thing that they had, which looks fucking awesome.
8589000	8596000	And I was like, man, if I'm going to get one for PC, the Vive does look pretty good, even though it is so expensive.
8596000	8602000	But if it was giving me an option like, okay, you can pick one or the other and we'll give it to you,
8602000	8605000	I'd probably choose the Vive because it looks pretty fantastic.
8605000	8608000	So, nice.
8608000	8610000	And you do also get some free apps as well.
8610000	8615000	Tilt Brush Paint app, the fantastic contraption, and Job Simulator.
8615000	8617000	So those will be coming with that.
8617000	8620000	Well, cutting edge toys are usually pretty expensive.
8620000	8621000	It looks pretty cutting edge.
8621000	8623000	Plus, it does have the actual control wands as well.
8623000	8631000	So, I mean, we haven't really seen too much as far as what, I don't know if they had a cost yet for the controllers for the Oculus Rift.
8631000	8635000	So maybe with all that added in there, it might end up being about $800.
8635000	8636000	So we'll see.
8636000	8639000	I'm dying to see how PlayStation VR is going to change this dynamic.
8639000	8642000	I mean, again, I realize it's very different.
8642000	8643000	It's not PC, it's console.
8643000	8645000	But we're all curious to see what that's going to look like.
8645000	8647000	We'll know in what, two more weeks?
8647000	8649000	I hope so.
8649000	8651000	Excited to see how that's going to change the game.
8651000	8652000	I am very curious.
8652000	8660000	And then if you want to drop even more money for tech that's really not done yet, HoloLens, the developers edition, will be available for $3,000.
8660000	8663000	But hey, with that $3,000, you get two games.
8663000	8668000	So it comes with Young Conquer and a couple other mini games.
8668000	8671000	Yes, it's really for developers only.
8671000	8675000	And of course, you know, if you like that narrow field of view, then you're going to love it.
8675000	8681000	I really want a HoloLens, but not for $3,000 and not at its current state.
8682000	8688000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat, and he said this several times throughout the evening, is pretty adamant that HoloLens is not a gaming device.
8688000	8698000	And although I'm not necessarily going to disagree because some of the Kinect's biggest capabilities had nothing to do with gaming, I will say, but yet they are including games with it.
8698000	8702000	So, I mean, you can't say games are banned from it.
8702000	8703000	Yeah, exactly.
8703000	8709000	And you can't say it's a non-gaming device when that's all I've seen on it so far as far as demonstrations go.
8709000	8712000	But with the dev kits out there, we'll hopefully see some new stuff.
8712000	8721000	Yeah, exactly. And I'm not saying that they can't implement, you know, like real life, you know, like medical practice, you know, applications, stuff like that.
8721000	8730000	But fucking hell, I mean, they've been showing Minecraft, they've been touting Minecraft a lot, and they've been showing like shooter games and shit that they have with it.
8730000	8733000	And plus, you know, showing that you can watch all these things on your walls.
8733000	8738000	I'm down with, you know, the whole application things and like, you know, popping my apps onto the wall in the room around me.
8738000	8740000	And so I think that's pretty cool.
8740000	8746000	Games would be, you know, a small portion of that, but still it doesn't function with that sense either.
8746000	8748000	I mean, it's fucking narrow as shit.
8748000	8752000	I mean, so I can't support that in its current state.
8752000	8754000	Well, I feel like we got a long way to go.
8754000	8758000	Like, you know, I kind of think, OK, well, what kinds of things besides games could be used for?
8758000	8761000	And I go like, well, maybe like architecture type of stuff.
8761000	8764000	Well, yeah, I can see where maybe in that in the modeling would be kind of cool.
8764000	8772000	I mean, I'm down with that, but it's still very, you know, we need to see some better hardware.
8774000	8782000	Maybe a type of application since, you know, it's AR instead of VR, maybe something where like it actually makes all the people around you naked.
8782000	8783000	I hope so.
8783000	8786000	That's not a game, but it sure would be fun.
8788000	8790000	Ugly significant other fixer.
8792000	8797000	Rageinator chat over at life.vog network dot com says HoloLens porn anyone?
8798000	8801000	That's what. Oh, is that why Bobby keeps saying it's not a gaming device?
8801000	8804000	Because it's for porn, obviously, if it is.
8804000	8807000	Can you imagine like you could surround yourself with porn.
8807000	8809000	Bobby, can I say it's for porn?
8809000	8811000	It's for porn, right?
8811000	8812000	Everything is for porn.
8812000	8815000	Seriously, it's it's just unbelievable.
8815000	8818000	You could have you could have porn all around you.
8818000	8822000	You could be surrounded 360 degrees by porn and you can do.
8823000	8825000	Yeah, it's for porn.
8826000	8830000	Act Defton chat says anything is the gateway for porn.
8830000	8835000	It's not a fucking gateway. It's a fucking holodeck of porn minus, you know, the interaction.
8835000	8840000	Bobby Blackwell says the low field of vision will kill porn.
8840000	8841000	That's true.
8841000	8844000	I'm going to need a really big field of vision.
8845000	8848000	Maybe second gen.
8848000	8855000	You are me because seriously, that's like, you know, experiencing porn porn through a spyglass or something like that.
8855000	8859000	It's like, listen, if you're doing like a peeping Tom app or something like that, that's OK.
8859000	8863000	But like just anything else, it just really takes you out of it.
8865000	8867000	All right.
8868000	8870000	Oh, God. All right.
8870000	8873000	All right. Let's move on one more story for you guys.
8873000	8876000	And it has to do with Steam and buying games on Steam and all this stuff.
8876000	8882000	But hey, you know, this is even though we talk a lot about this one marketplace here on the store, it is the way a lot of people are buying games.
8882000	8889000	And this is a pretty exciting change is that the way that bundle prices work is going to be changing on Steam,
8889000	8897000	allowing for a more dynamic pricing model that takes into account whether or not you own the games already featured in the bundle.
8897000	8904000	Now, apparently Valve has not actually officially announced this, but there's, I don't know, official documentation out there or what have you.
8904000	8909000	Long story short, you'll get a discount if you already own one of the included games.
8909000	8912000	This scales up depending on how many of those games you own.
8912000	8921000	In the documents, it says with Steam bundles, if a customer already owns some items in the bundle, they will pay for and receive only the items not already in their account.
8921000	8928000	This allows the best fans of your series or franchise to complete the set and get the deal on the remaining items in the bundles.
8928000	8937000	So, uh, yeah, I, you know, you always see like these huge developer bundles and then you go, but I already own like a quarter of them, so...
8937000	8942000	Yeah, unfortunately all those bundles are on, you know, fucking Humblebuddles, so that's not really gonna apply.
8943000	8950000	Yeah. YYR in chat says, Valve Complete Pack is now $12 for most people because you own most of it already.
8950000	8956000	Yeah, seriously, between like Portal and Portal 2 and, you know, Left 4 Dead and all those games.
8956000	8961000	It's like, okay, next time a Valve Complete Pack goes up, it won't cost me nearly as much.
8961000	8966000	Alright, I think it is time to open up the Skype line, so let's get to it.
8967000	8972000	We are gonna open it up over at, uh, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.
8972000	8978000	1877 Game O.L.R. the old-fashioned way. Wow, it's already lighting up, it's, oh my gosh, you guys are dying to get in tonight.
8978000	8980000	Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8980000	8982000	Hey, guys, it's Jason.
8982000	8983000	Hey, Jason, how you doing?
8983000	8986000	Doing, uh, pretty well. Been a pretty fun little weekend.
8986000	8988000	Good to hear from you and good to see you.
8988000	8990000	Uh, you guys, anyways.
8990000	8991000	Yes.
8991000	8993000	Not so much the radio listeners, but that's okay.
8993000	8997000	But I can see the progress on the beard. It looks very fluffy.
8997000	9002000	It, uh, yeah. No change, just letting it do its thing and doing that wonderfully.
9002000	9004000	Love it. What's on your mind tonight?
9004000	9010000	Um, when you were reading that email about Street Fighter V and reviews and that kind of stuff, it kinda...
9010000	9013000	Which one, Jason? Cause there was like three of them.
9013000	9020000	Uh, talking, talking, uh, the very first one talking about the eventual content additions to Street Fighter V
9020000	9025000	and in context of reviewing on release day or prior to release day release, uh, review copies
9025000	9029000	and, you know, games in the future if they significantly change.
9029000	9035000	Uh, and it just kind of brought back and I, it brought, it reminded myself of something that I said back
9035000	9039000	God, I think it was in like 2013 or 2014 or something like that.
9039000	9045000	Um, and it was, it was on that show. It was one of the, one of the, uh, shows at, uh, uh, the former studio
9045000	9048000	whose name I have completely forgotten, but prior to N7, naturally.
9048000	9049000	Um, it...
9049000	9056000	Uh, that was the tiny little broom closet space. Cause that was literally like our dining room was the studio.
9056000	9060000	Yes, especially given where the setup was. Absolutely. It was a nice apartment, but anyways.
9060000	9068000	Um, it's like, do we, is this, is this a foresight of needing to start dramatically doing reviews differently?
9068000	9075000	Uh, the point that I had made back then is that gaming, I used it in context mostly of first person shooters
9075000	9083000	and MMOs is that not only are MMOs sprawling worlds in both size and continuing updates,
9083000	9088000	but, uh, Titanfall attempted to do that in first person shooter.
9088000	9095000	I would call Destiny more of a first person shooter than an MMO because of the limited squad size, uh, limited party size.
9095000	9103000	Um, but there are more and more games that are adapting this long term, uh, this long term commitment,
9103000	9109000	pricing model irrelevant, you know, like, uh, no, there's no one specific definition of it,
9109000	9115000	but so many games are on this track to be able to actually live so long over time.
9115000	9123000	Um, Rocket League, I would step out on a limb and say Rocket League is the first sports class of game
9123000	9129000	that is doing that with the season rankings and the continuing content.
9129000	9136000	We'll see if it's anything more than just, uh, cute licenses, but there are plenty of games
9136000	9143000	because of the capabilities of PCs and consoles today that are opting for a life cycle of a game,
9143000	9153000	a life of a game, if not, and not just, you know, the EA, the NHL, the NFL, the NBA formula of one game every year.
9153000	9159000	You know, I think there's no easy answer to this, which of course you know is what I'm going to say,
9159000	9163000	but I kind of think, I kind of compare it to what do we see in other industries,
9163000	9167000	and I think what do reviews usually do in these types of artistic industries?
9167000	9172000	What is a review for a movie? What is a review for a concert? What is a review for a play?
9172000	9178000	It is for the money I spent and for the time I spent, how did I feel after the fact?
9178000	9182000	Like, how did the time and money I invested make me feel?
9182000	9184000	Because that's what a lot of this is.
9184000	9190000	And so I kind of think with games, that's kind of the way you have to approach it as well,
9190000	9194000	is that for the time and for the money I spent, or the money they're asking people to spend,
9194000	9198000	because we know in this case this is comped, but to be fair in the movie industry,
9198000	9201000	comped, plays, comped, a lot of that stuff is comped too.
9201000	9207000	It's kind of one of those, well then, what was your impression based off of your time with the product?
9207000	9211000	And that's why I'm kind of back with, if it's not there, it's not there.
9211000	9216000	And so I can't really say it in my review because I'm reviewing how was my time with it.
9216000	9223000	And you kind of also see this with a lot of games where the online mode isn't even on
9223000	9226000	because they haven't turned it on yet when the reviewers are trying to review it.
9226000	9233000	And so they say, well, we can't really review online mode, so this review is based on our experiences with this only.
9233000	9238000	Maybe this is why you have more and more places that are just, they're turning away from scores,
9238000	9242000	because, and I think this is part of why they turn away from scores,
9242000	9248000	because of what you're saying about how games are more dynamic, and I think Destiny is a great example.
9248000	9254000	I think, again, the way most people approach Destiny is that game was re-reviewed due to the expansion,
9254000	9261000	and the impression of most outlets was, hey, did you know? Destiny is a lot different now, and here's this expansion.
9261000	9272000	But I think the reason why a lot of places are getting rid of scores is because a lot of these games are living, breathing experiences
9272000	9275000	that can't necessarily be targeted on a scale of one to ten.
9275000	9279000	And we all know what a freaking emphasis the industry is placing on Metacritic,
9279000	9283000	and maybe we have to start getting away from that because of where the games are going.
9283000	9287000	Yeah, absolutely. It's a little strange to compare it to other mediums.
9287000	9299000	There are some comparisons that can be drawn, but in the list that you made, movies don't change except when, call them expansions, special editions.
9299000	9306000	Movies don't generally change, Clue being the most famous exception back in the day, the different movies, the different endings for different theaters.
9307000	9319000	Plays can change based off cast, and certainly there's the human factor of the performance and the energy, that word that God knows what it is
9319000	9326000	that actually makes you connect with it and enjoy it, like the same situation, location, cast, time of day, day of the week.
9326000	9332000	Everything can be identical, and it can be less enthusiastic and thrilling than otherwise.
9332000	9335000	It could also be the own fucking reviewer's fault as well.
9335000	9343000	It's a little strange to compare it to other media, but maybe that is my software bias of computing,
9343000	9348000	and the fact that I've known almost my whole life to know things evolve.
9348000	9356000	My freaking Mortal Kombat for the PC, I had to send whoever did the PC port,
9356000	9362000	I had to send Disc 1 back to them for newer hardware compatibility enhancements.
9362000	9372000	Floppy Disc 1 of 3, Mortal Kombat 1 for the PC back in 93, 94, 92, somewhere in the early 90s.
9372000	9375000	Like when I was in high school, yeah, probably like 93, 94.
9375000	9379000	I won't say how old I actually was then, if you're gonna play that game.
9379000	9380000	Let's not.
9381000	9388000	And gamers and technologists are the right crew to actually,
9388000	9392000	are the right group to actually make this change of getting away from review scores.
9392000	9400000	It's unfortunate, it's gonna tilt Metacritic down to certain review sites that grasp onto it to dear life,
9400000	9403000	but this is the group of people that I would put the most faith in,
9403000	9408000	being able to actually come up with a more compelling, more accessible,
9408000	9413000	more detailed in the things that you need to know of a system
9413000	9419000	for the changes that a larger and larger chunk of gaming is coming up with.
9419000	9424000	Let me end on this thought, kind of talking about the whole comparisons to the other media,
9424000	9428000	and I guess part of the reason why my brain always goes to the movies, the plays, the CDs and what have you,
9428000	9433000	is because it's all art, and I do believe, I firmly believe video games are art.
9433000	9437000	All of those different mediums are about expression, and video games are another form of expression.
9437000	9441000	And the thing about art, art is interpretation.
9441000	9446000	And that's why reviews are never, this issue can never really be solved easily,
9446000	9450000	because the way you interpret something and the way I interpret something are always going to be different.
9450000	9451000	And that's...
9451000	9454000	One of the only pieces of art on a fully dynamic canvas though.
9454000	9456000	That is art.
9456000	9457000	Absolutely.
9457000	9460000	Okay, my friend, I gotta let you go so we can squeeze in some more calls, but always good to hear from you.
9460000	9461000	Have a good night.
9461000	9462000	Take care, you too.
9462000	9463000	See you.
9463000	9467000	Our buddy Jason, you hear his voice at the beginning and at the end of every show here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9467000	9471000	1877 game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9471000	9475000	Over at chatoveratlive.vognetwork.com, Kaijuto says,
9475000	9476000	video games are fart.
9479000	9481000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9481000	9483000	Hi, this is Rachie Nader.
9483000	9485000	Long time, welcome back.
9485000	9486000	I know, really.
9486000	9487000	You sound better, too.
9487000	9489000	I can tell you've had some upgrades over there.
9489000	9490000	You sound better.
9490000	9498000	It's probably the building mic in this external webcam that I got with my computer.
9498000	9501000	Well, it's a much better quality than before.
9501000	9502000	What's on your mind, my friend?
9502000	9504000	Not a whole lot.
9504000	9508000	It's kind of related to what you were just saying.
9509000	9514000	I'm kind of bragging about not bragging about my computer,
9514000	9520000	because this is honestly the nicest thing that I've had in a very long time.
9520000	9526000	Well, I know the listeners can't see the video feed on my Skype call.
9526000	9527000	It's better.
9527000	9531000	Yeah, well, I was going to move my webcam real quick.
9531000	9532000	I just got out.
9532000	9535000	Be careful where I'm pointing, because I'm not wearing pants right now.
9535000	9538000	Not wearing pants right now.
9538000	9543000	But, yeah, that's the computer right there.
9543000	9548000	It's a Cybertron PC right there.
9548000	9554000	Plus, you see that little box sitting on top of my PC there?
9554000	9557000	That's an external Blu-ray drive right there.
9557000	9558000	Nice little drive.
9558000	9561000	Now, keep in mind, the listeners can't really see what I'm seeing,
9561000	9564000	so I'm going to kind of try to summarize as best I can.
9564000	9566000	But, yeah, I can definitely see all the parts of the computer there.
9566000	9570000	And I think, is that your bank account open on your desktop?
9570000	9572000	Can you point the camera back over that way?
9574000	9576000	Can you zoom in on your account number?
9576000	9577000	I'm kidding.
9577000	9578000	It's iTunes.
9578000	9579000	It's nothing.
9579000	9580000	All right.
9580000	9581000	Well, congrats on the new computer.
9581000	9585000	I know that's been a long investment and a big thing for you.
9585000	9589000	And I can just tell you're just excited to have it and be using it again
9589000	9590000	and be back in action.
9590000	9593000	So, let me ask this.
9593000	9594000	You got everything up and running.
9594000	9595000	You got your new computer and all this stuff.
9595000	9597000	What was the first game you had to go get?
9597000	9599000	The first game where you were like, we're going to play this.
9599000	9601000	Excuse me.
9601000	9602000	Coffee and spell.
9602000	9608000	Well, before I had my internet turned back on,
9608000	9611000	I was basically, for lack of a better term,
9611000	9620000	stuck playing my good old games that I had stored locally on some external hard drives.
9620000	9623000	And I'd been playing a lot of those.
9623000	9630000	I was playing like the original Flat Out, Oddworld, Abe's Odyssey,
9630000	9634000	and the Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3, stuff like that.
9635000	9642000	Now that I've had my internet on for a week now and had access to Steam and all that,
9642000	9648000	I've been playing Magic the Gallery in 2014, obviously.
9648000	9649000	Of course.
9649000	9656000	Yeah, and of course, I also tried some of the games that I previously had trouble with
9656000	9663000	with my last PC, such as Portal 2 and Brutal Legends, so on and so forth.
9663000	9668000	All the stuff that they tried to deny me before, I will now...
9668000	9673000	And I can honestly say that none of my games are giving me trouble now.
9673000	9674000	Good.
9674000	9675000	None.
9675000	9676000	Good.
9676000	9681000	Yeah, the only downside to this new PC, if you want to call it such,
9681000	9688000	is that earlier today I did have a little bit of difficulty with putting in the new RAM, though,
9688000	9695000	because the machine did come with 4GB of RAM already pre-installed.
9695000	9702000	I ordered some extra RAM, 8GB worth, and I kid you not,
9702000	9708000	it got to a point where I seriously thought I fucked up my brand new machine
9708000	9711000	and I was ready to shit and piss myself right there.
9711000	9714000	I'm like, oh my God, I screwed up my machine!
9714000	9717000	Anybody doing that kind of stuff always has that moment.
9717000	9723000	You know, Alan built the computer I use now, and there was plenty of those moments where it was like,
9723000	9728000	did you just fuck up all this equipment that I just dropped an extraordinary amount of money on?
9728000	9731000	But we worked through it. It worked out.
9731000	9733000	There's always that moment, though.
9733000	9744000	Yeah, well, luckily, between Tiger Claw's advice and the little trial and error on my end,
9744000	9748000	I managed to figure out what the problem was, so on and so forth,
9748000	9754000	and obviously, by virtue of fact, I have a PC ad right now talking to you via Skype.
9754000	9757000	Obviously, it managed to get fixed, so.
9757000	9761000	But so far, I'm loving everything.
9761000	9765000	Eventually, sooner or later, I'm going to have to upgrade my video card,
9765000	9773000	but I'm not in a big rush for that right now, and, you know, not only that,
9773000	9779000	but another thing I want to do is get a gaming mouse and keyboard,
9779000	9783000	but those two items are kind of like low priority.
9783000	9788000	I'm more interested in upgrading my graphics or video card more than anything, so.
9788000	9791000	Sure. I'm even looking into doing that, so.
9791000	9795000	All right. Well, Ray Jr., my friend, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls,
9795000	9799000	but I'm so happy to hear you're up and running, and I'm sure we'll hear from you again.
9799000	9801000	Sure, sounds good. I'll talk to you soon.
9801000	9802000	Yep, take care, buddy.
9802000	9803000	All right, bye, Ray.
9803000	9804000	Bye.
9804000	9807000	All right, wow, lots of calls coming in tonight.
9807000	9810000	Orange On Radio, I want a word on Skype, but we got another call right now.
9810000	9812000	Hi, you're on Orange On Radio. Who's this?
9812000	9814000	Hey, what's going on, brother?
9814000	9817000	Hey, not much. I'm good. I'm running on fumes at this point.
9817000	9819000	I'm so tired, but I'm good.
9819000	9823000	The show does give me a little second wind, so it's not like I'm dragging,
9823000	9827000	but it's like after this show is done and it's edited and posted, I'll be going to bed.
9827000	9829000	Bro, I know exactly what you mean.
9829000	9834000	When I podcast, thankfully, right by my computer is my coffee maker,
9834000	9837000	so I put a pot on so I can make it through the show.
9837000	9841000	You know, and there was a time when I would just kind of put the show up
9841000	9845000	whenever I felt like it, basically, and I would fall so far behind
9845000	9849000	that people really started to call me out on it when shows were posting a week late and stuff,
9849000	9852000	and it was like, all right, I really have to force myself.
9852000	9857000	If I don't post the night the show is recording, unless I have a really big circumstance,
9857000	9861000	because sometimes there's a tech problem or something, there's nothing you can do about that,
9861000	9865000	then it's like, I have to do it right away, or I know myself, it's not going to get done.
9865000	9869000	Now, now, sir, you are no Travis Donovan.
9869000	9875000	Now, now, don't pick on him just because he's not here to defend himself.
9875000	9879000	Hopefully he's doing well in retirement, yelling at kids to get off his lawn.
9879000	9883000	True, true, true. I know if it wasn't for him, Anime Jam Station probably wouldn't be where it is,
9883000	9885000	but I'm allowed one.
9885000	9890000	That's right. There's always time to take a shot at Travis. What's on your mind tonight?
9890000	9895000	Okay, um, so, well, you mentioned Adios Motherfucker earlier in the show tonight.
9895000	9896000	Yes, I did.
9896000	9904000	My mind flipped back to Fandame when I roomed with Dark Soccer, Andrew and crew,
9904000	9911000	and I think we actually went looking for a bar that knew, and a bartender who knew how to make that drink.
9912000	9917000	I'm almost positive it's almost the exact same thing as the Long Island, except instead of the soda,
9917000	9922000	it's like that blue, I don't remember what they call it, but it's that blue stuff.
9922000	9923000	Blue Caraco.
9923000	9926000	That's it, Blue Caraco. I'm almost positive that's it.
9926000	9929000	It's just the Long Island, but they put the Blue Caraco in it instead.
9929000	9932000	And for some reason, the blue makes it taste better.
9932000	9936000	Act DEFT in Chat says Windex. That's what it looks like.
9936000	9939000	That's what it looks like, you're just drinking Windex.
9939000	9945000	And honestly, it probably fucks you up even worse than Windex, but, you know.
9945000	9947000	Something like that.
9947000	9951000	SSG100Matt actually found, it's amazing the things you can find on Google,
9951000	9956000	but he actually found a little link to one of those drink mix sites and what is in it.
9956000	9962000	So it says, according to this site, it's one ounce vodka, one ounce gin, one ounce white rum,
9962000	9968000	one ounce Blue Caraco liquor, six ounce sweet and sour mix, and six ounce 7Up soda.
9968000	9970000	Oh, they do put a little soda in it.
9970000	9973000	Okay, my bar doesn't even bother with the soda.
9973000	9978000	That sounds almost like my bar as well.
9978000	9980000	What a waste.
9980000	9983000	You have the sweet and sour mix in there, that's your non-alcoholic part.
9983000	9985000	There you go.
9985000	9987000	Is that all you called in about was drinks?
9987000	9993000	No! No, but since we're on that topic, I'm not gonna get up and pour a shot.
9993000	9995000	No, I'm not gonna do that. Not tonight.
9996000	9998000	I also want to talk about NARC real quick.
9998000	10004000	Now, I may have brought this up in a previous episode, or someone else might have,
10004000	10013000	but the character Max Force was part of a cartoon series called The Power Team.
10013000	10018000	This came on during, I believe, the mid to late 90s.
10018000	10022000	It was part of a show called Video Power.
10023000	10025000	Oh, yeah.
10027000	10029000	So, you remember that show, too?
10029000	10036000	Vaguely. I remember of it, but I'm trying to Google it right now to get the images back in my mind,
10036000	10039000	but I remember Video Power, like, vaguely.
10039000	10041000	With Johnny Arcade.
10041000	10043000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10043000	10048000	Well, you mentioned that, when Darkstalker mentioned that, I was like, Power Team video.
10048000	10052000	It all came back to me, because I used to get up at 6.30 in the morning to watch this show.
10052000	10057000	He would come in and do the intro, they would do the cartoon, and then right afterwards,
10057000	10062000	there would be a quick review of the game, and then there would be a tip or a clue.
10062000	10070000	And mind you, most of the games and tips were acclaimed video games, thus the sponsor and thus the team.
10071000	10077000	Okay, yes, this was the show where they would run around with the Velcro and, like, try to get as much stuff
10077000	10079000	and stick it to the Velcro as they could, right?
10079000	10083000	Oh, yeah, I remember you used to stick, like, Nintendo Entertainment System boxes to themselves.
10083000	10084000	Like, on their head.
10084000	10085000	Really ginormous.
10085000	10086000	Yes.
10086000	10092000	And Genesis and Neo Geo, yes, that was the second season of Video Power when they retooled it into a game show.
10092000	10095000	Okay, that's the Video Power I remember.
10097000	10098000	Yep.
10098000	10103000	But yes, I'm looking a little bit on Wikipedia and I see that the season one was different.
10103000	10106000	Okay, I only remember the second part of that, I don't remember the first season.
10106000	10108000	That's weird that they would change it so radically.
10110000	10115000	I don't know, I guess for ratings, I suppose, you know, because I remember the second season,
10115000	10118000	they moved it from 6.30am to 8.30am.
10118000	10128000	YYR chat says, I totally forgot about Video Power, OMG, WTF, Tigerclaw found a YouTube of it.
10128000	10130000	Of course it's on YouTube!
10130000	10131000	Mm-hmm.
10131000	10132000	Of course.
10132000	10135000	Alright, well, thank you for the walk down memory lane, Rama.
10135000	10137000	Anything else you want to share with us tonight?
10137000	10144000	Quick thing, Microsoft Store, Fifth Avenue, we're having a division release launch party with Major Nelson.
10144000	10145000	Oh, nice.
10145000	10147000	Tell him I said hi.
10147000	10150000	Will do, I'm working the release party that night, so.
10150000	10153000	He has no idea who the fuck I am, but tell him I said hi anyway.
10153000	10158000	And if he actually remembers you, you best believe I will call you and tell you this.
10158000	10162000	Sounds good, no, he will not know who the hell I am, but that's fine, I can pretend.
10162000	10164000	Fair enough, fair enough.
10164000	10165000	Alright, take care my friend.
10165000	10168000	Yeah, one more thing, Loki, have a Snickers.
10168000	10172000	You turn into a real bad cranky pants when you don't eat.
10172000	10174000	He did eat though.
10174000	10178000	I did, I cooked actual, I don't know what exactly it was.
10178000	10184000	It was my wife's design, apparently she likes taking recipes and fucking them up, so.
10184000	10191000	It was supposed, no seriously, because it was supposed to be like a cheesesteak soup,
10191000	10198000	but she's like, I don't want it with the cheese, I do want it with barley though, and mushrooms.
10198000	10203000	And so I made it, it was pretty good, it just, it would have been better with cheese in it because it was intended to have cheese in it.
10203000	10211000	It was more like a French onion soup without, French onion soup with steak and mushrooms and barley in it.
10211000	10214000	If dinner didn't come in a bag, it's just not gonna work.
10214000	10220000	No, it's really, it's really filling, it's just, I'm gonna melt cheese on it next time and it'll be even better, so.
10221000	10230000	Rob, if you can see my facial expression now, it's like a mind full of fuck, because I'm trying to wrap my head around the concept of cheesesteak soup.
10230000	10235000	Well it has cheese in it, you melt the cheese in the soup and it's actually like mixed in there.
10235000	10242000	Like I've made, I've made like a, there was one I made that was like a cheesy leek soup or something like that and it was really good.
10242000	10247000	But there was one that had like cream and like broth and it was just good.
10248000	10249000	Alright.
10249000	10253000	Uh oh, because if I mention this to my friends from Philly, they'd probably kick my ass.
10256000	10259000	Alright, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you for the call.
10259000	10261000	No problem dude, y'all take care.

10262000	10263000	Bye.
10263000	10267000	Alright, I am gonna wrap up for now. I'm very sorry to those that didn't get through.
10267000	10274000	Uh, we, I just, it's after nine o'clock, I gotta wrap things up, because uh, yeah, I'm ready to edit the show and hit the hay.

10316000	10323000	Uh, a nice five star review goes a long way as well on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show.
10323000	10325000	Uh, really appreciate that.
10325000	10330000	Uh, word of mouth is all we got here, we're not a multi-million dollar website or anything like that.
10330000	10333000	It's just us, yo, in my spare room.
10333000	10337000	About time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but then we will see you again in seven days.
10337000	10348000	We will be back here next week in the, uh, lead up to GDC, which is, uh, you know, not usually a media event, but with the whole PlayStation VR thing looming, it should be an exciting year.
10348000	10350000	But meanwhile, getting everybody's final thoughts tonight.
10350000	10352000	Loki, what's it gonna be, your final thoughts on that?
10352000	10361000	My final thought is I'm gonna work on my game this week, hopefully a little bit more, and I may try to come up with something for the Gear VR to mess around with.
10361000	10366000	I already have an idea of something that'd be kind of fun, so we will try that.
10366000	10374000	Alright, and my final thought is goodnight. We'll see you in seven days, everybody. Goodnight!
10396000	10406000	See you next week!
10426000	10436000	See you next week!
