00:00.000 --> 00:17.560
This week the future gets a little bit clearer during GDC week with an official price for

00:17.560 --> 00:21.200
PlayStation VR and a patent based possibility for Nintendo's NX controller.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.400
Convention weeks mean plenty of news and information to cover and it all starts right now on the

00:24.400 --> 00:29.760
show where every gamer has a voice.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.880
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

00:34.880 --> 00:42.720
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 635 March 20th

00:42.720 --> 00:49.040
of 2016. Here we are assembled in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:49.040 --> 00:56.080
lifestyle with myself Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E and over there DarkSakura or

00:56.080 --> 01:02.400
Jamie Summers. Oh hi. Hi how are you doing? I'm all right how are you? Good, good. How has your day

01:02.400 --> 01:10.680
been? I planted things. Did you? I played outside. Were you playing Stardew Valley or was this IRL?

01:10.680 --> 01:15.640
It was IRL yo. Although you if you haven't tried it yet you need to try that Stardew Valley I'm

01:15.640 --> 01:20.000
telling you. I think you'd love it. Shane keeps telling me about it even though he's not playing

01:20.000 --> 01:24.880
games. I was like wait Shane isn't even playing games. He's doing what he does best enabling

01:24.880 --> 01:32.680
others. He's an enabler I know but um but no I we've got some some of those decorative plants in

01:32.680 --> 01:37.040
my backyard are dead. Yeah. And so I'm putting actually useful plants back there. Nice. Like

01:37.040 --> 01:42.120
rosemary. And Venus fly traps. I wish I could put picture plants back there but you have to live in

01:42.120 --> 01:47.480
a swamp. You know once at my old job I had years and years ago before OLR I had a desk and one day

01:47.480 --> 01:50.320
they were like we're gonna go nice enough the office we're gonna go get everybody some plants

01:50.320 --> 01:54.600
for their desk to nice and things up and you know they asked everybody what they wanted and everybody

01:54.640 --> 01:57.800
was saying things they said Rob what do you want on your desk I was like hmm I want a Venus fly

01:57.800 --> 02:03.440
trap and bless their hearts they brought me back a Venus fly trap to put on my desk and I was like

02:03.440 --> 02:09.120
this is cool. Of course you have to you have to really resist the urge to trigger the trap with

02:09.120 --> 02:12.800
your pencil because you know that's gonna kill it because you know it has to actually be a fly.

02:12.800 --> 02:19.320
But I did come into work one day and the jaws were shut and I was like oh did its job. Nice.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.840
I wish it had had something like that at the place that I used to work because there would

02:24.840 --> 02:29.960
be like little fruit flies hanging out on some of the plants. A Venus fly trap would have been

02:29.960 --> 02:36.040
pretty useful then. Very useful. Also also useful here on this program every week in studio we are

02:36.040 --> 02:41.120
joined except last week we were joined by tech master Loki. Yeah. Welcome back. How are you?

02:41.120 --> 02:48.880
Yeah. Yeah. Oh that good huh? No it's just dinner was yeah. Oh I see the fast fast food you picked

02:48.880 --> 02:52.440
up. It was not good. Well I couldn't decide what I wanted and I was like well I can get a sandwich.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.400
That was already once on the free. I was like well that's way far away now. So I'm like eh let's get

02:57.400 --> 03:03.560
Jack in the Box and the Jack in the Box is not no it was not up the par today. Had like a quarter

03:03.560 --> 03:07.400
of that burger and threw the fries away because they were just limping nasties. Sorry to hear

03:07.400 --> 03:11.160
that. That's all right it happens you know. Real problems you know what you should go back and

03:11.160 --> 03:15.400
complain that's what people do. Complain. Yeah I don't think so. I don't want more free food of

03:15.400 --> 03:22.320
that. No I'll just it's it's fine. All right. Well you know it what there is plenty of bacon

03:22.320 --> 03:28.640
but the bacon tasted like it had like I don't know buffalo wing sauce on it or something it

03:28.640 --> 03:35.880
just tastes it off so no. Hopefully it wasn't one of those things where somebody like you know like

03:35.880 --> 03:39.800
messed with the sauce or something. No their their bacon sometimes tastes like that. I think it's

03:39.800 --> 03:44.440
just if it's older. Well it's fast food quality. It's no it was not good today. There's no old

03:44.480 --> 03:49.040
adage you get what you pay for. You guys are in our chat room every week of course over at

03:49.040 --> 03:54.080
live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network

03:54.080 --> 03:59.920
vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show where SSG100Matt is in chat saying yeah I

03:59.920 --> 04:07.320
could have used a fly trap at my old job. A lot of gnats. That sounds kind of gnats-ty. Get it?

04:08.200 --> 04:15.200
All right. We have some special guests here in studio. This is fun. So Jamie has a bestie

04:15.200 --> 04:21.080
and Jamie's besties name is Becky and Becky's here in studio tonight and sometimes she she's

04:21.080 --> 04:25.200
she's brought us cakes and things like that in the past. We love when Becky comes to visit even

04:25.200 --> 04:29.160
even without food just to say hello. How are you doing Becky? I'm doing pretty well thank you.

04:29.160 --> 04:33.880
Awesome. Great to have you here. And Becky you've brought someone very special with you to the show.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.880
Do you want to introduce who else you brought with you tonight? I did indeed. I brought one of my

04:38.880 --> 04:45.960
personal favorite people on this planet. I may be a little biased given that he came from my body.

04:45.960 --> 05:01.120
You say that like it's another planet. Oh some people might wonder. Anyway here he is. Say hi.

05:01.680 --> 05:07.120
Hello. Hey welcome to the show. It's Julian right? Yeah. Welcome Julian to Orange Launch

05:07.120 --> 05:12.720
Radio. How are you doing? Good. Good. So Julian you're a bit of a gamer right? Yes. What kind of

05:12.720 --> 05:23.320
games do you play? I play a lot of Minecraft, pirate 101, and platforming games. Platforming

05:23.320 --> 05:28.960
games. What are those? What are platforming games to you? Um mostly the platforming games that I play

05:28.960 --> 05:36.280
are like pac-man platform 2. Pac-man platform 2. I don't. That's a flash. One of the flash games

05:36.280 --> 05:42.040
isn't it? Oh yeah. Okay okay. You like little internet flash games. You like some of those

05:42.040 --> 05:52.680
sim games on Xbox don't you as well? I also play a lot of what's it called? Disney infinity. That's

05:52.680 --> 05:57.240
right because when you you came in here you saw my little Sam Flynn over there from Disney infinity

05:57.240 --> 06:01.080
and you asked me if I had Disney infinity I was like no I just had the figure. You know why?

06:01.080 --> 06:06.000
Because Tron is really cool. Have you seen Tron? Yeah. No I have not. You need to ask your mother

06:06.000 --> 06:12.200
to see Tron. Becky. Becky you let me down over here. You got to educate the kid on Tron. That's

06:12.200 --> 06:16.520
okay I'm just I'm just giving her a hard time. That one I tried to convince him to watch before

06:16.520 --> 06:20.920
and he's like eh no it doesn't look good. That's good. All right we'll revisit this. Yeah yeah

06:20.920 --> 06:27.160
revisit this conversation a little later. That's right. Julian what about your Lego games? You're

06:27.160 --> 06:33.560
playing Lego Star Wars for a while. I played yeah I play a lot of Lego Star Wars. I also play Lego

06:33.560 --> 06:40.800
Marvel and the Lego movie game. Now are these now Loki you play the Lego games are these the same

06:40.800 --> 06:43.680
ones you've been playing? The Lego Marvel right? You talked about that on the show. Yeah we play

06:43.680 --> 06:49.400
Lego Marvel and then Lego Avengers and Disney Infinity 3.0. Now have you played the Lego

06:49.400 --> 06:54.080
dimensions where you have like the real Legos that you put on the little portals? No I have

06:54.080 --> 06:58.080
not but I've heard of it. It's kind of a waste of space let me tell you. It's kind of it's kind of

06:58.080 --> 07:03.360
a lot of junk. No it's it's kind of cool but the the regular Lego games are cool by themselves too.

07:03.360 --> 07:11.920
How old are you Julian? I'm eight. My birthday is coming up and I'll be nine on April 27. I'm

07:11.920 --> 07:17.920
celebrating it on the 24th. Oh well are you inviting all our listeners to your party? I'm

07:17.960 --> 07:22.440
just kidding don't don't invite them some of them are weird. All right. What's wrong with weird?

07:22.440 --> 07:32.120
I suppose that's true. This is a show that myself and Jamie and Matt all co-host after all. So tell

07:32.120 --> 07:36.520
us tell us a little more about Minecraft because you you know you're you know more than me when it

07:36.520 --> 07:40.800
comes to Minecraft. Like you were playing on that tablet and you were like you want to see cool

07:40.800 --> 07:45.880
stuff and you put all these creepers into a little hole and then you blew them all up. And then and

07:45.920 --> 07:51.000
then got a bunch of experience. Yeah. What's your favorite thing to do in Minecraft? Do you like do

07:51.000 --> 07:56.640
you like to just do like crazy stuff or or do you try to like actually play the game and build a

07:56.640 --> 08:04.560
house and all that? What do you do in Minecraft? I usually go to creative mode. It's survivally

08:04.560 --> 08:10.960
like if that's even a word. It is we make up words here on this show don't worry. Okay good.

08:10.960 --> 08:22.280
Was I gonna say you? I think you're gonna tell us more about what you do in Minecraft. I usually

08:22.280 --> 08:30.400
build a house and chant a bunch of good weapons actually chant armor usually use diamond armor

08:30.400 --> 08:36.240
and then I build an ender portal and go to the end and fight the ender dragon. I know how to get

08:36.240 --> 08:45.880
the egg so what you do how I do it is you press LT on the egg dig two blocks down dig dig straight

08:45.880 --> 08:53.720
one block put a redstone torch or torch break the block above the torch fall down on the torch and

08:53.720 --> 08:59.880
break and then you have the egg. Well there you go tips from Julian on Minecraft y'all in chat

08:59.880 --> 09:06.920
over at live.vognetwork.com. Now when I hate I hate saying that I just wish you I hate saying

09:06.920 --> 09:11.360
these words that are about to come out of my mouth but I have to say it when I was your age Julian

09:11.360 --> 09:17.400
we were playing games like the Oregon Trail have you ever played the Oregon Trail? No I have not

09:17.400 --> 09:22.800
I've never even heard of it. Yeah I know it's kind of yeah in the Oregon Trail it was it was a game

09:22.800 --> 09:27.880
that we played to learn about history because you know way back when and that was what we're

09:27.880 --> 09:31.840
supposed to be learning about that I thought it's about efficient hunting. Way back when in

09:31.840 --> 09:36.520
the 1800s before there were cars or any of that when people wanted to come to California because

09:36.520 --> 09:40.800
of the gold they had to come in covered wagons and they took something called the Oregon Trail

09:40.800 --> 09:45.000
because you could also go to Oregon you go to California you go to Oregon so this is a game

09:45.000 --> 09:49.640
where we learned about that but you also did weird things like you would hunt buffalo and you

09:49.640 --> 09:53.600
would type in the names of your friends you're gonna bring on you with your journey but sometimes

09:53.640 --> 09:59.920
they would die of dysentery and it was really weird. What? Yeah I know right? What even is dysentery?

09:59.920 --> 10:06.000
It's bad I don't know what it is but it's bad. It's a disease it has to deal with having very

10:06.000 --> 10:10.800
bad infections and probably awful diarrhea. Yeah well that's oh this is weird let's not talk about

10:10.800 --> 10:17.600
it so all right. How'd we go from Minecraft to that? Welcome to the show Julian. That's the type

10:17.600 --> 10:24.240
of games we had to play have you have you played like games that were cool when we were your age

10:24.240 --> 10:29.760
have you played any like older games you ever played like old-school Nintendo games? Um I've

10:29.760 --> 10:36.600
gone to Stragman Evils and played those games. Wait what he went where? Homestarrunner.com. Oh

10:36.600 --> 10:45.520
he played the Homestarrunner games. Those are the closest to old games I've played. Well one of these

10:45.520 --> 10:51.360
Pac-man also Pac-man that's that's considered old game. Okay played all those Capcom games with

10:51.360 --> 10:59.720
Dan. You played um the King Arthur game? Yeah those were fun. They were so good he doesn't

10:59.720 --> 11:04.920
remember. He played the Capcom he and Dan were playing the Capcom classics one of those

11:04.920 --> 11:10.280
collections. Yeah I'm just Minecraft there's a lot you can do in that they didn't have things

11:10.280 --> 11:17.520
like that when when I was 8. We had this thing called logo that what you did you told the turtle

11:17.520 --> 11:23.760
you'd say draw forward 30 and then turn right 30 and then it might make a little picture and that

11:23.760 --> 11:30.600
was like the highlight of your day. Does that sound fun? Um no. No it wasn't very fun you're right it wasn't very fun.

11:30.600 --> 11:37.440
Let's see over at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com actdeft and chat says Julian

11:37.480 --> 11:43.400
was spot-on on any new listener to the show. Dungeon Buster says Julian should play ET the

11:43.400 --> 11:51.480
extraterrestrial. Have you ever seen the movie ET? Um I've seen the movie and no. No thank you.

11:51.480 --> 11:57.360
Well they can you believe it they made a game based on the movie and back in the day it used

11:57.360 --> 12:04.040
to take one guy to make a game so one guy made that game in six weeks and can you imagine how

12:04.040 --> 12:09.560
it turned out? It's it sound like it turned out it would suck. Yeah you know what it turns out

12:09.560 --> 12:15.400
you're right it did not turn out very good at all. Even with like a bunch of people that you

12:15.400 --> 12:20.680
have to work it on like for like three years and then it turned out. You should be a manager at

12:20.680 --> 12:26.400
Atari because you make better decisions than they did in the 80s. In fact probably better decisions

12:26.400 --> 12:34.000
than they do today. Just say have you ever played driver 3? It's awful it's awful. It's awfully good

12:34.000 --> 12:40.480
is what he means to say. All right awesome do you now okay so so in chat over at live.vognetware.com

12:40.480 --> 12:45.640
YYR says Julian is the next great game designer. Well maybe maybe I don't do you want to make games

12:45.640 --> 12:50.840
or you which or you just want to play them? I was actually interested in it. What inspired me is I

12:50.840 --> 12:58.920
noticed my initials JDS. So so your initials inspired you to do game design? Yeah because my

12:58.920 --> 13:07.960
last two initials are DS. Oh I see what he did his initials are DS it's a sign. Becky was that

13:07.960 --> 13:14.360
planned when you named him that you. It was actually just I was looking for initials that

13:14.360 --> 13:19.400
would sound cool together I figured if anybody was gonna give him nicknames like JD. JD works

13:19.400 --> 13:24.440
okay you know he's not gonna get his butt kicked on the playground initials like JD. All right

13:24.440 --> 13:29.000
awesome so that's a so because you're in okay so you know a lot of people are wondering what's

13:29.000 --> 13:33.480
the new Nintendo what could the new Nintendo system be maybe it will be a JDS and that will

13:33.480 --> 13:39.960
really be the sign my friend. Wouldn't that just be a Japanese DS? Maybe you're such a buzzkill dark

13:39.960 --> 13:45.880
side. I know. So Julian if if you were to make a game what kind of game do you think you'd make?

13:45.880 --> 14:00.360
I might play some I might not play what how do I get play um the game the games I would make

14:00.360 --> 14:07.200
are the types of game like pirate 101 I would make games like that. Okay I have to admit I don't know

14:07.200 --> 14:11.080
pirate 101 I played a game called puzzle pirates back in the day but I doubt it's the same thing

14:11.080 --> 14:18.960
what do you do in pirate 101 what's that game? So um it's your it starts off by being captured

14:18.960 --> 14:26.640
of the armada it's if you want me to explain the whole thing it's a real long story um give us a

14:26.640 --> 14:33.560
short version so um then there's a war they made the armada everything went well they made more

14:33.680 --> 14:42.000
and more and everything turned out bad okay um I picked a swashbuckler defend I defend my friends

14:42.000 --> 14:53.200
um so I got arrested by the armada. Well that's no fun did you go to jail? Um yeah by deacon the

14:53.200 --> 15:01.320
canes messenger canes was the first and wait did you have to bust out of jail or was like there's

15:01.320 --> 15:08.280
no getting out like it's a Korean jail like what happened um there is this pirate named boot beard

15:08.280 --> 15:19.160
or something and um came and the right when they came the back of the prison exploded awesome ran

15:19.160 --> 15:27.480
out free someone which was your first companion came out um killed some armada people. Let me

15:27.480 --> 15:30.920
ask you this question because what you said made me think of this okay tell me if this is true or

15:30.920 --> 15:39.000
false game with explosions are better than games with no explosions games with explosions are

15:39.000 --> 15:44.200
better that's that's right that's just this kid you train this kid well Becky he knows what he's

15:44.200 --> 15:52.480
talking about I must say yes he's if you can't blow anything up it's no fun and games and evidenced

15:52.480 --> 15:58.880
by the fact that any time I play Dragon Age 2 he always wants to come as soon as we get to the last

15:58.880 --> 16:05.000
the last mission because his favorite thing is watching the chantry blow up awesome and games

16:05.000 --> 16:09.360
where you cause the explosion are the best that's why you like minecraft I know it I know it cuz

16:09.360 --> 16:13.600
that's one of the cool thing yeah he's not in his head over there yyr is helping out a little bit

16:13.600 --> 16:18.600
in the description of pirate 101 saying from Wikipedia it's a pirate based MMO created by

16:18.600 --> 16:22.840
Kingsisle entertainment players assume the role of the heroic pirates that set out in search of the

16:22.840 --> 16:27.840
treasures of the spiral the same fictional universe used in its sister game wizard 101

16:27.840 --> 16:32.760
oh there's a whole there's pirates and there's wizards oh yeah um there's a game called wizard

16:32.760 --> 16:40.200
when one it's much longer they've done more for it there instead there be a instead of the top

16:40.200 --> 16:47.440
will be in level 65 the top level is 110 oh boy that sounds like a long game is there ninjas 101

16:47.440 --> 16:56.560
I don't know well you would think pirates 101 is there pirate wizards 101 are the ninjas you

16:56.560 --> 17:09.960
fight called ninja pigs all right all right fair they're horrible ninja pigs sound pretty awful

17:09.960 --> 17:20.200
it's holy cereal I think Julian's having a heart attack over there so so okay so the game you're

17:20.200 --> 17:29.400
gonna make is gonna be pirates explosions and killing ninja pigs for sure all right there's

17:29.400 --> 17:42.120
more so it's a spin-off of Angry Birds would you not like Angry Birds Julian Angry Birds is okay I

17:42.120 --> 17:47.600
have Star Wars Angry Birds I'm really good at it all right the humility is important when you're

17:47.600 --> 17:53.880
playing games absolutely absolutely all right Julian I'm trying to think what else to ask you

17:53.880 --> 18:01.200
what what do you what do you want gamers everywhere out there to know about like what you hope the

18:01.200 --> 18:12.600
future has in store for games I don't know games better games games games games and better ones get

18:12.600 --> 18:17.200
better get make the games better that's right work on that make the games better I like that's good

18:17.800 --> 18:24.520
now when you are you know I know this is a long way away Julian but when you're in your 30s do

18:24.520 --> 18:29.680
you think you'd want to do an online radio show like we do do you want to take over or when I

18:29.680 --> 18:38.160
retire yeah yeah all right there we go awesome there we go so you guys here to here first this

18:38.160 --> 18:42.520
is this is the trick how we're gonna get a well are going for 50 years we're gonna pass it on to

18:42.520 --> 18:47.680
Julian when we're gone so we'll check in we'll have to check in again with Julian in a few years

18:47.680 --> 18:53.120
and see how that plan is progressing sound good sounds good well Julian thanks so much for being

18:53.120 --> 18:58.280
on the show I hope you had fun I didn't have a lot of fun awesome awesome you get to tell our

18:58.280 --> 19:04.640
listeners about pirates 101 and give them some elite minecraft tips awesome we'll have have fun

19:04.640 --> 19:08.360
and when you when you check out a new game that you think is really awesome and you want to tell

19:08.360 --> 19:12.840
us all about it you have to come back okay okay awesome I know you were a big hit with our chat

19:12.840 --> 19:21.840
room over at live live dot fog network calm oh that's okay that's okay if you're gonna talk use

19:21.840 --> 19:29.120
the mic oh yeah what is there are two games that I really want okay there's one called universe

19:29.120 --> 19:37.200
sandbox 2 mostly why I want it is black holes you get to explode everything and mess up everything

19:37.320 --> 19:43.280
in the whole entire freaking universe sounds reasonable and then spore it's a game about

19:43.280 --> 19:50.520
evolution and you know spore I know the five stages that goes from Stell cell stage creature

19:50.520 --> 19:58.600
stage tribal stage civilization stage and space day that's interesting spore is kind of an older

19:58.600 --> 20:05.800
game so you have you wanted that was made in 2008 interesting you know I bought spore when it first

20:05.840 --> 20:13.120
came out I was at e3 one year and will right who created spore did like a little tour of the game

20:13.120 --> 20:18.200
and when that game came out they had huge expectations for it and unfortunately didn't do

20:18.200 --> 20:24.560
it didn't do as well as they'd hoped and part of the reason why now sometimes they do that with

20:24.560 --> 20:29.840
games they make them better after they come out like there's a game called destiny that that's

20:29.840 --> 20:34.760
what they did they made it better like way after it came out so maybe spore was kind of like that

20:34.760 --> 20:39.480
but I think that's really cool that you still want to play old games as well as new ones cuz

20:39.480 --> 20:47.200
I think old games are really cool too so that's awesome all right let's see over at live dot vog

20:47.200 --> 20:51.280
network comm let's see s2100 Matt says got to start him on the show when they're young yep

20:51.280 --> 20:56.840
rage nator says Julian needs to be the fourth host make it so maybe in a few years raging here

20:56.840 --> 21:02.440
maybe a few years he's got a he's got a graduate high school first let's see Rama says is he taking

21:02.480 --> 21:07.320
over for intern drew I hope so he's a lot more entertaining I'm sure Julie appreciates that

21:07.320 --> 21:12.040
compliment I'm sure he does let's see in dark Tetsuya says always good to get the younger

21:12.040 --> 21:18.960
perspective absolutely and why YR says spore is from 2008 geez it's almost 10 years old already

21:18.960 --> 21:25.360
yeah you know it's a spore is probably as old as you are Julian it's kind of it's an older game

21:25.360 --> 21:31.720
almost almost then you then you get to play the stuff that maybe

21:32.840 --> 21:40.240
you know what you'll probably like though is a no-man's sky if you have a PlayStation 4 or PC

21:40.240 --> 21:47.640
I guess that's a PlayStation 4 I have is well it's not really mine it's mostly dad's the closest to

21:47.640 --> 21:54.360
PlayStation 4 that we have in the house is an Xbox one okay well Xbox one's pretty cool you can do a

21:54.360 --> 21:58.640
lot with an Xbox one yeah yeah let me ask you I'm gonna ask you one more thing real quick Julie and

21:58.640 --> 22:01.680
then we're gonna move on with the show cuz we have a lot of news to talk about this week but

22:01.920 --> 22:06.400
Julian do you know about virtual reality have you seen like the virtual reality the little

22:06.400 --> 22:13.040
headsets I mean the oculus rift that's right the oculus rift is one of them I've watched some videos

22:13.040 --> 22:17.560
on the oculus rift it's really cool yeah is that something you wanna you want to play with at some

22:17.560 --> 22:21.840
point hope yeah yeah it looks really cool cuz you know tonight we're gonna talk about the PlayStation

22:21.840 --> 22:26.960
VR is gonna be coming out and so this is a thing that's gonna be in people's homes pretty soon so I

22:27.000 --> 22:32.720
mean in a couple of years it'll it'll be probably about as common as an Xbox one it's gonna be kind

22:32.720 --> 22:39.040
of trippy so all right well we're gonna move on thank you Julian for being here and I I know I

22:39.040 --> 22:42.280
don't know if you guys are gonna hang around or if you're gonna take off but if you do end up

22:42.280 --> 22:47.400
hanging around we you can speak up whatever you like on whatever topics we're talking about but

22:47.400 --> 22:51.640
in the meantime we always like to start off each week show talking about how was your gaming week

22:51.640 --> 22:55.560
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week so dark soccer do you want to

22:55.560 --> 22:59.040
tell us a little bit about your gaming week I played some Animal Crossing happy home designer

22:59.040 --> 23:09.080
because I just got my new Animal Crossing amiibo I have Rover I have kappa and I'm waiting on Timmy

23:09.080 --> 23:18.280
and Tommy to arrive I did play some Dongan Ronpa I'm playing fractal again which I love my puzzle

23:18.280 --> 23:25.320
games so I had to get back into fractal and I hit level seven in ingress finally congrats because

23:25.320 --> 23:32.440
those Smurfs kept trying to steal my home so I would just steal it back and then when I actually

23:32.440 --> 23:39.960
made that leap into seven I started hunting them down out of spite because it was great

23:39.960 --> 23:53.960
awesome right gargamel like as real and yeah I think that's really been about it because it's

23:53.960 --> 24:01.360
been kind of a weird week that's all all right Loki how about you how is your gaming week well

24:01.360 --> 24:09.120
let's see I finished platinum in Lego Avengers so we have everything done there I don't play it

24:09.120 --> 24:15.480
anymore which is great until the DLC comes out and then I'll have to finish that I played a

24:15.480 --> 24:22.120
little bit of the track me a turbo beta so they give you basically all the white courses or at

24:22.120 --> 24:26.680
least most of the white courses to try out which are the easiest ones which you could have fooled

24:26.680 --> 24:32.720
me because they're still pretty hard and so it's pretty looking game it's also you know it's

24:32.720 --> 24:42.040
gameplay wise it reminds me a lot of was it the motorcycle racing one I can't remember what it's

24:42.040 --> 24:47.920
called now anyways um you know just like a track meeting game but very pretty and so you know it's

24:47.920 --> 24:53.680
got the course editor in there you're racing against times you know keep retrying to perfect

24:53.680 --> 25:01.440
each you know race especially getting gold on everything it's very difficult I like it I was

25:01.440 --> 25:07.120
planning on picking it up beforehand and you know this kind of you know solidifies that a little

25:07.120 --> 25:19.080
bit more so I got to play a little bit of that and then I what else I play um ingress a little

25:19.080 --> 25:28.160
bit I haven't been playing too much of that but I played a little bit of that and oh that's pretty

25:28.240 --> 25:35.560
much it I think yeah all right a little bit of the little bit of the gear VR stuff just test out

25:35.560 --> 25:39.880
some of the demos most of our videos those kind of lame yeah so I haven't really wanted to buy

25:39.880 --> 25:44.880
anything because they have like some free games but most of them are kind of lame they have games

25:44.880 --> 25:50.200
you can purchase but I'm like and without demo it's kind of hard for me to want to do this I

25:50.200 --> 25:55.080
wish I just had more of the free content that you know oculus has available for like you know the

25:55.080 --> 26:03.160
dk2 and that kind of stuff I just wish the dk2 ran better on my computer yes need it's justification

26:03.160 --> 26:08.840
for you to get a better computer well yeah but that's expensive so it is it is all right my

26:08.840 --> 26:14.100
gaming week let's see I actually played a variety of things this week thanks to the expanded Xbox

26:14.100 --> 26:18.600
one backwards compatibility with 360 games I don't know if you guys know but some new games

26:18.600 --> 26:24.600
hit this Thursday and a couple big ones Alan Wake hit which I have loaded by and play yet

26:24.640 --> 26:29.800
but I did play quite a bit of Castlevania Symphony of the Night is available now through backwards

26:29.800 --> 26:34.960
compatibility on Xbox one so if you bought that on the 360 check your Xbox one because you can go

26:34.960 --> 26:38.880
back and revisit Symphony of the Night which I did I actually played quite a bit of it this week

26:38.880 --> 26:44.040
and I miss that game you know it's got some weirdness though for that version because not

26:44.040 --> 26:48.680
all of the tricks from the PlayStation version work that is true they did you know it's not a

26:48.680 --> 26:54.040
perfect port but as far as you know if you just want kind of the core experience of the game and

26:54.200 --> 26:58.760
revisiting it and it's kind of fun to play it on the Xbox one with all the newer features and all

26:58.760 --> 27:08.040
that so I did play quite a bit of that also on the PlayStation 4 I played just some random things

27:08.040 --> 27:15.640
that I had to catch up with my backlog and then a little bit of Tron run are I tried to play on PC

27:15.640 --> 27:20.040
but then it crashed in the second level like my video card doesn't like the game or something

27:20.040 --> 27:24.680
that kind of like irritated me I don't know what's I think that's coming out though on PlayStation

27:24.680 --> 27:30.680
4 it is already out but it is already out like it's like 20 bucks for the game oh god no oh no

27:30.680 --> 27:36.480
then there's expansions on top of no but on Steam because I was an early access person for $10 I got

27:36.480 --> 27:41.240
all of it no I'm not paying $20 for that it's one of those things where I'm gonna wait for a sale

27:41.240 --> 27:46.640
and then I'll get out get all that stuff cuz I'm not gonna buy it now no way they have like

27:46.640 --> 27:51.680
transformers on sale right now for like $17 and I was like that's still too high even though it

27:51.680 --> 27:56.400
looks good I just it it's not that I don't think it's a great game and it's not deserving of even

27:56.400 --> 28:00.920
the full amount of money it's just that I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to it so I don't

28:00.920 --> 28:05.920
think I think I'd purchase it and not play it and I don't want to pay $17 for a game that I'm gonna

28:05.920 --> 28:12.760
purchase and not play so here's another game that I played this week that's brand new that I picked

28:12.760 --> 28:17.080
up on Friday and I've been enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would and that is Pokken

28:17.080 --> 28:23.000
Tournament is on the wheel and if you don't know Pokken Tournament it's basically the Pokemon

28:23.000 --> 28:27.880
fighting game that Bandai Namco did so it's I think it's got elements of Tekken which is why

28:27.880 --> 28:32.920
they call it Pokken but I don't I don't know if I see an awful lot of Tekken in it because one of

28:32.920 --> 28:38.680
the things that they did that I really think is like different for other fighting games I've

28:38.680 --> 28:42.960
played like you know you play Street Fighter 5 you kind of know what to expect a lot of those

28:42.960 --> 28:50.840
fighting games are very similar they're all those 2d games Pokken does a 3d type system but using

28:50.840 --> 28:55.880
certain moves you kind of pull the other fighter in and then it switches it does what's called a

28:55.880 --> 29:01.680
phase shift into a 2d mode so it kind of seamlessly goes back and forth then you can push them out of

29:01.680 --> 29:06.360
that back into what they call the field mode so right off the bat I was kind of like oh this is

29:06.360 --> 29:11.120
a little different than other fighting games I've played so um I like that and then um you know

29:11.120 --> 29:16.080
it's it's pretty easy to pick up there's only so many buttons and they kind of built like a rock

29:16.080 --> 29:20.640
paper scissors thing into it with the different types of attacks I mean I still feel like I'm

29:20.640 --> 29:25.240
button mashing sometimes but I kind of know a little bit more than I do in most fighters when

29:25.240 --> 29:29.120
I'm just sitting there mashing all the buttons I feel like okay I know what buttons I'm mashing

29:29.120 --> 29:35.920
with purpose so that's kind of cool um the only I get there's only 16 I think playable Pokemon which

29:35.960 --> 29:39.920
is a little weird when you consider there's what like 700 different Pokemon so that part's a little

29:39.920 --> 29:48.800
dlc yeah maybe maybe uh amiibo because you can get uh you get shadow mu 2 through uh one of the

29:48.800 --> 29:55.040
the little amiibo card or whatever so there's that um and then you can use your other amiibo to just

29:55.040 --> 30:00.640
unlock random things in the game but like the pokemon amiibo don't do anything the the other

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
amiibo don't do they just unlock random things that's all well let's that's great Nintendo wait

30:07.000 --> 30:13.280
yeah no no what no no I'm not gonna blame Nintendo because it's not Nintendo's fault it's Namco's

30:13.280 --> 30:20.240
fault for not utilizing those in you know better ways so no Nintendo gets a pass here but you

30:20.240 --> 30:24.280
should really pressure your developers to do something special with those poke you know Pokemon

30:24.280 --> 30:28.560
amiibo um an act-deft in chat over at live dog network comm says the poke and dev say that no

30:28.600 --> 30:33.800
DLC is planned but we'll see well nothing nothing's ever planned of course of course well that's not

30:33.800 --> 30:38.640
true it's been a DLC nowadays but um yeah I'm enjoying poke and tournament more than I thought

30:38.640 --> 30:44.240
I would I will say that I actually went online and played an online match I was very like kind

30:44.240 --> 30:50.360
of nervous to do that I didn't like that even when I play a fun mode game that my stats are still

30:50.360 --> 30:54.240
tracked I was like oh this is the mode where I'm supposed to be able to be bad they're just

30:54.240 --> 30:59.880
tracking your fun yeah they're tracking my fun that I had fun zero out of one matches but that

30:59.880 --> 31:06.080
it's okay because I had a good time playing the fight and it's like oh you know knowing there's

31:06.080 --> 31:11.440
a live person on the other hand and in Japan nonetheless kind of just like oh it adds another

31:11.440 --> 31:17.480
layer of intense intensity to the fight so why we are in chat over at live dog network comm says

31:17.480 --> 31:23.200
my poking record online is three to ten or so I got destroyed I feel like I don't fully understand

31:23.200 --> 31:28.360
the system yet but it's fun it's kind of where I'm at too I don't have that in-depth knowledge

31:28.360 --> 31:32.880
that it probably takes to be a tournament fighter but I feel like I know enough to just kind of have

31:32.880 --> 31:39.080
fun and button mash so yeah long story short I enjoy poking more than I thought I would so if

31:39.080 --> 31:42.680
you like fighting games or you really like Pokemon and kind of want to experience it a different way

31:42.680 --> 31:50.280
it might be worth checking out that $60 price tag might seem a little high especially when 16 is all

31:50.280 --> 31:58.760
there is I'm sure the game will be on sale by Christmas but we'll see we'll see um that's really

31:58.760 --> 32:03.440
pretty much everything that I played this week other than the usual stuff Final Fantasy 14 I

32:03.440 --> 32:07.920
guess there is one other thing I ought to mention or else somebody will say something in chat

32:07.920 --> 32:12.400
because I posted a Twitter about it earlier I also played World of Warcraft last night and today

32:12.400 --> 32:17.160
you remember remember that MMO I played for years and years and even had a podcast about it at one

32:17.200 --> 32:21.480
point yeah I decided to just peek and see what's going on here's the thing here's the thing for you

32:21.480 --> 32:27.280
guys I'll start yelling addict and all that stuff I'm actually not paying for it because you can

32:27.280 --> 32:32.880
play a character from 0 to 20 in the starter edition which is just the game without the

32:32.880 --> 32:38.080
monthly fee or the free edition or whatever so I'm just I'm leveling a character from scratch

32:38.080 --> 32:43.360
because one of my buddies mentioned to me that if you get a character to level 20 and it has to

32:43.360 --> 32:48.360
you can't use one of your old characters you have to actually ding that level 20 achievement now if

32:48.360 --> 32:52.880
you do that with a character you get I think an extra character and hearthstone or something like

32:52.880 --> 32:57.520
that and it's not even that I play hearthstone but I was just like I've been kind of curious

32:57.520 --> 33:04.200
how Warcraft might be different all these years since I left it so I'll check it out and that

33:04.200 --> 33:08.400
gives me something to work towards but will I pick it up again full-time with a subscription fee

33:08.400 --> 33:13.920
I'm not sure I will even though I have friends online that I haven't played with in a long time

33:13.920 --> 33:18.720
that I'd like to go back and experience Wow with I'm still super into Final Fantasy 14 like when I

33:18.720 --> 33:24.000
hear the news about World of Warcraft I'm like oh okay neat I guess I don't know if I really follow

33:24.000 --> 33:28.880
it as well as I used to anymore but cool cool but then when I hear about Final Fantasy 14 news I'm

33:28.880 --> 33:37.560
like yes more primals yay fan fest so I just I don't know I I guess Wow is something fun to kind

33:37.560 --> 33:41.880
of flirt with while there's there's a little bit of downtime on Final Fantasy 14 I guess I guess

33:41.880 --> 33:47.560
that's that so and yeah look at a chat over at live dot vog network comm rage Nader says sky

33:47.560 --> 33:53.160
played Wow addict you know see I knew that was coming I knew that was coming all right we're

33:53.160 --> 33:57.560
about to get into our news I did want to mention one thing I played also Disney infinity this week

33:57.560 --> 34:02.880
oh yeah because they have it there's having a sale again at GameStop for their used characters

34:02.880 --> 34:08.960
so you buy to get three free and so you know I was picking up pizza and we had time to kill so

34:08.960 --> 34:13.920
we went over there and picked up five new characters because you know it's dirt cheap

34:13.920 --> 34:19.680
that's the price that I should pay for those things and we own like 30 of them by now but

34:19.680 --> 34:26.160
it's because we bought them like that you get five for like 20 bucks so nice I like sales

34:26.160 --> 34:31.200
especially on collectible little figures that's for sure all right before we get into the news

34:31.200 --> 34:36.000
this week we do have a little bit of quick housekeeping as far as the show goes next week

34:36.000 --> 34:40.560
very happy we're gonna be having a Gabriel and Brianna are gonna oh yeah awesome they're gonna

34:40.560 --> 34:46.160
be back here next week with the sack IGDA oh great I'm gonna have to hear about how my you know yeah

34:46.160 --> 34:50.720
you better you better work you got a week to go I've been working on it I just I can't get anything

34:50.720 --> 34:57.040
done I'm in a block right now so so they're gonna be here to talk about the sack indie arcade which

34:57.040 --> 35:01.440
is in two weeks so very excited to have them back on the show we'll catch up with them and ask

35:01.440 --> 35:07.920
Gabriel about his own game that he's been making I'm crumpled and then in two weeks we will not

35:07.920 --> 35:13.920
be here the week of April Fool's Day because I will be in Tucson and that's no joke I will be

35:13.920 --> 35:21.120
out of town so I'm not gonna be able to be doing a show that week but we will be back the week after

35:21.120 --> 35:27.280
that we will be doing something from the indie arcade I'm not sure if we're gonna be live or

35:27.280 --> 35:30.080
if we're gonna do something taped we're still gonna figure that out hopefully I'll have an

35:30.080 --> 35:36.160
answer for you next week and then we'll of course have our own show when we return on the 10th I

35:36.160 --> 35:43.760
believe is the date so yeah there's that I also want to say a couple congratulations right here

35:43.760 --> 35:51.040
there's some big big news here so first off a big big big congratulations to our buddy Brad

35:51.120 --> 35:58.480
from pod culture because pod culture is hitting 500 episodes tomorrow the 500th episode of pod

35:58.480 --> 36:03.280
culture is tomorrow here at the voice geeks network six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern

36:03.280 --> 36:07.520
I know they just recorded it they recorded a bunch of episodes they had the whole gang

36:08.320 --> 36:14.000
from their episodes prior kind of back together to do episode 500 so it sounds like it was a lot

36:14.000 --> 36:18.480
of fun so I just want to say a big big congratulations to Brad and the whole gang at pod

36:18.480 --> 36:23.440
culture um who of course is a big part of the voice geeks network but Brad has always been in

36:23.440 --> 36:27.520
particular has always been a big champion for what we're doing here at orange launch radio as well as

36:27.520 --> 36:32.640
some of my other side projects you know he hosted the website for horde house you know and he's

36:32.640 --> 36:38.240
really helped out in a big way so um I think without his support there would be a lot of

36:38.240 --> 36:43.840
differences in what you hear today so I'm very happy not a lot of podcasts make it to 500 episodes

36:43.840 --> 36:49.600
so pod culture is now part of a very very exclusive club that probably only one percent or

36:49.600 --> 36:57.200
maybe half of a percent of podcasts belong to so um a big big congrats to uh Brad and all the folks

36:57.200 --> 37:04.640
over at pod culture on 500 episodes of that program again tomorrow six o'clock pacific nine

37:04.640 --> 37:08.720
o'clock eastern but if you can't be here live tomorrow when it debuts uh you can check it out

37:08.720 --> 37:14.000
in their podcast feed it'll go up later you know I haven't done the math yet but but before

37:14.000 --> 37:20.560
originally if we hadn't skipped any shows episode 666 would fall on my birthday but I think since

37:20.560 --> 37:24.720
we've skipped enough shows it may actually fall on halloween it may and if we skip some more it

37:24.720 --> 37:31.360
may fall on christmas that's what I'm aiming for olr christmas episode 666 edition that's

37:31.360 --> 37:35.760
what I'm aiming for and if we skip some more we can go to pinkberry instead

37:35.760 --> 37:43.440
all right uh let's see so uh also I want to say this there's a lot of good news this week

37:43.440 --> 37:49.600
one other congratulations then we'll get into the news our buddy yyr so uh we ran into him

37:49.600 --> 37:54.000
at magfest we did the video interview and we uh and he's been on the show before talking about

37:54.000 --> 37:59.200
multitasking right so multitasking went to steam greenlight and he's been trying to collect the

37:59.200 --> 38:04.080
votes and you know it's not it sometimes feels like arbitrary what gets greenlit on steam and

38:04.080 --> 38:09.120
what doesn't and it seems like sometimes a tough shell to crack well guess what multitasking got

38:09.120 --> 38:14.400
greenlit this week yyr is a game multitasking which i think is brilliant by the way got the

38:14.400 --> 38:18.640
pass on stream greenlight this week so that is going to be a game that you will soon be able to

38:18.640 --> 38:23.440
pick up on steam well i don't know how soon but you know eventually blizzard soon trademark you

38:23.440 --> 38:30.000
will be able to get on steam so thankfully hopefully not valve soon so now the question

38:30.000 --> 38:36.080
is what's gonna what's gonna happen first multitasking or half-life 3 multitasking well

38:36.080 --> 38:41.120
of course it's gonna be multitasking i mean the the earth will cease to exist before you know

38:41.120 --> 38:47.520
half-life 3 comes out all right so yyr i want the exclusive news when you okay yyr says i will

38:47.520 --> 38:55.200
announce it here oh good good good i'm excited awesome uh bobby blackwolf trying to cut us off

38:55.200 --> 39:01.360
saying yyr is gonna swerve everyone and tell me first before olr how about this you can give

39:01.360 --> 39:05.360
bobby the month and us the day how about that and then you have to listen to both shows to know

39:05.360 --> 39:11.360
what the true release day is all right so big congratulations all around lots of good news

39:11.360 --> 39:15.680
and it was a very very busy week in gaming news this week with game developers conference this

39:15.680 --> 39:21.120
week typically not a media event but there was definitely some things that happened as well

39:21.120 --> 39:24.720
way i think julian wants to pipe in before we get to the news this week did you want to you want to

39:24.720 --> 39:29.280
pipe in with something i saw you raise your hand over there you all right no all right just

39:29.280 --> 39:32.960
kicking back enjoying the news oh you're just stretching all right it's all good it's all good

39:32.960 --> 39:36.880
i thought i thought you might have been saying oh i i got something to say that's all right

39:36.880 --> 39:41.920
loki's gonna say something right now about what's going on in the news out of gdc all right so they

39:41.920 --> 39:48.480
finally announced some details on the playstation vr including the release date ish area um you know

39:48.480 --> 39:54.400
it's gonna be in october of this year as opposed to early in spring which was the original um

39:54.400 --> 40:02.320
projected release date they also announced the price 399 dollars in the u.s 399 euro

40:03.200 --> 40:12.160
or 349 pounds and 44 980 yen in japan and of course you know with that you're going to get

40:12.160 --> 40:21.360
you know the headset and it's going to come with the free um playroom vr game and it will require

40:21.360 --> 40:26.560
the playstation camera so you will need that and possibly move controllers for some of the games

40:27.600 --> 40:32.080
now if you don't have all that stuff you can pre-order that now because they're taking

40:32.080 --> 40:36.720
pre-orders on this brand new bundle it's going to include two move controllers the playstation

40:36.720 --> 40:44.800
camera the playstation vr um also a packaged game playstation vr worlds which has a like five or

40:44.800 --> 40:50.400
six different games in there it's kind of like a demo thing they've got the london heist uh that

40:50.400 --> 40:55.120
street luge game and i can't remember the other ones i actually watched the video on that but i

40:55.120 --> 41:01.200
don't remember uh so that'll be they're taking pre-orders on that starting on march 22nd

41:03.200 --> 41:09.520
now if you own something you know if you were a an avid playstation supporter and

41:09.520 --> 41:14.480
you know you picked up the move when everybody hated the move everybody hated on it no one

41:14.480 --> 41:18.480
supported it but people actually hate the move because i seem to remember most people thinking

41:18.480 --> 41:24.160
it was the best use of that like it was better than the wii technology it was i wasn't i don't

41:24.160 --> 41:28.880
know it was all right but like it wasn't supported too well it didn't have the games and it didn't

41:28.880 --> 41:33.600
wasn't supported too well playstation camera i picked up the playstation camera even though

41:33.600 --> 41:38.960
there's not really many uses for it um i picked up those things and i am being rewarded by not

41:38.960 --> 41:46.400
being able to unbundle this wonderful vr device there's a child i just want to point out a child

41:46.400 --> 41:52.320
in the room tonight is incredibly restraining loki and this is kind of awesome so yes

41:52.320 --> 41:57.280
unfortunately i am not able to um you know not because i mean i'm assuming that they will take

41:57.280 --> 42:03.280
pre-orders eventually honestly i may just have to pre-order this bundle for now it just you know and

42:03.280 --> 42:07.360
sell off the rest because i already own two playstation move controllers although i hear

42:07.360 --> 42:11.200
those batteries go bad so maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to get two new controllers

42:11.200 --> 42:16.480
but i already have a camera so i don't need that playstation vr worlds is probably plan

42:16.480 --> 42:21.760
to pick it up anyways because it looked pretty good but it kind of sucks that it's just you know

42:21.760 --> 42:24.960
hey let's get an extra hundred dollars out of you i mean it's a good it's good value if you don't

42:24.960 --> 42:32.320
own all that stuff but you know come on i mean people did support you maybe you should offer

42:32.320 --> 42:38.160
that stuff separately as well it'd be nice to have both skews um and then of course i i thought

42:38.160 --> 42:43.200
the headset is gonna be in stores you just can't pre-order it so yeah oh it's gonna be in stores

42:43.200 --> 42:48.800
how many in stores exactly yeah how many in stores yeah i don't think i know how the game works

42:49.440 --> 42:54.480
i used to work in that industry i know how it works i'm pre-ordering one of these and hey you

42:54.480 --> 42:58.560
know what hey and that's the other thing too it's like if you do want pre-order it's 100 bucks down

42:58.560 --> 43:04.960
too it's not those five dollars down you know nonsense it's a hundred dollars so yay thank you

43:04.960 --> 43:11.120
gamestop and you'll be happy to know because i know this was your biggest concern about it

43:11.120 --> 43:15.280
sony's not going to lose money on this they're actually going to make a profit off of each unit

43:15.280 --> 43:22.640
sold well i am so glad for you sony that you're going to be making a profit thank you make a

43:22.640 --> 43:30.640
profit off of those bundles and everything so okay well i guess that's important i still want

43:30.640 --> 43:35.440
to get one i mean even despite all this anger you're like well it's no it's it's not anger

43:35.440 --> 43:39.600
it's disappointment i mean because come on i was like you know because i went in there because

43:39.600 --> 43:42.640
we're purchasing the figures i'm like hey you know i know they just announced this you guys

43:42.640 --> 43:46.640
have a date when they're gonna take pre-orders on this before i read the news online and they said

43:46.640 --> 43:51.760
yeah they're gonna have this bundle it's available and originally cakes i'm in gamestop and they're

43:51.760 --> 43:56.720
like yeah we have this bundle that's gonna be you know 4.99 it comes with all this stuff i'm like

43:56.720 --> 44:02.320
uh stupid gamestop bundling you know stuff together oh great you know this is typical of

44:02.320 --> 44:07.840
them and i go i'm like oh it's everybody still stupid gamestop see i'm in this weird position

44:07.840 --> 44:13.600
because all i have is the camera and i want playstation vr well i mean i have your move

44:13.600 --> 44:17.840
but i'm gonna imagine you're gonna want that back well if they're working yeah i mean maybe i mean

44:17.840 --> 44:22.640
if i if you end up getting suckered into buying a new one i guess there's that but um yeah it's

44:22.720 --> 44:27.200
just like it's kind of like okay well i have the camera now i could probably run out and get a move

44:27.200 --> 44:31.040
second hand before they're gone because i'm sure probably everybody's thinking that but then yeah

44:31.040 --> 44:37.040
like can i guarantee that i can get the psvr by itself i don't know i imagine maybe at first it's

44:37.040 --> 44:41.680
gonna be a little crazy but then what is i mean i'm excited about it and i'm like an early adopter

44:41.680 --> 44:48.240
when it comes to hardware and stuff but maybe i am maybe i should wait i mean i don't know what

44:48.240 --> 44:56.160
exactly is gonna be at launch i mean res looks cool i guess but is it worth paying 400 for it i

44:56.160 --> 45:02.480
mean i don't know i mean i just have to kind of see what's out there and am i gonna be suckered

45:02.480 --> 45:07.600
in the pain you know 500 for all this stuff and then it's like oh well this is just about as

45:07.600 --> 45:14.480
supported as the move or the connect i mean i maybe i should wait i don't know we'll see i guess

45:14.480 --> 45:19.680
i am excited about it i want to try it out um it's just i've tried out the oculus i tried out

45:19.680 --> 45:26.880
the gear vr um they're okay but i mean i want to see the retail oculus because the gear vr is kind

45:26.880 --> 45:32.800
of hard that i mean i thought it'd be slightly better but it's i'll have to try the vr well

45:33.360 --> 45:38.080
what could i do with a second playstation camera lowkey nothing that can't do anything the

45:38.080 --> 45:42.720
situation you're gonna sell it back to a store that's what you're gonna do or sell it on ebay

45:42.720 --> 45:48.800
that's all you can do you should point them at each other yeah just let them watch recursive

45:48.800 --> 45:54.880
playstation you can't there's nothing you can't plug it in there i mean it's just it's it's back

45:54.880 --> 46:00.160
up side by side can i broadcast myself in 3d for other people's vr's you can't you can just you can

46:00.160 --> 46:06.640
sit there and go yep i paid a hundred dollars extra for this thanks tiger klon chat says maybe

46:06.640 --> 46:12.480
you can use it on your pc i kind of doubt that no it's a proprietary connection so no you're not

46:12.480 --> 46:17.840
going to be using an rpc oh well uh we'll see what i do i don't know i have a little time to

46:17.840 --> 46:21.680
decide what you're going to do what you're going to do i will get the vr thing eventually what

46:21.680 --> 46:26.960
you're going to do is you're going to look at sony and go what what the hell sony i mean come on

46:26.960 --> 46:31.520
i mean what the hell and that's what you're going to do and you just keep pitching a fit to them

46:31.520 --> 46:38.640
until they finally make the good choice and offer multiple skews uh yeah and our chat is talking

46:38.640 --> 46:43.760
about the cam and uh why we are saying really it's not usb and some folks saying nope nope it

46:43.760 --> 46:49.760
is a proprietary high speed connection there so um i'm i'm still curious enough about the playstation

46:49.760 --> 46:54.320
vr and i've liked what i've seen i want to get it it'll just kind of be you know am i going to end

46:54.320 --> 46:59.360
up with a second camera because of it or what so i do hope there are other ways to kind of piecemeal

46:59.360 --> 47:03.440
this that seems to be the right way you also need headphones because it does come with earbuds which

47:03.440 --> 47:08.720
i why earbuds i mean come on just throwing a headphone in there sony you make headphones

47:08.720 --> 47:12.640
do the playstation headsets work because i have that they they do work but i mean you're probably

47:12.640 --> 47:17.840
going to want i don't know if you buy the bundle it comes with a stereo headset from sony i've got

47:17.840 --> 47:24.160
a ton of sony headset or headphones so i mean i'm i'm good there but i have those official wireless

47:24.160 --> 47:28.400
whatever whatever i have yeah i have the playstation 3 one um you know it's it's all

47:28.400 --> 47:32.480
right those are pretty nice i will say this i do want to give sony props for this because as much

47:32.480 --> 47:35.360
as it sounds like we're being critical in this segment because the pricing and everything i

47:35.360 --> 47:41.680
actually do think this is really rad um is the fact that sony is supporting these old devices

47:41.680 --> 47:46.000
because i think most companies out there would have done a new move like it would have worked

47:46.000 --> 47:49.920
with the playstation 3 move they would have said oh you need this new one to play i kind of hope

47:49.920 --> 47:55.040
that there is a new device i really honestly i don't think the move they're okay but like i

47:55.040 --> 47:59.600
would be kind of cool like some haptic gloves or something or you know as bobby was saying you know

47:59.600 --> 48:03.280
why aren't you supporting the nav controller with the analog stick on there because that doesn't

48:03.280 --> 48:08.240
make any sense to me i wish they would have like a new controller with analog sticks on it and you

48:08.800 --> 48:12.960
support the old ones sure by all means but come out with something new because i don't think that

48:13.520 --> 48:19.040
this device that you created years ago is not necessarily going to fit all situations i think

48:19.040 --> 48:23.280
something else needs to come about because you know look what they're doing with like the the

48:23.280 --> 48:28.080
rift and the vive i mean i think the vive control looks pretty awesome and the rift one sounds

48:28.080 --> 48:32.800
pretty cool so i think they just need to step it up because that's going to be a big problem

48:32.800 --> 48:40.160
if the control's not good enough you're going to notice all right well uh let's go to a report on

48:40.160 --> 48:44.480
something that could be coming to vr i want to point out not playstation vr necessarily this is

48:44.480 --> 48:51.760
a different vr story but apparently a trailer was leaked for star wars trials on tatooine

48:51.760 --> 48:56.720
something developed by lucas arts and ilm apparently something that's coming to the vive

48:57.360 --> 49:03.760
there was a video that showed up on the ilm cross lab youtube channel but it was yanked shortly

49:03.760 --> 49:08.960
thereafter however once it's on the internet it's always on the internet so you know somebody yanked

49:08.960 --> 49:14.880
that and preserved it so there's the star wars trials on tatooine vr i mean it just it seems

49:14.880 --> 49:19.600
like a natural fit star wars is a huge property everybody loves it they're doing something with

49:19.600 --> 49:24.720
star wars battlefront exactly so they've got it they got to do something with star wars and vr so

49:24.720 --> 49:29.840
this is not a surprise whatsoever i'm just yeah i guess i guess the playstation vr will have

49:29.840 --> 49:34.720
battlefront this might be something a little more unique to the pcs or something we'll see

49:34.720 --> 49:42.000
so uh that's pretty cool also uh other stuff uh ubisoft is going to be bringing a popular

49:42.000 --> 49:49.600
role-playing party game to virtual reality it's called werewolves within uh this is the game this

49:49.680 --> 49:55.040
this is the wolf game in vr basically uh you can assume the role of villagers in a medieval village

49:55.040 --> 50:00.880
and you have to deduce which one is the werewolf that is terrorizing the town randomly players are

50:00.880 --> 50:09.120
given abilities that help them to figure this out um this so this is the wolf game in vr a game that

50:09.120 --> 50:15.120
we're used used to playing in real life at conventions where we're all sitting in front

50:15.120 --> 50:23.600
of each other is now in vr kind of weird in a way but at the same time this would open it up to the

50:23.600 --> 50:29.200
fact that you could play when you're not able to physically be in the same location you can actually

50:29.200 --> 50:35.520
play across a great distance so that's kind of neat um i suppose now the question is is bobby

50:35.520 --> 50:40.320
going to stay up till five in the morning playing this game at a case because that's what he used to

50:40.320 --> 50:45.200
do at dragon con so anyway uh bobby blackwolf actually says as someone who played that game

50:45.200 --> 50:53.840
a lot irl it defeats the purpose um sg100 matt says still waiting for clue vcr vr and bobby

50:53.840 --> 50:58.480
brings up another point too is the problem is you have to be able to read facial expressions

50:59.040 --> 51:04.080
that is that is really important in a game like where you have to like you have to be able to

51:04.080 --> 51:08.800
read somebody's face and know if they're lying and maybe vr is not going to let you do that we'll see

51:08.800 --> 51:14.960
but uh ubisoft is going to try so that is something to look forward to on vr moving on

51:14.960 --> 51:22.160
with some more news dark sakura a little thing about poking tournament actually um now whenever

51:22.160 --> 51:26.240
you're playing a game online one of the worst things is that when you're totally doing awesome

51:26.240 --> 51:32.160
and the other person just up in rage quits yep like i can't beat you so i'm just not going to

51:32.160 --> 51:37.200
give you the satisfaction of winning that's my life in grand theft of four yeah well there's

51:37.200 --> 51:44.400
supposed to be consequences for rage quitting in poke and tournament um there is an in-game

51:44.400 --> 51:51.520
advisor named nia who gives you the ins and outs and then tells you that before your online battles

51:51.520 --> 51:55.520
that and i'm quoting quitting in the middle of the battle is rude to your opponent and you'll

51:55.520 --> 52:02.560
suffer a penalty so please please refrain from doing so so basically if you disconnect you will

52:02.560 --> 52:09.440
lose some of your pokey gold which is what you use to buy stuff good because you know they should

52:09.440 --> 52:17.040
should lose like limbs off their pokemon then they have to fight like the next like 20 matches

52:17.040 --> 52:22.880
super handicapped you know that announcer she she's kind of annoying i don't know the voice

52:22.880 --> 52:27.760
acting isn't the really the best but uh like yyr says in the chat over at live.vog network.com

52:27.760 --> 52:32.160
poking tournament straight up warned you the first time you enter a ranked match that there

52:32.160 --> 52:37.920
are penalties if you quit and yeah that's very true uh it actually will come up and say please

52:37.920 --> 52:43.440
please don't quit because there are penalties for doing so so um good you got to take it that's

52:43.440 --> 52:51.120
right take that loss if you are not a winner you're a loser in poking tournament if you quit

52:51.120 --> 52:56.320
kanye west is going to come to your house and kill you no he's just going to talk about himself

52:56.320 --> 52:59.680
while you're trying to see he'll just tweet at you repeatedly that's they should just have

52:59.680 --> 53:05.040
rosette come in there for no reason whatsoever just like lecture you even though he is from

53:05.040 --> 53:11.520
animal cross i don't care does it matter because it's nintendo platform yeah that yeah well excuse

53:11.520 --> 53:17.360
mr we said he shows up and he yells at you for an hour and then lyle comes to sell you insurance

53:17.360 --> 53:22.400
actually i would say it's his long-lost brother mr disconnecty so what they'll happen what happens

53:22.400 --> 53:26.080
they'll put rosette in there people complain oh he's not a pokemon character and then pokemon

53:26.080 --> 53:33.280
company's like well we just made him one suck it and then there you go done he's reset him on

53:36.560 --> 53:40.640
they could just couldn't they just repurpose diglett or something to look like rosette i

53:40.640 --> 53:44.400
don't know all right no but i'm going to point out right now that this child is insane

53:45.440 --> 53:50.240
he was trying to break dance right here in your living room for sometimes you got dance

53:50.240 --> 53:54.800
something yeah sometimes sometimes when dark sakura goes on and on and on i have to dance

53:55.040 --> 54:00.720
to get my mind off it so dance to the bathroom all right what what did you want to say about that

54:01.760 --> 54:12.080
i welcome to the mic go ahead i wasn't trying to break dance i don't even like to dance do you

54:12.080 --> 54:19.600

54:19.600 --> 54:26.320
and loki do you know how we all met do you know how he met dancing that's true fake dancing we

54:26.320 --> 54:31.200
used to play a video game called dance dance revolution have you ever heard of it yeah oh

54:31.200 --> 54:35.040
yeah you see yeah it's over it is over here it's on the little poster here he's seen the ddr have

54:35.040 --> 54:39.280
you ever played it have you ever seen it talking to the mic don't forget to talk in the mic when

54:39.280 --> 54:46.880
you say um i've heard it i think i might have seen it uh-huh but i've never played it okay well

54:46.880 --> 54:52.880
someday you're gonna have to play it it's really stupid it's really really very fun but fun but

54:52.880 --> 54:58.560
really fun isn't there like um things on the screen like little objects and then there's

54:58.560 --> 55:04.320
squares they have to like arrows um like arrows on the screen you have to jump almost you got it

55:04.880 --> 55:13.200
really dancing it's walk walk step step step step it's not even dancing walk i just walk press that

55:14.080 --> 55:21.760
can i can i just point something out this is episode number 635 of orange lounge radio okay

55:22.560 --> 55:29.040
on and i want people can this go on the wiki please episode 635 is when the cast of orange

55:29.040 --> 55:34.720
lounge radio got told by an eight-year-old dance dance revolution isn't really dancing

55:34.720 --> 55:44.480
julian dear you know what no he's absolutely right you know what what we know

55:46.880 --> 55:50.080
it's a game but you can my mom told me about that

55:51.200 --> 55:55.600
it's how you step on this it is an indirect cousin of spider stomp

55:59.040 --> 56:03.680
thank you julie yeah you're right ddr isn't really dancing but it's it's still kind of fun

56:03.680 --> 56:09.360
it's kind of a sometimes sometimes you don't care but do you do you know that we used to play that

56:09.360 --> 56:14.640
in front of the whole arcade and people will walk in and they would see us not dancing and think

56:14.640 --> 56:21.680
those guys are very strange that's it seems really embarrassing i don't sometimes we didn't care we

56:21.680 --> 56:27.120
didn't care we we just you just we're having fun and then there was the time that we sat down and

56:27.120 --> 56:32.080
ate birthday cake in front of the fourth mix machine we went there for my birthday you know

56:32.240 --> 56:37.600
and ate cake on the floor sometimes you get to a point in your life where you just stop

56:37.600 --> 56:43.440
caring what other people think because i'm gonna have a good time and i don't care if other people

56:43.440 --> 56:47.760
have a problem with it the sooner you do that the better you're off that's right yeah that's right

56:47.760 --> 56:51.520
so if other kids tell you you're not cool but you're having fun doing what you're doing

56:53.120 --> 56:58.000
forget them you know how do we get from talking about video games to this because you said it

56:58.000 --> 57:01.760
looks embarrassing how do we get anywhere so julian next time someone gives you a hard time

57:01.760 --> 57:08.560
you just go so that's uh that's what we do here on orange launch radio supposedly we talk about

57:08.560 --> 57:13.200
video games and then suddenly we're talking about cake it just it just happens suddenly for some

57:13.200 --> 57:18.320
cake me too suddenly becomes a 90s after school special all right anyway all right so after that

57:18.320 --> 57:25.280
magic moment on the fullest house here at orange londredo uh let's move on i tried watching some

57:25.280 --> 57:32.240
of that it made me cry out of what am i doing with my life yeah right all right i love this

57:32.240 --> 57:37.840
sg100 matt says julian's trying to correct the derailment on the show i know right he's too

57:37.840 --> 57:42.640
young to realize that that's not going to happen that's okay that's okay all right let's move on

57:42.640 --> 57:48.320
we got more news loki so playstation view actually was something that finally got released widely in

57:48.320 --> 57:53.360
the united states i actually signed up for it because i don't have cable well i have cable tv

57:53.360 --> 58:00.240
what's comcast to me you're paying for like twenty dollars for local channels and hbo which

58:00.240 --> 58:05.040
i don't watch for some reason um but this is awesome so this is actually basically all the

58:05.040 --> 58:09.680
cable channels that you could possibly want 30 bucks is what it starts off as you can pay more

58:09.680 --> 58:15.920
if you want you know the movie channels and all that stuff supports um but basically it streams

58:15.920 --> 58:22.000
to your you know playstation 3 playstation 4 also i believe it supports the amazon fire

58:22.960 --> 58:31.360
and other devices um it's not bad actually i'm quite digging it and um you know being that i've

58:31.360 --> 58:38.000
you know basically cut you know comcast i mean i'm not i have comcast cable right now but it's

58:38.000 --> 58:41.520
only because it's getting the internet a lot cheaper with that although the internet ended

58:41.520 --> 58:47.120
up being a lot slower because the english as a second language guy didn't explain the benefits

58:47.200 --> 58:54.560
of the package very well so um yeah it's it's definitely worth it you can actually record shows

58:54.560 --> 58:59.200
you can go back and see the on-demand stuff um definitely we're checking out if you're kind of

58:59.200 --> 59:04.880
cutting you know cable out and starts at 30 bucks you know and plus you get seven days free so you

59:04.880 --> 59:11.600
get to check it out for seven days and so far so good that's awesome yeah this is why comcast locks

59:11.600 --> 59:17.760
people into deals now yeah they do for a year and like that's the thing is like the guy this

59:17.760 --> 59:22.400
is literally and i wish i had like a recording of the call and i know they do but i just it's too

59:22.400 --> 59:27.760
late now um it's you know he's like oh yeah this you know you'll get some cable it'll be basic

59:27.760 --> 59:32.800
cable channels but you'll also get you know faster internet speed because i knew this was originally

59:32.800 --> 59:40.000
when my internet was speed was just crap it was just awful and since i've switched to that plan

59:40.000 --> 59:44.960
it just gotten worse and worse and worse ironically though i did kind of figure out what

59:44.960 --> 59:50.960
part of that problem was um i ended up moving my router into the living room instead of in the

59:50.960 --> 59:57.680
bedroom and oh hey look at that internet speeds are six times faster now who'd have thought um so

59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.320
that did fix part of it but i'm still not getting the speeds that i was promised and you know it's

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.480
not hd but this is all in hd you get you know the streaming everything it's all the really cable

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.600
channels that you're gonna want anyways if you don't you're not interested in like the

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.200
local channels i mean so comedy central food network all that stuff i mean that's

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:20.720
that's all i watch so it's awesome yeah i i would check this out if i wasn't locked into the

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.240
comcast thing but i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i can't get out of the comcast thing because

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.760
i kind of think i was lied to with some certain things on that but i'll save that for another

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:33.600
episode anyhow let's move on with something that leaked out of uh the game developers conference

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.240
maybe and that is this infamous photo that's floating around out there of a nintendo nx

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.840
controller so apparently the nintendo nx controller what it looks like has been leaked

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.120
there's a little picture of it out there and it does line up with what was seen in a patent

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:58.480
that was published um in december of 2015 by several media outlets so yeah an nx controller

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:03.920
you know it makes sense that one of these is actually leaked um out of gdc because they're

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.080
probably you know trying to meet with some people to um show them you know hey this is what these

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:14.720
devices look like and all that stuff and how to develop for that um but uh you know some people

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:20.400
also at the same time are skeptical the thing that concerns me about what i'm seeing with this

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:27.680
is that i can't tell if those buttons are tactile or not and that really concerns me i think they

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.360
are i think there's two there's like an a and b that are tactile yeah and i think the projection

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.840
of the screen or whatever is backlit underneath them so that the buttons are still tactile

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.480
i can't tell and i know nobody from nintendo listens to the show but if they did i can't tell

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:49.600
you how important a tactile button is there is a reason games like sonic the hedgehog are not fun

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.080
to play on iphone and android because the touch controls are not the same as having tactile

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:03.920
buttons so that is my biggest beef otherwise i'm like okay i'll try this i'm not the the shape is

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.920
really weird but i'm i'm curious to see what they do with it the software is more important

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:16.240
uh you know in how it uses the hardware uh but it better have tactile buttons or i mean nintendo

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.080
just shot themselves in the foot big time as far as i'm concerned i'm i will not i mean this is i

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.040
know it might just sound like i'm i'm being a jerk or whatever but i'm not buying it if it's

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.760
only touch screen buttons that's not a fun experience that's how i feel i agree i like

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:42.080
buttons loki you're dying to say something i i i don't think it's real and if it is real it's

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.320
it's awful it's abs no seriously it's awful think about it i mean what are they attempting to do

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.480
with this is this supposed to be like the screen is the controller because my hand is on the

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.120
controller it's gonna be obstructing the screen what is the point of it it's super tight it's

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.680
like i'm playing on a gameboy micro or something like that what is the point of this and you know

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.240
because of this tech because whatever it is that they're using for this supposed screen

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:14.240
is proprietary it's gotta cost some amount of money that's ridiculous what's the point in

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.040
having more expensive controllers for this device it's just a gimmick it doesn't make any sense

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.920
i think it's fake i hope it's fake it's just i don't see the point and if it's just these

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.880
two analog sticks and two buttons i don't think that's going to be enough i just don't see the

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.240
point it's just like the wii u controller the second screen idea was okay but they haven't

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.080
really still used it to they haven't really used it in a way that makes sense now even most

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.480
developers like with minecraft coming out they didn't even use it for like you inventory or

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.720
things so what makes me confident in the fact that publishers or developers are going to use

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.120
this in a meaningful way i just don't see that happening it just looks like a gimmick and it's an

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.920
expensive gimmick uh there's a lot of people in our chat room that thinks it's fake but i think

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.840
this comment is interesting from kai judo in our chat over at live.vognierware.com saying

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.320
i don't know if nintendo shot themselves in the foot i wonder if touch controls work better for

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.960
kids i think us older gamers spent decades on a gamepad so it feels weird to us i think kids will

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.840
have an easier time well fortunately for you kai judo i have somebody in the room that can give

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:29.120
some insight to that julian so do you like games that have like real buttons or are you okay when

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:35.040
they're like fake ones on the screen you can tap the touch buttons do you do you have an opinion

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.400
do you think one's better than the other what do you mean by on this like in minecraft on the

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.440
minecraft pocket edition how the buttons are on screen when you play minecraft on there like the

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:51.040
buttons aren't something you actually touch but like on this and i'm showing him a playstation

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.240
3 controller on this the buttons are real and you touch them and i just turned on my playstation 3

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.880
showing the platformer for example what do you think do you think one's better than the other

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:06.320
because what what we're saying what we're arguing about is me i think this this is the way to do it

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.520
you have to have real buttons and i think when you're using a pad like that you don't get that

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.880
same experience but one of our listeners says kids might feel differently what do you think julian

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:25.920
um my opinion my opinion is that um it's still okay on the um when you can do it on the screen

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:32.480
but it's a lot easier talking real with it's but it's a lot easier with real buttons and

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.720
my opinion is it's a lot better like that ah and he pointed at the playstation 3 controller so

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:46.480
there you go the official child of the official child compare perspective i mean honestly just

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.840
looking at look at this i mean i understand that they did um patent this or whatever came up with

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.480
a patent for this but what's the point like i mean seriously how are you going to be holding

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:01.120
this controller what's the point if you're going to have the screen extend all the way the edge

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:06.000
you're not going to see it your hands are on the control you have to hold the controller somehow

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.160
i mean it's there's no point to it why waste the screen space why waste the cost of the device

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.280
that's why i think it's fake it's a neat idea and maybe it's like you know this is just a generic

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:22.240
controller we drew up for the patent which by all means i think that makes more sense but

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.200
i just don't see the point in a design like that i'm gonna play devil's advocate here for a minute

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.480
i think ultimately it really boils down to what are the games but here's the thing is that i

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:37.760
notice on this device at the top there's this type of infrared looking thing so it probably

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.720
communicates with the we in a similar fashion to like how your wiimote does well if that's the case

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:48.320
and that's facing you the infrared thing is facing well what about this little square thing that

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.920
could be one of those things that goes all the way around looks like there's a there looks like

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.640
there's a camera facing the player and then there's two speakers my point is maybe some games

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.000
you don't hold the controller in a standard way maybe you're actually holding the controller like

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.880
this you don't have your thumbs on the sticks and you're actually doing some type of motion

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.880
thing so you can see everything i'm just being devil's advocate is that maybe the controller

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:21.600
isn't held the same way in every game what were you say julian um or um like in iron man's

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.680
iron man 3 you tilt the screen to move so yeah like using a tilt thing to move

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.880
okay julian knows i'm talking about why don't you all right listen with nintendo games okay

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:41.200
nintendo games have come out you know for the last decade or so has the complaint ever been

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.800
gee i really wish there was more ways to interact with this game there has never been that complaint

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.440
it's never been oh i really wish i had this second screen because this really provides a unique

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.960
experience they don't use it in a way that's meaningful why do i want them to continue doing

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:02.560
this and now with a controller that makes even little sense in how you operate it's got limited

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.680
buttons so that's really going to limit you on what you can do with it forget those third-party

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.760
games you just basically rule them out now because you don't have those extra buttons that you're

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.560
going to be able to play you know fifa or whatever else that they're going to be pouring to it forget

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.000
battlefield or anything else coming to this platform because they don't have the buttons to

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.320
support that yeah okay they'll sell a separate controller for it but why am i buying a separate

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:30.800
controller for that i have like the wii u gamepad it's great and what it is but guess what it has a

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.600
screen in the middle and there's actual buttons that makes sense it doesn't make sense to extend

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.920
that screen all the way inside because my hands are on the screen they're holding the controller

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.440
it doesn't make any sense to do that there is no reason to do that dungeon buster and chat over at

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:52.320
live.vognetwork.com says aw julian's witnessing his first loki rant it's not full rant listen

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.280
let's be real he's having to reserve himself a slight bit if you don't it's a pg rant all right

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:05.840
so anyway um all right it's look in three months we'll know three months till e3 and then we will

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.360
finally we'll know what the deal is with the stinking system in the meantime it's a rumor

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.440
exactly and brad brad is saying you know they do use the wii u screen i practically only use that

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.400
controller to stream mario kart 2 yes it's great as a second screen it's great to stream the game

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.520
onto that screen now imagine that screen the size of a gameboy micro because that's what they're

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.080
trying to sell you here it's like something that's really tiny instead of that nice screen

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.680
here's what people okay and to answer my question i posed earlier because i do have the answer for

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.960
it what do people what do people want from a nintendo console really what possible improvements

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.840
could they have make it more beefier so they can run the games that other consoles have so that we

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.000
can actually have some third-party support because that was the problem before so your console is

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.120
underpowered and it can't support these modern games that's what we need we don't need another

01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:01.520
gimmicky control method it was cool with the wii it was cool with the wii u stop adding new method

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.400
it's not making these games any better if anything it's just finding a new gimmick and people use it

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.040
and that's it it doesn't add any meaningful gameplay to it make the games stand out and

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:16.160
speak the new zelda game looks awesome that is what you sell your console with not with oh look

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.920
i'm gonna have this unique controller it doesn't do anything make the games good people will buy

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.960
your console all right dr buster says also please understand it's only a prototype so i like i said

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.360
three months we'll know in three months stop innovating and just copy others no i'm not saying

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.520
that they're not innovating but really you think shrinking on the screen like that to the point

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.120
where it's covering your hands are covering they're not innovating they're copying those

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.920
they're basically it's a tablet controller maybe you need to lose some weight in your hands maybe

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.800
you need oh you're right let me just shrink down my hands let me just readjust the size of my hands

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.720
say i'll have little child hands like trump and then that way i'll be able to use that device

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.680
all right that's really who they're designing it for

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.480
for some reason the system is orange uh who go figure all right and it has a fake top

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:14.400
over here all right moving on the dark sakura save us from the land of loki rants quick

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:22.240
something that i want very much is going to be out on uh a steam on the day before my birthday

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.760
on december i'm sorry april 18th why does it say december dan ganronpa 2 goodbye despair will be

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:35.600
out which um it was already out in japan um in 2012 for the vita and then it came out in the

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:43.040
u.s in september 2014 on vita but since i think that dan ganronpa the first game has done so well

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:51.200
on steam that we're going to be getting the second one and um in addition to that i'm sure that most

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.640
fans of the series already know this but they're going to wrap up the hopes peak academy storyline

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.960
with an anime instead and then in the vein of ultra despair girls which is kind of a spin-off

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.880
game actually it's more like events that happen in between the first and second game um there's

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:16.000
going to be a v3 coming out that's going to be uh i guess in a hotel that's trapped beside a

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.960
inside a cage with new characters all new characters for that one so um yeah have you

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:29.680
already pre-ordered well i put it on my wish list i'm sure i'm sure birthday clause will bring it

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.960
for you we'll see it's just it's just it's just it's just after your birthday just after the day

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:42.960
before the day before yeah but but two days after my repeat my earlier birthday i see party all

to that by the way yes i everybody in this room hopefully will be there i should be there loki

01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:00.000
i've been uh i've been bookmarking today to make it happen all right while we uh eagerly await dark

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.760
all right well traveling over to japan and checking out the releases in japan this week

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:44.480
on march 24th dark souls 3 hits the playstation 4 and uh i know several people are looking forward

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:51.120
to this dead or alive extreme 3 comes out uh this coming week and of course there's a regular

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.160
edition and a collector's edition and all that good stuff uh nobu naga no yabu sozou

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:02.480
senkoku orishi rin comes out this week uh from koe and then a game called psycho pass sentaku

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:09.200
naki kofuku comes out in a regular and limited edition so uh i'm not sure what psycho pass is

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.080
but um it has kind of an interesting cover to it looks like it might be a game full of intrigue

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:20.240
and mystery we'll see um going over to the Wii U we don't really have anything on the

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.960
Wii U until april really when starfox zero is out so it's pretty quiet over there

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.120
but the playstation vita also has dead or alive extreme 3 venus comes out in regular and

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:38.000
collector's edition uh and hatsune miku project diva x is out this week so i bet some of our

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.640
listeners are excited about that uh it's always fun to see a new hatsune miku game come out and

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.960
there's also an accessory set i guess for the playstation vita if you want to check that out

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.760
nobu naga no yabu and psycho pass which i mentioned earlier also out on the vita vita

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:57.680
and then there's a game called tokyo zanadu sakura matsuri package comes out this week as well i

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.400
think that is just a repackaging of a prior released game probably a price reduction and

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.720
then lastly on the 3ds this week dragon quest monsters joker 3 uh and then dobutso no mori

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.680
happy home designer a special amiibo set is out the game's already out over there it's just this

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:19.520
is a special amiibo i know but oh is it the one that we already got over here that has no this

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.120
one actually has an isabel amiibo like a full amiibo not just a card well right mine came with

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:34.160
isabel and um and uh digby digby it came with uh isabel and no but that's you're thinking the um

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:40.080
um uh wii u game the the oh no this is the 3ds game the 3ds one okay yeah i got the one that

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.640
had the reader okay and then uh that is it that is what's out this week so um over in our chat

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.560
over at live dot vog network dot com uh some folks pointing out that psycho pass is an anime and

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.280
rama says psycho pass is an amazing anime so um and i trust him because he's the host of anime

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:05.840
jam session when i first thought psycho pass was like psycho pass you're first a psycho and then

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:15.600
you pass psychonus psycho pass what that's sometimes where we end up at the end of an

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.600
episode of orange lounge radio believe it's like we've gone past that point of going completely

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:28.080
psycho the game was made exactly for this channel how about our uk releases yeah yeah we'll get to

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.200
i just i just want to say real quick though one thing you have to understand about this game

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.080
julian it's japanese and they have some weird stuff in japan no no offense we've got some

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.000
awesome we've got some weird stuff in the u.s yeah that's right they look at some of our stuffs

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:48.960
like how did japan make a giant lizard attacking tokyo radiation julian who knows who knows

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.360
somebody probably probably taking some pills the doctor said they shouldn't take that's how i'm

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.680
thinking that's what i'm thinking it happened recreational pharmacy that's right and they made

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:06.880
some weird made super weird things in super myo galaxy one and two you know what julian yes they

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:15.360
did yes they did julian which reminds me i still need to show julian um georgia oh yeah educate him

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.480
on japanese horror movies the age of eight no it was the the sentai series that we were watching

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.840
oh it was like the animals and minecraft world why did i think why did in my head i hear juan

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.960
well thinking you want to show him the grudge he can see when he's 11 all right

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.840
we'll pour some beers and watch some japanese horror movie all right he's 11 uk releases

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.040
dark saga i don't get interested in watching any horror movie you're not interested in horror

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:49.040
movies no i don't like him either they sound horrible they do yeah they sound horrible

01:17:49.040 --> 01:18:02.320
all right on the 24th we have um samaras three on mac and pc on the 28th we have adrift for pc

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.200
gunjack for pc and pinball ethics 2 vr for pc

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:17.120
oh yeah um and then nope the other one's the week after that so never mind all right just a couple

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.080
more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week and then a break but loki first

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.880
oh this sounds like a wonderful idea so there's a rumor that sony is making a more powerful

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:33.200
playstation a like playstation four and a half or whatever uh it's going to feature a new gpu

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:40.080
that would support 4k resolution um also would assist with vr performance and would be backwards

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:52.080
compatible with the playstation 4 why why playstation playstation four and three quarters

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.480
exactly the kid's got a point how where do we draw the line then there's going to be playstation

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:04.240
four and five eighths you know how what what where does this end i just don't see the point

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:10.160
why fragment the you know the whole platform but whatever i mean it and if it isn't mean if all

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:16.320
games are gonna run on both systems then what's the point it runs it better i mean i just don't

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:22.880
see i don't know it just i i don't know like i again i i kind of feel like nintendo's kind of

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.480
done this to an extent they just put the different names on the consoles but like is it a 4.5 because

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.040
it's actually going to be fully backwards compatible with playstation 4 games um and

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.040
maybe playstation 5 or whatever they're designing well here's what i'm thinking you know if it

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.320
supports like 4k resolutions and stuff like that that's kind of cool i guess but once again that's

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:50.320
i mean i don't know 4k tvs aren't really widely adopted yet that's kind of like jumping on to the

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.760
3d gaming bandwagon oh they did that too that's right that's right they were trying to push

01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.240
stereoscopic 3d you know with their their headsets and stuff vr at least hopefully will do better i

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:10.480
hope but i i just i don't know bobbie is pointing out that yes it is to make better vr games and

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:16.160
allow 4k gaming and yeah i've heard the whole thing about the 4k gaming as well and and

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.040
certainly the the boost to vr make those games look better but still it's the whole fact that

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.600
it's kind of like going to be it's the same thing we're talking about the xbox one last week but at

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:32.000
this i i guess to be fair if they just called it the playstation 5 would we be having these issues

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.480
sure but why do i have to buy a new system to make the vr games better

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.280
it's it's your platform make your vr technology better then i mean maybe this should should we

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.800
wait a little longer for this to be released because like i understand if you're saying

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.640
that the hardware can't do it then maybe you should have put some extra gpu's or shit

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:57.280
oh stuff in the um actual you know little device thing the breakout box that they have maybe there

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.040
should have been some actual processing power in there because if this can't handle it if we

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:08.480
got to put on another system to be able to handle this this peripheral i'm paying 500 for thank you

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.720
very much i mean what's the point i'll buy a pc at that point if i have to keep upgrading to keep

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.600
you know up with the actual console games that's a pc that's a pc at that point that's why i don't

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.400
play on pc mostly because i have to keep upgrading my specs to be able to play the new games i'm

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.480
supposed to avoid that with consoles but now here we are yeah yeah julian what do you want to say

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.960
why are you are you not allowed to say bad words around me i've already seen freaking die hard

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.720
well yippee ki-yay motherfucker ladies ladies and gentlemen my son

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:58.800
i mean if you really want to do that if you really do you really are we turning this up

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:10.160
to 10 i mean is that that's because it's we've had this discussion before becky and i yes that if you

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:18.080
make using adult language something that's taboo it's just going to make them want to do it all

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.640
the more you make no big deal out of it and as we can see julian is it a big deal

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:31.520
um it's not really a big deal as long as you don't say it a bunch like like at school you

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:40.000
don't want to say the f word unless you break your whole leg i think that's an allowable excuse

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.240
that would be an allowable time to drop an f-bomb but you see sometimes on this program loki will

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.320
use the f word sometimes i do too we use it a lot we use it a lot so you know i lost count

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:58.320
and die hard around 30 door did you try to count that's that's uh it's pretty impressive there

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:03.280
might be some website telling you how many f words they there aren't die hard

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:10.960
ah love it uh yeah and that's julian's favorite christmas movie by the way our chatters right now

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:15.920
they love you i just want you to know they look they think die hard counts as a christmas movie

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.080
because then i would just watch it on christmas every single year yeah you should watch it on

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.720
christmas every single year although my favorite christmas movie is gremlins all right oh my gosh

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.920
okay but i just want you to know the chatters you're one of the favorite guests they've ever

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.440
had seen on the show i just want you to know that like i'm not making that up you come over here

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.800
yourself they love you so all right uh wow i feel so happy

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.760
all right that's why i say at the end of every episode all right

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:52.880
one other uh quick story here on bravely second uh bravely second and lair uh is uh the sequel

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:58.960
to bravely default on the nintendo ds and of course they've made some changes uh with bravely

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:04.960
second for the us release one of the big things is that they changed uh they changed this uh

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:10.240
subclass i think that was the tomahawk is what it was called before but it kind of appropriated some

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.040
native american culture that may have been insensitive here in this so they changed it

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.480
into a different class that uh takes a little more from cowboys so uh they did that that's one

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:26.240
big change but they also did some changes to side quests and apparently in the japanese version of

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.480
the game sometimes you would do side quests and the endings may not be so good like some bad

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.760
things may happen and you might kind of regret doing the side quests well uh what they ended

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.520
up doing is they actually changed these endings for the u.s audiences and now people are saying

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:47.280
oh you dumbed it down you lightened it up for the u.s and so forth well so far to the point

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.080
where nintendo actually put out a statement saying when the game was released in japan

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:57.040
each side quest would end with the team lamenting the decision they made regardless of the player's

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.600
decision this was intended to help players empathize with the character situation

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.320
but overwhelming feedback from players indicated that they felt an unsatisfying disconnect between

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:12.000
their intentions and the character's reactions in response these side quest endings were amended to

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.920
show the party readily coming to terms with their actions in a manner that does not cause the player

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:25.280
undue regret for their decisions these changes do not affect the gameplay so in other words sometimes

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.960
bad things happen and you have to deal with it but they're trying to give it a good good ending here

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:35.760
yeah julian what you mean by bad endings do you mean like you did this side quest so bad and

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.400
horribly your brother's head gets chopped up or something well something like that something

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.200
actually something like that now see we don't know because they don't want to spoil it because

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.040
if you were to say what happens you're kind of spoiling the story right that's like why when

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.640
you talk about star wars episode 7 there's one thing you don't talk about and that's what happens

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.280
in the last 15 minutes right you don't talk about that with people who haven't seen it so i think

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:00.880
it's kind of like that where they don't want to spoil it so we don't exactly know what happens

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.120
we just know it's bad so yeah somebody's brother probably gets it

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.760
speaking of julian julian have you seen the star wars movie you probably have seen the star wars

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.240
movie this is what happens i haven't seen it thank you for spoiling it spoiling julian if

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:26.800
you want to see an example of a bad ending tell your mom to shoot the annoying uh kid on top of

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:39.440
the citadel oh that's a bad ending mass effect well there is um ways to kill it you shoot the

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:47.120
machine that destroys all um synthetics okay hold on you don't don't ruin mass effect because

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.120
bobby blackwolf still hasn't played it so that's okay i understand i understand sometimes i want

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:56.000
to spoil it too because it's been like seven years and you didn't say that all right that's why i

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.920
phrased it the way that i did it pretend i did not say that pretend i didn't say it you're good

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:09.680
you're good you're good if you haven't played it by now all right all right anyway uh there

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.240
so there you go there's some changes happening in a bravely second and uh for better for worse

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.800
there it is they're they're having to defend it all right let's take a trip down memory lane shall

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:27.360
we every week every week here on the program uh dark sakura steps into the gaming vault to find

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:33.360
a game that hey you guys should respect this this is a classic game of the week and remember folks

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:39.280
the rules on what makes a classic game of the week is that a jamie has to like it or at least

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:46.400
want to acknowledge it b it has to be at least 10 years old yeah so remember the game the dark

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.760
soccer is picking tonight is 10 years old it's exactly 10 years old as of today this game is

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:58.400
older than julian you can believe it so all right so dark soccer dark soccer's picked one tonight

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.200
that is exactly 10 years old and get ready because brace yourselves for the groans that are about to

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.560
come from the chat room when they realize get ready to feel ancient gamers years old dark

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:17.200
sakura what is the classic game of the week the elder scrolls for oblivion yes oblivion is 10

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:28.880
years old as of today um like it's uh the game that came after it skyrim uh this is an action

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:36.960
a role-playing video game developed by bethesda um it is the fourth game in the elder school series

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:45.360
following uh morrowind and preceding skyrim as i just said and um it actually was released for in

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:53.680
march 2006 actually on this day in 2006 for windows and for the xbox 360 and

01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:03.920
it had uh some content expansions there were shivering aisles and it had a game of the year

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:11.440
edition and also included nights of of the nine with it in 2007 and there was a fifth anniversary

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:18.560
version in 2011 and i bought it on steam for two dollars because that's what they do with games

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:28.960
when there's a newer version so basically um it it focuses on a cult um called mythic dawn

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:35.280
that's trying to open the gates to the realm of oblivion and so it's very open world you can

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:45.520
do things to improve your skills or um you know develop other abilities that you have um

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:51.840
and this game actually took a while to develop it started in 2002 right after morrowind um was

01:29:51.840 --> 01:30:01.360
released and they have a lot smarter npc's in fact the npc's can make choices and have different

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:08.880
complex behaviors by using what they call the radiant ai system um it was uh you know one of

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.680
the other good things about this too is that it had some pretty nice voice work in it i mean

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:20.000
as far as um voice actors that you had in this you had and let me get back to the list because

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.040
i know it had patrick stewart in it linda carter and i think sean bean in a non-dying role

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:32.560
i think so you know one of those little uh unicorn of a role for him you know kind of

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:42.480
like silent hill was um because he didn't die in silent hill um but it was really just you know

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:51.680
meant to be a lot more immersive um it had uh some pretty i'd say you know for 2006 it had really

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:57.360
good graphics it had a new interface um hdr lighting a longer draw distance um

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:03.520
at its time it was really on the edge of you know pushing everything sort of how

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:10.160
skyrim was when it came out um of course you know a month later there were things that did

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:16.320
more but uh the game there's really not too much else i can say about it because you've either

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:26.000
played it or played games like it or you haven't um but it was uh i'd say about as epic when it

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:33.040
came out of skyrim was when it came out and uh definitely you know building on a very big uh

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:39.200
mythology behind uh what had already been established in the season um i'm sorry in the

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:47.520
series um it got a rating of um actually it initially got a rating of t for teen and then it

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:56.400
went to um a mature rating uh due to content that was not in the initial esrb review um

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.840
the actual quote on here says the presence in the pc version of the game of a locked out art file

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.800
that if accessed by um by using an apparently unauthorized third-party tool allows the user

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:14.160
to play the game with topless versions of female characters you know what modding happens that was

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.800
a really big deal when that happened though because it was like wait a minute the game makers

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:26.560
didn't intend for this to happen but because there was an actual female figure on the disc they had

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.400
to do the rating even though it wasn't intended to be seen in the game well and on top of that

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:36.720
it was also super blown out of proportion and sensationalized by most of the major media at

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:43.600
that point because what they neglected to say is that it was not regularly accessed uh uh game

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:49.760
content that you had to use a tool to get that sort of like the hot coffee thing you know in

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:58.160
grand theft auto whichever one that was four right three actually right san andreas or sanders so at

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:06.320
any rate um i figured that i would push the line and pick a really good game that came out exactly

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:14.560
a year ago today 10 years ago whatever i can't number rob geez um it came out 10 years ago today

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:22.480
to number one to make everyone it was a must-have on 360 too it was it really was uh it wasn't

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.960
quite a launch title but since nobody could get an xbox 360 when they first came out it pretty

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:33.520
much was a launch title so um yeah and uh let's see jim sally says yes oblivion made me lose my

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:40.400
job i wore i wore out my right stick leveling my health magic to 100 oblivion was stupidly addictive

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:46.080
and fun great choice for an old game review i just the world was so vast and i just remembered that

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.440
was really one of the first games because i didn't really get into morrowind so oblivion was really

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.320
one of the first games where i felt like i could just go anywhere i i'm just i'm gonna go into this

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:59.040
cave just because it can and i'm just gonna i'm gonna mess some stuff up in this cave and find

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:04.640
like maybe a potion for doing it all well but you remember what this paved the way for though is

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.080
that by the time we got to skyrim we already had this expectation of what can we do yeah so we

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:16.480
collected cabbages and rolled them down a hill which was awesome totally awesome i can't wait

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.160
for elder scrolls 6 that's all i'm saying yeah you know though i am curious though going just

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:28.080
touching a little bit on skyrim yeah you remember how someone used the uh like a cheat code to get

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.880
past the barriers and you could actually travel into morrowind and some of the other uh oh yeah

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.960
areas around and i wonder if the next game would actually be expansive enough you can travel

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.840
through the various we'll see areas of that's creepy time will tell that is creepy in the

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:50.640
meantime anything there it is your classic game of the week 10 years old today i was looking at

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:56.400
loki's thing the elder scrolls 4 oblivion just the way the light was catching the lenses on the vr

01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:03.760
thing uh-huh i was like oh my god that just creeped me out like a lot all right i'm gonna

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.600
go run away now all right that's all right we're gonna take a quick break anyway uh we have to take

01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.160
talk to you guys a little later when we open up the skype line at one eight seven seven game olr

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.920
or our username on skype orange lounge radio all right let's move on with some rapid fire news and

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.040
quickly talk about some other gaming highlights for the week loki so apparently j.j abrams is

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:17.600
still working on movies for portal and half-life um they're underway i guess and apparently they've

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.880
got writers and they're working on both of the stories but nothing exciting to announce so far

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:29.520
so i guess those movies will probably come out before the next half-life game

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.560
it's too bad but hey maybe if the movies you know get more hype in those series then

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.880
that might motivate them to work a little harder on it i guess we'll have to see you

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:53.280
uh so this is kind of cool um simon pegg has been asked to or is in talks to join the movie

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.200
adaption of ready player one which i can't wait to see and of course that's supposed to be coming

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:04.480
out now oh man it was supposed to come out christmas of 2017 but now it's march 30th of

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:12.160
2018 whatever i'll wait an extra three months but um yeah i can't wait to check that out

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.800
hopefully uh i don't know which character he'd be playing oh ogden morrow okay i could see that

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:28.000
um and then finally um they're gonna be putting out some new xbox one controllers and some new

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.760
colors they've got this uh dusk shadow which it's like a copper shadow and dusk shadow so

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.120
it's kind of a black that fades to blue or you know a copper color and those are available

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:47.920
and they are going to be ten dollars more expensive than the regular controllers

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:58.000
why apparently this is great because it's i love it when developers do this or publishers you can

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.640
only get the copper shadow model at game stop and the dust shadow well that's going to be a best buy

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:11.200
so um otherwise if you wait into um if you want to get it anywhere else throughout the world that's

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:17.920
going to be coming out in april you know i gotta say though those um controllers are gorgeous

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.640
like i don't know about the whole like wow it's 10 more dollars but the controllers are really

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:26.560
good looking i got it probably the copper one yeah i actually really like the blue one that's

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.680
fun i actually got to replace my one of my playstation 4 controllers because it's all

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.080
the bright analog sticks is all derpy and shit that's that's the one that my two-year-old son

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.080
gets he gets the derped controller because he doesn't actually play the games anyways

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:46.880
there you go he just shadows along yeah all right to register participation for this week's episode

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:52.320
of orange on treaty with bognetwork.com use the passphrase unit uh let's move on and talk about

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.120
splatoon and splatfest uh apparently there have been some changes to splatfest so even though you

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.760
know uh there were supposed to be no more major updates to splatoon there are still some little

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:07.600
minor tweaks coming and uh in the latest splatfest the vibe meter now has your splatfest power and

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:11.760
the splatfest power level depends on your ranked battle rank and your splatfest power level will

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.320
change as you win or lose during splatfest the player with the highest splatfest power on the

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:21.120
winning team gets a slightly larger boost to their power than their teammates after the match

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.560
also until now the splatfest matchmaking would favor groups with similar play styles

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:31.360
but players will now be more likely to play with those of similar splatfest power level

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:35.520
the higher the average splatfest power level the more splatfest points that you will get

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.920
what happens though if that power level goes over 9000 well then just paint explosions everywhere

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:49.200
like a dirty porno all right uh anyhow this could have been a thing but it wasn't you know the game

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.200
demon's crest which is by the way awesome i don't know if you've ever played it was like an old

01:41:53.200 --> 01:42:00.240
school gameboy game uh anyhow apparently uh renegade kid was a company and the founder uh

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:07.680
jewels watson actually mentioned on twitter that they pitched a gameboy advanced port of

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:15.040
demon's crest to capcom years back but nothing ever became became of it and uh capcom did explain

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:19.120
that the super nintendo version just didn't sell enough units to make it a viable proposition

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.800
oh that's unfortunate because that game was awesome but you know speaking of the gameboy

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.320
advance huh 10 year anniversary is tomorrow is it really i guess that makes sense dang

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.440
now we can start adding that into the classic game of the week pool

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:39.600
uh also and lastly for me tonight uh apparently there's a psa out there that uh if you're

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:44.320
interested i'm sorry 15 you know obviously 15 year anniversary i was gonna say i thought gba

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:50.480
was long before especially 60 um anyway uh hyrule warriors legends you probably don't want to play

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:58.480
that on the old 3ds it really runs best on the new 3ds and they say it runs like garbage on the

01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:08.240
old 3ds on the old 3ds uh you get sub 30 frames a second performance there is no 3d option and uh

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:12.080
yeah apparently some folks are going so far as to say you know they probably shouldn't have even

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.160
made it uh play they should have just said it's a new 3ds exclusive um and you guys know how i

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.120
feel about new 3ds exclusives but hyrule warriors i'm kind of like yeah i can play that on the weu

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.760
so i don't feel like i'm losing anything major well you're not gonna be able to play as those

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.200
extra characters because you have to buy it on both systems no i thought they were i thought

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.640
they were bringing it out on the weu yeah they are but the only way to play them on the weu is

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:43.360
you have to get a special download code that's in that 3ds version thank you nintendo i love

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:52.080
buying games more than once barf barf barf all right uh how about dark sakura a few things there

01:43:52.160 --> 01:44:01.680
is axiom verge uh it is uh going to be uh ported out to the xbox one and we you to be released

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:07.040
later this year um also uh the vita version is still in development too

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:19.280
xbox one by the way actually as of today um will be taking 50 off the price so it is going to go

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:27.040
down for the 500 gigabyte version 299 dollars the uh the division one terabyte bundle will be going

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:34.880
for 300 349 so uh and also a few of the games will be getting a 20 price cut including halo 5

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:41.840
which will never be a classic game of the week um also on march 22nd they're going to do a week-long

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:48.640
xbox store sale that discounts games by 40 to 60 percent including fallout 4 and far cry primal

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:54.720
so there you go oh there's more oh one more because i have another story yes

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:04.480
um i i i don't know how i feel about this because there's um gonna be a resident evil

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:16.880
slash biohazard musical um it's going to be directed um by uh actor rayon yuzuki who um

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:28.160
has uh been uh it looks like uh an actor who's been in uh a uh an all-female show called the uh

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:35.840
taco uh takara zuko review um which is as someone who's famous for playing male characters and it

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:43.680
will be overseen by capcom's um hirouki kobayashi so there you go i hope it has the acting chops of

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:50.160
the first game i'm quoting the article here and that i hope there's a song called jill sandwich i

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:54.880
was just about to say there better be a song called jill sandwich then again if it's only

01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:02.400
in japan likely that line i mean i'd have to get little no because that wasn't the because

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.640
the japanese release was in english um act deft in our chat over at live.vog network.com says little

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.400
shop of horror style musical please yes and there needs to be a song like suddenly see more in it i

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:19.280
would uh i would be so down for that and it would be every karaoke across america for the rest of

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:26.080
our lives but you have to have someone singing like um what's-her-face that played uh abri

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:31.280
yeah ellen barkin with the accent yeah the way that she talks

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.640
i see i think one night on the show dark soccer and i just need to cancel olr and do duets all

01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:50.880
night on the show would you guys enjoy that we have to have the olr sing along we we kind of

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.120
did that one week but it was it was a long long long long time ago when karaoke revolution first

01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:00.240
came out and then you weren't here that week we did it honestly enough you know there is like

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:06.800
a recording out there somewhere of me singing karaoke revolution at my friend mitch's party

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:14.480
nice in mobile alabama nice that was back when um uh ground zero was still open in mobile

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:19.200
well you know um years and years and years and years and years ago before olr it was probably

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:26.160
what the i think it was the year 2000 uh i went to a little convention in las vegas with my buddy

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:32.800
uh named jessica and we went into a little uh kiosk there and recorded ourselves singing

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.120
love shack and little did i know that that video would come back to haunt me for years

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:44.240
and years and years after recording that so no no anyway all right let's move on to the

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.280
frugal question of the week

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:59.600
every week we go to our facebook and our google plus communities and you take those words you

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:04.640
slam them together you get frugal and tonight dark soccer will be singing all of your answers

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:10.880
here we go i'm just kidding all right uh details of the playstation vr are out is what we asked

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:16.000
our listeners this week it's going to cost 399 dollars for 99 if you need a camera and

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.720
move controllers so now that you have most of the details save for many maybe some more games come

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:26.560
e3 have you decided if you're getting one or not why or why not let's start on google plus tonight

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.960
where prince beach fuzz says probably not i haven't seen anything that's convinced me i must

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:37.600
have it uh martin over on google plus says since i already have a ps4 i might get one if i see some

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:42.560
cool games announced for it some racing games perhaps at 400 it's in the upper realm of

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.520
disposable income purchases for me though i realize 400 is still a lot of money the oculus

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:52.640
and htc vive are just too expensive to be impulse buys no game would probably be good enough to

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:57.680
persuade me to spend that much here's the thing about racing games though as awesome as that

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:03.200
sounds i would worry could something moving that fast make me sick in virtual reality i think if

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.600
you do a racing game there's you know certain ways to do it so just you know you got to be

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:11.920
careful how fast you go and things like that i don't know if you could do f0 very well in

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:20.000
virtual reality then again i did play gx and like a rig sort of thing but anyway um moving on to

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.640
act deft who replied and said i do want one will i get it though probably not on launch i also need

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.000
to get a playstation 4 too but hopefully it will get actual support from sony and third parties

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.120
and it will be cheaper in a year or two going to facebook where we have a lot of answers tonight

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.320
fabrice a says i'm interested but i'll still wait it's a bunch of money and i've never even

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:49.680
tried any vr gear i'm also afraid vr is going to be a fad just like 3d television was mike b says

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:53.840
no i feel it will be another fad but at least it's one more step in the right direction like having

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:58.960
a holodeck and dr says yeah i'll probably get one i already have the camera and controllers so i got

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:06.080
that going for me tried psvr at psx and i'm pretty excited by what it can do winston h says

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:10.640
i probably won't get one considering it's out of my price range even if i did have the money i feel

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:16.240
like vr is still kind of niche at the moment guillermo r says yes because of res infinite and

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:20.640
sony being very active and working with developers to minimize motion sickness triggers gives me

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:25.120
confidence which by the way bobby blackwolf kind of piggybacked on on what i was saying

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:30.400
in the chat room and says you can do racing games and vr safely the trick is to render the cockpit

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.840
so your brain has a frame of reference to adjust to and that's because dark soccer you've talked

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:39.760
about being motion sick in games before and usually if like a game like oblivion funny

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.440
enough if you can shift into third person it's not nearly as bad because you have like that

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.080
reference thing not nearly as bad but what was funny is though is like in golden eye

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.280
even though you had the gun on screen yeah that made me really motion sick yeah i mean that's

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:56.800
probably the game that's done to me the worst maybe because the gun isn't enough you know the

01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.160
gun isn't really it's not a very good point of reference you know balancing a little bit too i'm

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:04.880
trying to remember if it did um it used to like doom i think it would bounce a little bit but

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:12.000
like in wolf doom doom and wolfenstein weren't really i have a head bob yeah anyway uh moving on

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.280
to critical myth who says no because i've yet to see the killer game that would be worth the

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:23.520
investment and i'm not convinced this is the next big advancement in gaming uh kirk k replied and

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.240
said the more and more i hear and see about these vr headsets makes me not want any of them this is

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:34.320
just part of video games that i'm not looking forward to at all nemesis 47 says that'd be a no

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.560
for me that's pretty much the price of a playstation 4 for something that's going to be a gimmick such

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:43.440
as the playstation 3 with the 3d gimmick or the move controller rather buy a playstation 4 than

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:48.560
a peripheral for only a few games thank you a game only needs a few controllers in the system

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.720
enough said entertainment says i feel like i'm a broken record at this point because i keep saying

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:56.480
the same thing over and over i feel like i'm a broken record at this point because i all right

01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:03.200
you get it and then says i want to demo any vr device before i purchase it william murderface

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:08.640
says the psvr looks interesting but even if i had a ps4 i don't i probably would hold off for a while

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.800
at this point it's still just a neat gimmick with a lot of promise when i see something that i

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:17.520
consider solid interesting and well executed then i will think about it degenerate johnny

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:22.720
says i have to say no even though i'm a consumer whore and how i still have standards one of those

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:27.600
standards is that there must be proper software support to warrant a hardware purchase so far

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:33.600
neither the oculus rift or the psvr have shown enough software support to my liking rage nator

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:39.680
says i know i won't get a playstation vr if only because i don't have a playstation 4 and i have no

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:45.280
real desire to get a playstation 4 i might however consider getting an oculus rift once i upgrade my

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:50.960
video card rob replies and says i won't get one right away i've seen this type before on the 3d

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:56.080
tvs only this time they're marketing to a significantly smaller demographic jordan t says i

01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:00.640
will buy one but not off the top we'll wait to see in a year or so i think the fad or gimmick part of

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:05.600
vr will be seen in the controller interfaces motion tracking hands and so forth and eventually most

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.160
games will settle focus on just the headset and either a normal gamepad or anything that can

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:15.920
replicate seated immersion like a joystick or a steering wheel lastly veronica isabelle says i

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.960
won't be buying one because i don't have a playstation 4 lots and lots of answers this week

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.600
uh over on facebook and google plus so it seems like we have a lot of listeners that are like i

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:30.240
don't even have a ps4 yet so this isn't something i'm really interested in buying it seems like a

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:35.520
lot of people who have tried it firsthand are very interested in it and then people who haven't

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:41.520
are kind of like i need to wait and see or i need that killer app i need that thing that makes it

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:46.320
very worth it and i don't think there's any problem with wanting that game that is going

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:51.760
to make it all worth it um and i see some folks in chat are saying rez rez rez which is weird

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:57.840
because rez is a game from like 1990 no but 2001 i think is when rez is so it is weird that a game

01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:04.320
that old uh but i got to admit i'm probably gonna pick up a psvr and you bet your ass i'm gonna get

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:09.920
rez because i really want to play that in vr um but i also know you know i'll probably pick up

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.920
some of the other uh mini game collections and some of the other stuff if they if they actually

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:17.280
do this star wars battlefront that might finally get me into battlefront that sounds awesome

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.800
so anyhow those are our answers from facebook and google plus thanks everybody for answering

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.720
that was some really good participation this week appreciate it all right let's move on back into

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:32.080
some other news loki i was just taking a look at the nx controller i don't think those buttons are

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:36.480
actual physical anymore oh really you think yeah if they're touch screen buttons well because the

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.440
way that they look either that or they're inset which is even weirder i don't like that at all

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:45.040
they're inset but the way they have it lit because they also have these like arrow buttons that are

01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:55.840
on the edges and it just looks fake so okay anyways so um microsoft made a really weird

01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:04.240
announcement they basically said hey um we are going to be opening up our online um to allow

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:09.120
connections with other consoles and pc networks so it's going to be up to the developers to support

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:13.520
this feature but they're going to open up xbox live so that you can do cross play with other

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:20.640
platforms that's kind of cool i mean i know in the past that's been kind of a stickler with a

01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:24.240
lot of the mmo's and stuff they were supposed to come into those platforms and i think now

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:31.760
with rocket league they're going to be supporting that um so i'll have to wait and see um now sony's

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:37.680
response to that is you know hey we're cool with that we just want to get some more information

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:43.280
on that to see you know you know they've been you know we've been supporting the cross platform

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.400
thing already with you know back even on the playstation 3 and now with you know different

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:54.480
integration they have with like you know street fighter 5 and that type of thing um it's all about

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.480
you know the developers and publishers what they want to do they need to get in touch with us and

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:06.080
handle everything else on a case-by-case basis so basically they just need to see what how they

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:12.720
implement this and how they can do it safely and all that fun stuff well this is going to be very

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.400
interesting for the future of gaming if they really pull this off and there's people you know

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:22.720
you can be on xbox one and play with people that are on a playstation 4 it's really not something

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:28.000
you've been able to do before and yes even i've cited the final fantasy 11 reference but the

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
interesting thing about final fantasy 11 even though that game you know if you forget you could

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:38.640
play that game on pc playstation 2 and xbox 360 you could play cross platform but you went through

01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:45.120
a portal play online to be able to play the game so technically it was all those systems were

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.960
connecting to play online which then really managed the game you had a separate id through

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.640
play online and all this stuff so that's how 11 kind of worked and made that happen so now i'm

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:58.400
assuming with what we're talking about in this whole cross-platform thing we're not going to have

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:03.440
play online it's going to be a bit more of a direct communication although you know i assume

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.080
the companies would have their servers their play servers and that's what everything would be

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:13.200
connecting to but it'll be a lot more seamless than trust me 11 was kind of like like kind of

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:16.640
a pain in the ass every kind of cool like you know with destiny and stuff you're gonna have

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.360
all the destiny players together and all that type of things and you'd be cool like to see

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:27.520
leaderboards and you know i don't know i think it's it's definitely a good idea i just be interested

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.960
to see how they implement that well and this is something i've been saying xbox one's been needing

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:35.920
to do for a long time now i wonder if xbox one is going to get final fantasy 14 you know and some

01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:39.760
of these some of these games that they've been kind of closed off to because of their policies

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:45.440
this that policy is the reason they didn't get um final fantasy 14 i'm telling plug in xbox one

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:51.040
into the pc version of uh 14 all the xbox controller stuff comes up so they were ready

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:56.080
to put that game on xbox one i'm sure so it'll be interesting to see maybe they do a the next

01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:01.040
expansion will be available on xbox one i bet i bet that'll be a thing now that this has been

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:07.360
torn down we'll see uh trying to look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:13.200
yyr says another announcement that they made that didn't make the headlines xbox one will now

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:20.800
support the mono game framework which is a new implementation of microsoft's own xna this actually

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:27.680
helps me out a lot this means multitasking for xbox one and playstation 4 will come out a lot

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:33.120
sooner that's pretty cool i did not realize that was another thing that they had announced

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.960
still waiting for that announcement where i can use an xbox one as a dev kit

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:45.040
that was promised before the xbox one launched well a lot changed before the xbox one actually

01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:50.960
launched but so anyhow uh one game that has seen a lot of success at least on the playstation 4 i

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:54.640
don't think it's uh seen anything on the xbox one yet because i don't think it's out there but it's

01:58:54.640 --> 01:59:00.240
on playstation 4 and pc is the independent game firewatch which i talked about on this show um

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:04.160
last month when it came out i actually did play the game from start to finish in a couple of

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:09.120
nights i thought the story was uh good enough to uh really make me curious what was going to happen

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:13.120
and it was also like short enough where i could kind of do that in just a couple play sessions

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:20.160
well apparently firewatch has been doing some very good business for um panic the uh publisher and

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:28.080
campo santo the developer uh by the end of the first month firewatch sold sold sold firewatch

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:37.440
sold half a million full price copies so that's pretty good um firewatch's budget which apparently

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:43.760
was made back was made back in one day so they made back the cost it took to make that game in

01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:48.560
one day which actually doesn't surprise me too much because i would bet the majority of those

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:53.360
500 000 copies were sold in the first day if not the first week that is why there's always this

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:57.840
hype around release dates and so forth because you know you only have so much time when you're

01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:02.000
right there front and center if your game doesn't land with a splash it can sometimes be very hard

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:09.200
to recover from that so um good good for them for firewatch um so yeah firewatch is a sales success

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:15.360
we're grateful and relieved but mostly grateful so uh awesome they are still dedicated to fixing

02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:18.400
bugs and improving the performance across the board some people were complaining about

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.720
performance issues on playstation 4 which yeah there are some parts that skip around a little

02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:27.920
bit it didn't really ruin it for me but i definitely noticed it um so but i thought

02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:34.560
still the strength in that game was the story um so it's worth checking out so congrats i i love

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:39.840
indie successes like that so they'll be able to make whatever they want to make next awesome all

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:45.520
right let's move on dark sakura well um have you guys been keeping up with the stuff on me tomo

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:51.680
a little bit uh i'm curious like when it's gonna come out here already but i've been getting emails

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:57.840
on it from nintendo yeah about signing up for stuff about it so i'm probably gonna do it but

02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:05.440
it's actually off to a really really good start in japan um it is right now the top free app on

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:12.960
the app store um and it's even crossed over line which um line is a big social media one over there

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:18.720
for you know contacting people and doing stuff um it has more than 1 million users right now

02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:24.800
but it's going to be coming out um outside of japan we should have releases later on

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:33.680
in 15 major markets across north america western europe russia australia and new zealand uh

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:41.680
later on this month um so yeah and then there's supposed to be four other mobile games developed

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:48.160
by nintendo to be out by march 2017 so i think that's pretty cool i'm looking forward to to

02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:55.120
giving it a go when it's out over here same i'm i'm curious to check it out i'm still not sure

02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:03.440
what the game is but i'm i'm definitely me tomo isn't necessarily a game yeah it's i think a

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:10.400
platform to games yeah something like that so i mean social networking i'm just here's my thing

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:13.760
is it going to be one of those things where it's fun for a day and then i'm never going to really

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:18.800
look at it again i don't know i guess the way it's set up it sounds like it might might be like

02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.440
an ask.fm type of thing where it's asking you it's asking you random questions and you're supposed

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:27.520
to answer it um i don't know if you'll have an anonymous ask box that's probably a dangerous

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:31.520
thing for nintendo but you know for the most part it kind of seems like it's that type of thing to

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:36.560
me um an act f in chat says it's like tomodachi life well i got to admit tomodachi life was fun

02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:42.400
for a couple days and then it's kind of kind of over it you know all right um since we're on the

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:49.120
topic of mobile gaming did you get to see that brief video of pokemon go i actually thank you

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.960
for bringing it up because it didn't make our show somewhere else yes i did see the brief video that

02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:57.440
was leaked from the south by southwest panel yeah i did i still don't know how the hell that game's

02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.760
gonna play yeah it didn't really explain anything to that resort it's like you throw a pokeball at

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:06.320
a pokemon you might catch it it didn't really have battle in it which surprised me so my thought is

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.040
maybe you go out and catch the pokemon and then you battle but i mean we saw a leaked minute and

02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.160
a half out of a panel it doesn't really tell us anything it's neat it's gonna put pressure on

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:21.040
the antique to put more official information out there though i think that's gonna be i mean it

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.000
looks okay i just i'm not a fan of pokemon so i don't know there was definitely something kind

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.040
of funky there when like they were actually capturing the pokemon like i don't know if it

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:33.280
was using the camera yeah it looked like it was yeah it kind of looked like an ar type of

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:37.680
projection on your cell phone screen so that was kind of neat so i'm curious to see what that all

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:42.560
looks like but uh it didn't really look like your typical pokemon game but you know you weren't

02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:49.200
really supposed to go into it expecting that so we'll see all right uh moving on loki all right

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.000
so and you're back to talking about microsoft again um one of the things that they're trying

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:02.480
to do um apparently they want to add support for up to 64 player parties um for you know different

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.640
games like battlefield or mmo raids that type of thing because right now they're you know they

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:13.440
keep increasing it i guess it was you know originally you know eight and then you know 12

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:19.600
players now 16 they want to get it up to 64 because you know then that way you can do you

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:24.880
know 64 versus 64 and you know get all sorts of crazy you know battles and stuff going on with

02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:30.480
that and that's according to i guess a comment made by mike gabara who's the head of programming

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:40.320
at xbox um that'd be cool i mean definitely i outside of like doing those massive battles

02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.360
and stuff i don't know why you'd want to party that big i mean that god i just remember like

02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:51.360
party chat on xbox with like eight people and it's just you know a lot of noise but it'd be

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:56.560
pretty cool if you could like you know arrange more social things that way i'd even sell for

02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:03.200
that for like you know playstation 4 as well i mean that would be pretty cool um yeah i the

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:08.000
bigger game parties that would be fun it would be uh tricky to manage and of course some people you

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:13.040
know are gonna fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck the kids but if you have any future friends i mean you know

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:17.040
whatever yeah friends that'd be fun i mean because that would open it up not that we have you know

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:22.160
that many people that would want to do this but we could do something fun after olr and probably

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:25.920
everybody who would want to come could come well like i think it'd be cool to like set up something

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:29.680
like a social thing where you have almost like a dm or something that's controlling like if you

02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:34.160
want to set up tournaments i mean we're like just thinking like platform independent here for a

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:39.920
second like say say i wanted to do like a kart racing game or something like that like mario kart

02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:44.400
on you know party system like this i could set up okay you know here's all the people we're gonna

02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:49.280
have okay you're gonna be in this seed we're gonna put these players in this race and go and these

02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:52.880
eight players are gonna race and then everybody else that's not playing we get to watch them and

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:59.120
then kind of do it like you know set up you know more complicated you know gameplay options you

02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:02.800
know that'd be kind of cool if you could do something like that or even like you know

02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:08.960
you know like turn-based things like if you could do an x you know on minecraft on one of those

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:14.000
platforms you know how they have all the different modded games and stuff on pc like hunger games

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.960
or sky uh sky wars or something like that where you can set up okay we're gonna have you know

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:23.680
these eight players go and then the next tier is gonna go and just set up like almost like a

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:29.600
bracket tournament type thing would be kind of fun um and broadcast it all to twitch or something

02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:33.840
you could use that to play or you could use that to play jackbox games i bet well actually

02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:37.760
the phone thing a lot of those games support tons and tons of players um i was gonna say

02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:43.440
ubisoft's the werewolf game 64 players where you can't see there are you the werewolf no are you

02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:48.880
the world no are you the world no are you the world no are you the world no uh we'll

02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:53.520
give murder face and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says it's also often a shit show

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:58.160
having played in a 32 player party it often turns to a train wreck especially in first-person

02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:04.000
shooters all right uh let's move on to this story and then we'll get to our mailbag for this week

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:11.760
uh gdc was not without its controversy uh microsoft had an after party one night and uh they

02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:18.000
kind of did that typical frat party scene you would see where there were some booth babes that

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.320
were there dancing uh there's actually some pictures that made it onto twitter where you've

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:27.360
got these ladies that are dancing and it honestly looks like she's wearing nothing but a bra on the

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:32.240
top or at least that's what it looks like and then kind of like one of those uh skirts and things um

02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:38.320
and you know wearing proper schoolgirl attire i don't know about proper school if you're britney

02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:44.240
spears if you're britney spears exactly 15 years she was in a school dress like that am i to believe

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:51.040
that that is an act an inaccurate depiction of what kids wear nowadays so here's the thing with

02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:57.280
that is that you know obviously because the game uh industry has had a reputation of being a bit

02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:03.040
of a frat house they're trying to welcome more diversity especially women but some of the women

02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:08.000
that attended this party were kind of turned off by this going uh in fact there's one tweet out

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.240
there uh saying this is how the games industry excludes women by pretending we don't exist and

02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:18.800
having dev parties with strippers um anyhow i to microsoft's credit as unfortunate as the

02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:26.800
circumstance was to microsoft's credit uh swiftly did phil spencer uh from xbox respond to this uh

02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:31.040
like an email went out to everybody at microsoft and of course it leaked out uh phil spencer

02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:36.240
replied to this um in the next morning basically saying that the party represented xbox and

02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.720
microsoft in a way that was not consistent or aligned to our values and then went on and called

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:45.520
it unequivocally wrong yeah i don't know if they're the one like it could have been the venue

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:49.840
that did that because they have like you know dancers and stuff that go along with the dj but

02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:56.880
yes either way it's not appropriate for a business dev party a party planner somewhere along the line

02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:02.320
got fired but i wonder you you bring an interesting insight is that what if maybe they told the

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:07.680
nightclub they wanted to do this party and the nightclub was like oh yeah we know gamers yeah

02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:11.760
sure wink wink well i don't even think it was necessarily that it's like this is what we this

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:16.480
is our setup you know we have dancers we have the dj you know that type of thing but then again it's

02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:21.840
it doesn't matter though because you as the party the hosts of the party you know the the company

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:26.080
is doing you need to be on top of what they're doing we're not excusing it we're just saying

02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:31.360
like that's probably how it happened but it just goes to show that yeah i don't think hey can we

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:36.480
get people that are scantily clad in like school girl outfits that are sexy and can we have them

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:42.080
that's going to totally you know make our women developers feel invited or anybody else that's

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:46.880
you know it's totally not going to be awkward you know discussing business while there's like

02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:53.760
you know some lady dancing in there i mean yeah so it was a horrible miscommunication on the way and

02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:58.400
unfortunately pers and i've said this a million times on the show perception is everything

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:04.320
and when you have britney spears esque ladies dancing and nothing against those ladies they're

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:09.520
very good looking ladies and they're just making money uh that they're working and so forth but um

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:15.680
perception is you know when you have that it's no matter who planned it or how it turned out

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:20.960
it looks like microsoft is still in the dark ages when it comes to you know what the gaming

02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:24.960
industry should be um but good on them for applying to it at least real quick and letting

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:29.600
them know letting everybody know they were taking it seriously so all right uh let's get to the mail

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:35.520
bag we're gonna do it uh participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place where you can send

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:42.480
us emails every that's not the mailbag song i mean i guess it could be how about this one all right

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:47.680
uh every week dark soccer dives in the mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com and reads

02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:57.920
a few emails for us here on the program the first one comes from azhp hi olr crew azhp here as always

02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:02.000
i loved your show and listen to every episode this week's show glossed over some other important

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.280
details regarding the clico chameleon that i feel excuse me that i feel would put the situation a

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:13.040
more clear light for your listeners i feel like it's important to lay out the findings of the

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:17.440
people investigating the console as quite a bit of the incredible detective work was done by the

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:24.240
internet at large the clico chameleon that appeared at toy fair was scrutinized by people following

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:30.480
the event and the images of the back of the machine and the controllers were used highly

02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:36.480
suggested that the clico chameleon on the show floor was simply a snus junior inside a hollowed

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:42.400
out jaguar shell at this point one could give them the benefit of the doubt perhaps it was a

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:48.080
conceptual mock-up of what they hoped to achieve with the system however the actions taken after

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.200
this were bewildering the console creators posted a photo on their facebook page of what appeared

02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:59.200
to be the circuit board inside of a clear jaguar shell claiming that the accusations of a snus

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:04.480
junior inside of jaguar were false and that this is what was running inside the chameleon at toy

02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:09.760
fair instead of placating the naysayers though this photo was with alarming speed compared to

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.840
a pc dvr capture card circuit board which appeared to be chip for chip match with the alleged chameleon

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:22.080
prototype once that comparison was posted in the facebook photos comments the picture was taken

02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:29.440
down nearly instantly sorry my voice is not happy today the chameleon creators then insisted that

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:34.960
everything would be cleared up on their kickstarter page when the kickstarter launched in early march

02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:40.560
it's important to note that kickstarter requires any hardware manufacturer to have a working

02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:47.040
prototype before allowing a kickstarter page to be creative created it makes it a little easier

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:53.280
to understand why a company might try to publicly fabricate evidence of a prototype doesn't it

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:59.520
however the promised kickstarter date came and went with no activity at this point the company

02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.400
that held the rights to the clico name announced that they did not know what was going on and

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.960
announced that they had contracted a team of independent engineers to verify whether or not

02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:14.720
the chameleon prototype existed they gave the engineers a seven-day deadline to report their

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:19.120
findings as it turns out they didn't need the engineers at all the chameleon developers announced

02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.000
they didn't have anything workable and that's when clico decided to part ways with them sorry for the

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.120
long email i just wanted people to recognize the detective work being done by the internet at large

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:32.880
to protect consumers from putting down money on a potentially illegitimate kickstarter

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:39.840
could the chameleon have really existed yes but considering the way in which things were handled

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.560
it makes developers look it makes the developers look very suspicious and i feel like that

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:50.400
information needs to be shared as it's a bit disingenuous to give the listeners a vague

02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:55.520
benefit of the doubt explanation without also reporting on the findings that led to to the

02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:00.560
clico holding company parting ways with the chameleon developers i understand not wanting to

02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.680
to saber rattle without solid definitive proof but at the time there was an overwhelming amount

02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:11.120
of crowd-sourced evidence uh which convinced the console publisher to back out of a deal

02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:15.600
that's got to count for something right you're truly azhp well i'll just be honest i wasn't

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.080
following the kickstarter i have a clique of vision that's all the clico i need that and

02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:25.840
cabbage patch kids bingo and i just want to make make sure it's clear i did not go light on this

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:30.080
just because you know some people associated with this have been on the show before that would not

02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:36.800
be okay um so i just want to make clear that is not a the reason why i explained the story like

02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:42.720
i did last week what i wanted to make sure was that if i was going to talk about it that i

02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:48.880
knew with confidence the facts and to be perfectly honest with so much news that happens every week

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:53.920
and you know the fact that we all hold day jobs and so forth i actually wasn't aware of some of

02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:57.680
the things that you pointed out in that email like the facebook post and all that that was i

02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:01.040
mean i knew about the show and the shell and all that stuff i didn't know about the facebook and

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:04.320
some of that other stuff you kind of tied some things together there um so thank you for the

02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:09.520
email um and so i guess that's that there you go now our listeners have an idea what happened

02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:14.720
the problem was from the gecko they were trying to launch the kickstarter because like that we

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:20.800
had without a prototype unfortunately here last week because my stupid kids have to get sick okay

02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:26.560
it's it's all their damn fault it's it's actually it's the fault of some other parent last week

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:31.680
exactly well it's the other you know and i've watched i am fully into what's going on here so

02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:36.720
yeah it's basically they're they're they bitched from it in the beginning you know they're oh well

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:41.760
it's not fair we all got to do it but we didn't yeah oh yeah that really worked out um but so

02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:45.680
they're they basically needed the money to create a prototype and they didn't have that money so they

02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:51.760
try to fake it to be able to meet that criteria in order to launch their crowdfunding could it

02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.320
have worked out well maybe could have not worked out well possibly who knows but

02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:00.800
you know it's it's a hard sell i mean especially when you have you know it's not

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:06.720
is this gonna actually come to fruition probably not anymore because people don't trust them i

02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:11.360
mean why would why would they even attempt it anymore because there's no way no one's gonna

02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:17.280
trust you anymore you're not gonna get the calico name who's gonna who's gonna even put money

02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:22.320
against us i mean i don't think anyone is well um my offer from last week still stands if anybody

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:26.400
from the organization would like to come on the show and talk about what's going on i promise

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:32.880
respect and um non-sensationalism we'll have an honest conversation and um you can

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.960
discuss some of these questions folks have in our chat room and so forth uh um head on and

02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:44.080
hopefully we can get to the bottom of how this happened so and and help gain maybe some of that

02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:53.840
trust back so anyhow um i i don't know what else to say next you know yes kind of what cabbage

02:16:53.840 --> 02:17:00.880
another cabbage patch kid now what because they clica made them oh it's like what kind of random

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:07.040
tangent ass thing is oh okay yeah i got it got it okay hello loki dark sakura and sky i really

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:12.160
wanted to give a quick shout out to a game i've played recently that really blew me away life is

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:17.680
strange despite getting a lot of awards i feel like more people should play this life is strange

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:23.680
is an episodic telltale-esque adventure game you play as maxine a young woman who one day finds out

02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:29.040
she has the power to reverse time crazy things start happening around her people start disappearing

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:35.440
and she tries to make sense of it all your actions impact the game in sorry impact the events in the

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:40.560
game just like in the telltale games but with an interesting quirk you can reverse time and change

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:45.280
your mind if you didn't like the outcome this leads to some very interesting choices and you

02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:53.200
soon find out that no choice is 100 good or bad the story got a has let me start over the story

02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:58.560
has got a twin peaks vibe to it murder mystery meets teenage drama it just gripped my throat and

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:04.240
didn't let go until i saw the credits it deals with some very deep emotional topics i almost cried

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:10.400
and you will and you will have to make some tough choices the cel-shaded art style is beautiful is

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:15.840
just beautiful the voice acting is really great and it makes you really care about the characters

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:20.480
the soundtrack is incredible with the acoustic songs perfectly complementing intense parts of

02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:27.120
the story i highly recommend it if you like a good narrative the story is one of the best i

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:32.560
have played a long time you won't regret it as always keep up the great show martin from belgian

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:37.600
honestly i i know this game has been getting a lot of kudos and it's one of those things like

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:42.080
on my list of games to play and i'll get to it just like i finally got to undertale although

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:46.320
i need to play more undertale i didn't really play enough of it so uh i definitely check out life is

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.320
strange i do have episode one because i came in one of those i think square enix did a humble

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:54.560
bundle not that long ago and i got episode one through that so um i definitely at least at least

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:58.960
want to give it that fair shot there so i was gonna say to go back to what we're talking about

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:04.160
the calico chameleon and everything there is one uh portable uh handheld system that they just

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:10.160
went through uh crowdfunding and they actually have a finished device it's the cinclair zx

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:17.600
spectrum vega plus it's a handheld um sink was a zx spectrum like the spectrum for the british

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:25.040
computer yes like the most part and it's actually being done by you know mr cinclair that is awesome

02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:28.880
give me a commodore 64 one of those actually well they did they did have that commodore computer

02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:37.440
a few years ago i will say i like how it sounds better in europe the zx no seriously because i

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:42.400
finally heard it i was like oh yeah that makes sense because it said nazi yeah they've got it

02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:47.520
on indiegogo right now it's already met it's it's like 300 of its funding right now and you

02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:54.400
can actually pick up one for 100 pounds see we didn't have that over here at all so yeah it's

02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:59.360
got that same it's got the lcd screen at the actual original resolution and everything it's

02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:04.080
like pretty awesome and i don't know so that's something to actually you know get behind if

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:08.880
you're interested in the you know the cinclair now i know the commodore 64 was huge over there

02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:15.360
as well but it that at least we had that here so you know i have many fond memories of that but

02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:22.240
anyway all right last email yes hello lr last week you asked folks where they get their gaming news

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:27.600
i was pretty surprised that nobody mentioned neo gaff neo gaff.com is currently the largest

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:32.720
dedicated internet message board about video games at least as far as i know it has grown into

02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:38.400
a community with over 160 000 members many of whom are actually working in the industry in some

02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:44.000
capacity in fact other news sites regularly list neo gaff as a source for their information

02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:48.400
if you simply go to page one and look at forum topics you are already looking

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:55.600
at most of the day's headlines the rest are probably on page two opinions run the gamut

02:20:55.600 --> 02:21:01.040
but most folks there seem capable of mature conversation those that aren't those that

02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:07.200
aren't are swiftly banned and while creating an account there involves a long waiting period

02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:13.760
and probably supporting a junior tag for several months there's no need to even bother with that

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:18.720
if you're merely interested in browsing best of all there are no videos no pop-up advertisements

02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:25.200
and no image heavy threads unless they are tagged as such and it's the only place besides olr that

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:32.800
i am aware that i'm aware of where they regularly discuss frog fractions too neo gaff is quickly

02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:39.280
becoming my primary news source other than olr i also go to polygon.com but already they don't seem

02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:43.920
like what they used to be which is interesting considering they have they haven't been around

02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:50.160
for four years yet but i digress keep on using and boozing erin yyr i mean i'm not one to you know

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:55.840
promote filing a lawsuit against the guy that created frog fractions two just so that there's

02:21:55.840 --> 02:22:00.240
some sort of evidence to where we can find out where frog fractions two actually is you know

02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:03.840
and you just say oh hey it's a sham you know never really created the game that way he has

02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:08.880
to provide evidence to where the hell the actual game is so we can play it but i mean i think we're

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:12.400
almost at that point loki you may already be playing it and you just don't know that it's

02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:16.400
frog fractions too well i'm glad i didn't put any money towards that because that's ridiculous

02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:25.520
um really it's actually been uh uh bought by konami and released as a frogger frag fracking

02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:30.240
and it's a patchy slot game i thought i saw on twitter some stickers i don't know if they were

02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:36.720
legit or not but i saw some stuff out of um gdc and it said frog fractions three and it was written

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:42.000
like final fantasy 3 and then there was another one that said frog fraction six and it was written

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.400
like final fantasy 3's japanese logo and i think it actually said something like frog fractions

02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:55.520
three six in japan and i was like if that is official fucking brilliant but you don't get

02:22:55.520 --> 02:23:00.320
you don't get to kickstart three until two is definitively answered that's the thing anyway

02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:05.920
the emailer did not email to talk about frog fractions two but that's what happened uh they

02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:11.200
wanted to talk about neo gaff and neo gaff is a news source um yeah i know a lot of uh websites

02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:14.720
actually will source neo gaff for their news sources because there are some industry people

02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:20.080
that use it and we'll kind of post there under the guise of anonymity uh i'm still a little wary

02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:24.640
with the whole forum and especially the reason like it seems very arbitrary kind of who they

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:28.880
let on there and who they don't i don't know like there's there's just a lot of weird missing pieces

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:33.680
of the puzzle for neo gaff for me but that's just me personally as long as y'all ain't hurting

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:39.360
anybody whatever i'm all for discussion i just kind of wish they'd be a little more inviting

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:43.760
but i suppose that's how they keep a lot of shit posts off there and and spam and so forth so

02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:51.040
i and on that end of things i kind of get it so all right um and bobby blackwolf says frog fractions

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:56.080
two is an arg it's been going on for a while there is no video game yeah and i remember a story that

02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:00.800
came up on the show not that long ago they kind of talked about the argms of it so i i still feel

02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:05.200
like at least there's going to be a flash game or something that you get at the end i don't know

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.880
uh and sho 100 matt in chat says uh i just feel that they're grasping at straws for rumors if

02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:16.240
they're referencing neo gaff and yyr in response to the talk about frog fractions three says

02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:22.720
that was mentioned on neo gaff this week well there you go all right that was it for emails

02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:30.080
participate at orange on twitter.com i was about to say yes we can say it again

02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:38.720
yes yes queen dark soccer you have not been able to yet on this episode talk about your new

02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.960
addiction do you want to quickly share with us because this is cross-promotion for my podcast

02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:50.960
of mine my big addiction right now is watching raja and raven do tutor boot they are drag queens

02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:59.520
by the way if you i love drag queens so much um and i have very minorly contributed to the career

02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:07.680
of the drag queen two years ago by letting her buy the pantone emerald studded lashes instead

02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:14.400
of me buying them well dark sakura um this is a good part for me to say that when you watch the

02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:19.840
next episode of drag race you should come on reading is fundamental that's the podcast about

02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:25.680
everything drag race that i do with captain spike and slide kick from game buoy as well as delvin

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:31.520
from video game realness which came back from the dead this week so um check that out rafpodcast.com

02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:37.520
i have to get it is not about video games period no i have to i i'm gonna i have to still finish

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:41.520
watching the first episode of season eight because i mean i'm probably gonna go back and watch just

02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:49.840
season four i think because latrice yeah um but um i've been watching all of the stuff on what's

02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.800
the what's the um channel it's like wow world of wonder yeah it's like it's rupaul's production

02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:00.400
company basically yeah but um i've really also enjoyed uh i've just enjoyed the content though

02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:08.560
in particular on that particular uh uh channel because they also um like i like the ones where

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:15.040
they respond to bad comments made about them but my favorite one was for uh national coming out day

02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:20.080
everyone talking about their first time and i thought that that was it was a very personal

02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:26.800
thing to share but i think that it was very very good you need to see season four because that's

02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.360
the one where i was on the reunion in a deleted scene that only aired overseas and i guess is on

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:37.600
the dvd but i'm in it no yeah remember that was that was a big thing yeah i was in it yeah i met

02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:44.240
latrice and uh that's cool so the other i interviewed tatiana once yeah and then um uh season

02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:48.880
seven you need to see for trixie mitel because she's fabulous she was she was a gamer x and i

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:53.600
think you think you met her and you had no clue who she was and because she came up to the table

02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.760
and i feel like you were there um i well i was also kind of sleep deprived in in my poor costume

02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:05.040
and then you need to see season eight for kim chi who's a nerd oh see that's why i started watching

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:11.920
because i like kimchi and dax exclamation point who's also a nerd she does a wonderful storm so

02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:18.080
that's right she's wearing the outfit walking in but the other one i liked was um the the one from

02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:23.840
shreveport oh chi chi divain chi chi divain all right we got to be careful it's not a drag queen

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:28.160
show it's a video game show but you know what i'm already in love though it is such good tv y'all

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:34.400
rob rob can i can i be adopted by a drag queen i but wouldn't that i don't know any

02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:41.040
if i but if i get adopted by a drag queen then i'd have to be a faux queen i i could do it talk

02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:45.600
to you know what you need to talk to is victoria she's the biggest i know all right uh let's get

02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:50.480
to the fus of the week where dark sakura can complain and uh bitch about how she's not a drag

02:27:50.480 --> 02:28:01.920
queen

02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:14.160

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:21.600

like enough to kill a horse let's be real all right or at least a liver yes all right uh let's

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:25.840
move on we got a couple more news stories for you guys and then we are going to get to uh the

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:34.080
skype line at 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio uh but first loki all right

02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:39.600
so there's some details about uh telltale's batman game that's gonna be coming out this summer

02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:48.720
you know basically basically saying it's a fresh interpretation of the universe set in modern time

02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:54.400
it's not gonna be based off any existing you know batman games films or comics and you know focus

02:30:54.400 --> 02:31:02.400
on bruce and batman and not like the rest of the side characters of course alfred and vicki vale

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:10.000
uh james gordon and renee montoya will be in it and says certain characters will have a deeply

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:15.360
personal relationship with bruce in his private life and decisions made as bruce or batman will

02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:23.920
affect their paths towards corruption or redemption and yeah and they were taking a non-photorealistic

02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:31.120
interpretation of the universe so i'm imagining kind of like um i don't know kind of like uh

02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:38.560
was it the what was that one the wolf what was their game the wolf among us wolf among us yes

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:41.680
thank you that i think like an art style like that actually you know to be honest a lot of

02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:46.000
their games have that kind of same art style so yeah imagine it's gonna be similar to that so

02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:52.560
cool i'm looking forward to it i like some batman and they said also it's gonna have a mature rating

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:59.600
and it's gonna feel like an r-rated film all right well um i have some sad news to kind of

02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:04.000
end on tonight unfortunately we had some passings in the gaming industry this week but uh you know

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:10.640
it would not be cool if i didn't uh acknowledge um their them and their lives and tip our hats

02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:17.760
a little bit to remember akira tago who is the brains behind professor latin in the puzzle design

02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:24.560
unfortunately passed away at the age of 90 due to pneumonia but not 90 that's a good run that's a

02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:32.000
good run so uh you know um remembering akira tago this week uh who passed away uh in creating the

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:38.720
puzzles in professor latin but 90 years old that's that's amazing um also this week however we lost

02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:46.080
eric madow um who was killed in a windstorm on sunday so unfortunately um not at 90 years old

02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:51.040
madow was taking one of his daughters for a drive and the vehicle was hit by a falling tree

02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:57.360
the daughter did survive but unfortunately eric madow did pass away eric madow is the pokemon

02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:02.880
company international creative design director and he had worked on several games in the pokemon

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:09.680
series uh including omega ruby and alpha sapphire x and y black and white versions 2 conquest i

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:15.520
mean the guy did a lot for the various pokemon games and unfortunately that is a very tragic

02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:21.200
event that happened there so uh just remembering um those guys and tipping our hats to the legacy

02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:27.200
they leave behind in gaming so acknowledgement um okay anyhow let's try to change the subject

02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:33.600
back on to the week in gaming we do want to open up the skype line for you guys 1877 game olr

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:39.600
or our username on skype orange lounge radio all one word so the skype line is open if you'd like

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:43.680
to go ahead and give us a call in the meantime loki i was going to check in and see if you had

02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:48.320
any last minute news yeah there's um the xbox they're talking to or they're actively looking

02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:54.080
into um bringing back some of those digital sharing options so you know they basically

02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:00.720
saying you know hey the steam family plan has you know a good um setup which be honest i've never

02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:04.720
actually used that even though we do have that available um i don't has anybody actually used

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:10.560
the steam family sharing yet anyway i i did it first and then like uh when it was like first in

02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:14.960
beta and then i tried to use it with alan like a month ago we couldn't find it we couldn't use it

02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:20.640
like and i was like did they disable it at some point my thought was i was running the beta at

02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:28.000
the time so maybe you can't be using that maybe i had undertale would not work while i was in the

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.560
beta so i had to drop out of the beta and then undertale would work where it was really weird

02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:37.360
okay yeah so that's something that they're looking into so all all sorts of good news coming out of

02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:43.200
the microsoft camp all right well let's get to it our our phones are ringing so let's get to it

02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:47.840
hello you're on orange launch radio who's this hey uh this is reginator hey reginator what's on

02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:52.640
your mind buddy i'm not a whole lot i gotta keep this short and sweet because i got a house guest

02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:59.920
right now but uh okay uh yeah i was just wondering uh totally random uh uh tangent from what's been

02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:08.320
talked on the show tonight but uh i know that for the longest time uh vog has had a steam group but

02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:16.000
you know really nothing has been done with the group you know aside from now being a collect

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:22.400
you know way of connecting with other vog members uh if have you and uh bobby considered doing

02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:28.560
anything more with the group or no sure it's just it's honestly honestly spazzing here the best

02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.760
answer i have for that is that it's it's a big it's it's mostly a time thing um just because you

02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.720
know i would love to be able to say oh hey every thursday night we're gonna meet on steam and play

02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:44.000
x game but the reality is um that's the night i tape one of my podcasts and then i tape another

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.640
one of my podcasts on mondays or tuesdays you know so it's like i kind of you know i'm busy in that

02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:53.840
regard so it's hard to me to kind of commit to something regular um but i would really encourage

02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:57.520
you know if some of you guys that are really enthusiastic about steam kind of want to pick

02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:01.760
up the torch and run with it um if it's a game i own like i saw you guys talking about rocket

02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:06.160
league earlier and if i didn't have to be up at 5 30 tomorrow i probably would join you guys but

02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:11.440
maybe next week after the show i would totally be down with playing some rocket league so um yeah i

02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:16.080
like i i think if you guys want to get together and try to plan some game sessions i would love

02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:21.840
that and i'll try to enjoy where i can just unfortunately setting it up myself um when i'm

02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:29.680
doing three podcasts right now is a bit difficult so yeah i can't imagine that and uh now just as

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:34.640
uh just off the record well since this is being recorded i guess it's on the record

02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:42.480
it's okay one of the better shows that you guys had aside from the night that you had the devafit

02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:49.520
the night that we had what the uh aside from the night that you had the devafit

02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:55.680
oh the oh the night i had the devafit oh yes i remember yeah yeah all right but uh great show

02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:02.080
so thank you i my i i even just saw a tweet uh act f had written a tweet that said something to the

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:06.160
effect of i feel bad if you're not listening to olr it's one of the most hilarious episodes in

02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:11.200
a while hey julian did a great job sometimes it takes a kid to tell you how it is because kids

02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:14.400
they're gonna tell you they they don't have a filter they're gonna tell you how it is

02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:17.200
that's why i like it's why i liked having julian on the show

02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:22.720
hey well uh i want to go out there where you can uh fit in some more calls but uh

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:27.680
thanks for having me on you're welcome tonight all right and hello to your mystery guest i see

02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:35.280
you in there all right take care yeah you too it's somebody else just kind of walking around in the

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:40.720
background all right uh probably has no idea that he's on an internet show right now all right let's

02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.120
go to another call we've uh got the skyline lighting up hello you're on orange on radio

02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:53.200
who's this uh i forgot my name you forgot no actually it's aaron hey it's aaron also known

02:37:53.200 --> 02:38:01.680
as yyr what's up buddy uh well uh i'm still uh i'm feeling a little overwhelmed really after

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:07.600
seeing that i was greenlit honestly i don't think i know what day it happened i uh i went back a few

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:14.640
days later and checked and there it was so so they didn't even email you huh they didn't email

02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:20.240
you or anything to tell you that that happened no no it's really strange um the page says you know

02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:27.040
valve has reached out to this developer no they didn't i didn't get an email or anything i uh i

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:31.600
had to go to the page and find it unless it got sent to spam or something yeah check that out

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:35.920
because they may be waiting on you for something so i think i noticed it on friday because i've

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.640
been playing danganronpa and was going back to look over stuff inside i only saw it because

02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:46.320
your tweet well that's when i saw it i saw it on friday but uh yes actually they are waiting on

02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:52.560
a number of things um first of all uh you know i have to fill out a few things i have to sign an nda

02:38:53.360 --> 02:39:00.000
and then uh basically they're going to give me access to the steamworks sdk um and then you know

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.440
that's when i'll be able to start adding steam specific features like leaderboards achievements

02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:09.280
you know all the good stuff oh yeah you're not gonna have so much fun designing achievements

02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:13.120
for this game you're not gonna have to worry about integrating it through your website anymore like

02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:20.160
you had to do with your um xbox 360 arcade games yes that's correct no more typing in codes but

02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:25.360
then at the same time now you have to learn about how are people going to try to exploit it and put

02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:31.840
fake scores up there so look out is that actually happening with other steam games i just figure in

02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.160
games in general it's happening somewhere you see fake scores everywhere but steam

02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:40.640
i don't know i'd have to open that up to the listeners i'm not sure well i'd like to think

02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:45.040
that maybe we have some sort of control over it like if we see a number one score that's

02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.680
very obviously fake it would be nice if we could just kind of go click okay gone yeah

02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:56.720
uh kaijuto in chat says do something crazy and don't add achievements start the anti-achievement

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:02.480
moment no but i love chi me too kaijuto is wrong i'm sorry it's a show where every gamer has a

02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:10.000
voice but that voice is wrong i'm just giving him a hard time i love achievements too and i

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.960
think for a game like multitasking they could work i'm actually going to design i'm gonna

02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:20.000
it's going to be one of those games where you know the game there's there's modes that gives you uh

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.920
things to do and there are challenges that give you things to do but the achievements are going

02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:28.800
to give you other things to do that aren't you know spelled out by the modes like they're going

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:33.680
to have you trying crazy things that you wouldn't otherwise try that's what i'm going to set out to

02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:39.120
do with those well but just make sure you have a couple gimmes so i can i can get them they'll be

02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:46.320
easy ones too okay good good well everyone ought to be able to get congratulations again on making

02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:51.440
green light we're excited to hear about your progress um anything else you want to act def

02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:59.680
says make an achievement based on kaijuto well i don't know maybe you have to go into the olr

02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:08.720
chat and hate on xbox a certain number of times maybe what you do if you plug and unplug an xbox

02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.360
controller so many times you get that achievement you get occasionally all right that's a really

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:18.720
good idea hey look at that how do you like that all right oh my god that's gonna be great really

02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:25.120
funny no maybe that'll be a secret one all right just all i ask is one olr reference

02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:29.600
somewhere there's one olr reference somewhere in there i'd be eternally grateful you know what

02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:34.800
that's a fantastic idea and i will do that too all right thank you very much all right uh anything

02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:42.160
else on your mind tonight why we are um if you have played ori in the blind forest the definitive

02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:48.080
edition should be the easiest five dollar purchase you should ever decide on it's only five bucks

02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:54.960
yeah the if you own the original game oh the upgrade is five dollars okay if you don't own

02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:59.440
the original game it includes the original game and it's twenty dollars and it's still worth it

02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:03.680
um and what does the new one have i have played ori in the blind forest it's great what does the

02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:10.880
new one have well the bad news is um you can't move your save over and continue and you know

02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:16.480
explore the rest of the world that you didn't see you do have to start over and cry your eyes out

02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:23.520
after watching the prologue in the first five minutes again but um the good news is the new

02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:27.440
stuff you don't have to wait till the end of the game to see it it's kind of spread all throughout

02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:32.720
the game uh they added an easy difficulty for wimps they added a hard one for the tough guys

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:38.240
and they also added a one life difficulty which you know you can't cheat it by quitting the game

02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:45.040
quickly there's there's a trick like if you take the xbox offline and copy down the save you know

02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:50.880
before it sinks with the cloud then you might be able to continue but probably not like it

02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:56.240
it's really actually one life mode so that's dangerous but they also added an entirely new

02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:02.480
area a couple of new abilities to the skill tree and uh just some other new surprises and secrets

02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:08.880
so it's and new music and it's absolutely worth playing again well i'm gonna have to check that

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:13.120
out all right thank you for the tip all right while we are best of luck in development keep us

02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:17.680
posted on progress and multitasking but for now i'm gonna let you go absolutely keep doing what

02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.400
you guys are doing and any news i have i will announce it here first all right appreciate that

02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:28.800
exclusives take care of my friend have a great week you too bye bye 1877 game olr or username

on skype orange lounge radio all one word we'll see if we can squeeze in one more call here before

02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:40.720
the end um loki any other last minute stories no no all right well thankfully we do have another

02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:45.280
call coming in so we can at least get to that uh hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:51.360
hey there's a deaf hey act deaf what's on your mind buddy um well pokin mostly yeah you've been

02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:56.560
playing too what do you think actually i haven't played it yet because i haven't gotten my copy

02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:06.960
uh i'm waiting for uh at least tuesday to get my copy but yeah um uh i mostly have a rant about

02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:14.880
pokin go for it what's up you know well the the character selection isn't that fast but it's okay

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:24.640
but it's missing like a really core really really important pokemon of the uh of at least the

02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:30.400
recent generation i know jigglypuff what's up with that like where no no no no not not jigglypuff

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:39.600
what the fuck jigglypups already is mashed so leave her there i love how actually offended

02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:43.840
you were by the fact that i suggested the jigglypuff all right who's missing act f

02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:49.680
hallelujah oh i've heard you're not the first person i've heard say this

02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:58.320
yeah it's it's like oh my god it's since pokin was announced i was thinking oh my god hallelujah

02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:05.120
is gonna be perfect for this it's a lucha door pokemon like like it's like a perfect match

02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:11.840
yes but where the fuck is the lucha and somewhere to be to be found instead you got lucha pikachu

02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:20.720
which is which is i don't mind lucha uh it's what's the name pikachu pikachu libre yeah pikachu

02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:28.080
libre that's it yeah yeah yeah i don't mind being him and pokin like it's yeah it's also like uh

02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:38.640
given but we have an actual luchador pokemon that that's pretty much uh uh uh it's a luchador it's

02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:46.160
it's obvious that he should uh should have been in pokin and and really it's like idiotic that

02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:53.600
and no i don't know if uh fanamco or pokemon company made the decisions in the roster but

02:45:54.560 --> 02:46:00.640
it it was like a given even not even for a support pokemon which is also like really what the fuck

02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:07.440
here's the good news for what it's worth act f i really feel like a lot of this game is kind of

02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:13.840
set up to prove a concept perhaps and i think the sequel is likely to get a lot more of what i think

02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:18.640
if this game gets a sequel the sequel will probably deliver on a lot of what people want

02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:23.520
and it'll probably be an expanded roster of characters um probably a little more like some

02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:28.720
more modes that you can do with single player that aren't just you know a pretty boring story and uh

02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:32.960
uh one-on-one play like i kind of feel like they might start to round some of that stuff

02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:40.640
out a little bit um so maybe maybe you'll see that happen in pokin too but for now

02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.720
you know it's it's more of a arcade game that's made its way home i suppose

02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:52.640
well that's true uh and aside from that i really don't have anything against the game and i and i

02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:57.520
what up from what i'm seeing everyone is most is mostly like in the game

02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:05.520
it it seems like it's gonna be a really really great uh uh fighting game for competition

02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:10.080
tournament so i'm hearing there's people that were playing street fighter 5 that have left to

02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:17.840
play pokin like it's that much of a game changer yeah one of the top players who is uh i think

02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:26.320
justin wong is gonna be playing pokin and like uh like seriously it's gonna be entering competitions

02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:32.560
and all that so it's gonna be really interesting how how the competition like in evo it's gonna

02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:37.040
kind of turn out well and i think if pokin has that kind of coverage and becomes that kind of

02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:42.160
game i think it's guaranteed we'll get a sequel to be honest yeah from what i'm seeing it's it's

02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:48.240
like really easy to get into yeah but really complicated to master so it is it's gonna be

02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:52.880
my head was spinning a little bit after the tutorial but once you get in there and just

02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.400
start playing like you kind of find out okay i think i know a little more about this than i

02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:01.680
thought i did so well act deft uh thank you for your thoughts i'm gonna go ahead and let you go

02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:05.200
so we can wrap up the show but thanks for the call hey thanks for having me all right take care of

02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:10.240
my friend you too bye-bye i still love how offended he sounded when i suggested julie

02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:14.720
puffy in the game all right we're gonna close the skype line sorry to those that didn't get

02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:20.240

02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:39.360
here they made the show a lot of fun and i'm sure after that you know just so you guys know um

02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:43.440
before the show julian was like like there was a moment probably like five minutes before the show

02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:49.920
where julian got super nervous about being on air so and then you know it's like how do you how do

02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:54.560
