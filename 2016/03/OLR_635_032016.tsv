0	17560	This week the future gets a little bit clearer during GDC week with an official price for
17560	21200	PlayStation VR and a patent based possibility for Nintendo's NX controller.
21200	24400	Convention weeks mean plenty of news and information to cover and it all starts right now on the
24400	29760	show where every gamer has a voice.
30480	34880	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where
34880	42720	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 635 March 20th
42720	49040	of 2016. Here we are assembled in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer
49040	56080	lifestyle with myself Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E and over there DarkSakura or
56080	62400	Jamie Summers. Oh hi. Hi how are you doing? I'm all right how are you? Good, good. How has your day
62400	70680	been? I planted things. Did you? I played outside. Were you playing Stardew Valley or was this IRL?
70680	75640	It was IRL yo. Although you if you haven't tried it yet you need to try that Stardew Valley I'm
75640	80000	telling you. I think you'd love it. Shane keeps telling me about it even though he's not playing
80000	84880	games. I was like wait Shane isn't even playing games. He's doing what he does best enabling
84880	92680	others. He's an enabler I know but um but no I we've got some some of those decorative plants in
92680	97040	my backyard are dead. Yeah. And so I'm putting actually useful plants back there. Nice. Like
97040	102120	rosemary. And Venus fly traps. I wish I could put picture plants back there but you have to live in
102120	107480	a swamp. You know once at my old job I had years and years ago before OLR I had a desk and one day
107480	110320	they were like we're gonna go nice enough the office we're gonna go get everybody some plants
110320	114600	for their desk to nice and things up and you know they asked everybody what they wanted and everybody
114640	117800	was saying things they said Rob what do you want on your desk I was like hmm I want a Venus fly
117800	123440	trap and bless their hearts they brought me back a Venus fly trap to put on my desk and I was like
123440	129120	this is cool. Of course you have to you have to really resist the urge to trigger the trap with
129120	132800	your pencil because you know that's gonna kill it because you know it has to actually be a fly.
132800	139320	But I did come into work one day and the jaws were shut and I was like oh did its job. Nice.
139320	144840	I wish it had had something like that at the place that I used to work because there would
144840	149960	be like little fruit flies hanging out on some of the plants. A Venus fly trap would have been
149960	156040	pretty useful then. Very useful. Also also useful here on this program every week in studio we are
156040	161120	joined except last week we were joined by tech master Loki. Yeah. Welcome back. How are you?
161120	168880	Yeah. Yeah. Oh that good huh? No it's just dinner was yeah. Oh I see the fast fast food you picked
168880	172440	up. It was not good. Well I couldn't decide what I wanted and I was like well I can get a sandwich.
172440	177400	That was already once on the free. I was like well that's way far away now. So I'm like eh let's get
177400	183560	Jack in the Box and the Jack in the Box is not no it was not up the par today. Had like a quarter
183560	187400	of that burger and threw the fries away because they were just limping nasties. Sorry to hear
187400	191160	that. That's all right it happens you know. Real problems you know what you should go back and
191160	195400	complain that's what people do. Complain. Yeah I don't think so. I don't want more free food of
195400	202320	that. No I'll just it's it's fine. All right. Well you know it what there is plenty of bacon
202320	208640	but the bacon tasted like it had like I don't know buffalo wing sauce on it or something it
208640	215880	just tastes it off so no. Hopefully it wasn't one of those things where somebody like you know like
215880	219800	messed with the sauce or something. No their their bacon sometimes tastes like that. I think it's
219800	224440	just if it's older. Well it's fast food quality. It's no it was not good today. There's no old
224480	229040	adage you get what you pay for. You guys are in our chat room every week of course over at
229040	234080	live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network
234080	239920	vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show where SSG100Matt is in chat saying yeah I
239920	247320	could have used a fly trap at my old job. A lot of gnats. That sounds kind of gnats-ty. Get it?
248200	255200	All right. We have some special guests here in studio. This is fun. So Jamie has a bestie
255200	261080	and Jamie's besties name is Becky and Becky's here in studio tonight and sometimes she she's
261080	265200	she's brought us cakes and things like that in the past. We love when Becky comes to visit even
265200	269160	even without food just to say hello. How are you doing Becky? I'm doing pretty well thank you.
269160	273880	Awesome. Great to have you here. And Becky you've brought someone very special with you to the show.
274200	278880	Do you want to introduce who else you brought with you tonight? I did indeed. I brought one of my
278880	285960	personal favorite people on this planet. I may be a little biased given that he came from my body.
285960	301120	You say that like it's another planet. Oh some people might wonder. Anyway here he is. Say hi.
301680	307120	Hello. Hey welcome to the show. It's Julian right? Yeah. Welcome Julian to Orange Launch
307120	312720	Radio. How are you doing? Good. Good. So Julian you're a bit of a gamer right? Yes. What kind of
312720	323320	games do you play? I play a lot of Minecraft, pirate 101, and platforming games. Platforming
323320	328960	games. What are those? What are platforming games to you? Um mostly the platforming games that I play
328960	336280	are like pac-man platform 2. Pac-man platform 2. I don't. That's a flash. One of the flash games
336280	342040	isn't it? Oh yeah. Okay okay. You like little internet flash games. You like some of those
342040	352680	sim games on Xbox don't you as well? I also play a lot of what's it called? Disney infinity. That's
352680	357240	right because when you you came in here you saw my little Sam Flynn over there from Disney infinity
357240	361080	and you asked me if I had Disney infinity I was like no I just had the figure. You know why?
361080	366000	Because Tron is really cool. Have you seen Tron? Yeah. No I have not. You need to ask your mother
366000	372200	to see Tron. Becky. Becky you let me down over here. You got to educate the kid on Tron. That's
372200	376520	okay I'm just I'm just giving her a hard time. That one I tried to convince him to watch before
376520	380920	and he's like eh no it doesn't look good. That's good. All right we'll revisit this. Yeah yeah
380920	387160	revisit this conversation a little later. That's right. Julian what about your Lego games? You're
387160	393560	playing Lego Star Wars for a while. I played yeah I play a lot of Lego Star Wars. I also play Lego
393560	400800	Marvel and the Lego movie game. Now are these now Loki you play the Lego games are these the same
400800	403680	ones you've been playing? The Lego Marvel right? You talked about that on the show. Yeah we play
403680	409400	Lego Marvel and then Lego Avengers and Disney Infinity 3.0. Now have you played the Lego
409400	414080	dimensions where you have like the real Legos that you put on the little portals? No I have
414080	418080	not but I've heard of it. It's kind of a waste of space let me tell you. It's kind of it's kind of
418080	423360	a lot of junk. No it's it's kind of cool but the the regular Lego games are cool by themselves too.
423360	431920	How old are you Julian? I'm eight. My birthday is coming up and I'll be nine on April 27. I'm
431920	437920	celebrating it on the 24th. Oh well are you inviting all our listeners to your party? I'm
437960	442440	just kidding don't don't invite them some of them are weird. All right. What's wrong with weird?
442440	452120	I suppose that's true. This is a show that myself and Jamie and Matt all co-host after all. So tell
452120	456520	us tell us a little more about Minecraft because you you know you're you know more than me when it
456520	460800	comes to Minecraft. Like you were playing on that tablet and you were like you want to see cool
460800	465880	stuff and you put all these creepers into a little hole and then you blew them all up. And then and
465920	471000	then got a bunch of experience. Yeah. What's your favorite thing to do in Minecraft? Do you like do
471000	476640	you like to just do like crazy stuff or or do you try to like actually play the game and build a
476640	484560	house and all that? What do you do in Minecraft? I usually go to creative mode. It's survivally
484560	490960	like if that's even a word. It is we make up words here on this show don't worry. Okay good.
490960	502280	Was I gonna say you? I think you're gonna tell us more about what you do in Minecraft. I usually
502280	510400	build a house and chant a bunch of good weapons actually chant armor usually use diamond armor
510400	516240	and then I build an ender portal and go to the end and fight the ender dragon. I know how to get
516240	525880	the egg so what you do how I do it is you press LT on the egg dig two blocks down dig dig straight
525880	533720	one block put a redstone torch or torch break the block above the torch fall down on the torch and
533720	539880	break and then you have the egg. Well there you go tips from Julian on Minecraft y'all in chat
539880	546920	over at live.vognetwork.com. Now when I hate I hate saying that I just wish you I hate saying
546920	551360	these words that are about to come out of my mouth but I have to say it when I was your age Julian
551360	557400	we were playing games like the Oregon Trail have you ever played the Oregon Trail? No I have not
557400	562800	I've never even heard of it. Yeah I know it's kind of yeah in the Oregon Trail it was it was a game
562800	567880	that we played to learn about history because you know way back when and that was what we're
567880	571840	supposed to be learning about that I thought it's about efficient hunting. Way back when in
571840	576520	the 1800s before there were cars or any of that when people wanted to come to California because
576520	580800	of the gold they had to come in covered wagons and they took something called the Oregon Trail
580800	585000	because you could also go to Oregon you go to California you go to Oregon so this is a game
585000	589640	where we learned about that but you also did weird things like you would hunt buffalo and you
589640	593600	would type in the names of your friends you're gonna bring on you with your journey but sometimes
593640	599920	they would die of dysentery and it was really weird. What? Yeah I know right? What even is dysentery?
599920	606000	It's bad I don't know what it is but it's bad. It's a disease it has to deal with having very
606000	610800	bad infections and probably awful diarrhea. Yeah well that's oh this is weird let's not talk about
610800	617600	it so all right. How'd we go from Minecraft to that? Welcome to the show Julian. That's the type
617600	624240	of games we had to play have you have you played like games that were cool when we were your age
624240	629760	have you played any like older games you ever played like old-school Nintendo games? Um I've
629760	636600	gone to Stragman Evils and played those games. Wait what he went where? Homestarrunner.com. Oh
636600	645520	he played the Homestarrunner games. Those are the closest to old games I've played. Well one of these
645520	651360	Pac-man also Pac-man that's that's considered old game. Okay played all those Capcom games with
651360	659720	Dan. You played um the King Arthur game? Yeah those were fun. They were so good he doesn't
659720	664920	remember. He played the Capcom he and Dan were playing the Capcom classics one of those
664920	670280	collections. Yeah I'm just Minecraft there's a lot you can do in that they didn't have things
670280	677520	like that when when I was 8. We had this thing called logo that what you did you told the turtle
677520	683760	you'd say draw forward 30 and then turn right 30 and then it might make a little picture and that
683760	690600	was like the highlight of your day. Does that sound fun? Um no. No it wasn't very fun you're right it wasn't very fun.
690600	697440	Let's see over at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com actdeft and chat says Julian
697480	703400	was spot-on on any new listener to the show. Dungeon Buster says Julian should play ET the
703400	711480	extraterrestrial. Have you ever seen the movie ET? Um I've seen the movie and no. No thank you.
711480	717360	Well they can you believe it they made a game based on the movie and back in the day it used
717360	724040	to take one guy to make a game so one guy made that game in six weeks and can you imagine how
724040	729560	it turned out? It's it sound like it turned out it would suck. Yeah you know what it turns out
729560	735400	you're right it did not turn out very good at all. Even with like a bunch of people that you
735400	740680	have to work it on like for like three years and then it turned out. You should be a manager at
740680	746400	Atari because you make better decisions than they did in the 80s. In fact probably better decisions
746400	754000	than they do today. Just say have you ever played driver 3? It's awful it's awful. It's awfully good
754000	760480	is what he means to say. All right awesome do you now okay so so in chat over at live.vognetware.com
760480	765640	YYR says Julian is the next great game designer. Well maybe maybe I don't do you want to make games
765640	770840	or you which or you just want to play them? I was actually interested in it. What inspired me is I
770840	778920	noticed my initials JDS. So so your initials inspired you to do game design? Yeah because my
778920	787960	last two initials are DS. Oh I see what he did his initials are DS it's a sign. Becky was that
787960	794360	planned when you named him that you. It was actually just I was looking for initials that
794360	799400	would sound cool together I figured if anybody was gonna give him nicknames like JD. JD works
799400	804440	okay you know he's not gonna get his butt kicked on the playground initials like JD. All right
804440	809000	awesome so that's a so because you're in okay so you know a lot of people are wondering what's
809000	813480	the new Nintendo what could the new Nintendo system be maybe it will be a JDS and that will
813480	819960	really be the sign my friend. Wouldn't that just be a Japanese DS? Maybe you're such a buzzkill dark
819960	825880	side. I know. So Julian if if you were to make a game what kind of game do you think you'd make?
825880	840360	I might play some I might not play what how do I get play um the game the games I would make
840360	847200	are the types of game like pirate 101 I would make games like that. Okay I have to admit I don't know
847200	851080	pirate 101 I played a game called puzzle pirates back in the day but I doubt it's the same thing
851080	858960	what do you do in pirate 101 what's that game? So um it's your it starts off by being captured
858960	866640	of the armada it's if you want me to explain the whole thing it's a real long story um give us a
866640	873560	short version so um then there's a war they made the armada everything went well they made more
873680	882000	and more and everything turned out bad okay um I picked a swashbuckler defend I defend my friends
882000	893200	um so I got arrested by the armada. Well that's no fun did you go to jail? Um yeah by deacon the
893200	901320	canes messenger canes was the first and wait did you have to bust out of jail or was like there's
901320	908280	no getting out like it's a Korean jail like what happened um there is this pirate named boot beard
908280	919160	or something and um came and the right when they came the back of the prison exploded awesome ran
919160	927480	out free someone which was your first companion came out um killed some armada people. Let me
927480	930920	ask you this question because what you said made me think of this okay tell me if this is true or
930920	939000	false game with explosions are better than games with no explosions games with explosions are
939000	944200	better that's that's right that's just this kid you train this kid well Becky he knows what he's
944200	952480	talking about I must say yes he's if you can't blow anything up it's no fun and games and evidenced
952480	958880	by the fact that any time I play Dragon Age 2 he always wants to come as soon as we get to the last
958880	965000	the last mission because his favorite thing is watching the chantry blow up awesome and games
965000	969360	where you cause the explosion are the best that's why you like minecraft I know it I know it cuz
969360	973600	that's one of the cool thing yeah he's not in his head over there yyr is helping out a little bit
973600	978600	in the description of pirate 101 saying from Wikipedia it's a pirate based MMO created by
978600	982840	Kingsisle entertainment players assume the role of the heroic pirates that set out in search of the
982840	987840	treasures of the spiral the same fictional universe used in its sister game wizard 101
987840	992760	oh there's a whole there's pirates and there's wizards oh yeah um there's a game called wizard
992760	1000200	when one it's much longer they've done more for it there instead there be a instead of the top
1000200	1007440	will be in level 65 the top level is 110 oh boy that sounds like a long game is there ninjas 101
1007440	1016560	I don't know well you would think pirates 101 is there pirate wizards 101 are the ninjas you
1016560	1029960	fight called ninja pigs all right all right fair they're horrible ninja pigs sound pretty awful
1029960	1040200	it's holy cereal I think Julian's having a heart attack over there so so okay so the game you're
1040200	1049400	gonna make is gonna be pirates explosions and killing ninja pigs for sure all right there's
1049400	1062120	more so it's a spin-off of Angry Birds would you not like Angry Birds Julian Angry Birds is okay I
1062120	1067600	have Star Wars Angry Birds I'm really good at it all right the humility is important when you're
1067600	1073880	playing games absolutely absolutely all right Julian I'm trying to think what else to ask you
1073880	1081200	what what do you what do you want gamers everywhere out there to know about like what you hope the
1081200	1092600	future has in store for games I don't know games better games games games games and better ones get
1092600	1097200	better get make the games better that's right work on that make the games better I like that's good
1097800	1104520	now when you are you know I know this is a long way away Julian but when you're in your 30s do
1104520	1109680	you think you'd want to do an online radio show like we do do you want to take over or when I
1109680	1118160	retire yeah yeah all right there we go awesome there we go so you guys here to here first this
1118160	1122520	is this is the trick how we're gonna get a well are going for 50 years we're gonna pass it on to
1122520	1127680	Julian when we're gone so we'll check in we'll have to check in again with Julian in a few years
1127680	1133120	and see how that plan is progressing sound good sounds good well Julian thanks so much for being
1133120	1138280	on the show I hope you had fun I didn't have a lot of fun awesome awesome you get to tell our
1138280	1144640	listeners about pirates 101 and give them some elite minecraft tips awesome we'll have have fun
1144640	1148360	and when you when you check out a new game that you think is really awesome and you want to tell
1148360	1152840	us all about it you have to come back okay okay awesome I know you were a big hit with our chat
1152840	1161840	room over at live live dot fog network calm oh that's okay that's okay if you're gonna talk use
1161840	1169120	the mic oh yeah what is there are two games that I really want okay there's one called universe
1169120	1177200	sandbox 2 mostly why I want it is black holes you get to explode everything and mess up everything
1177320	1183280	in the whole entire freaking universe sounds reasonable and then spore it's a game about
1183280	1190520	evolution and you know spore I know the five stages that goes from Stell cell stage creature
1190520	1198600	stage tribal stage civilization stage and space day that's interesting spore is kind of an older
1198600	1205800	game so you have you wanted that was made in 2008 interesting you know I bought spore when it first
1205840	1213120	came out I was at e3 one year and will right who created spore did like a little tour of the game
1213120	1218200	and when that game came out they had huge expectations for it and unfortunately didn't do
1218200	1224560	it didn't do as well as they'd hoped and part of the reason why now sometimes they do that with
1224560	1229840	games they make them better after they come out like there's a game called destiny that that's
1229840	1234760	what they did they made it better like way after it came out so maybe spore was kind of like that
1234760	1239480	but I think that's really cool that you still want to play old games as well as new ones cuz
1239480	1247200	I think old games are really cool too so that's awesome all right let's see over at live dot vog
1247200	1251280	network comm let's see s2100 Matt says got to start him on the show when they're young yep
1251280	1256840	rage nator says Julian needs to be the fourth host make it so maybe in a few years raging here

1262480	1267320	over for intern drew I hope so he's a lot more entertaining I'm sure Julie appreciates that
1267320	1272040	compliment I'm sure he does let's see in dark Tetsuya says always good to get the younger
1272040	1278960	perspective absolutely and why YR says spore is from 2008 geez it's almost 10 years old already
1278960	1285360	yeah you know it's a spore is probably as old as you are Julian it's kind of it's an older game
1285360	1291720	almost almost then you then you get to play the stuff that maybe
1292840	1300240	you know what you'll probably like though is a no-man's sky if you have a PlayStation 4 or PC
1300240	1307640	I guess that's a PlayStation 4 I have is well it's not really mine it's mostly dad's the closest to
1307640	1314360	PlayStation 4 that we have in the house is an Xbox one okay well Xbox one's pretty cool you can do a
1314360	1318640	lot with an Xbox one yeah yeah let me ask you I'm gonna ask you one more thing real quick Julie and
1318640	1321680	then we're gonna move on with the show cuz we have a lot of news to talk about this week but
1321920	1326400	Julian do you know about virtual reality have you seen like the virtual reality the little
1326400	1333040	headsets I mean the oculus rift that's right the oculus rift is one of them I've watched some videos
1333040	1337560	on the oculus rift it's really cool yeah is that something you wanna you want to play with at some
1337560	1341840	point hope yeah yeah it looks really cool cuz you know tonight we're gonna talk about the PlayStation
1341840	1346960	VR is gonna be coming out and so this is a thing that's gonna be in people's homes pretty soon so I
1347000	1352720	mean in a couple of years it'll it'll be probably about as common as an Xbox one it's gonna be kind
1352720	1359040	of trippy so all right well we're gonna move on thank you Julian for being here and I I know I
1359040	1362280	don't know if you guys are gonna hang around or if you're gonna take off but if you do end up
1362280	1367400	hanging around we you can speak up whatever you like on whatever topics we're talking about but
1367400	1371640	in the meantime we always like to start off each week show talking about how was your gaming week
1371640	1375560	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week so dark soccer do you want to
1375560	1379040	tell us a little bit about your gaming week I played some Animal Crossing happy home designer
1379040	1389080	because I just got my new Animal Crossing amiibo I have Rover I have kappa and I'm waiting on Timmy
1389080	1398280	and Tommy to arrive I did play some Dongan Ronpa I'm playing fractal again which I love my puzzle
1398280	1405320	games so I had to get back into fractal and I hit level seven in ingress finally congrats because
1405320	1412440	those Smurfs kept trying to steal my home so I would just steal it back and then when I actually
1412440	1419960	made that leap into seven I started hunting them down out of spite because it was great
1419960	1433960	awesome right gargamel like as real and yeah I think that's really been about it because it's
1433960	1441360	been kind of a weird week that's all all right Loki how about you how is your gaming week well
1441360	1449120	let's see I finished platinum in Lego Avengers so we have everything done there I don't play it
1449120	1455480	anymore which is great until the DLC comes out and then I'll have to finish that I played a
1455480	1462120	little bit of the track me a turbo beta so they give you basically all the white courses or at
1462120	1466680	least most of the white courses to try out which are the easiest ones which you could have fooled
1466680	1472720	me because they're still pretty hard and so it's pretty looking game it's also you know it's
1472720	1482040	gameplay wise it reminds me a lot of was it the motorcycle racing one I can't remember what it's
1482040	1487920	called now anyways um you know just like a track meeting game but very pretty and so you know it's
1487920	1493680	got the course editor in there you're racing against times you know keep retrying to perfect
1493680	1501440	each you know race especially getting gold on everything it's very difficult I like it I was
1501440	1507120	planning on picking it up beforehand and you know this kind of you know solidifies that a little
1507120	1519080	bit more so I got to play a little bit of that and then I what else I play um ingress a little
1519080	1528160	bit I haven't been playing too much of that but I played a little bit of that and oh that's pretty
1528240	1535560	much it I think yeah all right a little bit of the little bit of the gear VR stuff just test out
1535560	1539880	some of the demos most of our videos those kind of lame yeah so I haven't really wanted to buy
1539880	1544880	anything because they have like some free games but most of them are kind of lame they have games
1544880	1550200	you can purchase but I'm like and without demo it's kind of hard for me to want to do this I
1550200	1555080	wish I just had more of the free content that you know oculus has available for like you know the
1555080	1563160	dk2 and that kind of stuff I just wish the dk2 ran better on my computer yes need it's justification
1563160	1568840	for you to get a better computer well yeah but that's expensive so it is it is all right my
1568840	1574100	gaming week let's see I actually played a variety of things this week thanks to the expanded Xbox
1574100	1578600	one backwards compatibility with 360 games I don't know if you guys know but some new games
1578600	1584600	hit this Thursday and a couple big ones Alan Wake hit which I have loaded by and play yet
1584640	1589800	but I did play quite a bit of Castlevania Symphony of the Night is available now through backwards
1589800	1594960	compatibility on Xbox one so if you bought that on the 360 check your Xbox one because you can go
1594960	1598880	back and revisit Symphony of the Night which I did I actually played quite a bit of it this week
1598880	1604040	and I miss that game you know it's got some weirdness though for that version because not
1604040	1608680	all of the tricks from the PlayStation version work that is true they did you know it's not a
1608680	1614040	perfect port but as far as you know if you just want kind of the core experience of the game and
1614200	1618760	revisiting it and it's kind of fun to play it on the Xbox one with all the newer features and all
1618760	1628040	that so I did play quite a bit of that also on the PlayStation 4 I played just some random things
1628040	1635640	that I had to catch up with my backlog and then a little bit of Tron run are I tried to play on PC
1635640	1640040	but then it crashed in the second level like my video card doesn't like the game or something
1640040	1644680	that kind of like irritated me I don't know what's I think that's coming out though on PlayStation
1644680	1650680	4 it is already out but it is already out like it's like 20 bucks for the game oh god no oh no
1650680	1656480	then there's expansions on top of no but on Steam because I was an early access person for $10 I got
1656480	1661240	all of it no I'm not paying $20 for that it's one of those things where I'm gonna wait for a sale
1661240	1666640	and then I'll get out get all that stuff cuz I'm not gonna buy it now no way they have like
1666640	1671680	transformers on sale right now for like $17 and I was like that's still too high even though it
1671680	1676400	looks good I just it it's not that I don't think it's a great game and it's not deserving of even
1676400	1680920	the full amount of money it's just that I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to it so I don't
1680920	1685920	think I think I'd purchase it and not play it and I don't want to pay $17 for a game that I'm gonna
1685920	1692760	purchase and not play so here's another game that I played this week that's brand new that I picked
1692760	1697080	up on Friday and I've been enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would and that is Pokken
1697080	1703000	Tournament is on the wheel and if you don't know Pokken Tournament it's basically the Pokemon
1703000	1707880	fighting game that Bandai Namco did so it's I think it's got elements of Tekken which is why
1707880	1712920	they call it Pokken but I don't I don't know if I see an awful lot of Tekken in it because one of
1712920	1718680	the things that they did that I really think is like different for other fighting games I've
1718680	1722960	played like you know you play Street Fighter 5 you kind of know what to expect a lot of those
1722960	1730840	fighting games are very similar they're all those 2d games Pokken does a 3d type system but using
1730840	1735880	certain moves you kind of pull the other fighter in and then it switches it does what's called a
1735880	1741680	phase shift into a 2d mode so it kind of seamlessly goes back and forth then you can push them out of
1741680	1746360	that back into what they call the field mode so right off the bat I was kind of like oh this is
1746360	1751120	a little different than other fighting games I've played so um I like that and then um you know
1751120	1756080	it's it's pretty easy to pick up there's only so many buttons and they kind of built like a rock
1756080	1760640	paper scissors thing into it with the different types of attacks I mean I still feel like I'm
1760640	1765240	button mashing sometimes but I kind of know a little bit more than I do in most fighters when
1765240	1769120	I'm just sitting there mashing all the buttons I feel like okay I know what buttons I'm mashing
1769120	1775920	with purpose so that's kind of cool um the only I get there's only 16 I think playable Pokemon which
1775960	1779920	is a little weird when you consider there's what like 700 different Pokemon so that part's a little
1779920	1788800	dlc yeah maybe maybe uh amiibo because you can get uh you get shadow mu 2 through uh one of the
1788800	1795040	the little amiibo card or whatever so there's that um and then you can use your other amiibo to just
1795040	1800640	unlock random things in the game but like the pokemon amiibo don't do anything the the other
1801000	1807000	amiibo don't do they just unlock random things that's all well let's that's great Nintendo wait
1807000	1813280	yeah no no what no no I'm not gonna blame Nintendo because it's not Nintendo's fault it's Namco's
1813280	1820240	fault for not utilizing those in you know better ways so no Nintendo gets a pass here but you
1820240	1824280	should really pressure your developers to do something special with those poke you know Pokemon
1824280	1828560	amiibo um an act-deft in chat over at live dog network comm says the poke and dev say that no
1828600	1833800	DLC is planned but we'll see well nothing nothing's ever planned of course of course well that's not
1833800	1838640	true it's been a DLC nowadays but um yeah I'm enjoying poke and tournament more than I thought
1838640	1844240	I would I will say that I actually went online and played an online match I was very like kind
1844240	1850360	of nervous to do that I didn't like that even when I play a fun mode game that my stats are still
1850360	1854240	tracked I was like oh this is the mode where I'm supposed to be able to be bad they're just
1854240	1859880	tracking your fun yeah they're tracking my fun that I had fun zero out of one matches but that
1859880	1866080	it's okay because I had a good time playing the fight and it's like oh you know knowing there's
1866080	1871440	a live person on the other hand and in Japan nonetheless kind of just like oh it adds another
1871440	1877480	layer of intense intensity to the fight so why we are in chat over at live dog network comm says
1877480	1883200	my poking record online is three to ten or so I got destroyed I feel like I don't fully understand
1883200	1888360	the system yet but it's fun it's kind of where I'm at too I don't have that in-depth knowledge
1888360	1892880	that it probably takes to be a tournament fighter but I feel like I know enough to just kind of have
1892880	1899080	fun and button mash so yeah long story short I enjoy poking more than I thought I would so if
1899080	1902680	you like fighting games or you really like Pokemon and kind of want to experience it a different way
1902680	1910280	it might be worth checking out that $60 price tag might seem a little high especially when 16 is all
1910280	1918760	there is I'm sure the game will be on sale by Christmas but we'll see we'll see um that's really
1918760	1923440	pretty much everything that I played this week other than the usual stuff Final Fantasy 14 I
1923440	1927920	guess there is one other thing I ought to mention or else somebody will say something in chat
1927920	1932400	because I posted a Twitter about it earlier I also played World of Warcraft last night and today
1932400	1937160	you remember remember that MMO I played for years and years and even had a podcast about it at one
1937200	1941480	point yeah I decided to just peek and see what's going on here's the thing here's the thing for you
1941480	1947280	guys I'll start yelling addict and all that stuff I'm actually not paying for it because you can
1947280	1952880	play a character from 0 to 20 in the starter edition which is just the game without the
1952880	1958080	monthly fee or the free edition or whatever so I'm just I'm leveling a character from scratch
1958080	1963360	because one of my buddies mentioned to me that if you get a character to level 20 and it has to
1963360	1968360	you can't use one of your old characters you have to actually ding that level 20 achievement now if
1968360	1972880	you do that with a character you get I think an extra character and hearthstone or something like
1972880	1977520	that and it's not even that I play hearthstone but I was just like I've been kind of curious
1977520	1984200	how Warcraft might be different all these years since I left it so I'll check it out and that
1984200	1988400	gives me something to work towards but will I pick it up again full-time with a subscription fee
1988400	1993920	I'm not sure I will even though I have friends online that I haven't played with in a long time
1993920	1998720	that I'd like to go back and experience Wow with I'm still super into Final Fantasy 14 like when I
1998720	2004000	hear the news about World of Warcraft I'm like oh okay neat I guess I don't know if I really follow
2004000	2008880	it as well as I used to anymore but cool cool but then when I hear about Final Fantasy 14 news I'm
2008880	2017560	like yes more primals yay fan fest so I just I don't know I I guess Wow is something fun to kind
2017560	2021880	of flirt with while there's there's a little bit of downtime on Final Fantasy 14 I guess I guess
2021880	2027560	that's that so and yeah look at a chat over at live dot vog network comm rage Nader says sky
2027560	2033160	played Wow addict you know see I knew that was coming I knew that was coming all right we're
2033160	2037560	about to get into our news I did want to mention one thing I played also Disney infinity this week
2037560	2042880	oh yeah because they have it there's having a sale again at GameStop for their used characters
2042880	2048960	so you buy to get three free and so you know I was picking up pizza and we had time to kill so
2048960	2053920	we went over there and picked up five new characters because you know it's dirt cheap
2053920	2059680	that's the price that I should pay for those things and we own like 30 of them by now but
2059680	2066160	it's because we bought them like that you get five for like 20 bucks so nice I like sales
2066160	2071200	especially on collectible little figures that's for sure all right before we get into the news
2071200	2076000	this week we do have a little bit of quick housekeeping as far as the show goes next week
2076000	2080560	very happy we're gonna be having a Gabriel and Brianna are gonna oh yeah awesome they're gonna
2080560	2086160	be back here next week with the sack IGDA oh great I'm gonna have to hear about how my you know yeah
2086160	2090720	you better you better work you got a week to go I've been working on it I just I can't get anything
2090720	2097040	done I'm in a block right now so so they're gonna be here to talk about the sack indie arcade which
2097040	2101440	is in two weeks so very excited to have them back on the show we'll catch up with them and ask
2101440	2107920	Gabriel about his own game that he's been making I'm crumpled and then in two weeks we will not
2107920	2113920	be here the week of April Fool's Day because I will be in Tucson and that's no joke I will be
2113920	2121120	out of town so I'm not gonna be able to be doing a show that week but we will be back the week after
2121120	2127280	that we will be doing something from the indie arcade I'm not sure if we're gonna be live or
2127280	2130080	if we're gonna do something taped we're still gonna figure that out hopefully I'll have an
2130080	2136160	answer for you next week and then we'll of course have our own show when we return on the 10th I
2136160	2143760	believe is the date so yeah there's that I also want to say a couple congratulations right here
2143760	2151040	there's some big big news here so first off a big big big congratulations to our buddy Brad
2151120	2158480	from pod culture because pod culture is hitting 500 episodes tomorrow the 500th episode of pod
2158480	2163280	culture is tomorrow here at the voice geeks network six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern
2163280	2167520	I know they just recorded it they recorded a bunch of episodes they had the whole gang
2168320	2174000	from their episodes prior kind of back together to do episode 500 so it sounds like it was a lot
2174000	2178480	of fun so I just want to say a big big congratulations to Brad and the whole gang at pod
2178480	2183440	culture um who of course is a big part of the voice geeks network but Brad has always been in
2183440	2187520	particular has always been a big champion for what we're doing here at orange launch radio as well as
2187520	2192640	some of my other side projects you know he hosted the website for horde house you know and he's
2192640	2198240	really helped out in a big way so um I think without his support there would be a lot of
2198240	2203840	differences in what you hear today so I'm very happy not a lot of podcasts make it to 500 episodes
2203840	2209600	so pod culture is now part of a very very exclusive club that probably only one percent or
2209600	2217200	maybe half of a percent of podcasts belong to so um a big big congrats to uh Brad and all the folks
2217200	2224640	over at pod culture on 500 episodes of that program again tomorrow six o'clock pacific nine
2224640	2228720	o'clock eastern but if you can't be here live tomorrow when it debuts uh you can check it out
2228720	2234000	in their podcast feed it'll go up later you know I haven't done the math yet but but before
2234000	2240560	originally if we hadn't skipped any shows episode 666 would fall on my birthday but I think since
2240560	2244720	we've skipped enough shows it may actually fall on halloween it may and if we skip some more it
2244720	2251360	may fall on christmas that's what I'm aiming for olr christmas episode 666 edition that's
2251360	2255760	what I'm aiming for and if we skip some more we can go to pinkberry instead
2255760	2263440	all right uh let's see so uh also I want to say this there's a lot of good news this week
2263440	2269600	one other congratulations then we'll get into the news our buddy yyr so uh we ran into him
2269600	2274000	at magfest we did the video interview and we uh and he's been on the show before talking about
2274000	2279200	multitasking right so multitasking went to steam greenlight and he's been trying to collect the
2279200	2284080	votes and you know it's not it sometimes feels like arbitrary what gets greenlit on steam and
2284080	2289120	what doesn't and it seems like sometimes a tough shell to crack well guess what multitasking got
2289120	2294400	greenlit this week yyr is a game multitasking which i think is brilliant by the way got the
2294400	2298640	pass on stream greenlight this week so that is going to be a game that you will soon be able to
2298640	2303440	pick up on steam well i don't know how soon but you know eventually blizzard soon trademark you
2303440	2310000	will be able to get on steam so thankfully hopefully not valve soon so now the question
2310000	2316080	is what's gonna what's gonna happen first multitasking or half-life 3 multitasking well
2316080	2321120	of course it's gonna be multitasking i mean the the earth will cease to exist before you know

2388480	2394400	it's gonna be in october of this year as opposed to early in spring which was the original um
2394400	2402320	projected release date they also announced the price 399 dollars in the u.s 399 euro
2403200	2412160	or 349 pounds and 44 980 yen in japan and of course you know with that you're going to get
2412160	2421360	you know the headset and it's going to come with the free um playroom vr game and it will require
2421360	2426560	the playstation camera so you will need that and possibly move controllers for some of the games
2427600	2432080	now if you don't have all that stuff you can pre-order that now because they're taking
2432080	2436720	pre-orders on this brand new bundle it's going to include two move controllers the playstation
2436720	2444800	camera the playstation vr um also a packaged game playstation vr worlds which has a like five or
2444800	2450400	six different games in there it's kind of like a demo thing they've got the london heist uh that
2450400	2455120	street luge game and i can't remember the other ones i actually watched the video on that but i
2455120	2461200	don't remember uh so that'll be they're taking pre-orders on that starting on march 22nd
2463200	2469520	now if you own something you know if you were a an avid playstation supporter and
2469520	2474480	you know you picked up the move when everybody hated the move everybody hated on it no one
2474480	2478480	supported it but people actually hate the move because i seem to remember most people thinking
2478480	2484160	it was the best use of that like it was better than the wii technology it was i wasn't i don't
2484160	2488880	know it was all right but like it wasn't supported too well it didn't have the games and it didn't
2488880	2493600	wasn't supported too well playstation camera i picked up the playstation camera even though
2493600	2498960	there's not really many uses for it um i picked up those things and i am being rewarded by not
2498960	2506400	being able to unbundle this wonderful vr device there's a child i just want to point out a child
2506400	2512320	in the room tonight is incredibly restraining loki and this is kind of awesome so yes
2512320	2517280	unfortunately i am not able to um you know not because i mean i'm assuming that they will take
2517280	2523280	pre-orders eventually honestly i may just have to pre-order this bundle for now it just you know and
2523280	2527360	sell off the rest because i already own two playstation move controllers although i hear
2527360	2531200	those batteries go bad so maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to get two new controllers
2531200	2536480	but i already have a camera so i don't need that playstation vr worlds is probably plan
2536480	2541760	to pick it up anyways because it looked pretty good but it kind of sucks that it's just you know
2541760	2544960	hey let's get an extra hundred dollars out of you i mean it's a good it's good value if you don't
2544960	2552320	own all that stuff but you know come on i mean people did support you maybe you should offer
2552320	2558160	that stuff separately as well it'd be nice to have both skews um and then of course i i thought
2558160	2563200	the headset is gonna be in stores you just can't pre-order it so yeah oh it's gonna be in stores
2563200	2568800	how many in stores exactly yeah how many in stores yeah i don't think i know how the game works
2569440	2574480	i used to work in that industry i know how it works i'm pre-ordering one of these and hey you
2574480	2578560	know what hey and that's the other thing too it's like if you do want pre-order it's 100 bucks down
2578560	2584960	too it's not those five dollars down you know nonsense it's a hundred dollars so yay thank you
2584960	2591120	gamestop and you'll be happy to know because i know this was your biggest concern about it
2591120	2595280	sony's not going to lose money on this they're actually going to make a profit off of each unit
2595280	2602640	sold well i am so glad for you sony that you're going to be making a profit thank you make a
2602640	2610640	profit off of those bundles and everything so okay well i guess that's important i still want
2610640	2615440	to get one i mean even despite all this anger you're like well it's no it's it's not anger
2615440	2619600	it's disappointment i mean because come on i was like you know because i went in there because
2619600	2622640	we're purchasing the figures i'm like hey you know i know they just announced this you guys
2622640	2626640	have a date when they're gonna take pre-orders on this before i read the news online and they said
2626640	2631760	yeah they're gonna have this bundle it's available and originally cakes i'm in gamestop and they're
2631760	2636720	like yeah we have this bundle that's gonna be you know 4.99 it comes with all this stuff i'm like
2636720	2642320	uh stupid gamestop bundling you know stuff together oh great you know this is typical of
2642320	2647840	them and i go i'm like oh it's everybody still stupid gamestop see i'm in this weird position
2647840	2653600	because all i have is the camera and i want playstation vr well i mean i have your move
2653600	2657840	but i'm gonna imagine you're gonna want that back well if they're working yeah i mean maybe i mean
2657840	2662640	if i if you end up getting suckered into buying a new one i guess there's that but um yeah it's
2662720	2667200	just like it's kind of like okay well i have the camera now i could probably run out and get a move
2667200	2671040	second hand before they're gone because i'm sure probably everybody's thinking that but then yeah
2671040	2677040	like can i guarantee that i can get the psvr by itself i don't know i imagine maybe at first it's
2677040	2681680	gonna be a little crazy but then what is i mean i'm excited about it and i'm like an early adopter
2681680	2688240	when it comes to hardware and stuff but maybe i am maybe i should wait i mean i don't know what
2688240	2696160	exactly is gonna be at launch i mean res looks cool i guess but is it worth paying 400 for it i
2696160	2702480	mean i don't know i mean i just have to kind of see what's out there and am i gonna be suckered
2702480	2707600	in the pain you know 500 for all this stuff and then it's like oh well this is just about as
2707600	2714480	supported as the move or the connect i mean i maybe i should wait i don't know we'll see i guess
2714480	2719680	i am excited about it i want to try it out um it's just i've tried out the oculus i tried out
2719680	2726880	the gear vr um they're okay but i mean i want to see the retail oculus because the gear vr is kind
2726880	2732800	of hard that i mean i thought it'd be slightly better but it's i'll have to try the vr well
2733360	2738080	what could i do with a second playstation camera lowkey nothing that can't do anything the
2738080	2742720	situation you're gonna sell it back to a store that's what you're gonna do or sell it on ebay
2742720	2748800	that's all you can do you should point them at each other yeah just let them watch recursive
2748800	2754880	playstation you can't there's nothing you can't plug it in there i mean it's just it's it's back
2754880	2760160	up side by side can i broadcast myself in 3d for other people's vr's you can't you can just you can
2760160	2766640	sit there and go yep i paid a hundred dollars extra for this thanks tiger klon chat says maybe
2766640	2772480	you can use it on your pc i kind of doubt that no it's a proprietary connection so no you're not
2772480	2777840	going to be using an rpc oh well uh we'll see what i do i don't know i have a little time to
2777840	2781680	decide what you're going to do what you're going to do i will get the vr thing eventually what
2781680	2786960	you're going to do is you're going to look at sony and go what what the hell sony i mean come on
2786960	2791520	i mean what the hell and that's what you're going to do and you just keep pitching a fit to them
2791520	2798640	until they finally make the good choice and offer multiple skews uh yeah and our chat is talking
2798640	2803760	about the cam and uh why we are saying really it's not usb and some folks saying nope nope it
2803760	2809760	is a proprietary high speed connection there so um i'm i'm still curious enough about the playstation
2809760	2814320	vr and i've liked what i've seen i want to get it it'll just kind of be you know am i going to end
2814320	2819360	up with a second camera because of it or what so i do hope there are other ways to kind of piecemeal
2819360	2823440	this that seems to be the right way you also need headphones because it does come with earbuds which
2823440	2828720	i why earbuds i mean come on just throwing a headphone in there sony you make headphones
2828720	2832640	do the playstation headsets work because i have that they they do work but i mean you're probably
2832640	2837840	going to want i don't know if you buy the bundle it comes with a stereo headset from sony i've got
2837840	2844160	a ton of sony headset or headphones so i mean i'm i'm good there but i have those official wireless
2844160	2848400	whatever whatever i have yeah i have the playstation 3 one um you know it's it's all
2848400	2852480	right those are pretty nice i will say this i do want to give sony props for this because as much
2852480	2855360	as it sounds like we're being critical in this segment because the pricing and everything i
2855360	2861680	actually do think this is really rad um is the fact that sony is supporting these old devices
2861680	2866000	because i think most companies out there would have done a new move like it would have worked
2866000	2869920	with the playstation 3 move they would have said oh you need this new one to play i kind of hope
2869920	2875040	that there is a new device i really honestly i don't think the move they're okay but like i
2875040	2879600	would be kind of cool like some haptic gloves or something or you know as bobby was saying you know
2879600	2883280	why aren't you supporting the nav controller with the analog stick on there because that doesn't
2883280	2888240	make any sense to me i wish they would have like a new controller with analog sticks on it and you
2888800	2892960	support the old ones sure by all means but come out with something new because i don't think that
2893520	2899040	this device that you created years ago is not necessarily going to fit all situations i think
2899040	2903280	something else needs to come about because you know look what they're doing with like the the
2903280	2908080	rift and the vive i mean i think the vive control looks pretty awesome and the rift one sounds
2908080	2912800	pretty cool so i think they just need to step it up because that's going to be a big problem
2912800	2920160	if the control's not good enough you're going to notice all right well uh let's go to a report on
2920160	2924480	something that could be coming to vr i want to point out not playstation vr necessarily this is
2924480	2931760	a different vr story but apparently a trailer was leaked for star wars trials on tatooine
2931760	2936720	something developed by lucas arts and ilm apparently something that's coming to the vive
2937360	2943760	there was a video that showed up on the ilm cross lab youtube channel but it was yanked shortly
2943760	2948960	thereafter however once it's on the internet it's always on the internet so you know somebody yanked
2948960	2954880	that and preserved it so there's the star wars trials on tatooine vr i mean it just it seems
2954880	2959600	like a natural fit star wars is a huge property everybody loves it they're doing something with
2959600	2964720	star wars battlefront exactly so they've got it they got to do something with star wars and vr so
2964720	2969840	this is not a surprise whatsoever i'm just yeah i guess i guess the playstation vr will have
2969840	2974720	battlefront this might be something a little more unique to the pcs or something we'll see
2974720	2982000	so uh that's pretty cool also uh other stuff uh ubisoft is going to be bringing a popular
2982000	2989600	role-playing party game to virtual reality it's called werewolves within uh this is the game this
2989680	2995040	this is the wolf game in vr basically uh you can assume the role of villagers in a medieval village
2995040	3000880	and you have to deduce which one is the werewolf that is terrorizing the town randomly players are
3000880	3009120	given abilities that help them to figure this out um this so this is the wolf game in vr a game that
3009120	3015120	we're used used to playing in real life at conventions where we're all sitting in front
3015120	3023600	of each other is now in vr kind of weird in a way but at the same time this would open it up to the
3023600	3029200	fact that you could play when you're not able to physically be in the same location you can actually
3029200	3035520	play across a great distance so that's kind of neat um i suppose now the question is is bobby
3035520	3040320	going to stay up till five in the morning playing this game at a case because that's what he used to
3040320	3045200	do at dragon con so anyway uh bobby blackwolf actually says as someone who played that game
3045200	3053840	a lot irl it defeats the purpose um sg100 matt says still waiting for clue vcr vr and bobby
3053840	3058480	brings up another point too is the problem is you have to be able to read facial expressions
3059040	3064080	that is that is really important in a game like where you have to like you have to be able to
3064080	3068800	read somebody's face and know if they're lying and maybe vr is not going to let you do that we'll see
3068800	3074960	but uh ubisoft is going to try so that is something to look forward to on vr moving on
3074960	3082160	with some more news dark sakura a little thing about poking tournament actually um now whenever
3082160	3086240	you're playing a game online one of the worst things is that when you're totally doing awesome
3086240	3092160	and the other person just up in rage quits yep like i can't beat you so i'm just not going to
3092160	3097200	give you the satisfaction of winning that's my life in grand theft of four yeah well there's
3097200	3104400	supposed to be consequences for rage quitting in poke and tournament um there is an in-game
3104400	3111520	advisor named nia who gives you the ins and outs and then tells you that before your online battles
3111520	3115520	that and i'm quoting quitting in the middle of the battle is rude to your opponent and you'll
3115520	3122560	suffer a penalty so please please refrain from doing so so basically if you disconnect you will
3122560	3129440	lose some of your pokey gold which is what you use to buy stuff good because you know they should
3129440	3137040	should lose like limbs off their pokemon then they have to fight like the next like 20 matches
3137040	3142880	super handicapped you know that announcer she she's kind of annoying i don't know the voice
3142880	3147760	acting isn't the really the best but uh like yyr says in the chat over at live.vog network.com
3147760	3152160	poking tournament straight up warned you the first time you enter a ranked match that there
3152160	3157920	are penalties if you quit and yeah that's very true uh it actually will come up and say please
3157920	3163440	please don't quit because there are penalties for doing so so um good you got to take it that's
3163440	3171120	right take that loss if you are not a winner you're a loser in poking tournament if you quit
3171120	3176320	kanye west is going to come to your house and kill you no he's just going to talk about himself
3176320	3179680	while you're trying to see he'll just tweet at you repeatedly that's they should just have
3179680	3185040	rosette come in there for no reason whatsoever just like lecture you even though he is from
3185040	3191520	animal cross i don't care does it matter because it's nintendo platform yeah that yeah well excuse
3191520	3197360	mr we said he shows up and he yells at you for an hour and then lyle comes to sell you insurance
3197360	3202400	actually i would say it's his long-lost brother mr disconnecty so what they'll happen what happens
3202400	3206080	they'll put rosette in there people complain oh he's not a pokemon character and then pokemon
3206080	3213280	company's like well we just made him one suck it and then there you go done he's reset him on
3216560	3220640	they could just couldn't they just repurpose diglett or something to look like rosette i
3220640	3224400	don't know all right no but i'm going to point out right now that this child is insane
3225440	3230240	he was trying to break dance right here in your living room for sometimes you got dance

3363680	3369360	it's kind of a sometimes sometimes you don't care but do you do you know that we used to play that
3369360	3374640	in front of the whole arcade and people will walk in and they would see us not dancing and think
3374640	3381680	those guys are very strange that's it seems really embarrassing i don't sometimes we didn't care we
3381680	3387120	didn't care we we just you just we're having fun and then there was the time that we sat down and
3387120	3392080	ate birthday cake in front of the fourth mix machine we went there for my birthday you know
3392240	3397600	and ate cake on the floor sometimes you get to a point in your life where you just stop
3397600	3403440	caring what other people think because i'm gonna have a good time and i don't care if other people
3403440	3407760	have a problem with it the sooner you do that the better you're off that's right yeah that's right
3407760	3411520	so if other kids tell you you're not cool but you're having fun doing what you're doing
3413120	3418000	forget them you know how do we get from talking about video games to this because you said it
3418000	3421760	looks embarrassing how do we get anywhere so julian next time someone gives you a hard time
3421760	3428560	you just go so that's uh that's what we do here on orange launch radio supposedly we talk about
3428560	3433200	video games and then suddenly we're talking about cake it just it just happens suddenly for some
3433200	3438320	cake me too suddenly becomes a 90s after school special all right anyway all right so after that
3438320	3445280	magic moment on the fullest house here at orange londredo uh let's move on i tried watching some
3445280	3452240	of that it made me cry out of what am i doing with my life yeah right all right i love this
3452240	3457840	sg100 matt says julian's trying to correct the derailment on the show i know right he's too
3457840	3462640	young to realize that that's not going to happen that's okay that's okay all right let's move on
3462640	3468320	we got more news loki so playstation view actually was something that finally got released widely in
3468320	3473360	the united states i actually signed up for it because i don't have cable well i have cable tv
3473360	3480240	what's comcast to me you're paying for like twenty dollars for local channels and hbo which
3480240	3485040	i don't watch for some reason um but this is awesome so this is actually basically all the
3485040	3489680	cable channels that you could possibly want 30 bucks is what it starts off as you can pay more
3489680	3495920	if you want you know the movie channels and all that stuff supports um but basically it streams
3495920	3502000	to your you know playstation 3 playstation 4 also i believe it supports the amazon fire
3502960	3511360	and other devices um it's not bad actually i'm quite digging it and um you know being that i've
3511360	3518000	you know basically cut you know comcast i mean i'm not i have comcast cable right now but it's
3518000	3521520	only because it's getting the internet a lot cheaper with that although the internet ended
3521520	3527120	up being a lot slower because the english as a second language guy didn't explain the benefits
3527200	3534560	of the package very well so um yeah it's it's definitely worth it you can actually record shows
3534560	3539200	you can go back and see the on-demand stuff um definitely we're checking out if you're kind of
3539200	3544880	cutting you know cable out and starts at 30 bucks you know and plus you get seven days free so you
3544880	3551600	get to check it out for seven days and so far so good that's awesome yeah this is why comcast locks
3551600	3557760	people into deals now yeah they do for a year and like that's the thing is like the guy this
3557760	3562400	is literally and i wish i had like a recording of the call and i know they do but i just it's too
3562400	3567760	late now um it's you know he's like oh yeah this you know you'll get some cable it'll be basic
3567760	3572800	cable channels but you'll also get you know faster internet speed because i knew this was originally
3572800	3580000	when my internet was speed was just crap it was just awful and since i've switched to that plan
3580000	3584960	it just gotten worse and worse and worse ironically though i did kind of figure out what
3584960	3590960	part of that problem was um i ended up moving my router into the living room instead of in the
3590960	3597680	bedroom and oh hey look at that internet speeds are six times faster now who'd have thought um so
3597680	3602320	that did fix part of it but i'm still not getting the speeds that i was promised and you know it's
3602320	3606480	not hd but this is all in hd you get you know the streaming everything it's all the really cable
3606480	3609600	channels that you're gonna want anyways if you don't you're not interested in like the
3609600	3613200	local channels i mean so comedy central food network all that stuff i mean that's
3613200	3620720	that's all i watch so it's awesome yeah i i would check this out if i wasn't locked into the
3620720	3624240	comcast thing but i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i can't get out of the comcast thing because
3624240	3627760	i kind of think i was lied to with some certain things on that but i'll save that for another
3627760	3633600	episode anyhow let's move on with something that leaked out of uh the game developers conference
3633600	3640240	maybe and that is this infamous photo that's floating around out there of a nintendo nx
3640240	3645840	controller so apparently the nintendo nx controller what it looks like has been leaked
3645840	3651120	there's a little picture of it out there and it does line up with what was seen in a patent
3651120	3658480	that was published um in december of 2015 by several media outlets so yeah an nx controller
3658480	3663920	you know it makes sense that one of these is actually leaked um out of gdc because they're
3663920	3668080	probably you know trying to meet with some people to um show them you know hey this is what these
3668080	3674720	devices look like and all that stuff and how to develop for that um but uh you know some people
3674720	3680400	also at the same time are skeptical the thing that concerns me about what i'm seeing with this
3680400	3687680	is that i can't tell if those buttons are tactile or not and that really concerns me i think they
3687680	3693360	are i think there's two there's like an a and b that are tactile yeah and i think the projection
3693360	3697840	of the screen or whatever is backlit underneath them so that the buttons are still tactile
3697840	3702480	i can't tell and i know nobody from nintendo listens to the show but if they did i can't tell
3702480	3709600	you how important a tactile button is there is a reason games like sonic the hedgehog are not fun
3709600	3716080	to play on iphone and android because the touch controls are not the same as having tactile
3716080	3723920	buttons so that is my biggest beef otherwise i'm like okay i'll try this i'm not the the shape is
3723920	3729920	really weird but i'm i'm curious to see what they do with it the software is more important
3729920	3736240	uh you know in how it uses the hardware uh but it better have tactile buttons or i mean nintendo
3736240	3742080	just shot themselves in the foot big time as far as i'm concerned i'm i will not i mean this is i
3742080	3747040	know it might just sound like i'm i'm being a jerk or whatever but i'm not buying it if it's
3747040	3753760	only touch screen buttons that's not a fun experience that's how i feel i agree i like
3753760	3762080	buttons loki you're dying to say something i i i don't think it's real and if it is real it's
3762080	3768320	it's awful it's abs no seriously it's awful think about it i mean what are they attempting to do
3768320	3772480	with this is this supposed to be like the screen is the controller because my hand is on the
3772480	3777120	controller it's gonna be obstructing the screen what is the point of it it's super tight it's
3777120	3781680	like i'm playing on a gameboy micro or something like that what is the point of this and you know
3781680	3786240	because of this tech because whatever it is that they're using for this supposed screen
3787520	3794240	is proprietary it's gotta cost some amount of money that's ridiculous what's the point in
3794240	3799040	having more expensive controllers for this device it's just a gimmick it doesn't make any sense
3799600	3805920	i think it's fake i hope it's fake it's just i don't see the point and if it's just these
3805920	3810880	two analog sticks and two buttons i don't think that's going to be enough i just don't see the
3810880	3816240	point it's just like the wii u controller the second screen idea was okay but they haven't
3816240	3822080	really still used it to they haven't really used it in a way that makes sense now even most
3822080	3826480	developers like with minecraft coming out they didn't even use it for like you inventory or
3826480	3832720	things so what makes me confident in the fact that publishers or developers are going to use
3832720	3837120	this in a meaningful way i just don't see that happening it just looks like a gimmick and it's an
3837120	3841920	expensive gimmick uh there's a lot of people in our chat room that thinks it's fake but i think
3841920	3845840	this comment is interesting from kai judo in our chat over at live.vognierware.com saying
3845840	3850320	i don't know if nintendo shot themselves in the foot i wonder if touch controls work better for
3850320	3856960	kids i think us older gamers spent decades on a gamepad so it feels weird to us i think kids will
3856960	3861840	have an easier time well fortunately for you kai judo i have somebody in the room that can give
3861840	3869120	some insight to that julian so do you like games that have like real buttons or are you okay when
3869120	3875040	they're like fake ones on the screen you can tap the touch buttons do you do you have an opinion
3875040	3880400	do you think one's better than the other what do you mean by on this like in minecraft on the
3880400	3885440	minecraft pocket edition how the buttons are on screen when you play minecraft on there like the
3885440	3891040	buttons aren't something you actually touch but like on this and i'm showing him a playstation
3891040	3896240	3 controller on this the buttons are real and you touch them and i just turned on my playstation 3
3896240	3900880	showing the platformer for example what do you think do you think one's better than the other
3900960	3906320	because what what we're saying what we're arguing about is me i think this this is the way to do it
3906320	3911520	you have to have real buttons and i think when you're using a pad like that you don't get that
3911520	3916880	same experience but one of our listeners says kids might feel differently what do you think julian
3916880	3925920	um my opinion my opinion is that um it's still okay on the um when you can do it on the screen
3925920	3932480	but it's a lot easier talking real with it's but it's a lot easier with real buttons and
3933280	3938720	my opinion is it's a lot better like that ah and he pointed at the playstation 3 controller so
3939280	3946480	there you go the official child of the official child compare perspective i mean honestly just
3946480	3951840	looking at look at this i mean i understand that they did um patent this or whatever came up with
3951840	3956480	a patent for this but what's the point like i mean seriously how are you going to be holding
3956480	3961120	this controller what's the point if you're going to have the screen extend all the way the edge
3961120	3966000	you're not going to see it your hands are on the control you have to hold the controller somehow
3966000	3972160	i mean it's there's no point to it why waste the screen space why waste the cost of the device
3972160	3977280	that's why i think it's fake it's a neat idea and maybe it's like you know this is just a generic
3977280	3982240	controller we drew up for the patent which by all means i think that makes more sense but
3982880	3987200	i just don't see the point in a design like that i'm gonna play devil's advocate here for a minute
3987200	3992480	i think ultimately it really boils down to what are the games but here's the thing is that i
3992480	3997760	notice on this device at the top there's this type of infrared looking thing so it probably
3997760	4002720	communicates with the we in a similar fashion to like how your wiimote does well if that's the case
4002800	4008320	and that's facing you the infrared thing is facing well what about this little square thing that
4008320	4011920	could be one of those things that goes all the way around looks like there's a there looks like
4011920	4018640	there's a camera facing the player and then there's two speakers my point is maybe some games
4018640	4024000	you don't hold the controller in a standard way maybe you're actually holding the controller like
4024000	4028880	this you don't have your thumbs on the sticks and you're actually doing some type of motion
4028880	4032880	thing so you can see everything i'm just being devil's advocate is that maybe the controller
4032880	4041600	isn't held the same way in every game what were you say julian um or um like in iron man's
4042640	4047680	iron man 3 you tilt the screen to move so yeah like using a tilt thing to move
4048640	4054880	okay julian knows i'm talking about why don't you all right listen with nintendo games okay
4054880	4061200	nintendo games have come out you know for the last decade or so has the complaint ever been
4061200	4066800	gee i really wish there was more ways to interact with this game there has never been that complaint
4066800	4071440	it's never been oh i really wish i had this second screen because this really provides a unique
4071440	4076960	experience they don't use it in a way that's meaningful why do i want them to continue doing
4076960	4082560	this and now with a controller that makes even little sense in how you operate it's got limited
4082560	4087680	buttons so that's really going to limit you on what you can do with it forget those third-party
4087680	4091760	games you just basically rule them out now because you don't have those extra buttons that you're
4091760	4096560	going to be able to play you know fifa or whatever else that they're going to be pouring to it forget
4096560	4100000	battlefield or anything else coming to this platform because they don't have the buttons to
4100000	4104320	support that yeah okay they'll sell a separate controller for it but why am i buying a separate
4104320	4110800	controller for that i have like the wii u gamepad it's great and what it is but guess what it has a
4110800	4115600	screen in the middle and there's actual buttons that makes sense it doesn't make sense to extend
4115600	4119920	that screen all the way inside because my hands are on the screen they're holding the controller
4119920	4125440	it doesn't make any sense to do that there is no reason to do that dungeon buster and chat over at
4125440	4132320	live.vognetwork.com says aw julian's witnessing his first loki rant it's not full rant listen
4133760	4139280	let's be real he's having to reserve himself a slight bit if you don't it's a pg rant all right
4139280	4145840	so anyway um all right it's look in three months we'll know three months till e3 and then we will
4145840	4151360	finally we'll know what the deal is with the stinking system in the meantime it's a rumor
4151360	4155440	exactly and brad brad is saying you know they do use the wii u screen i practically only use that
4155440	4160400	controller to stream mario kart 2 yes it's great as a second screen it's great to stream the game
4160400	4165520	onto that screen now imagine that screen the size of a gameboy micro because that's what they're
4165520	4170080	trying to sell you here it's like something that's really tiny instead of that nice screen
4171120	4175680	here's what people okay and to answer my question i posed earlier because i do have the answer for
4175680	4180960	it what do people what do people want from a nintendo console really what possible improvements
4180960	4185840	could they have make it more beefier so they can run the games that other consoles have so that we
4185840	4190000	can actually have some third-party support because that was the problem before so your console is
4190000	4195120	underpowered and it can't support these modern games that's what we need we don't need another
4195120	4201520	gimmicky control method it was cool with the wii it was cool with the wii u stop adding new method
4201520	4206400	it's not making these games any better if anything it's just finding a new gimmick and people use it
4206400	4211040	and that's it it doesn't add any meaningful gameplay to it make the games stand out and
4211040	4216160	speak the new zelda game looks awesome that is what you sell your console with not with oh look
4216160	4221920	i'm gonna have this unique controller it doesn't do anything make the games good people will buy
4221920	4226960	your console all right dr buster says also please understand it's only a prototype so i like i said
4226960	4231360	three months we'll know in three months stop innovating and just copy others no i'm not saying
4231360	4235520	that they're not innovating but really you think shrinking on the screen like that to the point
4235520	4239120	where it's covering your hands are covering they're not innovating they're copying those
4239120	4243920	they're basically it's a tablet controller maybe you need to lose some weight in your hands maybe
4243920	4248800	you need oh you're right let me just shrink down my hands let me just readjust the size of my hands
4248800	4252720	say i'll have little child hands like trump and then that way i'll be able to use that device
4257840	4259680	all right that's really who they're designing it for
4262080	4266480	for some reason the system is orange uh who go figure all right and it has a fake top
4266480	4274400	over here all right moving on the dark sakura save us from the land of loki rants quick
4274400	4282240	something that i want very much is going to be out on uh a steam on the day before my birthday
4282240	4287760	on december i'm sorry april 18th why does it say december dan ganronpa 2 goodbye despair will be
4287760	4295600	out which um it was already out in japan um in 2012 for the vita and then it came out in the
4295600	4303040	u.s in september 2014 on vita but since i think that dan ganronpa the first game has done so well
4303680	4311200	on steam that we're going to be getting the second one and um in addition to that i'm sure that most
4311200	4316640	fans of the series already know this but they're going to wrap up the hopes peak academy storyline
4316640	4322960	with an anime instead and then in the vein of ultra despair girls which is kind of a spin-off
4322960	4328880	game actually it's more like events that happen in between the first and second game um there's
4328880	4336000	going to be a v3 coming out that's going to be uh i guess in a hotel that's trapped beside a
4336000	4342960	inside a cage with new characters all new characters for that one so um yeah have you
4342960	4349680	already pre-ordered well i put it on my wish list i'm sure i'm sure birthday clause will bring it
4349680	4354960	for you we'll see it's just it's just it's just it's just after your birthday just after the day
4354960	4362960	before the day before yeah but but two days after my repeat my earlier birthday i see party all
4362960	4367120	right which that'll be fun i'm gonna call that party just relive the past i'm looking forward
4367120	4373840	to that by the way yes i everybody in this room hopefully will be there i should be there loki
4373840	4380000	i've been uh i've been bookmarking today to make it happen all right while we uh eagerly await dark

4402480	4412960	and hyrule warriors legends on 3ds will be coming out on friday as well and that's it
4413840	4417760	all right well traveling over to japan and checking out the releases in japan this week
4417760	4424480	on march 24th dark souls 3 hits the playstation 4 and uh i know several people are looking forward
4424480	4431120	to this dead or alive extreme 3 comes out uh this coming week and of course there's a regular
4431120	4436160	edition and a collector's edition and all that good stuff uh nobu naga no yabu sozou
4436160	4442480	senkoku orishi rin comes out this week uh from koe and then a game called psycho pass sentaku
4442480	4449200	naki kofuku comes out in a regular and limited edition so uh i'm not sure what psycho pass is
4449840	4454080	but um it has kind of an interesting cover to it looks like it might be a game full of intrigue
4454080	4460240	and mystery we'll see um going over to the Wii U we don't really have anything on the
4460240	4464960	Wii U until april really when starfox zero is out so it's pretty quiet over there
4464960	4471120	but the playstation vita also has dead or alive extreme 3 venus comes out in regular and
4471120	4478000	collector's edition uh and hatsune miku project diva x is out this week so i bet some of our
4478000	4482640	listeners are excited about that uh it's always fun to see a new hatsune miku game come out and
4482640	4486960	there's also an accessory set i guess for the playstation vita if you want to check that out
4487200	4491760	nobu naga no yabu and psycho pass which i mentioned earlier also out on the vita vita
4491760	4497680	and then there's a game called tokyo zanadu sakura matsuri package comes out this week as well i
4497680	4502400	think that is just a repackaging of a prior released game probably a price reduction and
4502400	4508720	then lastly on the 3ds this week dragon quest monsters joker 3 uh and then dobutso no mori
4508720	4513680	happy home designer a special amiibo set is out the game's already out over there it's just this
4513680	4519520	is a special amiibo i know but oh is it the one that we already got over here that has no this
4519520	4525120	one actually has an isabel amiibo like a full amiibo not just a card well right mine came with
4525120	4534160	isabel and um and uh digby digby it came with uh isabel and no but that's you're thinking the um
4534160	4540080	um uh wii u game the the oh no this is the 3ds game the 3ds one okay yeah i got the one that
4540080	4546640	had the reader okay and then uh that is it that is what's out this week so um over in our chat
4546640	4552560	over at live dot vog network dot com uh some folks pointing out that psycho pass is an anime and
4552560	4557280	rama says psycho pass is an amazing anime so um and i trust him because he's the host of anime
4557280	4565840	jam session when i first thought psycho pass was like psycho pass you're first a psycho and then
4565840	4575600	you pass psychonus psycho pass what that's sometimes where we end up at the end of an
4575600	4579600	episode of orange lounge radio believe it's like we've gone past that point of going completely
4579600	4588080	psycho the game was made exactly for this channel how about our uk releases yeah yeah we'll get to
4588080	4591200	i just i just want to say real quick though one thing you have to understand about this game
4591200	4596080	julian it's japanese and they have some weird stuff in japan no no offense we've got some
4596080	4600000	awesome we've got some weird stuff in the u.s yeah that's right they look at some of our stuffs
4600000	4608960	like how did japan make a giant lizard attacking tokyo radiation julian who knows who knows
4608960	4613360	somebody probably probably taking some pills the doctor said they shouldn't take that's how i'm
4613360	4617680	thinking that's what i'm thinking it happened recreational pharmacy that's right and they made
4617680	4626880	some weird made super weird things in super myo galaxy one and two you know what julian yes they
4626880	4635360	did yes they did julian which reminds me i still need to show julian um georgia oh yeah educate him
4635360	4640480	on japanese horror movies the age of eight no it was the the sentai series that we were watching
4640480	4645840	oh it was like the animals and minecraft world why did i think why did in my head i hear juan
4645840	4650960	well thinking you want to show him the grudge he can see when he's 11 all right
4653280	4657840	we'll pour some beers and watch some japanese horror movie all right he's 11 uk releases
4657840	4663040	dark saga i don't get interested in watching any horror movie you're not interested in horror
4663040	4669040	movies no i don't like him either they sound horrible they do yeah they sound horrible
4669040	4682320	all right on the 24th we have um samaras three on mac and pc on the 28th we have adrift for pc
4682960	4687200	gunjack for pc and pinball ethics 2 vr for pc
4689920	4697120	oh yeah um and then nope the other one's the week after that so never mind all right just a couple
4697120	4702080	more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week and then a break but loki first
4702080	4706880	oh this sounds like a wonderful idea so there's a rumor that sony is making a more powerful
4706880	4713200	playstation a like playstation four and a half or whatever uh it's going to feature a new gpu
4713200	4720080	that would support 4k resolution um also would assist with vr performance and would be backwards
4720080	4732080	compatible with the playstation 4 why why playstation playstation four and three quarters
4733520	4738480	exactly the kid's got a point how where do we draw the line then there's going to be playstation
4738480	4744240	four and five eighths you know how what what where does this end i just don't see the point
4744480	4750160	why fragment the you know the whole platform but whatever i mean it and if it isn't mean if all
4750160	4756320	games are gonna run on both systems then what's the point it runs it better i mean i just don't
4756320	4762880	see i don't know it just i i don't know like i again i i kind of feel like nintendo's kind of
4762880	4768480	done this to an extent they just put the different names on the consoles but like is it a 4.5 because
4768480	4773040	it's actually going to be fully backwards compatible with playstation 4 games um and
4773040	4777040	maybe playstation 5 or whatever they're designing well here's what i'm thinking you know if it
4777040	4782320	supports like 4k resolutions and stuff like that that's kind of cool i guess but once again that's
4784080	4790320	i mean i don't know 4k tvs aren't really widely adopted yet that's kind of like jumping on to the
4790320	4795760	3d gaming bandwagon oh they did that too that's right that's right they were trying to push
4795760	4802240	stereoscopic 3d you know with their their headsets and stuff vr at least hopefully will do better i
4802240	4810480	hope but i i just i don't know bobbie is pointing out that yes it is to make better vr games and
4810480	4816160	allow 4k gaming and yeah i've heard the whole thing about the 4k gaming as well and and
4816160	4821040	certainly the the boost to vr make those games look better but still it's the whole fact that
4821040	4825600	it's kind of like going to be it's the same thing we're talking about the xbox one last week but at
4825600	4832000	this i i guess to be fair if they just called it the playstation 5 would we be having these issues
4832400	4836480	sure but why do i have to buy a new system to make the vr games better
4838160	4843280	it's it's your platform make your vr technology better then i mean maybe this should should we
4843280	4846800	wait a little longer for this to be released because like i understand if you're saying
4846800	4850640	that the hardware can't do it then maybe you should have put some extra gpu's or shit
4850640	4857280	oh stuff in the um actual you know little device thing the breakout box that they have maybe there
4857280	4863040	should have been some actual processing power in there because if this can't handle it if we
4863040	4868480	got to put on another system to be able to handle this this peripheral i'm paying 500 for thank you
4868480	4874720	very much i mean what's the point i'll buy a pc at that point if i have to keep upgrading to keep
4874720	4879600	you know up with the actual console games that's a pc that's a pc at that point that's why i don't
4879600	4884400	play on pc mostly because i have to keep upgrading my specs to be able to play the new games i'm
4884400	4888480	supposed to avoid that with consoles but now here we are yeah yeah julian what do you want to say
4890000	4896960	why are you are you not allowed to say bad words around me i've already seen freaking die hard
4906400	4910720	well yippee ki-yay motherfucker ladies ladies and gentlemen my son
4910720	4918800	i mean if you really want to do that if you really do you really are we turning this up
4918800	4930160	to 10 i mean is that that's because it's we've had this discussion before becky and i yes that if you
4930800	4938080	make using adult language something that's taboo it's just going to make them want to do it all
4938080	4942640	the more you make no big deal out of it and as we can see julian is it a big deal
4944960	4951520	um it's not really a big deal as long as you don't say it a bunch like like at school you
4951520	4960000	don't want to say the f word unless you break your whole leg i think that's an allowable excuse
4960000	4966240	that would be an allowable time to drop an f-bomb but you see sometimes on this program loki will
4966240	4972320	use the f word sometimes i do too we use it a lot we use it a lot so you know i lost count
4972320	4978320	and die hard around 30 door did you try to count that's that's uh it's pretty impressive there
4978320	4983280	might be some website telling you how many f words they there aren't die hard
4985120	4990960	ah love it uh yeah and that's julian's favorite christmas movie by the way our chatters right now
4990960	4995920	they love you i just want you to know they look they think die hard counts as a christmas movie
4995920	5000080	because then i would just watch it on christmas every single year yeah you should watch it on
5000080	5004720	christmas every single year although my favorite christmas movie is gremlins all right oh my gosh
5004720	5007920	okay but i just want you to know the chatters you're one of the favorite guests they've ever
5007920	5011440	had seen on the show i just want you to know that like i'm not making that up you come over here
5011520	5016800	yourself they love you so all right uh wow i feel so happy
5020320	5023760	all right that's why i say at the end of every episode all right
5024320	5032880	one other uh quick story here on bravely second uh bravely second and lair uh is uh the sequel
5032880	5038960	to bravely default on the nintendo ds and of course they've made some changes uh with bravely
5038960	5044960	second for the us release one of the big things is that they changed uh they changed this uh
5044960	5050240	subclass i think that was the tomahawk is what it was called before but it kind of appropriated some
5050240	5055040	native american culture that may have been insensitive here in this so they changed it
5055040	5060480	into a different class that uh takes a little more from cowboys so uh they did that that's one
5060480	5066240	big change but they also did some changes to side quests and apparently in the japanese version of
5066240	5070480	the game sometimes you would do side quests and the endings may not be so good like some bad
5070480	5075760	things may happen and you might kind of regret doing the side quests well uh what they ended
5075760	5081520	up doing is they actually changed these endings for the u.s audiences and now people are saying
5081520	5087280	oh you dumbed it down you lightened it up for the u.s and so forth well so far to the point
5087280	5092080	where nintendo actually put out a statement saying when the game was released in japan
5092080	5097040	each side quest would end with the team lamenting the decision they made regardless of the player's
5097040	5101600	decision this was intended to help players empathize with the character situation
5101600	5106320	but overwhelming feedback from players indicated that they felt an unsatisfying disconnect between
5106320	5112000	their intentions and the character's reactions in response these side quest endings were amended to
5112000	5117920	show the party readily coming to terms with their actions in a manner that does not cause the player
5118000	5125280	undue regret for their decisions these changes do not affect the gameplay so in other words sometimes
5125280	5128960	bad things happen and you have to deal with it but they're trying to give it a good good ending here
5128960	5135760	yeah julian what you mean by bad endings do you mean like you did this side quest so bad and
5135760	5140400	horribly your brother's head gets chopped up or something well something like that something
5140400	5145200	actually something like that now see we don't know because they don't want to spoil it because
5145200	5149040	if you were to say what happens you're kind of spoiling the story right that's like why when
5149040	5152640	you talk about star wars episode 7 there's one thing you don't talk about and that's what happens
5152640	5157280	in the last 15 minutes right you don't talk about that with people who haven't seen it so i think
5157280	5160880	it's kind of like that where they don't want to spoil it so we don't exactly know what happens
5160880	5165120	we just know it's bad so yeah somebody's brother probably gets it
5168560	5173760	speaking of julian julian have you seen the star wars movie you probably have seen the star wars
5173760	5178240	movie this is what happens i haven't seen it thank you for spoiling it spoiling julian if
5178240	5186800	you want to see an example of a bad ending tell your mom to shoot the annoying uh kid on top of
5186800	5199440	the citadel oh that's a bad ending mass effect well there is um ways to kill it you shoot the
5199440	5207120	machine that destroys all um synthetics okay hold on you don't don't ruin mass effect because
5207120	5211120	bobby blackwolf still hasn't played it so that's okay i understand i understand sometimes i want
5211120	5216000	to spoil it too because it's been like seven years and you didn't say that all right that's why i
5216000	5221920	phrased it the way that i did it pretend i did not say that pretend i didn't say it you're good
5221920	5229680	you're good you're good if you haven't played it by now all right all right anyway uh there
5229680	5234240	so there you go there's some changes happening in a bravely second and uh for better for worse
5234240	5238800	there it is they're they're having to defend it all right let's take a trip down memory lane shall
5238800	5247360	we every week every week here on the program uh dark sakura steps into the gaming vault to find
5247360	5253360	a game that hey you guys should respect this this is a classic game of the week and remember folks
5253360	5259280	the rules on what makes a classic game of the week is that a jamie has to like it or at least
5259280	5266400	want to acknowledge it b it has to be at least 10 years old yeah so remember the game the dark
5266400	5271760	soccer is picking tonight is 10 years old it's exactly 10 years old as of today this game is
5271760	5278400	older than julian you can believe it so all right so dark soccer dark soccer's picked one tonight
5278400	5283200	that is exactly 10 years old and get ready because brace yourselves for the groans that are about to
5283200	5288560	come from the chat room when they realize get ready to feel ancient gamers years old dark
5288560	5297200	sakura what is the classic game of the week the elder scrolls for oblivion yes oblivion is 10
5297200	5308880	years old as of today um like it's uh the game that came after it skyrim uh this is an action
5308880	5316960	a role-playing video game developed by bethesda um it is the fourth game in the elder school series
5316960	5325360	following uh morrowind and preceding skyrim as i just said and um it actually was released for in
5325360	5333680	march 2006 actually on this day in 2006 for windows and for the xbox 360 and
5336320	5343920	it had uh some content expansions there were shivering aisles and it had a game of the year
5343920	5351440	edition and also included nights of of the nine with it in 2007 and there was a fifth anniversary
5351440	5358560	version in 2011 and i bought it on steam for two dollars because that's what they do with games
5358560	5368960	when there's a newer version so basically um it it focuses on a cult um called mythic dawn
5368960	5375280	that's trying to open the gates to the realm of oblivion and so it's very open world you can
5376160	5385520	do things to improve your skills or um you know develop other abilities that you have um
5386240	5391840	and this game actually took a while to develop it started in 2002 right after morrowind um was
5391840	5401360	released and they have a lot smarter npc's in fact the npc's can make choices and have different
5401360	5408880	complex behaviors by using what they call the radiant ai system um it was uh you know one of
5408880	5413680	the other good things about this too is that it had some pretty nice voice work in it i mean
5414320	5420000	as far as um voice actors that you had in this you had and let me get back to the list because
5420000	5425040	i know it had patrick stewart in it linda carter and i think sean bean in a non-dying role
5425760	5432560	i think so you know one of those little uh unicorn of a role for him you know kind of
5432560	5442480	like silent hill was um because he didn't die in silent hill um but it was really just you know
5442480	5451680	meant to be a lot more immersive um it had uh some pretty i'd say you know for 2006 it had really
5451680	5457360	good graphics it had a new interface um hdr lighting a longer draw distance um
5458400	5463520	at its time it was really on the edge of you know pushing everything sort of how
5463520	5470160	skyrim was when it came out um of course you know a month later there were things that did
5470720	5476320	more but uh the game there's really not too much else i can say about it because you've either
5476320	5486000	played it or played games like it or you haven't um but it was uh i'd say about as epic when it
5486000	5493040	came out of skyrim was when it came out and uh definitely you know building on a very big uh
5493040	5499200	mythology behind uh what had already been established in the season um i'm sorry in the
5499200	5507520	series um it got a rating of um actually it initially got a rating of t for teen and then it
5507520	5516400	went to um a mature rating uh due to content that was not in the initial esrb review um
5518400	5523840	the actual quote on here says the presence in the pc version of the game of a locked out art file
5523840	5528800	that if accessed by um by using an apparently unauthorized third-party tool allows the user
5528800	5534160	to play the game with topless versions of female characters you know what modding happens that was
5534160	5538800	a really big deal when that happened though because it was like wait a minute the game makers
5538800	5546560	didn't intend for this to happen but because there was an actual female figure on the disc they had
5546560	5550400	to do the rating even though it wasn't intended to be seen in the game well and on top of that
5550400	5556720	it was also super blown out of proportion and sensationalized by most of the major media at
5556720	5563600	that point because what they neglected to say is that it was not regularly accessed uh uh game
5563600	5569760	content that you had to use a tool to get that sort of like the hot coffee thing you know in
5569760	5578160	grand theft auto whichever one that was four right three actually right san andreas or sanders so at
5578160	5586320	any rate um i figured that i would push the line and pick a really good game that came out exactly
5586320	5594560	a year ago today 10 years ago whatever i can't number rob geez um it came out 10 years ago today
5595520	5602480	to number one to make everyone it was a must-have on 360 too it was it really was uh it wasn't
5602480	5606960	quite a launch title but since nobody could get an xbox 360 when they first came out it pretty
5606960	5613520	much was a launch title so um yeah and uh let's see jim sally says yes oblivion made me lose my
5613520	5620400	job i wore i wore out my right stick leveling my health magic to 100 oblivion was stupidly addictive
5620400	5626080	and fun great choice for an old game review i just the world was so vast and i just remembered that
5626080	5629440	was really one of the first games because i didn't really get into morrowind so oblivion was really
5629440	5634320	one of the first games where i felt like i could just go anywhere i i'm just i'm gonna go into this
5634320	5639040	cave just because it can and i'm just gonna i'm gonna mess some stuff up in this cave and find
5639040	5644640	like maybe a potion for doing it all well but you remember what this paved the way for though is
5644640	5650080	that by the time we got to skyrim we already had this expectation of what can we do yeah so we
5650080	5656480	collected cabbages and rolled them down a hill which was awesome totally awesome i can't wait
5656480	5662160	for elder scrolls 6 that's all i'm saying yeah you know though i am curious though going just
5662160	5668080	touching a little bit on skyrim yeah you remember how someone used the uh like a cheat code to get
5668080	5672880	past the barriers and you could actually travel into morrowind and some of the other uh oh yeah
5672880	5678960	areas around and i wonder if the next game would actually be expansive enough you can travel
5678960	5685840	through the various we'll see areas of that's creepy time will tell that is creepy in the
5685840	5690640	meantime anything there it is your classic game of the week 10 years old today i was looking at
5690640	5696400	loki's thing the elder scrolls 4 oblivion just the way the light was catching the lenses on the vr
5696400	5703760	thing uh-huh i was like oh my god that just creeped me out like a lot all right i'm gonna
5703760	5707600	go run away now all right that's all right we're gonna take a quick break anyway uh we have to take
5707600	5712560	a break um i don't know if are you guys staying around for the next part or probably taking off
5712560	5718880	here pretty soon i don't know so um given the fact that he's turning circles through the room
5719520	5723120	i think it might be about time to get him home that's all right but i want well i want to make
5723120	5727120	sure that julian wave julian julian before you go stop spinning for a minute come grab the mic

5800400	5807680	greatness what i'll write that down one i don't know one eight seven seven game olr or username
5807680	5813920	on skype orange lounge radio rapid fire news the frugal question of the week emails all when we
5813920	5826080	come back with more of orange lounge radio right after this welcome back everybody to orange lounge
5826080	5832640	radio live tonight with episode number 635 of our show in progress for this march the 20th of
5832640	5837760	2016 and of course uh if you're just joining us then you missed a fun filled first half of
5837760	5844320	the show where we had um we had uh julian who is an eight-year-old gamer here on the program
5844320	5849440	uh son of dark soccer's bestie becky who's also been on the show before so and that was a lot of
5849440	5855840	fun of her labor yes and the listeners loved it and it was great hearing his perspective and his
5855840	5860160	opinions on die hard and so forth um we're going to continue on though however as we usually do
5860160	5866240	and get you guys onto the show um unfortunately uh we did send julian home uh because you know
5866240	5870480	we the show runs till nine o'clock which can be a little bit late and also uh it's probably for
5870480	5875840	the best that we don't let you guys talk to him i'm just messing all right but we will uh we will
5875840	5880160	talk to you guys a little later when we open up the skype line at one eight seven seven game olr
5880160	5885920	or our username on skype orange lounge radio all right let's move on with some rapid fire news and
5885920	5891040	quickly talk about some other gaming highlights for the week loki so apparently j.j abrams is
5891040	5897600	still working on movies for portal and half-life um they're underway i guess and apparently they've
5897600	5904880	got writers and they're working on both of the stories but nothing exciting to announce so far
5904880	5909520	so i guess those movies will probably come out before the next half-life game
5911360	5916560	it's too bad but hey maybe if the movies you know get more hype in those series then
5917120	5922880	that might motivate them to work a little harder on it i guess we'll have to see you
5924400	5933280	uh so this is kind of cool um simon pegg has been asked to or is in talks to join the movie
5933280	5939200	adaption of ready player one which i can't wait to see and of course that's supposed to be coming
5939200	5944480	out now oh man it was supposed to come out christmas of 2017 but now it's march 30th of
5945120	5952160	2018 whatever i'll wait an extra three months but um yeah i can't wait to check that out
5953040	5958800	hopefully uh i don't know which character he'd be playing oh ogden morrow okay i could see that
5958800	5968000	um and then finally um they're gonna be putting out some new xbox one controllers and some new
5968000	5975760	colors they've got this uh dusk shadow which it's like a copper shadow and dusk shadow so
5975760	5981120	it's kind of a black that fades to blue or you know a copper color and those are available
5982160	5987920	and they are going to be ten dollars more expensive than the regular controllers
5989440	5998000	why apparently this is great because it's i love it when developers do this or publishers you can
5998000	6002640	only get the copper shadow model at game stop and the dust shadow well that's going to be a best buy
6003280	6011200	so um otherwise if you wait into um if you want to get it anywhere else throughout the world that's
6011200	6017920	going to be coming out in april you know i gotta say though those um controllers are gorgeous
6018880	6022640	like i don't know about the whole like wow it's 10 more dollars but the controllers are really
6022640	6026560	good looking i got it probably the copper one yeah i actually really like the blue one that's
6026560	6031680	fun i actually got to replace my one of my playstation 4 controllers because it's all
6031680	6036080	the bright analog sticks is all derpy and shit that's that's the one that my two-year-old son
6036080	6040080	gets he gets the derped controller because he doesn't actually play the games anyways
6040080	6046880	there you go he just shadows along yeah all right to register participation for this week's episode
6046880	6052320	of orange on treaty with bognetwork.com use the passphrase unit uh let's move on and talk about
6052320	6057120	splatoon and splatfest uh apparently there have been some changes to splatfest so even though you
6057120	6061760	know uh there were supposed to be no more major updates to splatoon there are still some little
6061760	6067600	minor tweaks coming and uh in the latest splatfest the vibe meter now has your splatfest power and
6067600	6071760	the splatfest power level depends on your ranked battle rank and your splatfest power level will
6071760	6076320	change as you win or lose during splatfest the player with the highest splatfest power on the
6076320	6081120	winning team gets a slightly larger boost to their power than their teammates after the match
6081920	6086560	also until now the splatfest matchmaking would favor groups with similar play styles
6086560	6091360	but players will now be more likely to play with those of similar splatfest power level
6091360	6095520	the higher the average splatfest power level the more splatfest points that you will get
6095520	6101920	what happens though if that power level goes over 9000 well then just paint explosions everywhere
6102000	6109200	like a dirty porno all right uh anyhow this could have been a thing but it wasn't you know the game
6109200	6113200	demon's crest which is by the way awesome i don't know if you've ever played it was like an old
6113200	6120240	school gameboy game uh anyhow apparently uh renegade kid was a company and the founder uh
6120240	6127680	jewels watson actually mentioned on twitter that they pitched a gameboy advanced port of
6127680	6135040	demon's crest to capcom years back but nothing ever became became of it and uh capcom did explain
6135040	6139120	that the super nintendo version just didn't sell enough units to make it a viable proposition
6139120	6144800	oh that's unfortunate because that game was awesome but you know speaking of the gameboy
6144800	6150320	advance huh 10 year anniversary is tomorrow is it really i guess that makes sense dang
6150960	6153440	now we can start adding that into the classic game of the week pool
6153440	6159600	uh also and lastly for me tonight uh apparently there's a psa out there that uh if you're
6159600	6164320	interested i'm sorry 15 you know obviously 15 year anniversary i was gonna say i thought gba
6164320	6170480	was long before especially 60 um anyway uh hyrule warriors legends you probably don't want to play
6170480	6178480	that on the old 3ds it really runs best on the new 3ds and they say it runs like garbage on the
6178480	6188240	old 3ds on the old 3ds uh you get sub 30 frames a second performance there is no 3d option and uh
6188240	6192080	yeah apparently some folks are going so far as to say you know they probably shouldn't have even
6192080	6198160	made it uh play they should have just said it's a new 3ds exclusive um and you guys know how i
6198160	6203120	feel about new 3ds exclusives but hyrule warriors i'm kind of like yeah i can play that on the weu
6203120	6207760	so i don't feel like i'm losing anything major well you're not gonna be able to play as those
6207760	6211200	extra characters because you have to buy it on both systems no i thought they were i thought
6211200	6216640	they were bringing it out on the weu yeah they are but the only way to play them on the weu is
6216640	6223360	you have to get a special download code that's in that 3ds version thank you nintendo i love
6223360	6232080	buying games more than once barf barf barf all right uh how about dark sakura a few things there
6232160	6241680	is axiom verge uh it is uh going to be uh ported out to the xbox one and we you to be released
6241680	6247040	later this year um also uh the vita version is still in development too
6249120	6259280	xbox one by the way actually as of today um will be taking 50 off the price so it is going to go
6259280	6267040	down for the 500 gigabyte version 299 dollars the uh the division one terabyte bundle will be going
6267040	6274880	for 300 349 so uh and also a few of the games will be getting a 20 price cut including halo 5
6274880	6281840	which will never be a classic game of the week um also on march 22nd they're going to do a week-long
6281840	6288640	xbox store sale that discounts games by 40 to 60 percent including fallout 4 and far cry primal
6289680	6294720	so there you go oh there's more oh one more because i have another story yes
6296960	6304480	um i i i don't know how i feel about this because there's um gonna be a resident evil
6305200	6316880	slash biohazard musical um it's going to be directed um by uh actor rayon yuzuki who um
6317520	6328160	has uh been uh it looks like uh an actor who's been in uh a uh an all-female show called the uh
6328160	6335840	taco uh takara zuko review um which is as someone who's famous for playing male characters and it
6335840	6343680	will be overseen by capcom's um hirouki kobayashi so there you go i hope it has the acting chops of
6344400	6350160	the first game i'm quoting the article here and that i hope there's a song called jill sandwich i
6350160	6354880	was just about to say there better be a song called jill sandwich then again if it's only
6354880	6362400	in japan likely that line i mean i'd have to get little no because that wasn't the because
6362400	6368640	the japanese release was in english um act deft in our chat over at live.vog network.com says little
6368640	6374400	shop of horror style musical please yes and there needs to be a song like suddenly see more in it i
6374400	6379280	would uh i would be so down for that and it would be every karaoke across america for the rest of
6379280	6386080	our lives but you have to have someone singing like um what's-her-face that played uh abri
6386800	6391280	yeah ellen barkin with the accent yeah the way that she talks
6402480	6406640	i see i think one night on the show dark soccer and i just need to cancel olr and do duets all
6406640	6410880	night on the show would you guys enjoy that we have to have the olr sing along we we kind of
6410880	6415120	did that one week but it was it was a long long long long time ago when karaoke revolution first
6415120	6420240	came out and then you weren't here that week we did it honestly enough you know there is like
6420240	6426800	a recording out there somewhere of me singing karaoke revolution at my friend mitch's party
6426800	6434480	nice in mobile alabama nice that was back when um uh ground zero was still open in mobile
6434480	6439200	well you know um years and years and years and years and years ago before olr it was probably
6439200	6446160	what the i think it was the year 2000 uh i went to a little convention in las vegas with my buddy
6446160	6452800	uh named jessica and we went into a little uh kiosk there and recorded ourselves singing
6452800	6457120	love shack and little did i know that that video would come back to haunt me for years
6457120	6464240	and years and years after recording that so no no anyway all right let's move on to the
6464240	6467280	frugal question of the week
6475440	6479600	every week we go to our facebook and our google plus communities and you take those words you
6479600	6484640	slam them together you get frugal and tonight dark soccer will be singing all of your answers
6484640	6490880	here we go i'm just kidding all right uh details of the playstation vr are out is what we asked
6490960	6496000	our listeners this week it's going to cost 399 dollars for 99 if you need a camera and
6496000	6500720	move controllers so now that you have most of the details save for many maybe some more games come
6500720	6506560	e3 have you decided if you're getting one or not why or why not let's start on google plus tonight
6506560	6510960	where prince beach fuzz says probably not i haven't seen anything that's convinced me i must
6510960	6517600	have it uh martin over on google plus says since i already have a ps4 i might get one if i see some
6517680	6522560	cool games announced for it some racing games perhaps at 400 it's in the upper realm of
6522560	6527520	disposable income purchases for me though i realize 400 is still a lot of money the oculus
6527520	6532640	and htc vive are just too expensive to be impulse buys no game would probably be good enough to
6532640	6537680	persuade me to spend that much here's the thing about racing games though as awesome as that
6537680	6543200	sounds i would worry could something moving that fast make me sick in virtual reality i think if
6543200	6547600	you do a racing game there's you know certain ways to do it so just you know you got to be
6547600	6551920	careful how fast you go and things like that i don't know if you could do f0 very well in
6551920	6560000	virtual reality then again i did play gx and like a rig sort of thing but anyway um moving on to
6560000	6566640	act deft who replied and said i do want one will i get it though probably not on launch i also need
6566640	6572000	to get a playstation 4 too but hopefully it will get actual support from sony and third parties
6572000	6577120	and it will be cheaper in a year or two going to facebook where we have a lot of answers tonight
6577120	6582320	fabrice a says i'm interested but i'll still wait it's a bunch of money and i've never even
6582320	6589680	tried any vr gear i'm also afraid vr is going to be a fad just like 3d television was mike b says
6589680	6593840	no i feel it will be another fad but at least it's one more step in the right direction like having
6593840	6598960	a holodeck and dr says yeah i'll probably get one i already have the camera and controllers so i got
6598960	6606080	that going for me tried psvr at psx and i'm pretty excited by what it can do winston h says
6606080	6610640	i probably won't get one considering it's out of my price range even if i did have the money i feel
6610640	6616240	like vr is still kind of niche at the moment guillermo r says yes because of res infinite and
6616240	6620640	sony being very active and working with developers to minimize motion sickness triggers gives me
6620640	6625120	confidence which by the way bobby blackwolf kind of piggybacked on on what i was saying
6625120	6630400	in the chat room and says you can do racing games and vr safely the trick is to render the cockpit
6630400	6635840	so your brain has a frame of reference to adjust to and that's because dark soccer you've talked
6635840	6639760	about being motion sick in games before and usually if like a game like oblivion funny
6639760	6643440	enough if you can shift into third person it's not nearly as bad because you have like that
6643440	6648080	reference thing not nearly as bad but what was funny is though is like in golden eye
6648640	6653280	even though you had the gun on screen yeah that made me really motion sick yeah i mean that's
6653280	6656800	probably the game that's done to me the worst maybe because the gun isn't enough you know the
6656800	6660160	gun isn't really it's not a very good point of reference you know balancing a little bit too i'm
6660160	6664880	trying to remember if it did um it used to like doom i think it would bounce a little bit but
6664880	6672000	like in wolf doom doom and wolfenstein weren't really i have a head bob yeah anyway uh moving on
6672000	6677280	to critical myth who says no because i've yet to see the killer game that would be worth the
6677280	6683520	investment and i'm not convinced this is the next big advancement in gaming uh kirk k replied and
6683520	6688240	said the more and more i hear and see about these vr headsets makes me not want any of them this is
6688240	6694320	just part of video games that i'm not looking forward to at all nemesis 47 says that'd be a no
6694320	6698560	for me that's pretty much the price of a playstation 4 for something that's going to be a gimmick such
6698560	6703440	as the playstation 3 with the 3d gimmick or the move controller rather buy a playstation 4 than
6703440	6708560	a peripheral for only a few games thank you a game only needs a few controllers in the system
6708560	6712720	enough said entertainment says i feel like i'm a broken record at this point because i keep saying
6712720	6716480	the same thing over and over i feel like i'm a broken record at this point because i all right
6716480	6723200	you get it and then says i want to demo any vr device before i purchase it william murderface
6723200	6728640	says the psvr looks interesting but even if i had a ps4 i don't i probably would hold off for a while
6728640	6732800	at this point it's still just a neat gimmick with a lot of promise when i see something that i
6732800	6737520	consider solid interesting and well executed then i will think about it degenerate johnny
6737520	6742720	says i have to say no even though i'm a consumer whore and how i still have standards one of those
6742720	6747600	standards is that there must be proper software support to warrant a hardware purchase so far
6747600	6753600	neither the oculus rift or the psvr have shown enough software support to my liking rage nator
6753600	6759680	says i know i won't get a playstation vr if only because i don't have a playstation 4 and i have no
6759680	6765280	real desire to get a playstation 4 i might however consider getting an oculus rift once i upgrade my
6765280	6770960	video card rob replies and says i won't get one right away i've seen this type before on the 3d
6770960	6776080	tvs only this time they're marketing to a significantly smaller demographic jordan t says i
6776080	6780640	will buy one but not off the top we'll wait to see in a year or so i think the fad or gimmick part of
6780640	6785600	vr will be seen in the controller interfaces motion tracking hands and so forth and eventually most
6785600	6790160	games will settle focus on just the headset and either a normal gamepad or anything that can
6790160	6795920	replicate seated immersion like a joystick or a steering wheel lastly veronica isabelle says i
6795920	6800960	won't be buying one because i don't have a playstation 4 lots and lots of answers this week
6800960	6805600	uh over on facebook and google plus so it seems like we have a lot of listeners that are like i
6805600	6810240	don't even have a ps4 yet so this isn't something i'm really interested in buying it seems like a
6810240	6815520	lot of people who have tried it firsthand are very interested in it and then people who haven't
6815520	6821520	are kind of like i need to wait and see or i need that killer app i need that thing that makes it
6821520	6826320	very worth it and i don't think there's any problem with wanting that game that is going
6826320	6831760	to make it all worth it um and i see some folks in chat are saying rez rez rez which is weird
6831760	6837840	because rez is a game from like 1990 no but 2001 i think is when rez is so it is weird that a game
6837840	6844320	that old uh but i got to admit i'm probably gonna pick up a psvr and you bet your ass i'm gonna get
6844320	6849920	rez because i really want to play that in vr um but i also know you know i'll probably pick up
6849920	6853920	some of the other uh mini game collections and some of the other stuff if they if they actually
6853920	6857280	do this star wars battlefront that might finally get me into battlefront that sounds awesome
6857840	6862800	so anyhow those are our answers from facebook and google plus thanks everybody for answering
6862800	6866720	that was some really good participation this week appreciate it all right let's move on back into
6866720	6872080	some other news loki i was just taking a look at the nx controller i don't think those buttons are
6872080	6876480	actual physical anymore oh really you think yeah if they're touch screen buttons well because the
6876480	6881440	way that they look either that or they're inset which is even weirder i don't like that at all
6881440	6885040	they're inset but the way they have it lit because they also have these like arrow buttons that are
6885040	6895840	on the edges and it just looks fake so okay anyways so um microsoft made a really weird
6895840	6904240	announcement they basically said hey um we are going to be opening up our online um to allow
6904240	6909120	connections with other consoles and pc networks so it's going to be up to the developers to support
6909120	6913520	this feature but they're going to open up xbox live so that you can do cross play with other
6913520	6920640	platforms that's kind of cool i mean i know in the past that's been kind of a stickler with a
6920640	6924240	lot of the mmo's and stuff they were supposed to come into those platforms and i think now
6924240	6931760	with rocket league they're going to be supporting that um so i'll have to wait and see um now sony's
6931760	6937680	response to that is you know hey we're cool with that we just want to get some more information
6937680	6943280	on that to see you know you know they've been you know we've been supporting the cross platform
6943280	6948400	thing already with you know back even on the playstation 3 and now with you know different
6948400	6954480	integration they have with like you know street fighter 5 and that type of thing um it's all about
6954480	6958480	you know the developers and publishers what they want to do they need to get in touch with us and
6958480	6966080	handle everything else on a case-by-case basis so basically they just need to see what how they
6966080	6972720	implement this and how they can do it safely and all that fun stuff well this is going to be very
6972720	6976400	interesting for the future of gaming if they really pull this off and there's people you know
6976400	6982720	you can be on xbox one and play with people that are on a playstation 4 it's really not something
6982720	6988000	you've been able to do before and yes even i've cited the final fantasy 11 reference but the
6988000	6992000	interesting thing about final fantasy 11 even though that game you know if you forget you could
6992000	6998640	play that game on pc playstation 2 and xbox 360 you could play cross platform but you went through
6998640	7005120	a portal play online to be able to play the game so technically it was all those systems were
7005120	7008960	connecting to play online which then really managed the game you had a separate id through
7008960	7014640	play online and all this stuff so that's how 11 kind of worked and made that happen so now i'm
7014640	7018400	assuming with what we're talking about in this whole cross-platform thing we're not going to have
7018400	7023440	play online it's going to be a bit more of a direct communication although you know i assume
7023440	7028080	the companies would have their servers their play servers and that's what everything would be
7028080	7033200	connecting to but it'll be a lot more seamless than trust me 11 was kind of like like kind of
7033200	7036640	a pain in the ass every kind of cool like you know with destiny and stuff you're gonna have
7036640	7041360	all the destiny players together and all that type of things and you'd be cool like to see
7041360	7047520	leaderboards and you know i don't know i think it's it's definitely a good idea i just be interested
7047520	7050960	to see how they implement that well and this is something i've been saying xbox one's been needing
7050960	7055920	to do for a long time now i wonder if xbox one is going to get final fantasy 14 you know and some
7055920	7059760	of these some of these games that they've been kind of closed off to because of their policies
7059760	7065440	this that policy is the reason they didn't get um final fantasy 14 i'm telling plug in xbox one
7065440	7071040	into the pc version of uh 14 all the xbox controller stuff comes up so they were ready
7071040	7076080	to put that game on xbox one i'm sure so it'll be interesting to see maybe they do a the next
7076080	7081040	expansion will be available on xbox one i bet i bet that'll be a thing now that this has been
7081680	7087360	torn down we'll see uh trying to look at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
7087920	7093200	yyr says another announcement that they made that didn't make the headlines xbox one will now
7093200	7100800	support the mono game framework which is a new implementation of microsoft's own xna this actually
7100800	7107680	helps me out a lot this means multitasking for xbox one and playstation 4 will come out a lot
7107680	7113120	sooner that's pretty cool i did not realize that was another thing that they had announced
7113200	7116960	still waiting for that announcement where i can use an xbox one as a dev kit
7118320	7125040	that was promised before the xbox one launched well a lot changed before the xbox one actually
7125040	7130960	launched but so anyhow uh one game that has seen a lot of success at least on the playstation 4 i
7130960	7134640	don't think it's uh seen anything on the xbox one yet because i don't think it's out there but it's
7134640	7140240	on playstation 4 and pc is the independent game firewatch which i talked about on this show um
7140240	7144160	last month when it came out i actually did play the game from start to finish in a couple of
7144160	7149120	nights i thought the story was uh good enough to uh really make me curious what was going to happen
7149120	7153120	and it was also like short enough where i could kind of do that in just a couple play sessions
7153120	7160160	well apparently firewatch has been doing some very good business for um panic the uh publisher and
7160160	7168080	campo santo the developer uh by the end of the first month firewatch sold sold sold firewatch
7168080	7177440	sold half a million full price copies so that's pretty good um firewatch's budget which apparently
7177440	7183760	was made back was made back in one day so they made back the cost it took to make that game in
7183760	7188560	one day which actually doesn't surprise me too much because i would bet the majority of those
7188560	7193360	500 000 copies were sold in the first day if not the first week that is why there's always this
7193360	7197840	hype around release dates and so forth because you know you only have so much time when you're
7197840	7202000	right there front and center if your game doesn't land with a splash it can sometimes be very hard
7202000	7209200	to recover from that so um good good for them for firewatch um so yeah firewatch is a sales success
7209200	7215360	we're grateful and relieved but mostly grateful so uh awesome they are still dedicated to fixing
7215360	7218400	bugs and improving the performance across the board some people were complaining about
7218400	7222720	performance issues on playstation 4 which yeah there are some parts that skip around a little
7222720	7227920	bit it didn't really ruin it for me but i definitely noticed it um so but i thought
7227920	7234560	still the strength in that game was the story um so it's worth checking out so congrats i i love
7234560	7239840	indie successes like that so they'll be able to make whatever they want to make next awesome all
7239840	7245520	right let's move on dark sakura well um have you guys been keeping up with the stuff on me tomo
7245520	7251680	a little bit uh i'm curious like when it's gonna come out here already but i've been getting emails
7251680	7257840	on it from nintendo yeah about signing up for stuff about it so i'm probably gonna do it but
7257840	7265440	it's actually off to a really really good start in japan um it is right now the top free app on
7265440	7272960	the app store um and it's even crossed over line which um line is a big social media one over there
7272960	7278720	for you know contacting people and doing stuff um it has more than 1 million users right now
7279280	7284800	but it's going to be coming out um outside of japan we should have releases later on
7286320	7293680	in 15 major markets across north america western europe russia australia and new zealand uh
7293680	7301680	later on this month um so yeah and then there's supposed to be four other mobile games developed
7301680	7308160	by nintendo to be out by march 2017 so i think that's pretty cool i'm looking forward to to
7308160	7315120	giving it a go when it's out over here same i'm i'm curious to check it out i'm still not sure
7315920	7323440	what the game is but i'm i'm definitely me tomo isn't necessarily a game yeah it's i think a
7324480	7330400	platform to games yeah something like that so i mean social networking i'm just here's my thing
7330400	7333760	is it going to be one of those things where it's fun for a day and then i'm never going to really
7333760	7338800	look at it again i don't know i guess the way it's set up it sounds like it might might be like
7338800	7343440	an ask.fm type of thing where it's asking you it's asking you random questions and you're supposed
7343440	7347520	to answer it um i don't know if you'll have an anonymous ask box that's probably a dangerous
7347520	7351520	thing for nintendo but you know for the most part it kind of seems like it's that type of thing to
7351520	7356560	me um an act f in chat says it's like tomodachi life well i got to admit tomodachi life was fun
7356560	7362400	for a couple days and then it's kind of kind of over it you know all right um since we're on the
7362400	7369120	topic of mobile gaming did you get to see that brief video of pokemon go i actually thank you
7369120	7372960	for bringing it up because it didn't make our show somewhere else yes i did see the brief video that
7372960	7377440	was leaked from the south by southwest panel yeah i did i still don't know how the hell that game's
7377440	7381760	gonna play yeah it didn't really explain anything to that resort it's like you throw a pokeball at
7381760	7386320	a pokemon you might catch it it didn't really have battle in it which surprised me so my thought is
7386320	7391040	maybe you go out and catch the pokemon and then you battle but i mean we saw a leaked minute and
7391040	7396160	a half out of a panel it doesn't really tell us anything it's neat it's gonna put pressure on
7396160	7401040	the antique to put more official information out there though i think that's gonna be i mean it
7401040	7406000	looks okay i just i'm not a fan of pokemon so i don't know there was definitely something kind
7406000	7409040	of funky there when like they were actually capturing the pokemon like i don't know if it
7409040	7413280	was using the camera yeah it looked like it was yeah it kind of looked like an ar type of
7413280	7417680	projection on your cell phone screen so that was kind of neat so i'm curious to see what that all
7417680	7422560	looks like but uh it didn't really look like your typical pokemon game but you know you weren't
7422560	7429200	really supposed to go into it expecting that so we'll see all right uh moving on loki all right
7429200	7434000	so and you're back to talking about microsoft again um one of the things that they're trying
7434000	7442480	to do um apparently they want to add support for up to 64 player parties um for you know different
7442480	7448640	games like battlefield or mmo raids that type of thing because right now they're you know they
7448640	7453440	keep increasing it i guess it was you know originally you know eight and then you know 12
7453440	7459600	players now 16 they want to get it up to 64 because you know then that way you can do you
7459600	7464880	know 64 versus 64 and you know get all sorts of crazy you know battles and stuff going on with
7464880	7470480	that and that's according to i guess a comment made by mike gabara who's the head of programming
7470480	7480320	at xbox um that'd be cool i mean definitely i outside of like doing those massive battles
7480320	7485360	and stuff i don't know why you'd want to party that big i mean that god i just remember like
7485360	7491360	party chat on xbox with like eight people and it's just you know a lot of noise but it'd be
7491360	7496560	pretty cool if you could like you know arrange more social things that way i'd even sell for
7496560	7503200	that for like you know playstation 4 as well i mean that would be pretty cool um yeah i the
7503200	7508000	bigger game parties that would be fun it would be uh tricky to manage and of course some people you
7508000	7513040	know are gonna fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck the kids but if you have any future friends i mean you know
7513040	7517040	whatever yeah friends that'd be fun i mean because that would open it up not that we have you know
7517040	7522160	that many people that would want to do this but we could do something fun after olr and probably
7522160	7525920	everybody who would want to come could come well like i think it'd be cool to like set up something
7525920	7529680	like a social thing where you have almost like a dm or something that's controlling like if you
7529680	7534160	want to set up tournaments i mean we're like just thinking like platform independent here for a
7534160	7539920	second like say say i wanted to do like a kart racing game or something like that like mario kart
7539920	7544400	on you know party system like this i could set up okay you know here's all the people we're gonna
7544400	7549280	have okay you're gonna be in this seed we're gonna put these players in this race and go and these
7549280	7552880	eight players are gonna race and then everybody else that's not playing we get to watch them and
7552880	7559120	then kind of do it like you know set up you know more complicated you know gameplay options you
7559120	7562800	know that'd be kind of cool if you could do something like that or even like you know
7564080	7568960	you know like turn-based things like if you could do an x you know on minecraft on one of those
7568960	7574000	platforms you know how they have all the different modded games and stuff on pc like hunger games
7574000	7578960	or sky uh sky wars or something like that where you can set up okay we're gonna have you know
7578960	7583680	these eight players go and then the next tier is gonna go and just set up like almost like a
7583680	7589600	bracket tournament type thing would be kind of fun um and broadcast it all to twitch or something
7589600	7593840	you could use that to play or you could use that to play jackbox games i bet well actually
7593840	7597760	the phone thing a lot of those games support tons and tons of players um i was gonna say
7597760	7603440	ubisoft's the werewolf game 64 players where you can't see there are you the werewolf no are you
7603440	7608880	the world no are you the world no are you the world no are you the world no uh we'll
7608880	7613520	give murder face and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says it's also often a shit show
7613520	7618160	having played in a 32 player party it often turns to a train wreck especially in first-person
7618160	7624000	shooters all right uh let's move on to this story and then we'll get to our mailbag for this week
7624000	7631760	uh gdc was not without its controversy uh microsoft had an after party one night and uh they
7631760	7638000	kind of did that typical frat party scene you would see where there were some booth babes that
7638000	7642320	were there dancing uh there's actually some pictures that made it onto twitter where you've
7642320	7647360	got these ladies that are dancing and it honestly looks like she's wearing nothing but a bra on the
7647360	7652240	top or at least that's what it looks like and then kind of like one of those uh skirts and things um
7652240	7658320	and you know wearing proper schoolgirl attire i don't know about proper school if you're britney
7658320	7664240	spears if you're britney spears exactly 15 years she was in a school dress like that am i to believe
7664240	7671040	that that is an act an inaccurate depiction of what kids wear nowadays so here's the thing with
7671040	7677280	that is that you know obviously because the game uh industry has had a reputation of being a bit
7677280	7683040	of a frat house they're trying to welcome more diversity especially women but some of the women
7683040	7688000	that attended this party were kind of turned off by this going uh in fact there's one tweet out
7688000	7692240	there uh saying this is how the games industry excludes women by pretending we don't exist and
7692240	7698800	having dev parties with strippers um anyhow i to microsoft's credit as unfortunate as the
7698800	7706800	circumstance was to microsoft's credit uh swiftly did phil spencer uh from xbox respond to this uh
7706800	7711040	like an email went out to everybody at microsoft and of course it leaked out uh phil spencer
7711040	7716240	replied to this um in the next morning basically saying that the party represented xbox and
7716240	7720720	microsoft in a way that was not consistent or aligned to our values and then went on and called
7720720	7725520	it unequivocally wrong yeah i don't know if they're the one like it could have been the venue
7725520	7729840	that did that because they have like you know dancers and stuff that go along with the dj but
7729840	7736880	yes either way it's not appropriate for a business dev party a party planner somewhere along the line
7736880	7742320	got fired but i wonder you you bring an interesting insight is that what if maybe they told the
7742320	7747680	nightclub they wanted to do this party and the nightclub was like oh yeah we know gamers yeah
7747680	7751760	sure wink wink well i don't even think it was necessarily that it's like this is what we this
7751760	7756480	is our setup you know we have dancers we have the dj you know that type of thing but then again it's
7756480	7761840	it doesn't matter though because you as the party the hosts of the party you know the the company
7761840	7766080	is doing you need to be on top of what they're doing we're not excusing it we're just saying
7766080	7771360	like that's probably how it happened but it just goes to show that yeah i don't think hey can we
7771360	7776480	get people that are scantily clad in like school girl outfits that are sexy and can we have them
7776480	7782080	that's going to totally you know make our women developers feel invited or anybody else that's
7782080	7786880	you know it's totally not going to be awkward you know discussing business while there's like
7786880	7793760	you know some lady dancing in there i mean yeah so it was a horrible miscommunication on the way and
7793760	7798400	unfortunately pers and i've said this a million times on the show perception is everything
7798400	7804320	and when you have britney spears esque ladies dancing and nothing against those ladies they're
7804320	7809520	very good looking ladies and they're just making money uh that they're working and so forth but um
7809520	7815680	perception is you know when you have that it's no matter who planned it or how it turned out
7815680	7820960	it looks like microsoft is still in the dark ages when it comes to you know what the gaming
7820960	7824960	industry should be um but good on them for applying to it at least real quick and letting
7824960	7829600	them know letting everybody know they were taking it seriously so all right uh let's get to the mail
7829600	7835520	bag we're gonna do it uh participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place where you can send
7835520	7842480	us emails every that's not the mailbag song i mean i guess it could be how about this one all right
7842480	7847680	uh every week dark soccer dives in the mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com and reads
7847680	7857920	a few emails for us here on the program the first one comes from azhp hi olr crew azhp here as always
7857920	7862000	i loved your show and listen to every episode this week's show glossed over some other important
7862000	7867280	details regarding the clico chameleon that i feel excuse me that i feel would put the situation a
7867280	7873040	more clear light for your listeners i feel like it's important to lay out the findings of the
7873040	7877440	people investigating the console as quite a bit of the incredible detective work was done by the
7877440	7884240	internet at large the clico chameleon that appeared at toy fair was scrutinized by people following
7884240	7890480	the event and the images of the back of the machine and the controllers were used highly
7890480	7896480	suggested that the clico chameleon on the show floor was simply a snus junior inside a hollowed
7896480	7902400	out jaguar shell at this point one could give them the benefit of the doubt perhaps it was a
7902400	7908080	conceptual mock-up of what they hoped to achieve with the system however the actions taken after
7908080	7913200	this were bewildering the console creators posted a photo on their facebook page of what appeared
7913200	7919200	to be the circuit board inside of a clear jaguar shell claiming that the accusations of a snus
7919200	7924480	junior inside of jaguar were false and that this is what was running inside the chameleon at toy
7924480	7929760	fair instead of placating the naysayers though this photo was with alarming speed compared to
7929760	7935840	a pc dvr capture card circuit board which appeared to be chip for chip match with the alleged chameleon
7935840	7942080	prototype once that comparison was posted in the facebook photos comments the picture was taken
7942080	7949440	down nearly instantly sorry my voice is not happy today the chameleon creators then insisted that
7949440	7954960	everything would be cleared up on their kickstarter page when the kickstarter launched in early march
7955920	7960560	it's important to note that kickstarter requires any hardware manufacturer to have a working
7960560	7967040	prototype before allowing a kickstarter page to be creative created it makes it a little easier
7967040	7973280	to understand why a company might try to publicly fabricate evidence of a prototype doesn't it
7973280	7979520	however the promised kickstarter date came and went with no activity at this point the company
7979520	7984400	that held the rights to the clico name announced that they did not know what was going on and
7984400	7988960	announced that they had contracted a team of independent engineers to verify whether or not
7988960	7994720	the chameleon prototype existed they gave the engineers a seven-day deadline to report their
7994720	7999120	findings as it turns out they didn't need the engineers at all the chameleon developers announced
7999120	8004000	they didn't have anything workable and that's when clico decided to part ways with them sorry for the
8004000	8009120	long email i just wanted people to recognize the detective work being done by the internet at large
8009120	8012880	to protect consumers from putting down money on a potentially illegitimate kickstarter
8013600	8019840	could the chameleon have really existed yes but considering the way in which things were handled
8019840	8024560	it makes developers look it makes the developers look very suspicious and i feel like that
8024560	8030400	information needs to be shared as it's a bit disingenuous to give the listeners a vague
8030400	8035520	benefit of the doubt explanation without also reporting on the findings that led to to the
8035520	8040560	clico holding company parting ways with the chameleon developers i understand not wanting to
8040560	8045680	to saber rattle without solid definitive proof but at the time there was an overwhelming amount
8045680	8051120	of crowd-sourced evidence uh which convinced the console publisher to back out of a deal
8051120	8055600	that's got to count for something right you're truly azhp well i'll just be honest i wasn't
8055600	8060080	following the kickstarter i have a clique of vision that's all the clico i need that and
8060080	8065840	cabbage patch kids bingo and i just want to make make sure it's clear i did not go light on this
8065840	8070080	just because you know some people associated with this have been on the show before that would not
8070080	8076800	be okay um so i just want to make clear that is not a the reason why i explained the story like
8076800	8082720	i did last week what i wanted to make sure was that if i was going to talk about it that i
8082720	8088880	knew with confidence the facts and to be perfectly honest with so much news that happens every week
8088880	8093920	and you know the fact that we all hold day jobs and so forth i actually wasn't aware of some of
8093920	8097680	the things that you pointed out in that email like the facebook post and all that that was i
8097680	8101040	mean i knew about the show and the shell and all that stuff i didn't know about the facebook and
8101040	8104320	some of that other stuff you kind of tied some things together there um so thank you for the
8104320	8109520	email um and so i guess that's that there you go now our listeners have an idea what happened
8109520	8114720	the problem was from the gecko they were trying to launch the kickstarter because like that we
8114720	8120800	had without a prototype unfortunately here last week because my stupid kids have to get sick okay
8120800	8126560	it's it's all their damn fault it's it's actually it's the fault of some other parent last week
8126640	8131680	exactly well it's the other you know and i've watched i am fully into what's going on here so
8132240	8136720	yeah it's basically they're they're they bitched from it in the beginning you know they're oh well
8136720	8141760	it's not fair we all got to do it but we didn't yeah oh yeah that really worked out um but so
8141760	8145680	they're they basically needed the money to create a prototype and they didn't have that money so they
8145680	8151760	try to fake it to be able to meet that criteria in order to launch their crowdfunding could it
8151760	8156320	have worked out well maybe could have not worked out well possibly who knows but
8156320	8160800	you know it's it's a hard sell i mean especially when you have you know it's not
8162160	8166720	is this gonna actually come to fruition probably not anymore because people don't trust them i
8166720	8171360	mean why would why would they even attempt it anymore because there's no way no one's gonna
8171360	8177280	trust you anymore you're not gonna get the calico name who's gonna who's gonna even put money
8177280	8182320	against us i mean i don't think anyone is well um my offer from last week still stands if anybody
8182320	8186400	from the organization would like to come on the show and talk about what's going on i promise
8186400	8192880	respect and um non-sensationalism we'll have an honest conversation and um you can
8194000	8198960	discuss some of these questions folks have in our chat room and so forth uh um head on and
8198960	8204080	hopefully we can get to the bottom of how this happened so and and help gain maybe some of that
8204080	8213840	trust back so anyhow um i i don't know what else to say next you know yes kind of what cabbage
8213840	8220880	another cabbage patch kid now what because they clica made them oh it's like what kind of random
8220880	8227040	tangent ass thing is oh okay yeah i got it got it okay hello loki dark sakura and sky i really
8227040	8232160	wanted to give a quick shout out to a game i've played recently that really blew me away life is
8232160	8237680	strange despite getting a lot of awards i feel like more people should play this life is strange
8237680	8243680	is an episodic telltale-esque adventure game you play as maxine a young woman who one day finds out
8243680	8249040	she has the power to reverse time crazy things start happening around her people start disappearing
8249040	8255440	and she tries to make sense of it all your actions impact the game in sorry impact the events in the
8255440	8260560	game just like in the telltale games but with an interesting quirk you can reverse time and change
8260560	8265280	your mind if you didn't like the outcome this leads to some very interesting choices and you
8265280	8273200	soon find out that no choice is 100 good or bad the story got a has let me start over the story
8273200	8278560	has got a twin peaks vibe to it murder mystery meets teenage drama it just gripped my throat and
8278560	8284240	didn't let go until i saw the credits it deals with some very deep emotional topics i almost cried
8284240	8290400	and you will and you will have to make some tough choices the cel-shaded art style is beautiful is
8290400	8295840	just beautiful the voice acting is really great and it makes you really care about the characters
8295840	8300480	the soundtrack is incredible with the acoustic songs perfectly complementing intense parts of
8300480	8307120	the story i highly recommend it if you like a good narrative the story is one of the best i
8307120	8312560	have played a long time you won't regret it as always keep up the great show martin from belgian
8313360	8317600	honestly i i know this game has been getting a lot of kudos and it's one of those things like
8317600	8322080	on my list of games to play and i'll get to it just like i finally got to undertale although
8322080	8326320	i need to play more undertale i didn't really play enough of it so uh i definitely check out life is
8326320	8330320	strange i do have episode one because i came in one of those i think square enix did a humble
8330320	8334560	bundle not that long ago and i got episode one through that so um i definitely at least at least
8334560	8338960	want to give it that fair shot there so i was gonna say to go back to what we're talking about
8338960	8344160	the calico chameleon and everything there is one uh portable uh handheld system that they just
8344160	8350160	went through uh crowdfunding and they actually have a finished device it's the cinclair zx
8350160	8357600	spectrum vega plus it's a handheld um sink was a zx spectrum like the spectrum for the british
8357600	8365040	computer yes like the most part and it's actually being done by you know mr cinclair that is awesome
8365040	8368880	give me a commodore 64 one of those actually well they did they did have that commodore computer
8368880	8377440	a few years ago i will say i like how it sounds better in europe the zx no seriously because i
8377440	8382400	finally heard it i was like oh yeah that makes sense because it said nazi yeah they've got it
8382400	8387520	on indiegogo right now it's already met it's it's like 300 of its funding right now and you
8387520	8394400	can actually pick up one for 100 pounds see we didn't have that over here at all so yeah it's
8394400	8399360	got that same it's got the lcd screen at the actual original resolution and everything it's
8399360	8404080	like pretty awesome and i don't know so that's something to actually you know get behind if
8404080	8408880	you're interested in the you know the cinclair now i know the commodore 64 was huge over there
8408880	8415360	as well but it that at least we had that here so you know i have many fond memories of that but
8415360	8422240	anyway all right last email yes hello lr last week you asked folks where they get their gaming news
8423040	8427600	i was pretty surprised that nobody mentioned neo gaff neo gaff.com is currently the largest
8427600	8432720	dedicated internet message board about video games at least as far as i know it has grown into
8432720	8438400	a community with over 160 000 members many of whom are actually working in the industry in some
8438400	8444000	capacity in fact other news sites regularly list neo gaff as a source for their information
8444560	8448400	if you simply go to page one and look at forum topics you are already looking
8449200	8455600	at most of the day's headlines the rest are probably on page two opinions run the gamut
8455600	8461040	but most folks there seem capable of mature conversation those that aren't those that
8461040	8467200	aren't are swiftly banned and while creating an account there involves a long waiting period
8467200	8473760	and probably supporting a junior tag for several months there's no need to even bother with that
8473760	8478720	if you're merely interested in browsing best of all there are no videos no pop-up advertisements
8478720	8485200	and no image heavy threads unless they are tagged as such and it's the only place besides olr that
8485200	8492800	i am aware that i'm aware of where they regularly discuss frog fractions too neo gaff is quickly
8492800	8499280	becoming my primary news source other than olr i also go to polygon.com but already they don't seem
8499280	8503920	like what they used to be which is interesting considering they have they haven't been around
8503920	8510160	for four years yet but i digress keep on using and boozing erin yyr i mean i'm not one to you know
8510160	8515840	promote filing a lawsuit against the guy that created frog fractions two just so that there's
8515840	8520240	some sort of evidence to where we can find out where frog fractions two actually is you know
8520240	8523840	and you just say oh hey it's a sham you know never really created the game that way he has
8523840	8528880	to provide evidence to where the hell the actual game is so we can play it but i mean i think we're
8528880	8532400	almost at that point loki you may already be playing it and you just don't know that it's
8532400	8536400	frog fractions too well i'm glad i didn't put any money towards that because that's ridiculous
8537360	8545520	um really it's actually been uh uh bought by konami and released as a frogger frag fracking
8546080	8550240	and it's a patchy slot game i thought i saw on twitter some stickers i don't know if they were
8550240	8556720	legit or not but i saw some stuff out of um gdc and it said frog fractions three and it was written
8556720	8562000	like final fantasy 3 and then there was another one that said frog fraction six and it was written
8562000	8566400	like final fantasy 3's japanese logo and i think it actually said something like frog fractions
8566400	8575520	three six in japan and i was like if that is official fucking brilliant but you don't get
8575520	8580320	you don't get to kickstart three until two is definitively answered that's the thing anyway
8580320	8585920	the emailer did not email to talk about frog fractions two but that's what happened uh they
8585920	8591200	wanted to talk about neo gaff and neo gaff is a news source um yeah i know a lot of uh websites
8591200	8594720	actually will source neo gaff for their news sources because there are some industry people
8594720	8600080	that use it and we'll kind of post there under the guise of anonymity uh i'm still a little wary
8600080	8604640	with the whole forum and especially the reason like it seems very arbitrary kind of who they
8604640	8608880	let on there and who they don't i don't know like there's there's just a lot of weird missing pieces
8608880	8613680	of the puzzle for neo gaff for me but that's just me personally as long as y'all ain't hurting
8613680	8619360	anybody whatever i'm all for discussion i just kind of wish they'd be a little more inviting
8619360	8623760	but i suppose that's how they keep a lot of shit posts off there and and spam and so forth so
8623760	8631040	i and on that end of things i kind of get it so all right um and bobby blackwolf says frog fractions
8631040	8636080	two is an arg it's been going on for a while there is no video game yeah and i remember a story that
8636080	8640800	came up on the show not that long ago they kind of talked about the argms of it so i i still feel
8640800	8645200	like at least there's going to be a flash game or something that you get at the end i don't know
8646000	8650880	uh and sho 100 matt in chat says uh i just feel that they're grasping at straws for rumors if
8650880	8656240	they're referencing neo gaff and yyr in response to the talk about frog fractions three says
8656240	8662720	that was mentioned on neo gaff this week well there you go all right that was it for emails
8663360	8670080	participate at orange on twitter.com i was about to say yes we can say it again
8670880	8678720	yes yes queen dark soccer you have not been able to yet on this episode talk about your new
8678720	8682960	addiction do you want to quickly share with us because this is cross-promotion for my podcast
8682960	8690960	of mine my big addiction right now is watching raja and raven do tutor boot they are drag queens
8690960	8699520	by the way if you i love drag queens so much um and i have very minorly contributed to the career
8700080	8707680	of the drag queen two years ago by letting her buy the pantone emerald studded lashes instead
8707680	8714400	of me buying them well dark sakura um this is a good part for me to say that when you watch the
8714400	8719840	next episode of drag race you should come on reading is fundamental that's the podcast about
8719840	8725680	everything drag race that i do with captain spike and slide kick from game buoy as well as delvin
8725680	8731520	from video game realness which came back from the dead this week so um check that out rafpodcast.com
8731520	8737520	i have to get it is not about video games period no i have to i i'm gonna i have to still finish
8737520	8741520	watching the first episode of season eight because i mean i'm probably gonna go back and watch just
8741520	8749840	season four i think because latrice yeah um but um i've been watching all of the stuff on what's
8749840	8754800	the what's the um channel it's like wow world of wonder yeah it's like it's rupaul's production
8754800	8760400	company basically yeah but um i've really also enjoyed uh i've just enjoyed the content though
8760400	8768560	in particular on that particular uh uh channel because they also um like i like the ones where
8768560	8775040	they respond to bad comments made about them but my favorite one was for uh national coming out day
8775040	8780080	everyone talking about their first time and i thought that that was it was a very personal
8780080	8786800	thing to share but i think that it was very very good you need to see season four because that's
8786800	8791360	the one where i was on the reunion in a deleted scene that only aired overseas and i guess is on
8791360	8797600	the dvd but i'm in it no yeah remember that was that was a big thing yeah i was in it yeah i met
8797600	8804240	latrice and uh that's cool so the other i interviewed tatiana once yeah and then um uh season
8804240	8808880	seven you need to see for trixie mitel because she's fabulous she was she was a gamer x and i
8808880	8813600	think you think you met her and you had no clue who she was and because she came up to the table
8813600	8819760	and i feel like you were there um i well i was also kind of sleep deprived in in my poor costume
8819760	8825040	and then you need to see season eight for kim chi who's a nerd oh see that's why i started watching
8825040	8831920	because i like kimchi and dax exclamation point who's also a nerd she does a wonderful storm so
8831920	8838080	that's right she's wearing the outfit walking in but the other one i liked was um the the one from
8838080	8843840	shreveport oh chi chi divain chi chi divain all right we got to be careful it's not a drag queen
8843840	8848160	show it's a video game show but you know what i'm already in love though it is such good tv y'all
8849200	8854400	rob rob can i can i be adopted by a drag queen i but wouldn't that i don't know any
8855040	8861040	if i but if i get adopted by a drag queen then i'd have to be a faux queen i i could do it talk
8861040	8865600	to you know what you need to talk to is victoria she's the biggest i know all right uh let's get
8865600	8870480	to the fus of the week where dark sakura can complain and uh bitch about how she's not a drag
8870480	8881920	queen

8894400	8901600	and it's not going away um and also this weird throat thing i'm having going on but i think it's

9009920	9014160	like a ton they give me a ton of ibuprofen for that like way more than anybody needed
9014160	9021360	like enough to kill a horse let's be real all right or at least a liver yes all right uh let's
9021360	9025840	move on we got a couple more news stories for you guys and then we are going to get to uh the
9025840	9034080	skype line at 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio uh but first loki all right
9034080	9039600	so there's some details about uh telltale's batman game that's gonna be coming out this summer
9040800	9048720	you know basically basically saying it's a fresh interpretation of the universe set in modern time
9048720	9054400	it's not gonna be based off any existing you know batman games films or comics and you know focus
9054400	9062400	on bruce and batman and not like the rest of the side characters of course alfred and vicki vale
9063360	9070000	uh james gordon and renee montoya will be in it and says certain characters will have a deeply
9070000	9075360	personal relationship with bruce in his private life and decisions made as bruce or batman will
9075360	9083920	affect their paths towards corruption or redemption and yeah and they were taking a non-photorealistic
9083920	9091120	interpretation of the universe so i'm imagining kind of like um i don't know kind of like uh
9091120	9098560	was it the what was that one the wolf what was their game the wolf among us wolf among us yes
9098560	9101680	thank you that i think like an art style like that actually you know to be honest a lot of
9101680	9106000	their games have that kind of same art style so yeah imagine it's gonna be similar to that so
9107440	9112560	cool i'm looking forward to it i like some batman and they said also it's gonna have a mature rating
9112560	9119600	and it's gonna feel like an r-rated film all right well um i have some sad news to kind of
9119600	9124000	end on tonight unfortunately we had some passings in the gaming industry this week but uh you know
9124000	9130640	it would not be cool if i didn't uh acknowledge um their them and their lives and tip our hats
9130640	9137760	a little bit to remember akira tago who is the brains behind professor latin in the puzzle design
9137920	9144560	unfortunately passed away at the age of 90 due to pneumonia but not 90 that's a good run that's a
9144560	9152000	good run so uh you know um remembering akira tago this week uh who passed away uh in creating the
9152000	9158720	puzzles in professor latin but 90 years old that's that's amazing um also this week however we lost
9158720	9166080	eric madow um who was killed in a windstorm on sunday so unfortunately um not at 90 years old
9166080	9171040	madow was taking one of his daughters for a drive and the vehicle was hit by a falling tree
9171040	9177360	the daughter did survive but unfortunately eric madow did pass away eric madow is the pokemon
9177360	9182880	company international creative design director and he had worked on several games in the pokemon
9182880	9189680	series uh including omega ruby and alpha sapphire x and y black and white versions 2 conquest i
9189680	9195520	mean the guy did a lot for the various pokemon games and unfortunately that is a very tragic
9195520	9201200	event that happened there so uh just remembering um those guys and tipping our hats to the legacy
9201200	9207200	they leave behind in gaming so acknowledgement um okay anyhow let's try to change the subject
9207200	9213600	back on to the week in gaming we do want to open up the skype line for you guys 1877 game olr
9213600	9219600	or our username on skype orange lounge radio all one word so the skype line is open if you'd like
9219600	9223680	to go ahead and give us a call in the meantime loki i was going to check in and see if you had
9223680	9228320	any last minute news yeah there's um the xbox they're talking to or they're actively looking
9228320	9234080	into um bringing back some of those digital sharing options so you know they basically
9234080	9240720	saying you know hey the steam family plan has you know a good um setup which be honest i've never
9240720	9244720	actually used that even though we do have that available um i don't has anybody actually used
9244720	9250560	the steam family sharing yet anyway i i did it first and then like uh when it was like first in
9250560	9254960	beta and then i tried to use it with alan like a month ago we couldn't find it we couldn't use it
9255680	9260640	like and i was like did they disable it at some point my thought was i was running the beta at
9260640	9268000	the time so maybe you can't be using that maybe i had undertale would not work while i was in the
9268000	9272560	beta so i had to drop out of the beta and then undertale would work where it was really weird
9272560	9277360	okay yeah so that's something that they're looking into so all all sorts of good news coming out of
9277360	9283200	the microsoft camp all right well let's get to it our our phones are ringing so let's get to it
9283200	9287840	hello you're on orange launch radio who's this hey uh this is reginator hey reginator what's on
9287840	9292640	your mind buddy i'm not a whole lot i gotta keep this short and sweet because i got a house guest
9292640	9299920	right now but uh okay uh yeah i was just wondering uh totally random uh uh tangent from what's been
9299920	9308320	talked on the show tonight but uh i know that for the longest time uh vog has had a steam group but
9308960	9316000	you know really nothing has been done with the group you know aside from now being a collect
9316000	9322400	you know way of connecting with other vog members uh if have you and uh bobby considered doing
9322400	9328560	anything more with the group or no sure it's just it's honestly honestly spazzing here the best
9328640	9333760	answer i have for that is that it's it's a big it's it's mostly a time thing um just because you
9333760	9338720	know i would love to be able to say oh hey every thursday night we're gonna meet on steam and play
9338720	9344000	x game but the reality is um that's the night i tape one of my podcasts and then i tape another
9344000	9348640	one of my podcasts on mondays or tuesdays you know so it's like i kind of you know i'm busy in that
9348640	9353840	regard so it's hard to me to kind of commit to something regular um but i would really encourage
9353840	9357520	you know if some of you guys that are really enthusiastic about steam kind of want to pick
9357520	9361760	up the torch and run with it um if it's a game i own like i saw you guys talking about rocket
9361760	9366160	league earlier and if i didn't have to be up at 5 30 tomorrow i probably would join you guys but
9366160	9371440	maybe next week after the show i would totally be down with playing some rocket league so um yeah i
9371440	9376080	like i i think if you guys want to get together and try to plan some game sessions i would love
9376080	9381840	that and i'll try to enjoy where i can just unfortunately setting it up myself um when i'm
9381840	9389680	doing three podcasts right now is a bit difficult so yeah i can't imagine that and uh now just as
9389680	9394640	uh just off the record well since this is being recorded i guess it's on the record
9396560	9402480	it's okay one of the better shows that you guys had aside from the night that you had the devafit
9403600	9409520	the night that we had what the uh aside from the night that you had the devafit
9409520	9415680	oh the oh the night i had the devafit oh yes i remember yeah yeah all right but uh great show
9415680	9422080	so thank you i my i i even just saw a tweet uh act f had written a tweet that said something to the
9422080	9426160	effect of i feel bad if you're not listening to olr it's one of the most hilarious episodes in
9426160	9431200	a while hey julian did a great job sometimes it takes a kid to tell you how it is because kids
9431200	9434400	they're gonna tell you they they don't have a filter they're gonna tell you how it is
9434480	9437200	that's why i like it's why i liked having julian on the show
9438080	9442720	hey well uh i want to go out there where you can uh fit in some more calls but uh
9443280	9447680	thanks for having me on you're welcome tonight all right and hello to your mystery guest i see
9447680	9455280	you in there all right take care yeah you too it's somebody else just kind of walking around in the
9455280	9460720	background all right uh probably has no idea that he's on an internet show right now all right let's
9460960	9465120	go to another call we've uh got the skyline lighting up hello you're on orange on radio
9465120	9473200	who's this uh i forgot my name you forgot no actually it's aaron hey it's aaron also known
9473200	9481680	as yyr what's up buddy uh well uh i'm still uh i'm feeling a little overwhelmed really after
9481680	9487600	seeing that i was greenlit honestly i don't think i know what day it happened i uh i went back a few
9487600	9494640	days later and checked and there it was so so they didn't even email you huh they didn't email
9494640	9500240	you or anything to tell you that that happened no no it's really strange um the page says you know
9500240	9507040	valve has reached out to this developer no they didn't i didn't get an email or anything i uh i
9507040	9511600	had to go to the page and find it unless it got sent to spam or something yeah check that out
9511600	9515920	because they may be waiting on you for something so i think i noticed it on friday because i've
9516000	9520640	been playing danganronpa and was going back to look over stuff inside i only saw it because
9520640	9526320	your tweet well that's when i saw it i saw it on friday but uh yes actually they are waiting on
9526320	9532560	a number of things um first of all uh you know i have to fill out a few things i have to sign an nda
9533360	9540000	and then uh basically they're going to give me access to the steamworks sdk um and then you know
9540000	9545440	that's when i'll be able to start adding steam specific features like leaderboards achievements
9545520	9549280	you know all the good stuff oh yeah you're not gonna have so much fun designing achievements
9549280	9553120	for this game you're not gonna have to worry about integrating it through your website anymore like
9553120	9560160	you had to do with your um xbox 360 arcade games yes that's correct no more typing in codes but
9560160	9565360	then at the same time now you have to learn about how are people going to try to exploit it and put
9565360	9571840	fake scores up there so look out is that actually happening with other steam games i just figure in
9571840	9576160	games in general it's happening somewhere you see fake scores everywhere but steam
9576160	9580640	i don't know i'd have to open that up to the listeners i'm not sure well i'd like to think
9580640	9585040	that maybe we have some sort of control over it like if we see a number one score that's
9585040	9589680	very obviously fake it would be nice if we could just kind of go click okay gone yeah
9591680	9596720	uh kaijuto in chat says do something crazy and don't add achievements start the anti-achievement
9596720	9602480	moment no but i love chi me too kaijuto is wrong i'm sorry it's a show where every gamer has a
9602480	9610000	voice but that voice is wrong i'm just giving him a hard time i love achievements too and i
9610000	9614960	think for a game like multitasking they could work i'm actually going to design i'm gonna
9614960	9620000	it's going to be one of those games where you know the game there's there's modes that gives you uh
9620000	9623920	things to do and there are challenges that give you things to do but the achievements are going
9623920	9628800	to give you other things to do that aren't you know spelled out by the modes like they're going
9628800	9633680	to have you trying crazy things that you wouldn't otherwise try that's what i'm going to set out to
9633680	9639120	do with those well but just make sure you have a couple gimmes so i can i can get them they'll be
9639120	9646320	easy ones too okay good good well everyone ought to be able to get congratulations again on making
9646320	9651440	green light we're excited to hear about your progress um anything else you want to act def
9651440	9659680	says make an achievement based on kaijuto well i don't know maybe you have to go into the olr
9659680	9668720	chat and hate on xbox a certain number of times maybe what you do if you plug and unplug an xbox
9668720	9673360	controller so many times you get that achievement you get occasionally all right that's a really
9673360	9678720	good idea hey look at that how do you like that all right oh my god that's gonna be great really
9678720	9685120	funny no maybe that'll be a secret one all right just all i ask is one olr reference
9685120	9689600	somewhere there's one olr reference somewhere in there i'd be eternally grateful you know what
9689600	9694800	that's a fantastic idea and i will do that too all right thank you very much all right uh anything
9694800	9702160	else on your mind tonight why we are um if you have played ori in the blind forest the definitive
9702160	9708080	edition should be the easiest five dollar purchase you should ever decide on it's only five bucks
9709040	9714960	yeah the if you own the original game oh the upgrade is five dollars okay if you don't own
9714960	9719440	the original game it includes the original game and it's twenty dollars and it's still worth it
9719440	9723680	um and what does the new one have i have played ori in the blind forest it's great what does the
9723680	9730880	new one have well the bad news is um you can't move your save over and continue and you know
9730880	9736480	explore the rest of the world that you didn't see you do have to start over and cry your eyes out
9736480	9743520	after watching the prologue in the first five minutes again but um the good news is the new
9743520	9747440	stuff you don't have to wait till the end of the game to see it it's kind of spread all throughout
9747440	9752720	the game uh they added an easy difficulty for wimps they added a hard one for the tough guys
9752720	9758240	and they also added a one life difficulty which you know you can't cheat it by quitting the game
9758240	9765040	quickly there's there's a trick like if you take the xbox offline and copy down the save you know
9765040	9770880	before it sinks with the cloud then you might be able to continue but probably not like it
9770880	9776240	it's really actually one life mode so that's dangerous but they also added an entirely new
9776240	9782480	area a couple of new abilities to the skill tree and uh just some other new surprises and secrets
9782480	9788880	so it's and new music and it's absolutely worth playing again well i'm gonna have to check that
9788880	9793120	out all right thank you for the tip all right while we are best of luck in development keep us
9793120	9797680	posted on progress and multitasking but for now i'm gonna let you go absolutely keep doing what
9797680	9802400	you guys are doing and any news i have i will announce it here first all right appreciate that
9802400	9808800	exclusives take care of my friend have a great week you too bye bye 1877 game olr or username
9808800	9813280	on skype orange lounge radio all one word we'll see if we can squeeze in one more call here before
9813280	9820720	the end um loki any other last minute stories no no all right well thankfully we do have another
9820720	9825280	call coming in so we can at least get to that uh hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
9825280	9831360	hey there's a deaf hey act deaf what's on your mind buddy um well pokin mostly yeah you've been
9831360	9836560	playing too what do you think actually i haven't played it yet because i haven't gotten my copy
9837360	9846960	uh i'm waiting for uh at least tuesday to get my copy but yeah um uh i mostly have a rant about
9847040	9854880	pokin go for it what's up you know well the the character selection isn't that fast but it's okay
9856080	9864640	but it's missing like a really core really really important pokemon of the uh of at least the
9864640	9870400	recent generation i know jigglypuff what's up with that like where no no no no not not jigglypuff
9870400	9879600	what the fuck jigglypups already is mashed so leave her there i love how actually offended
9879600	9883840	you were by the fact that i suggested the jigglypuff all right who's missing act f
9884480	9889680	hallelujah oh i've heard you're not the first person i've heard say this
9890640	9898320	yeah it's it's like oh my god it's since pokin was announced i was thinking oh my god hallelujah
9898320	9905120	is gonna be perfect for this it's a lucha door pokemon like like it's like a perfect match
9905680	9911840	yes but where the fuck is the lucha and somewhere to be to be found instead you got lucha pikachu
9912560	9920720	which is which is i don't mind lucha uh it's what's the name pikachu pikachu libre yeah pikachu
9920720	9928080	libre that's it yeah yeah yeah i don't mind being him and pokin like it's yeah it's also like uh
9928080	9938640	given but we have an actual luchador pokemon that that's pretty much uh uh uh it's a luchador it's
9938640	9946160	it's obvious that he should uh should have been in pokin and and really it's like idiotic that
9946720	9953600	and no i don't know if uh fanamco or pokemon company made the decisions in the roster but
9954560	9960640	it it was like a given even not even for a support pokemon which is also like really what the fuck
9961440	9967440	here's the good news for what it's worth act f i really feel like a lot of this game is kind of
9967440	9973840	set up to prove a concept perhaps and i think the sequel is likely to get a lot more of what i think
9973840	9978640	if this game gets a sequel the sequel will probably deliver on a lot of what people want
9978640	9983520	and it'll probably be an expanded roster of characters um probably a little more like some
9983520	9988720	more modes that you can do with single player that aren't just you know a pretty boring story and uh
9988720	9992960	uh one-on-one play like i kind of feel like they might start to round some of that stuff
9992960	10000640	out a little bit um so maybe maybe you'll see that happen in pokin too but for now
10000640	10004720	you know it's it's more of a arcade game that's made its way home i suppose
10005680	10012640	well that's true uh and aside from that i really don't have anything against the game and i and i
10013360	10017520	what up from what i'm seeing everyone is most is mostly like in the game
10018240	10025520	it it seems like it's gonna be a really really great uh uh fighting game for competition
10025520	10030080	tournament so i'm hearing there's people that were playing street fighter 5 that have left to
10030160	10037840	play pokin like it's that much of a game changer yeah one of the top players who is uh i think
10037840	10046320	justin wong is gonna be playing pokin and like uh like seriously it's gonna be entering competitions
10046320	10052560	and all that so it's gonna be really interesting how how the competition like in evo it's gonna
10052560	10057040	kind of turn out well and i think if pokin has that kind of coverage and becomes that kind of
10057040	10062160	game i think it's guaranteed we'll get a sequel to be honest yeah from what i'm seeing it's it's
10062160	10068240	like really easy to get into yeah but really complicated to master so it is it's gonna be
10069840	10072880	my head was spinning a little bit after the tutorial but once you get in there and just
10072880	10076400	start playing like you kind of find out okay i think i know a little more about this than i
10076400	10081680	thought i did so well act deft uh thank you for your thoughts i'm gonna go ahead and let you go
10081680	10085200	so we can wrap up the show but thanks for the call hey thanks for having me all right take care of
10085200	10090240	my friend you too bye-bye i still love how offended he sounded when i suggested julie
