00:00.000 --> 00:17.720
This week, some new adventure MMOs are unlikely to see the light of day, while one classic

00:17.720 --> 00:21.600
adventure game gets a patch to update its compatibility despite having a popular sequel.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.200
We're bringing you the details on these and the rest of the week's gaming news, and it

00:24.200 --> 00:31.200
all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.800
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.800 --> 00:36.320
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.320 --> 00:43.960
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, March the 13th of 2016, episode number

00:43.960 --> 00:46.360
634 of our show.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.360
That's right, been running since 2002.

00:49.360 --> 00:54.680
Myself here in studio, Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E,

00:54.680 --> 00:58.600
and joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.440
Are you yourself the elf?

01:00.440 --> 01:02.320
Uh, I think.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
Is that a...

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
Did you ever hear of herself the elf?

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
Uh, is that a band?

01:05.320 --> 01:06.320
The 80s.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.320
Is that like a 90s band?

01:07.320 --> 01:08.320
It was the 80s.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.320
Is that a goth-y band?

01:09.320 --> 01:10.320
No, it was a cartoon.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.680
Did they open for Susie and the Banshees?

01:11.680 --> 01:13.000
It was an 80s cartoon.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I see.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.880
No, I guess I'm behind on my 80s cartoons.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.880
I'm trying to think.

01:16.920 --> 01:20.920
I mean, there was a lot of 80s cartoons I liked, but probably, I don't know, my favorite

01:20.920 --> 01:22.840
by far, Muppet Babies.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
That was my jam.

01:23.840 --> 01:24.840
I watched that every day.

01:24.840 --> 01:29.000
I was a big fan of David the Gnome.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.680
I don't even know that one.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.680
You don't know David the Gnome?

01:31.680 --> 01:32.680
I don't think so.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.680
I'm a visual person.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.680
I bet if you showed it to me, it'd be like, oh yeah, it is.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.080
They had Tom Bosley as David the Gnome.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.840
Oh, maybe I did see that.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.280
He had the big red hat, and they had the fox friend.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.840
And then when they died, they turned into trees, and the fox cried.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.480
Okay, I think I did see that.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
Yes, I did.

01:49.480 --> 01:54.600
But I was more raised on, I mean, I watched a lot of Nickelodeon.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.800
You Can't Do That on Television was my jam.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.520
Like that was required viewing.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.160
The greatest thing Canada's ever given us besides Alanis Morissette.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.400
However, Alanis Morissette, of course, was on You Can't Do That on Television.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
For A season.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.400
There you go.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.480
For like two episodes, I think.

02:09.480 --> 02:14.040
But anyway, then game shows was the big thing.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.680
Like USA Network used to play game shows like nonstop all day.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.800
The Scrabble game show and Supermarket Sweep, although I think that was a lifetime.

02:21.800 --> 02:28.680
Rob decided he wanted to be what was his face from Press Your Luck to Markin.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.680
Peter to Markin.

02:29.680 --> 02:30.680
Yeah.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.680
Right.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.680
You decided you wanted to be him when you grew up.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.480
Well, Bob Barker was always a personal inspiration of mine because the price is right.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.480
He is very orange.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.880
I saw the prices.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.240
I think he's more orangy than Trump.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.240
I'm sure.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.240
I'm sure.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.960
I'm sure at some point I've told this story on OLR, but I actually went to the prices

02:48.960 --> 02:52.600
right in 2001 when you were blinded by the jacket.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.600
Yes.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.840
When Barker was still hosting it and Rod Roddy, rest in peace, was still alive.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.600
And we went to two tapings.

02:58.600 --> 03:02.240
And for the second taping, we were sitting right behind Rod Roddy and the jacket was

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
sparkling in my face.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.240
Rest in peace.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.240
He was a fantastic.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.760
And Rob came back with a tan.

03:07.760 --> 03:13.080
I'm just sad I didn't get called up on stage, but oh, my God, we had we had been at Coachella.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.920
The day before.

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
So I was exhausted.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.600
Speaking, ironically, Susie and the Banshees, we saw Coachella.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.720
So go figure that it was it was Susie and the Banshees, the Chemical Brothers and Bjork.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.720
Rob.

03:26.720 --> 03:27.720
What?

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Peekaboo.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.040
That's pretty much what it sounded like.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.320
That was pretty much if you could kind of combine Susie and the Banshees and Bjork

03:34.320 --> 03:37.480
into one thing, it would be that anyway.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.480
Not joining us tonight.

03:38.480 --> 03:43.040
Sadly, tech master, Loki, one of Loki's kids is really sick and sitting on his chair.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.720
So tech master Loki was afraid that he would bring the virus over here if he showed up.

03:47.720 --> 03:52.960
So if you're out there, Loki listening, I hope you and the youngins feel better.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.880
But filling in on a moment's notice tonight.

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
Very appreciative.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.200
He could step in the studio tonight.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.800
All it took was a little bit of wine to bribe him.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.800
Say hello, everybody to Shane.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.800
Hello.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
How are you?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.200
Isn't it pronounced, pronounced Coachella?

04:06.200 --> 04:07.200
Not Coachella.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
I don't know.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.080
Like, it's not a co it's coach Ella.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.640
Yeah, because you don't put a co it on.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.000
By the way, I thought of you.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.480
Or write a bow it.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.480
Really good.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.240
Did somebody mispronounce something horribly and kinda what I was watching?

04:22.240 --> 04:23.240
I was playing.

04:23.240 --> 04:29.100
No, I was actually finishing up the danganronpa anime before I finished the game.

04:29.100 --> 04:34.280
And there's like they do one big point because Xanadu and they did a second when he goes

04:34.280 --> 04:35.280
back Xanadu.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.800
I was like, Oh, that's like Rob.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.120
Shut up.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.120
So what?

04:40.160 --> 04:41.160
Anyway.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.040
It made me think of you fondly, fondly.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Yeah.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.040
Yeah.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.040
Watching people get murdered.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.040
It was great.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.400
Shana Linco here in the house to fill in for or I'm just I don't know why you still use

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
a link.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.620
Oh, I thought you use both.

04:53.620 --> 04:57.480
That's just all my Twitter because I don't put my last name even though it's in there

04:57.480 --> 04:58.480
anyway.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.480
So I should just I'll change it right now.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.480
Are you gonna change your Twitter handle?

05:02.480 --> 05:03.480
Sure.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.480
Why not?

05:04.480 --> 05:05.480
All right.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.480
Whatever.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
Well, anyway, I don't know how I already gave up on this.

05:07.480 --> 05:12.760
If you were going to follow Rob's theme, the OMG, you could be WTF.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.760
No, I don't want to follow a Rob theme.

05:15.760 --> 05:16.760
Okay.

05:16.760 --> 05:20.280
Well, yeah, I know I use I use the name OMG, it's Rob and certain things.

05:20.280 --> 05:24.160
And I kind of joke that if Shane wanted to follow my footsteps, his appropriate name

05:24.160 --> 05:27.200
would be whatever it's Shane.

05:27.200 --> 05:32.520
Just like the the character from that game I'm going to sue for ripping me off.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.440
Oh, the Stardew Valley?

05:34.440 --> 05:35.440
Yes.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.440
We're talking about that in a little bit.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.240
I swear to God, the guy that made Stardew Valley is an OLR fan because Shane is in

05:41.240 --> 05:42.240
the game.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.240
I'm not in the game.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
You're not in the game.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.240
Loki's not in the game.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.240
Shane is in the game.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.240
Like where to go.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.240
One hundred percent.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.500
It is me down to a T and his name is Shane.

05:52.500 --> 05:56.240
So hey, that's the one that you were talking about when we were talking about cosplay,

05:56.240 --> 05:57.240
right?

05:57.240 --> 05:58.240
Yeah.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.320
I was like, I should I could do that because all I would need is nothing because I it's

06:01.320 --> 06:02.320
me.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.320
All right.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.320
All right.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.320
Well, hey.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.840
So guy who made Stardew Valley, if you're out there, A, come on the show because you

06:08.840 --> 06:09.840
made a great game.

06:09.840 --> 06:10.840
I'll talk about it later.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.280
But B, thanks for putting Shane in the game, but not the rest of us.

06:14.280 --> 06:19.520
Just just, you know, maybe the guy who made Stardew Valley is a fan of Ranger Pride, which

06:19.520 --> 06:20.520
is your podcast.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.520
I doubt that.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
That's OK.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.160
Who would be a fan of that?

06:24.160 --> 06:25.480
Everybody should.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.840
Tell us quickly about Ranger Pride.

06:26.840 --> 06:32.400
It's about Power Rangers and Super Sentai and we talk about news and episodes and we

06:32.400 --> 06:37.480
have topics of the week and we have a fun time and it's super positive show and we have

06:37.480 --> 06:39.000
a good time.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.640
And Shane finally forced me to watch some Super Sentai earlier today.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.640
It was great.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.640
I was busy trying to prep for the show.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.040
We were watching Ju-O-Jir.

06:46.040 --> 06:50.960
I didn't see as much of it as Dark Sakura did, but it was I kept laughing at how, like,

06:50.960 --> 06:51.960
silly it is.

06:51.960 --> 06:52.960
But it is for kids.

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
I mean, it's not like, you know.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.960
Yes.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.960
But it's still fun to watch.

06:55.960 --> 06:56.960
Yeah.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.600
No, you get you when you when I asked you before and you gave the whole superhero analogy,

07:00.600 --> 07:02.360
like some people are obsessed with Marvel Universe.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.360
Why can't I be obsessed with Power Rangers?

07:03.360 --> 07:04.360
Exactly.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.360
That was a very good defense.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.980
It is a good defense and that's my, like, easy defense to go to.

07:08.980 --> 07:14.280
People are freaking the fuck out about five seconds of Spider-Man in a new trailer.

07:14.280 --> 07:20.000
We went to the movies, me and Flacco Jones and Exfer and Flacco Jones' wife, last night

07:20.000 --> 07:27.220
and saw 10 Cloverfield Lane and then they put the Civil War trailer on and Flacco Jones

07:27.220 --> 07:31.260
and his wife were so excited, but it was the old trailer and there was no Spider-Man.

07:31.260 --> 07:34.700
I was like, maybe the next trailer that comes up will have it.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.180
It wasn't though.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.180
They'll play both trailers.

07:37.180 --> 07:38.180
Yes.

07:38.180 --> 07:39.180
No, but the next one was X-Men.

07:39.180 --> 07:40.180
So I was happy.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.180
Oh, there you go.

07:41.180 --> 07:42.180
All right.

07:42.180 --> 07:44.140
Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight.

07:44.140 --> 07:46.780
I do quickly, though, have to plug our chat room.

07:46.780 --> 07:50.020
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

07:50.020 --> 07:53.100
Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.580
Do tune in sometime for a live show if you never have before.

07:55.580 --> 08:00.060
It's a different experience when you get to participate and join along in our chat room

08:00.060 --> 08:01.060
over at live.vognetwork.com.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.060
I'm exposing celebrities.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.060
Are you...

08:03.060 --> 08:07.780
You guys are talking about celebrities by one word because you're talking about Bjork

08:07.780 --> 08:08.780
and now I see Cher.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.780
Yeah.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.560
Because I said that Bjork probably just goes by Bjork because she's got a really long complicated

08:13.560 --> 08:15.460
Icelandic family name or last name.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.420
Well, it's not like you know a ton of people named Bjork.

08:17.420 --> 08:21.060
Gudmund's daughter, which means that was her dad's name, is Gudmund.

08:21.060 --> 08:24.100
But Cher's is Cherlyn's Sarkeesian.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.700
But Cher is Cher, she'll always be just Cher.

08:27.700 --> 08:31.420
Which by the way, can we talk about quickly because Daylight Savings Time happened last

08:31.420 --> 08:32.420
night obviously.

08:32.420 --> 08:37.980
So everybody was sharing on Facebook that image of Cher that said, don't forget, turn

08:37.980 --> 08:42.260
back time this Saturday and tell your friends and I'm sitting there going, uh-uh.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.980
Someone did a different version of it.

08:43.980 --> 08:44.980
I was like, no, no, no.

08:44.980 --> 08:46.500
We don't turn back time.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.940
This is turn forward time.

08:48.940 --> 08:53.860
Or I would have gone with a picture of Cyndi Lauper and said this is the time after time.

08:54.620 --> 08:59.980
Well, the people were reposting the Cher picture and it said, you idiots don't need to turn

08:59.980 --> 09:00.980
back time.

09:00.980 --> 09:01.980
It's spring forward.

09:01.980 --> 09:02.980
Now share this.

09:02.980 --> 09:07.220
Anyhow, um, let's see.

09:07.220 --> 09:10.660
And I see you are talking about your addiction with Don Gunropa in our chat.

09:10.660 --> 09:16.860
Yes, because Don Gunropa, I came to the game late because I didn't own a PS, well I mean

09:16.860 --> 09:20.200
I have a PSP somewhere in my house amongst all the stuff.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.140
But when was the last time we ever touched that?

09:22.140 --> 09:27.820
And I don't have a Vita, so I've missed out on Don Gunropa for a while.

09:27.820 --> 09:33.020
And so when it came out to steam, I was super excited and of course I get super irritated

09:33.020 --> 09:34.020
at it now.

09:34.020 --> 09:37.100
I know it's not talking about my gaming weekend, but I have to get this out.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.100
Sure.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.100
Of course.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.100
Okay.

09:40.100 --> 09:43.800
So I play with Japanese language and English, you know, text.

09:43.800 --> 09:48.060
So what's so weird, and this is the annoying part of knowing enough about a language to

09:48.060 --> 09:55.180
get the gist of what they're saying, is hearing the localization be completely bizarre.

09:55.180 --> 09:59.340
Like there's a scene where they're talking about, well, where, first of all, they changed

09:59.340 --> 10:03.020
genocide or show to genocide Jack for some stupid reason.

10:03.020 --> 10:08.140
And then she's talking about like ramen and ramen, you know, how you have to choose the

10:08.140 --> 10:09.240
noodles and everything.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.820
And they're, instead change it to spaghetti, but they're talking about ramen.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.900
And I hear ramen and I see spaghetti and my brain shuts down.

10:16.900 --> 10:21.700
And I'm like, I can't even, I just need to learn to read Kanji.

10:21.700 --> 10:25.380
Um, so that's been my, my annoyance with that game.

10:25.380 --> 10:28.380
Kids today know ramen, especially poor college kids.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.380
Definitely know ramen.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.380
Exactly.

10:30.380 --> 10:35.680
And I mean, it's not like we're, we're, you know, no one knew, you know, jack shit about

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
Japanese culture.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.620
It's pretty much a lot more common knowledge these days.

10:39.620 --> 10:40.620
So I thought.

10:40.620 --> 10:46.860
Back in my day, I remember at WinCo, you could get ramen for seven cents a thing.

10:46.860 --> 10:50.420
And that was like, what, let me finish.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.420
Cause I'm annoyed.

10:51.420 --> 10:52.420
I thought you were finished.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.420
Sorry.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.420
I wasn't.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.420
Fine.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.860
Um, it's just, some of the localization is pretty clever, but the rest of it's just really

10:58.860 --> 10:59.860
aggravating.

10:59.860 --> 11:05.980
Um, so I don't want to say bad job localization team, you know, you did badly, but at the

11:05.980 --> 11:12.180
same time I would like to, you know, have the video game companies behind these things,

11:12.180 --> 11:18.780
give us some kind of credit, you know, and not think that we're total plebeians and don't

11:18.780 --> 11:19.780
know anything.

11:19.780 --> 11:24.860
Um, let's see, uh, Brad from pod cultures and chat saying about the ramen thing and

11:24.860 --> 11:29.780
broke adults, you know, you're broke when you see six for a buck and go, Ooh, a sale.

11:29.780 --> 11:36.060
But we know the difference between cheap ass, you know, cup of noodles and actual good ramen

11:36.060 --> 11:37.780
that you get in a ramen shop.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.420
And you know what, we've all fallen on tough times and had to do the ramen thing.

11:41.460 --> 11:47.260
So, you know, it happens, but I also know, um, certain unnamed people that I may or may

11:47.260 --> 11:51.300
not happen to live with will enjoy ramen as a snack as well.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.340
Like just eating the, that's pretty good.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.340
Yeah.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.340
I know so many people do that.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.900
I don't really make ramen burgers that way.

11:57.900 --> 12:01.460
That's a big trend thing too, is making the, the buns out of noodles.

12:01.460 --> 12:07.420
But anyway, look, we can talk about food, um, a ton, but we need to get into my smoothie.

12:07.420 --> 12:11.460
We need to get into video games and, uh, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic

12:11.460 --> 12:16.220
tonight, which is an interesting story that I've seen floating around Twitter that I wanted

12:16.220 --> 12:17.860
to bring up on the show.

12:17.860 --> 12:22.220
And I don't know, um, Shane, you watch a lot more Twitch than I do and have watched that

12:22.220 --> 12:23.220
really evolve.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.220
Right?

12:24.220 --> 12:25.220
Well, yes and no.

12:25.220 --> 12:26.220
How so?

12:26.220 --> 12:28.820
Well, no, because we'll talk about it in my gaming week.

12:28.820 --> 12:29.980
All right.

12:29.980 --> 12:33.100
But yes, because I was watching a lot of Twitch.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.100
All right.

12:34.100 --> 12:39.100
I don't know if you know this particular Twitch streamer, but there is a Twitch streamer out

12:39.100 --> 12:41.860
there and she went by Arah Gaming.

12:41.860 --> 12:42.860
I hope I'm saying that right.

12:42.860 --> 12:43.860
No, I don't.

12:43.860 --> 12:47.020
I know the story you're about to say, but no, I never watched this person.

12:47.020 --> 12:52.560
And unfortunately she, she had a divorce recently or, or fortunately, I don't know the circumstance,

12:52.560 --> 12:55.980
but a divorce happened in that particular situation.

12:55.980 --> 12:59.940
And you know, those are always, you know, tough situations, but things happen.

13:00.780 --> 13:05.220
And what made this really weird and why this is suddenly going all around Twitter and even

13:05.220 --> 13:06.220
ending up on our podcast.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.980
And I feel really weird talking about somebody's personal life like this.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.420
So I don't, I don't, you know, I don't know the details about what happens.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.420
I want to get into that.

13:13.420 --> 13:14.460
I want to keep it classy.

13:14.460 --> 13:22.440
But what's fascinating about this is that it seems like Arah Gaming's husband got access

13:22.440 --> 13:26.300
in the divorce to her social media accounts.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.180
So he has the Twitter and the Twitch account.

13:29.420 --> 13:30.420
Isn't that illegal?

13:30.420 --> 13:36.780
I, you would think, but apparently this is what's happening, is that somebody else showed

13:36.780 --> 13:44.020
up on her Twitch stream, some other gal that wasn't her, like the stand in, I guess.

13:44.020 --> 13:48.300
And you know, of course the first thing people are saying is, who's this stranger?

13:48.300 --> 13:49.300
Who's this?

13:49.300 --> 13:52.540
And there's a little part of me, and again, I don't know any of these people involved.

13:52.540 --> 13:56.980
I don't know the story and it's probably a mess that I don't want to know, but you almost

13:56.980 --> 14:02.780
have to kind of feel like, what did that other girl agree to get herself into?

14:02.780 --> 14:07.780
Does she know exactly what's happening and that she is the splendor?

14:07.780 --> 14:10.180
Maybe he's treating this like a season.

14:10.180 --> 14:15.620
So this season it's this chick on the channel and then when they get a divorce, season three

14:15.620 --> 14:18.300
will start and we'll get a new chick.

14:18.300 --> 14:23.520
But I mean, and it's not like it isn't completely obvious what's going on, but the new woman

14:23.520 --> 14:27.520
will not talk about why she's commandeering the channel.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.360
So, and I believe people are jumping to conclusions that the husband got the Twitch channel and

14:32.360 --> 14:34.520
the settlement and so forth.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.800
And the new streamer says she can't comment on it due to legal reasons, but ARA Gaming

14:39.800 --> 14:44.580
decided to stop streaming and incorporate the channel so people can still enjoy some

14:44.580 --> 14:49.280
of the gameplay while she's no longer streaming.

14:49.280 --> 14:55.960
I guess the channel was sold by the original streamer, although ARA Gaming has not said

14:55.960 --> 15:01.320
anything since the divorce, has not said a single thing, and with good reason, probably

15:01.320 --> 15:05.520
has stayed radio silent on all of this because here we all are speculating on what the hell's

15:05.520 --> 15:06.520
going on.

15:06.520 --> 15:12.560
So now of course there's a Twitter hashtag, ARAgate, which is going on with this and somebody

15:12.560 --> 15:17.280
claiming to be the husband, so we don't know if it is or not, went into the Twitch chat

15:17.280 --> 15:23.560
and said that ARA Gaming will not be streaming for five years.

15:23.560 --> 15:31.940
So I don't know how that happened, but something in this divorce settlement may have made her

15:31.940 --> 15:35.480
unable to stream for five years.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.320
It's crazy.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.920
By the way, this isn't the first time dramatic things have happened on Twitch.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.960
Drama things happen all the time.

15:43.960 --> 15:49.480
But again, I don't want to get into this person's personal business because it's tacky, but

15:49.480 --> 15:55.880
I find it fascinating the whole fact that somebody's Twitch channel is now essentially

15:55.880 --> 15:59.600
something that has to be divided up in a divorce.

15:59.600 --> 16:03.400
And part of me wonders, and again, rampant speculation.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.240
I don't know anything going on here.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.640
Was the Twitch channel part of the reason for the divorce, which is why she had to give

16:09.640 --> 16:11.640
it up?

16:12.040 --> 16:14.120
It's probably an asset issue.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.280
It's a revenue generating asset.

16:16.280 --> 16:20.560
You know, like I would probably say something along the lines of like book rights and things

16:20.560 --> 16:23.400
like that, especially if you had a co-written book.

16:24.320 --> 16:27.040
You know, what state is she in?

16:27.360 --> 16:28.240
Are they California?

16:28.920 --> 16:32.840
I honestly do not know off the top of my head and did not dig deep enough to figure it out.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.720
I know for California and actually for a lot of states out there, if you don't have a prenup

16:36.720 --> 16:40.760
for divorce, then assets are split 50-50 between spouses.

16:41.480 --> 16:46.760
So it could be a legal divider that it is considered an asset.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.200
Well, she had 30,000 subscribers.

16:49.200 --> 16:54.480
That probably, I mean, that's not the largest Twitch channel, but it's a nice little chunk of

16:54.480 --> 16:55.160
pocket change.

16:55.160 --> 16:59.960
But you can't help but wonder, was the husband taking the channel just to be personal?

17:00.400 --> 17:04.920
You know, and again, I feel a little tacky, but these are the questions we inevitably ask

17:04.920 --> 17:08.440
ourselves when we don't have all the facts in front of us, because for whatever reason,

17:08.440 --> 17:13.200
whether it's she's under a gag order or she just doesn't want to fucking acknowledge it

17:13.200 --> 17:14.760
anymore, she's not commenting.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.680
So we don't really have both sides of the story.

17:17.320 --> 17:24.400
This is just sort of setting off every single spousal abuse trigger in my head.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.200
You know, it's just sending off red flags.

17:28.200 --> 17:32.360
And I think that it's nothing that we should be speculating on.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.320
I don't know what the precedent is.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.200
I don't know why.

17:35.360 --> 17:41.200
And until we have that information, speculation, there's not really much that we can do.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.920
We could also hope for the best, though, for her.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.280
Maybe this is part of some sort of settlement.

17:45.280 --> 17:49.760
And the trade off is, yeah, she can't stream and make that revenue, but maybe her ex-husband's

17:49.760 --> 17:52.440
paying a nice chunk of change because of that.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.280
Maybe he had to pay for it.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.280
He could be paying taxes on revenue from it.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.000
Potentially.

17:56.120 --> 18:01.080
You know, and something, something to think about when Conan O'Brien got a divorce, haha, from

18:01.080 --> 18:08.320
NBC, like, he was paid to not be on the air for, what was it, like six months?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.360
That's why he went out on tour.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.360
He did the live tour, remember?

18:10.360 --> 18:11.760
And then the TBS thing started.

18:11.960 --> 18:16.200
So, you know, five years seems like an awful long time, but maybe she'll be able to come back at

18:16.200 --> 18:20.040
some point and maybe he's paying all the revenue in the long term.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.600
Again, you know, I'm speculating, but I just, this is such a 2016 story.

18:24.880 --> 18:29.080
Who would have thought, even five years ago, when we were broadcasting video of OLR on

18:29.080 --> 18:33.760
Justin TV, that people would ever be fighting over the ownership of Twitch channels like this?

18:33.960 --> 18:34.200
I don't know.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.400
Shane, since you watch a lot of Twitch, anything, any other comments or insight on this?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.480
No, not at all.

18:41.600 --> 18:48.560
I think it's, if she had viewers, I'm sorry that they can't watch her stream anymore if she was

18:48.560 --> 18:49.040
awesome.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.440
So, sucks for that.

18:51.680 --> 18:55.560
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:55.560 --> 19:00.440
Alan Alchemy says, I get that streaming is very lucrative, but wouldn't he just argue for more

19:00.440 --> 19:01.920
alimony if she was the breadwinner?

19:02.200 --> 19:04.040
And the meat and potatoes is her personality.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.640
He can broadcast using her subs, but they'll drop like flies once they realize it's not her.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.600
And then Kaijuto went into saying, register a new account, case closed.

19:13.880 --> 19:18.480
And Alan Alchemy said, yeah, but if she hit a certain subscriber milestone, she'll have to rebuild it.

19:18.720 --> 19:24.240
Well, I mean, you know, despite how awkward this situation is, it is getting her a lot of press.

19:24.600 --> 19:29.840
And so if she were to suddenly come out and say, I have a new channel, she'd probably get this bulk of

19:29.840 --> 19:32.680
the subscribers back and then some in a short timeframe.

19:32.680 --> 19:38.760
I mean, that's just, that's just the reality of how this kind of like, you know, drive by looking at the,

19:38.800 --> 19:42.240
you know, car accident that happened on the side of the road, looky-loo type of thing works.

19:42.480 --> 19:42.960
Oh, no.

19:43.720 --> 19:50.360
Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com also says, plus Twitch is such a shithole now anyway, so she's

19:50.360 --> 19:51.040
better off.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.600
She can start a playroom show on Ustream.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.040
Is Twitch, is Twitch turning into a shithole, Shane?

19:56.920 --> 20:02.800
Um, to be honest, again, without going into our gaming weeks yet, the last stuff I was watching on it was

20:02.800 --> 20:04.480
just a lot of Until Dawn.

20:04.840 --> 20:08.000
So I don't care for like the big streamers.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.920
I've never watched the big streamers.

20:09.920 --> 20:16.120
Like if you have like over 300 subs, I probably wouldn't be watching you.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.320
But the little ones I liked still, I still thought they were great.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.120
Yeah.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.880
I like the more genuine reaction stuff.

20:22.880 --> 20:27.200
Although I would certainly say personality goes a long way.

20:27.240 --> 20:27.600
Yeah.

20:27.600 --> 20:32.800
But the people that get like the thousands of subscriptions, those aren't the personalities usually I like.

20:32.800 --> 20:38.640
Those are like the over the top, like making random noises, saying weird things.

20:38.640 --> 20:43.000
People that will read the dialogue in an RPG in a crazy accent while they're in the RPG.

20:43.000 --> 20:43.640
That's okay.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.520
That's that can be okay.

20:45.520 --> 20:50.800
I don't mind that so much because then I'm, it's like listening to a story on tape or something.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.880
All right.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.480
Anyhow, I just thought that would be an interesting thing to talk about because

20:58.480 --> 21:03.280
I can't think of anything more modern in gaming than that fighting over the rights of a Twitch feed.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.120
Let's get into our gaming weeks before we get into the rest of the news.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.000
This week, we're going to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.720
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

21:12.720 --> 21:14.240
I've been playing Danganronpa.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.640
I've been playing Heroes of Dragon Age.

21:16.960 --> 21:24.120
I've been ingressing and Neko Atsume and I saw something on Twitter the other day.

21:24.320 --> 21:28.200
Somebody was making necklaces of cat butts from Neko Atsume.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.280
And I was like, oh, Dark Sakura needs one of those.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.600
Maybe I'll get it for you for your birthday.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.880
You want a cat butt keychain?

21:33.080 --> 21:33.680
No, thank you.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.080
I have way too many keychains right now.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.240
And I'm sad the portal one that you got me broke.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.280
Oh, no.

21:39.280 --> 21:43.440
Yeah, those plastic ones don't really hold up that long to my insane usage of keys.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.720
Yeah, sadly, I think those types of things are more for show than actual use.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.800
I had a Pokemon one that lit up, that thing got busted in a year.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.720
I wore out one of my Togepis and thankfully I found another one in the package.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.920
I just had it lying around.

21:57.800 --> 22:04.800
And Dan and I were, well, mostly Dan, but Dan was playing like elevator action today and breaking out the nest stuff.

22:05.120 --> 22:11.200
He took apart our Nintendo last night, took out the lock chip and cleaned it like completely inside and out.

22:11.640 --> 22:12.080
Wow.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.960
So that he wouldn't have to unbox one of our other ones.

22:15.720 --> 22:16.880
That's still in the box.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.400
Is that cleaning it so that you don't have to blow on the cartridge anymore?

22:19.400 --> 22:22.440
Like cleaning the contacts so you don't have to do the whole thing.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.440
But he also took out the lock chip, so it was just like the pirate lockout.

22:26.600 --> 22:26.960
Right.

22:27.000 --> 22:27.360
Yeah.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.680
So I didn't know he knew how to do all that, but that doesn't surprise me at the same time.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.000
He learned it on YouTube.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.520
Of course.

22:33.880 --> 22:34.880
I watched him do it.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.720
It was educational.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.800
And then I went back to making my wine cork, uh, cork board.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.480
Because Pinterest.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.800
Do you actually use Pinterest?

22:45.840 --> 22:46.760
I hate their website.

22:47.080 --> 22:54.560
I actually use Pinterest for looking up, um, lately my thing has been, uh, medieval, um, instruments.

22:55.440 --> 23:00.680
And Pinterest has actually been a pretty good source because I haven't found examples of certain ones.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.440
So I'll just look through the various ones until I find the one that I want.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.120
I can get the name of it and then I can search for it that way.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.680
The only thing that bugs me about Pinterest is every time I go to their mobile site, something links me there.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.240
It's like, download the app right now.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.320
Download it, do it, do it.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.800
It's just like, Oh my God, some of those, some of the mobile ads and some of those sites are horrendous.

23:18.040 --> 23:26.480
I hate the ones that will automatically, like you go to the page and it's like, opens up the app store and it's like, get Candy Crush, Soda, Saga, Supreme, King Commander right now.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.760
And I'm like, fuck off.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.000
I will never download your game.

23:29.000 --> 23:29.520
Block.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.680
Report it for spam.

23:31.120 --> 23:35.960
But I've, I've been using it more only on my computer.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.640
I don't use it on my phone at all.

23:37.840 --> 23:38.440
Well, that works.

23:39.200 --> 23:39.480
All right.

23:39.880 --> 23:44.240
Well, if that's it for Dark Soccer's gaming week, Shane, you said you had an interesting story here for your gaming week.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.720
No, I didn't say it was interesting.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.080
All right.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.400
Well, what is, what is your gaming week?

23:47.400 --> 23:48.800
I don't have a gaming week.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.960
I quit playing video games for now.

23:53.000 --> 23:53.720
Okay, wait a minute.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.000
So you quit playing video games?

23:56.000 --> 23:56.320
Why?

23:56.320 --> 23:56.760
Yes.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.680
Cause I don't know.

23:57.720 --> 24:04.920
I, I seriously, all I did was watch some random movie on Netflix and afterwards I was like, I'm going to stop eating meat and quit playing video games.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.840
And it didn't have anything to do with the movie whatsoever.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.400
And that's just how it's been since then.

24:11.400 --> 24:19.400
I haven't touched a single game, not like an iPhone game or an iPad game or a handheld game or a computer game or a console game.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.360
Nothing.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.440
So what the hell are you doing on a video game podcast?

24:23.200 --> 24:26.080
Laying on a couch and playing on my iPad, but not a game.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.640
Just looking on the internet.

24:27.680 --> 24:35.360
Well, the way you'd phrased it to me earlier, which I was hoping you'd repeat was, was that you're not like, just because you're not playing video games doesn't mean you hate it.

24:35.360 --> 24:35.880
That's true.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.600
All my only websites I know to go to still are video game websites.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.760
So I still read about video games.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.200
I just don't play them.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.720
And I canceled all my pre-orders except for one.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.760
I kept my No Man's Sky collector's edition just in case.

24:50.200 --> 24:55.880
And we know, uh, when Pokemon comes out, I will definitely be playing games at that point.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.920
But, uh, until I figure out what I want to do about this, there's no video games.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.320
What do you mean by what you want to do?

25:02.360 --> 25:17.080
Like, I was kind of toying with the idea of maybe just, like, playing games at, like, a very, um, reduced, like, I don't know what the next word I want to say.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.880
Like, I would want to play them less.

25:20.240 --> 25:26.760
So maybe, like, only allow myself to play, like, three hours a week or something stupid like that.

25:27.080 --> 25:32.680
And not for any particular reason, but I just think there's maybe more to do out there than just play video games.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.440
Do you think you were addicted to video games?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.560
And so this is something where you're like-

25:35.560 --> 25:38.960
No, because I really have not been playing video games a lot lately anyway.

25:38.960 --> 25:44.640
This is just, like, like, I was already at playing maybe, like, five hours a week at the most.

25:44.920 --> 25:48.080
And I was just like, eh, lazy.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.360
I don't want to play games now, so I just won't.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.440
So what are you doing instead?

25:51.680 --> 25:52.720
What do you do with the time that you-

25:52.720 --> 25:53.600
Living life.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.160
Yes.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.600
And by living life, Hulu.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.320
Well, yeah, I-

25:58.320 --> 26:02.960
Okay, but to be fair, hold on, I've got to raj you on this, because how is that any different?

26:02.960 --> 26:03.800
That's what I was going to say.

26:03.800 --> 26:08.800
It's really not different, but it's really not different.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.480
But it's just, in my head, it's kind of different.

26:11.800 --> 26:19.400
So once I figure out what I want to really do with this time, then there'll be less Hulu.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.920
But I just need to figure out what I want to do.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.000
Like, I want to go out and do something instead.

26:23.400 --> 26:30.240
I don't want to just, like, sit there and watch Hulu or Netflix or Amazon Prime or anything like that for hours.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.520
I want to go out and do something.

26:31.520 --> 26:34.160
And if I play video games so much, then I can't do that.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.720
And if I watch Hulu so much, I can't do that.

26:36.720 --> 26:42.880
So that's why everything's kind of just, like, taking a backseat or falling off a cliff and being gone.

26:43.640 --> 26:48.440
Having known Shane, because some of you might be like, why the hell is he on this show if he doesn't play video games?

26:48.440 --> 26:48.840
Because-

26:48.840 --> 26:52.520
But I have, and, you know, just up until this week did.

26:53.200 --> 27:00.080
Well, and also, like, you know, like you said, you still stay on tap with what's doing, what's going on in the community and everything.

27:00.360 --> 27:05.560
And for me, just knowing Shane as long as I have, Shane is very much the type of person where he's either all in or he's all out.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.440
Yes, yep, that's how it is.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.160
When Shane says, I need to play less video games-

27:10.160 --> 27:10.960
That means zero.

27:10.960 --> 27:17.840
The only way he knows physically how to accomplish that is saying to himself, I need to play no video games.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.800
Yep. That's just how I did, like, soda.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.960
It's like, I need to drink less soda.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.280
So what I do? Cold turkey'd it.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.080
I need to eat less Taco Bell. What do I do? Cold turkey'd it.

27:25.280 --> 27:28.000
I need to play less video games. What do I do? Cold turkey'd it.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.400
But you're eating Del Taco right now.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.880
That is not Taco Bell.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.040
But it won't last forever.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.080
It's already gone. I already ate it.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.800
But it's- I mean, it's the same thing.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.120
You're banned from Taco Bell. I'm sorry, Del Taco is the same thing.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.400
The Taco Bell thing was just because I ate it too much.

27:43.600 --> 27:48.400
So if Del Taco becomes a problem, then I have to eat less of it, which means cold turkey.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.640
Yeah, but Sunday night during OLR, we always eat like shit.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.760
So, well, yeah, I was just like, what am I going to eat?

27:52.760 --> 27:54.680
I think I ate very healthy, thank you.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.120
All right. I apologize.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.720
And since like once in a while, she eats shit too.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.720
Once in a while.

28:00.920 --> 28:05.840
Since I gave up meat, it's like, what am I really going to do?

28:05.840 --> 28:10.400
Like, I have to find these alternatives and sometimes they're not the best alternatives.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.840
So whatever. My gaming week is nothing.

28:13.040 --> 28:13.960
The end.

28:16.120 --> 28:20.280
Oh, except that, you know, my gaming week does involve apparently me farming and

28:20.280 --> 28:24.000
working at a Wal-Mart type store in a video game that ripped off my likeness.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.560
I feel like video games are just something you gave up for Lent, like in 40 days.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.160
Maybe.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.480
Maybe when Easter happens.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.760
No, it might not even be 40 days, because again, I'm playing with the idea of can I

28:37.360 --> 28:40.200
maybe do like three hours a week and hold myself to it?

28:40.520 --> 28:41.040
Probably.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.600
There's going to be something that comes out.

28:42.720 --> 28:47.720
No, well, I just got Twilight Princess that came out last Friday and I was loving the

28:47.720 --> 28:48.640
heck out of it.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.240
And then, you know, this happens.

28:50.240 --> 28:55.200
I'm like, I just want to play Twilight Princess, but I'm not letting myself at all.

28:55.200 --> 29:00.200
And it sucks because I just did my absolute favorite dungeon in that game, which is the

29:00.200 --> 29:04.600
one where you get the spinner, which is the best item in any Zelda game ever and has the

29:04.600 --> 29:07.320
best boss fight because it's basically Jet Set Radio.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.920
And I can't play beyond that now.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.120
That's it.

29:11.240 --> 29:17.680
Why don't you tell yourself, like, OK, if I go all day without eating meat or Taco Bell,

29:17.680 --> 29:19.640
then that's one hour of video game I can play.

29:19.640 --> 29:20.640
Or if I...

29:20.640 --> 29:23.000
Because I will be like, oh, it's only an hour.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.880
Maybe I'll just push another 30 minutes and then it'll be, oh, I've already done an hour

29:26.880 --> 29:27.080
or three.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.360
Why don't I do three hours?

29:28.360 --> 29:32.200
Somebody needs an app or something that starts yelling at him once the hour is up or something

29:32.200 --> 29:37.080
where, like, if I go to the gym for 30 minutes, then I can play 90 minutes of Twilight

29:37.080 --> 29:37.840
Princess or something.

29:37.840 --> 29:38.480
I don't know.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.320
No, it doesn't work.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.680
All in or all out.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.560
That's the chain way.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.440
That is my way.

29:44.040 --> 29:49.680
Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love eating turkey, but I gave it up.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.480
I went cold turkey on the turkey.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.800
Oh, and like, dark meat turkey is really good, too.

29:54.960 --> 29:59.720
You know what, though, I keep telling Shane that when he plays video games again, he needs

29:59.720 --> 30:00.720
to play the game with me.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.680
He needs to play Dungannormpa because it's great.

30:04.760 --> 30:08.720
Hey, Bobby Black Wolf has a decent suggestion, Shane, for how you can force yourself to only

30:08.720 --> 30:09.480
play a certain amount of time.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.880
Bobby Black Wolf says, use the parental controls on the consoles.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.320
Oh, no, because then I will unlock it because I'll have the parental control.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.240
What if I had the parental control?

30:18.320 --> 30:20.400
Do you really want me to bug you until you give it to me?

30:20.400 --> 30:22.720
I kind of love this idea.

30:22.840 --> 30:27.080
Do you want me to come over in the middle of the night and smash your windows because you

30:27.080 --> 30:28.200
wouldn't give me the code?

30:28.400 --> 30:30.240
Because that's a thing that could happen.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.800
We have a guard cat.

30:31.800 --> 30:32.160
Come on.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.080
No, you know better.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.960
Or do I know better or do you know better?

30:35.960 --> 30:39.720
I will have half the code and Dark Sakura will have the other half of the code.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.680
And then that's the only way it's going to be unlocked.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.400
There are, I think Bobby had a good idea there.

30:44.440 --> 30:44.640
No.

30:44.640 --> 30:48.920
My first idea was just to leave my video game systems at different people's houses.

30:48.920 --> 30:49.280
Do that.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.440
I was like, I'm stronger than that.

30:51.440 --> 30:56.480
I still want to borrow your Vita TV when I want to play Danganronpa too.

30:56.560 --> 30:56.840
I know.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.040
Now I'm like, I want you to bring your video games over.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.520
My, my whole thing when I said, I don't understand why you're doing this is because you, you

31:02.520 --> 31:04.360
weren't able to tell me what you were going to do instead.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.960
You were like, I'm going to stop playing video games.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
And I'm like, so you don't really have to have something to do instead.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.480
I just didn't want you to sit around on the couch.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.880
I could teach you how to knit, Shane.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.920
No, that's scary.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.680
Uh, SSG, SSG 100.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.360
Matt says, yes, please do this.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.360
I want this to happen and recorded.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.240
I don't know about that.

31:25.400 --> 31:25.720
What?

31:25.720 --> 31:26.960
The breaking his windows?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.640
No, I think that's what he's talking about.

31:29.640 --> 31:34.320
So Bobby Blackwell is offering up a new YouTube video series on VoG network.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.960
It can be like that show.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.720
What the hell is that horrible game show?

31:37.720 --> 31:41.200
It was on the reality channel where they were in solid solitary.

31:41.240 --> 31:47.040
So did you say it was a horrible show and that's the best show and you would just, it's

31:47.040 --> 31:49.400
like a reality solitary.

31:49.440 --> 31:49.760
Okay.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.320
Then great.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.920
Since you love it so much, you it's like you're on it.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.480
God, I can't even talk to you right now.

31:54.480 --> 31:58.280
I'm going to break your windows for real, but you have to go without games.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.360
Do I get a voice?

32:00.560 --> 32:01.600
That's awesome.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.160
That will make fun of me up on the wall.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.480
Yes, but it's just Jamie.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.200
Solitary was so good.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.080
Jamie gets to be the glados role.

32:11.080 --> 32:15.680
I'm so upset now that we brought up solitary cause it's like my favorite game show.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.520
Oh my God.

32:17.560 --> 32:23.520
Um, bonds double 06 and chat says, Shane, like every teenage male said about quitting

32:23.520 --> 32:26.400
porn, I can quit, but I have to quit cold Turkey.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.440
Well, okay.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.880
Shane's not talking crazy.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.880
Shane didn't ever say he was going to give up porn.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.400
I said video games and that's what he is.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.160
That's why he won't tell me what he replaced it with.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.200
He just replaced it with more porn.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.680
That's that's what it ended up being.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.320
He's like, you know what?

32:40.320 --> 32:41.120
I don't have enough porn.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.680
Uh, act deaf to chat says Shane holding off on something.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.560
I seriously want to see how long it goes.

32:47.040 --> 32:52.840
Uh, well like soda has been like two years now, so I don't push me because if you

32:52.840 --> 32:57.840
think like I'm one of those people that you tell me not to do something, I'll do

32:57.840 --> 33:00.080
it and like, do it tenfold.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.440
What's the saying 99 cent of everything I do.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.920
99% of everything I do is motivated by spite.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.560
That's 174% of everything I do.

33:10.680 --> 33:11.200
All right.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.560
Tiger con chat says the only way Shane will ever play a video game is if they put

33:14.560 --> 33:15.120
porn on it.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.360
Um, absolutely not even true.

33:17.360 --> 33:17.920
Absolutely.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.080
If they make a dyno charger.

33:19.080 --> 33:19.880
Oh God.

33:19.880 --> 33:20.240
Yeah.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.840
If Jason Riley were on it and he can make chase and Riley make out, that's it.

33:24.280 --> 33:24.960
It's over.

33:25.040 --> 33:25.480
It's over.

33:25.480 --> 33:25.960
I windows.

33:26.000 --> 33:26.720
I will do.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.280
Yeah, I'll smash them out of excitement either way.

33:31.280 --> 33:32.960
Your windows need to be replaced soon.

33:35.560 --> 33:36.200
All right.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.440
Um, my gaming week.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.360
So, uh, I've played a few things this week.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.960
Uh, one new game that I played this week, actually a listener was kind enough to buy

33:43.960 --> 33:44.480
this for me.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.640
So I just want to, I give a shout out, you know who you are and thank you for giving

33:47.640 --> 33:48.360
this to me as a gift.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.920
Cause it was a game I was gender genuinely curious about anyway, because

33:51.920 --> 33:55.040
Shane started talking to me about it one day.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.640
He's like, so did you hear about this new game?

33:57.640 --> 33:59.920
It's like the new Minecraft or five nights at Freddy's.

33:59.920 --> 34:00.640
It's the new.

34:00.760 --> 34:04.240
I said it was the new, um, that other game I've never played Undertale.

34:04.320 --> 34:04.600
Okay.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.440
It's, but it's the new indie sensation game, right?

34:07.680 --> 34:09.200
He says it's called Stardew Valley.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.480
And I said, I don't know anything about it.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.760
Uh, and what you said, it was like animal crossing and harvest moon or something like

34:14.760 --> 34:14.920
that.

34:14.920 --> 34:15.240
Right.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.480
So I was like, all right, well then I looked up the steam page and I put it on my

34:18.480 --> 34:22.800
wishlist and I swear, not even like two hours later, I get a message on Twitter.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.000
That's like, Hey, I, there's this game you need to play.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.280
You need to play and I want to get it for you because I know you'll like it and it's

34:30.280 --> 34:31.040
right up your alley.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.480
And I was just kind of like, okay, well, I didn't know what the game was at that

34:33.560 --> 34:36.160
point. But then when I saw what it was, I was like, okay, this is funny.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.640
Cause I had just put it on my wishlist two hours before.

34:38.640 --> 34:39.720
And yes, I do want to try this.

34:40.120 --> 34:40.360
Okay.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.680
So Stardew Valley, it's a new game that just came out on steam like one or two

34:43.680 --> 34:44.080
weeks ago.

34:44.080 --> 34:44.440
Right.

34:44.840 --> 34:50.360
And yeah, it's, it's similar to harvest moon, but also kind of Minecraft.

34:50.400 --> 34:55.840
I really feel like Stardew Valley in a way is Minecraft for people that hate

34:55.840 --> 34:56.480
Minecraft.

34:58.640 --> 35:02.920
I think that's one of the best ways to describe it because you, you're not in

35:03.000 --> 35:06.440
that whole weird first person thing and you're not having to break the bricks.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.480
It's, it's totally different.

35:07.760 --> 35:12.240
You are on a farm and you have similar types of tools to what you'd have in

35:12.240 --> 35:12.720
Minecraft.

35:12.720 --> 35:18.120
You have a pickaxe, a shovel, a hoe, and those are all things for killing

35:18.120 --> 35:21.720
somebody and burying the body, which you can probably do in Stardew Valley.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.600
I just haven't got there yet.

35:22.800 --> 35:28.120
So you, you can clean up your farm and then you can start to bury little plant

35:28.120 --> 35:30.160
seeds and stuff and grow plants.

35:30.560 --> 35:34.280
There's a town nearby and you start to get to know the villagers and I guess you

35:34.280 --> 35:36.080
can romance the villagers.

35:36.240 --> 35:42.000
Although there is one particular villager who like, well, when you try to talk to

35:42.000 --> 35:43.360
him is like, I don't want to talk to you.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.200
I'm very busy, you know, type of thing.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.480
And his name is Shane.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.320
And he's rude and rude.

35:48.360 --> 35:54.800
He had, until today, he had my hair cut and he only wears blue and I saw

35:54.800 --> 35:56.120
wearing brown actually.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.320
Well, he wears like shorts and a hoodie.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.400
That's what I do.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.440
It's, it's ridiculous.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.200
It's me.

36:02.640 --> 36:05.480
But you can't romance Shane.

36:05.760 --> 36:10.640
But I was reading some weird, uh, online article where the guy was actually

36:10.640 --> 36:13.080
talking, the guy who created the game and I'm sorry, I forget his name in the

36:13.080 --> 36:16.600
moment, but, um, the guy, it was all created by one guy, which is really

36:16.600 --> 36:17.040
impressive.

36:17.440 --> 36:21.760
Um, and the guy actually said, yeah, I want to work on some free updates and

36:21.760 --> 36:25.000
items and people keep asking me to make Shane romanceable.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.080
So that's one thing I'm going to add into the game.

36:27.480 --> 36:31.920
Um, and so I was like, okay, that's super awkward, but that is the thing that I

36:31.920 --> 36:33.440
guess they're going to actually put in the game.

36:33.760 --> 36:39.720
Um, I, I am so, I'm still trying to learn about this game that I can't figure out

36:39.720 --> 36:41.240
how to romance anybody yet.

36:41.280 --> 36:46.520
I, my understanding is there's no, like they do the cool thing where whoever your

36:46.520 --> 36:50.000
character is can romance anybody that is romanceable.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
There's, you know, there's five guys and five girls.

36:52.000 --> 36:52.120
Yeah.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.080
There's no gender provisions or anything like that.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.160
And there's a lot of customizability with your characters.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.200
That's why the game doesn't really care about that, which is cool.

36:58.600 --> 37:04.600
Um, but, uh, here's the thing about the game is that yet again, it's one of those

37:04.600 --> 37:09.400
games like Minecraft, when it first came out, that doesn't really handhold you an

37:09.400 --> 37:10.000
awful lot.

37:10.640 --> 37:15.960
Like it doesn't really tell you a lot about what to do now, granted you do get

37:15.960 --> 37:19.320
quests to go talk to villagers, you get quests to do plants.

37:19.560 --> 37:24.040
So it does kind of give you little like hints and things, but like there's other

37:24.040 --> 37:27.640
like things that I would think would be critically important that the game doesn't

37:27.640 --> 37:29.320
really explain very well to you.

37:29.600 --> 37:35.120
Things like you have an energy bar and if you don't eat, you will faint or you will,

37:35.120 --> 37:36.680
you know, like other things will happen.

37:36.680 --> 37:40.800
And I don't know, like it's, it's kind of hard to figure out like, okay, well, how

37:40.800 --> 37:43.280
do I continue stocking myself with food?

37:43.640 --> 37:46.280
And I've just basically gotten to the point where it's like, okay, if my energy

37:46.280 --> 37:48.560
meter's done for the day, what did I do?

37:48.560 --> 37:53.960
I think I, I think I dug through the garbage and found something to eat, but in

37:53.960 --> 37:58.200
what, on the other hand, that's part of what's really cool about the game is that

37:58.200 --> 38:01.840
it is so open because it doesn't tell you what to do.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.640
I kind of think that's the point.

38:03.960 --> 38:09.880
I think the guy who made it wants to see what people come up with and how people,

38:10.040 --> 38:14.400
you know, um, experience and, and get over the certain challenges in the game.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.120
And I think that's why this game is so popular right now because it's incredibly

38:17.120 --> 38:18.320
popular on live streams.

38:18.520 --> 38:22.200
He also said that there's like hidden stuff that nobody's figured out yet and he's

38:22.200 --> 38:23.960
not going to talk about it either.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.280
And the game does go beyond just having the farm.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.440
You can end up doing fishing.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.840
There's a mine that you go into later.

38:31.880 --> 38:35.280
I heard it's very, just like Animal Crossing slash Harvest Moon.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.080
That's what the game is.

38:36.080 --> 38:36.680
It really is.

38:36.680 --> 38:40.760
But I actually find, I don't know, I never really got into Harvest Moon, but I'm

38:40.760 --> 38:42.840
enjoying what I've playing a Stardew Valley so far.

38:42.840 --> 38:47.240
I just feel like, and this is kind of like my, my OCD coming in to play a little bit.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.280
I keep feeling like I'm playing the game wrong.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.880
I keep feeling like I'm going to die.

38:52.880 --> 38:53.800
I'm going to lose.

38:53.800 --> 38:54.960
I'm not doing this right.

38:55.440 --> 39:00.880
And I have to kind of remind myself at some point, there is no right or wrong way

39:00.880 --> 39:03.280
to be playing this, but it's just, it's a weird hurdle for me to get over.

39:03.280 --> 39:03.800
Does it make sense?

39:03.800 --> 39:04.280
What I'm saying?

39:04.520 --> 39:06.480
No, it doesn't.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.200
I'm sorry.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.160
No, whatever.

39:08.200 --> 39:12.040
There's a, I've seen on a video game site that you don't like to talk about, but I'll

39:12.040 --> 39:15.640
say anyway, Kotaku, um, they have like tips for playing it.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.600
Maybe you should check it out if you really feel like you're doing something wrong.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.080
Well, maybe, maybe I will look into that.

39:20.080 --> 39:20.480
Who knows?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.280
Um, let's see.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.120
I was seeing if anybody in chat was commenting on this, but no, they're still

39:26.120 --> 39:27.280
talking about the window breaking.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.240
Uh, see, they're really into it.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.840
I think this is what should happen.

39:31.800 --> 39:32.600
There should be a poll.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.600
Can you put a poll up on VoG and see how many windows they want me to break?

39:36.040 --> 39:36.760
No, I will not.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.880
Also house or car?

39:39.360 --> 39:39.840
What?

39:40.040 --> 39:41.760
House windows or car windows?

39:41.760 --> 39:42.320
Which ones?

39:42.360 --> 39:43.080
Well, both.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.800
This is the house is a rental.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.320
My car is covered by my insurance.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.240
So I guess the car.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.680
No, no, no, no, no windows.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.240
They get to pick.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.800
They're the ones into this idea.

39:51.840 --> 39:52.800
Stop it.

39:53.640 --> 39:54.160
Anyway.

39:54.480 --> 40:00.320
Um, so Stardew Valley, I played a little bit of that and it's, it's really kind of

40:00.320 --> 40:02.320
addicting in, in a Minecraft kind of way.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.920
And I will be playing more of that.

40:03.920 --> 40:04.680
So thanks again.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.040
Um, I never expect money or gifts or whatever from doing this show.

40:09.040 --> 40:13.840
It's a really flattering thing when a listener spends their harder money to buy

40:13.840 --> 40:15.840
something just because they think I'd get a kick out of it.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.720
So I really appreciate that.

40:17.360 --> 40:22.200
Um, also in my gaming week, I played a little bit of Tron run R because I had

40:22.200 --> 40:26.400
yet to play the full game once they released it on steam and here's the

40:26.400 --> 40:28.560
hilarious thing about Tron run R.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.160
It crashes my computer.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.480
I think that's great.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.280
I can play the first level fine.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.120
And then the second level crash.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.640
Have you updated like your graphics?

40:36.640 --> 40:39.640
I just updated my graphics drivers last night.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.360
So I'm going to try it again, probably after the show tonight and see if it

40:42.360 --> 40:43.240
still crashes on me.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.160
Cause isn't it coming to console?

40:45.200 --> 40:47.000
So too, it is already on console.

40:47.000 --> 40:47.960
Why don't you just pick it up there?

40:47.960 --> 40:49.560
Unless it's going to crash again.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.320
But then yeah, you do.

40:50.320 --> 40:50.840
It's Tron.

40:50.840 --> 40:51.440
It is Tron.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.920
If you support Tron, maybe they'll make another movie.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.560
Maybe there's an achievement in the game called Tron three.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.600
And I was like, is the achievement for getting that achievement.

41:01.640 --> 41:02.120
LOL.

41:02.120 --> 41:02.840
Just kidding.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.160
No, I don't.

41:05.160 --> 41:05.800
I, what was it?

41:05.800 --> 41:08.560
Oh, you have to get like a combo through the entire stage or something

41:08.560 --> 41:09.640
and you get that achievement.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.160
I just, I randomly got that on the first stage cause I'd played the game before.

41:13.160 --> 41:14.800
So I, I knew what I was doing.

41:14.800 --> 41:19.880
So Alan alchemy and chat says, wow, that's impressive because

41:19.880 --> 41:21.280
your computer is rock solid.

41:21.520 --> 41:21.880
Alan.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.640
It just means I need a video card upgrade.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.720
Like we've been talking about, even though my video cards only, what a year

41:26.720 --> 41:28.760
old, it's time to get the video card.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.000
That'll run the Oculus.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.240
Don't you want me to have it?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.880
Uh, so yeah, I, I tried to play a little bit of Tron run R and, uh, that

41:36.880 --> 41:37.640
didn't go so well.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.600
So instead I went to the PlayStation four and I was like, Oh, what can I

41:40.600 --> 41:40.920
download?

41:40.920 --> 41:41.720
What can I check out?

41:42.040 --> 41:46.200
And my buddy extra for that hosts a show with me called guys on a show.

41:46.240 --> 41:51.080
Also here at vog network.com has been pimping a game for ever that

41:51.080 --> 41:52.440
he really, really, really loves.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.400
And so I decided to check this game out, even though I played Rayman legends.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.200
No, it was not, I played that, but not this week.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.800
Uh, I played it at E3 like two years ago.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.880
It was a while ago on the PS four.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.200
And then I played it on PC a little bit.

42:06.400 --> 42:11.120
The game is assault Android cactus, and it was one of the games that was, you

42:11.120 --> 42:14.240
could vote for it to be free, but unfortunately it didn't win because it

42:14.240 --> 42:15.960
was up against a game called bro force.

42:15.960 --> 42:19.160
There was no way anything was going to win against that.

42:19.200 --> 42:19.440
Yeah.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.080
Which is kinda, which is kinda sucky.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.760
Cause I'll tell you what I've played both.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.960
And I think assault Android cactus is kind of a more interesting game.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.600
Sorry, bro.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.400
Bro force.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.400
Wasn't that bad though.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.000
I, I haven't been into it.

42:30.040 --> 42:30.880
I couldn't get into it.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.640
Like some of the over the top stuff.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.880
I was like, Oh, that's funny.

42:33.880 --> 42:38.080
But like assault Android cactus kind of had me right from the get go because

42:38.080 --> 42:40.520
it's, it's a twin stick shooter type of game.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.320
But it has some different sorts of mechanics.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.040
Like, you know, I could say like, Oh, it's like geometry wars, but it's

42:46.040 --> 42:50.240
really nothing like it, like at its core where you have the two sticks move

42:50.240 --> 42:53.000
and shoot smash TVS type of game.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.080
Yeah, I guess it's that, but you can switch weapons midway through.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.920
And there's actually, you have to think when you switch weapons, there's

42:59.920 --> 43:01.160
going to be time to do that.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.520
So you don't want to get yourself in a corner.

43:02.760 --> 43:06.720
Uh, there's power ups and the level design is kind of interesting because

43:06.720 --> 43:08.600
some levels the lights will go out.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.360
So the only way you can see is the monsters that are around.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.600
Some levels have conveyor belts, which is really weird.

43:14.600 --> 43:17.720
Like, uh, you might have like a giant wheel and then the middle wheel is

43:17.720 --> 43:20.880
spinning, so you kind of have to keep that in mind as the levels going.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.520
So sounds kind of unfair, but that's mean that's part of it.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.680
That's part of the challenge.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.280
So they can't just all be nice square little stages.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.880
So yeah, I I've been having fun with this all Android cactus.

43:33.880 --> 43:36.560
I think that's kind of a neat game and it does the whole thing like Spelunky

43:36.560 --> 43:39.200
does, where like there's a daily challenge that you can play and see

43:39.200 --> 43:40.560
how you rank against your friends.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.960
And there's like an endless mode.

43:42.240 --> 43:46.840
So, um, yeah, I I've been having fun with this all Android cactus.

43:46.840 --> 43:49.880
So I didn't play it a lot, a lot, but I played it enough to know that I enjoy it.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.560
So, uh, that'll probably do it for my gaming week.

43:52.560 --> 43:53.600
I think that's all I need to say.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.200
So, um, I want to get into some housekeeping real quick.

43:57.720 --> 44:02.640
Uh, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R we're also on Facebook,

44:02.640 --> 44:06.120
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

44:06.480 --> 44:10.760
Uh, we will not be having a show in a few weeks.

44:10.760 --> 44:14.920
It's April 3rd, just so you know, no live show, April 3rd, I'll be out of town.

44:15.280 --> 44:20.080
Uh, but we will be back the next week on April 10th and on April 9th, we will be

44:20.080 --> 44:25.960
at the Sacramento, uh, indie game, indie gaming arcade, uh, and, um, looking to

44:25.960 --> 44:29.880
try and get Bree and Gabe back on the show in the next couple of weeks to tell

44:29.880 --> 44:31.320
us a little more about this year's event.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.000
I know they have a nice bigger space.

44:33.000 --> 44:33.880
It's going to be a lot of fun.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.360
So, uh, we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks when they come back onto the

44:37.360 --> 44:37.640
show.

44:38.120 --> 44:41.960
Um, otherwise we will still be here through the coming weeks.

44:42.280 --> 44:46.760
Uh, one other thing I want to mention over at vog network.com, of course, where

44:46.760 --> 44:50.840
this show is and broadcast live on Sunday night, uh, over at vog network.com, our

44:50.840 --> 44:53.920
pal Bobby Black Wolf, who does the show right before us here on Sunday nights,

44:54.160 --> 44:59.400
he just posted a cool little video, uh, over at vog network, uh, on our YouTube

44:59.400 --> 44:59.760
account.

44:59.760 --> 45:01.600
And then it's also there on the main page.

45:01.880 --> 45:05.360
Um, that was his little road trip to magfest.

45:05.360 --> 45:11.480
He actually drove from Atlanta to Washington, DC, but he actually kind of

45:11.480 --> 45:14.400
now has, has, has come out as a Tesla owner.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.760
Basically, it was kind of keeping it a secret for a little while.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.320
Uh, but he actually has mentioned now, uh, everybody knows he has a Tesla.

45:21.600 --> 45:25.160
And so when you have an all electric vehicle like that, you don't stop at a

45:25.160 --> 45:26.480
gas station to get gas.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.280
When you have a very long drive, you do this whole little thing where you stop

45:29.320 --> 45:30.200
at superchargers.

45:30.520 --> 45:35.120
Uh, so he actually planned his route and he did a really good job with this video.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.640
It's like an hour long, so it's almost like a bit of a documentary, but I got to

45:38.640 --> 45:41.840
say, and I'm not just saying this because I know Bobby and he's my friend and I

45:41.840 --> 45:45.000
like to promote his stuff because if it wasn't good, I probably just would have

45:45.000 --> 45:46.120
mentioned it and ended it there.

45:46.320 --> 45:50.880
But it actually is really good because, uh, he actually explains it at a level

45:50.880 --> 45:56.600
like a lot of the Tesla stuff he was showing me before was like at a level for

45:56.640 --> 45:59.520
people that already owned the vehicles and already kind of know that stuff.

45:59.520 --> 46:03.320
But Bobby kind of phrased it in a way where if you don't really know anything

46:03.320 --> 46:07.800
about what being a Tesla owner is like or how the electric cars are very different

46:07.800 --> 46:11.120
from the gas cars, he kind of explains all that and really breaks it down.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.560
So I thought it was a good little like kind of entry level.

46:13.560 --> 46:19.040
Like if you're curious, like why are those cars so damn expensive and, and what

46:19.040 --> 46:20.120
is that all about?

46:20.120 --> 46:21.240
Why are people so into it?

46:21.400 --> 46:25.280
I think Bobby does a really good job explaining that and framing it in the

46:25.280 --> 46:28.440
video game text of the fact that it was a road trip to go to magfest.

46:28.640 --> 46:31.320
And if you get to the end of the documentary, he does have a cool little,

46:31.320 --> 46:32.800
um, kind of montage.

46:33.120 --> 46:36.120
Cause you know, it's not a movie without a montage.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.600
So he has a fun little montage of the end.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.160
There are some of the stuff at magfest.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.120
So I check that out.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.280
It's over on the vog network, YouTube, or you can see that on the main page.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.920
Uh, vog network.com.

46:46.360 --> 46:51.400
Um, act deft and chat says, uh, hopefully like black Wolf said, the cars get

46:51.400 --> 46:52.400
cheaper with time.

46:52.760 --> 46:55.640
Uh, and Nintendo maniac 64 is in our chat room.

46:55.640 --> 46:56.600
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

46:56.600 --> 47:01.760
Live.vognetwork.com and says, um, I decided to check in and funny thing

47:01.760 --> 47:05.800
about Tesla, I've been following Tesla for longer than OLR.

47:05.960 --> 47:08.600
So if anyone needs another Tesla expert, I'm here.

47:08.600 --> 47:12.240
Well, Nintendo maniac, you definitely should go check out Bobby's documentary

47:12.240 --> 47:13.480
and let them know your feedback.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.400
I've been studying Tesla since I was a little kid.

47:16.640 --> 47:21.760
Because Nikola Tesla was really awesome and Edison stole his shit.

47:21.800 --> 47:22.280
Yes.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.160
So, yes.

47:23.560 --> 47:27.960
Uh, I was, Hey, uh, I actually rode in Bobby's car.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.920
Uh, he picked me up at the airport for, um, dragon con last year.

47:30.920 --> 47:35.240
And so we, we went on a little trip and I got to say, I was like, wow, I

47:35.240 --> 47:36.720
can see why these are cool.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.200
And I kind of want one.

47:38.480 --> 47:43.040
It's going to be a little while before I can get a couple of folks at my, um, at

47:43.040 --> 47:44.880
my work, have them in the parking lot.

47:44.880 --> 47:45.880
So I've gotten to stare at them.

47:46.000 --> 47:46.560
They're nice.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.120
They're nice cars.

47:47.120 --> 47:50.720
I mean, and as this electric thing gets more and more and more, I think we're

47:50.720 --> 47:52.880
going to see more competition, which will be a good thing.

47:52.880 --> 47:55.360
It drives the price down and competition drives the industry.

47:55.560 --> 47:57.760
So it's, I think it's gonna be fascinating in a few years.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.880
Anyway, I don't want to spend too much more time on that.

47:59.880 --> 48:03.720
Cause it is a video game show, but, uh, Bobby did a great job and

48:03.720 --> 48:05.080
it's worth the kudos over there.

48:05.160 --> 48:09.440
So, um, let's get into some gaming news, some video game stuff.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.160
Uh, Shane filling in for Loki this week and to start us off tonight.

48:12.160 --> 48:15.240
But then I have to stop watching this video of adorable puppies that are

48:15.280 --> 48:18.760
like huddled up and look, then they get, they all run away.

48:19.400 --> 48:19.760
Okay.

48:19.760 --> 48:21.280
A it's horrible radio.

48:21.280 --> 48:24.080
When you describe a video, uh, well, let me hold it up to the

48:24.080 --> 48:24.920
microphone so they can see.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.800
Why don't you just pause it, read the story, and then you can go back to it.

48:28.480 --> 48:29.640
That's not as fun.

48:29.640 --> 48:30.520
That was so cute.

48:31.080 --> 48:36.560
Anyway, let's talk about other cute things like, um, just that I play games.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.600
It's just like, I do nickel.

48:38.600 --> 48:39.000
That's amazing.

48:39.000 --> 48:39.640
What are you talking about?

48:39.680 --> 48:44.120
So another cute thing, just like those puppies is that lion's head, uh, studios

48:44.160 --> 48:47.080
is probably closing down and fable legends got canceled.

48:47.360 --> 48:48.200
How is that cute?

48:48.320 --> 48:51.320
I don't know, but I'm sure there's something cute about that.

48:51.320 --> 48:53.000
No, I don't think there's anything cute about that.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.920
It's cute in the, Oh, that's cute.

48:56.040 --> 48:56.360
Yeah.

48:56.400 --> 49:01.720
Um, so basically a statement was made on the Xbox site, uh, saying after much

49:01.720 --> 49:05.800
consideration, we have decided to cease development on fable legends and are in

49:05.800 --> 49:10.800
discussions with the employees about the proposed closure of lion head studios in

49:10.800 --> 49:11.880
the UK.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.600
So no more fable, I guess.

49:15.640 --> 49:19.440
It's not a flagship for Microsoft anymore unless they move it to another studio.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.080
Yeah.

49:20.080 --> 49:25.280
But I think what, this is the third, this was to be the third fable game since the

49:25.280 --> 49:27.880
numbered series and it's the third fable game.

49:27.880 --> 49:29.960
I don't think a lot of people were really excited for.

49:30.120 --> 49:36.920
Well, I, I think maybe going away from the mainline series was a mistake in a way.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.960
I mean, fable three wasn't as well received as fable two.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.280
Well, the first half was.

49:41.360 --> 49:44.480
The first half of fable three was super well received and then the second half

49:44.480 --> 49:44.960
happened.

49:44.960 --> 49:45.320
True.

49:45.680 --> 49:51.320
Um, I just kind of think that they should have tried to do another fable game

49:51.320 --> 49:54.240
because the problem with the games that came after fable is that they weren't

49:54.240 --> 49:55.160
really fable games.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.000
Remember that?

49:56.040 --> 49:57.480
Remember, I don't even remember the name of it.

49:57.480 --> 50:00.200
It was the connect fable game and they had to sit there until they were blue in the

50:00.200 --> 50:01.560
face going, it's not on rails.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.760
Um, it wasn't really that good of a game.

50:03.800 --> 50:07.080
I didn't even realize that there was like a beta for fable legends.

50:07.120 --> 50:12.040
That's how much that fables not on my radar and I'm guessing it's probably not

50:12.040 --> 50:13.520
on a lot of people's anymore.

50:14.200 --> 50:17.880
So it's really sad that they're possibly closing down.

50:18.160 --> 50:22.520
Um, it looks like they also kind of announced that a Danish developer press

50:22.520 --> 50:27.360
play, uh, the team that did, uh, max, the curse of the brotherhood is also being

50:27.360 --> 50:27.760
shuttered.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.440
Like that one's a hundred percent sure.

50:29.680 --> 50:35.560
So, uh, not a good time to be a Microsoft, uh, first party studio.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.280
Rare.

50:37.480 --> 50:38.000
You hear that?

50:39.400 --> 50:41.160
That the shuttering noise is your future.

50:41.160 --> 50:41.560
Trouble.

50:41.560 --> 50:41.840
Really?

50:41.880 --> 50:42.560
Oh, I think so.

50:42.560 --> 50:43.560
What, what have they done?

50:44.200 --> 50:45.560
They don't do killer instinct.

50:45.560 --> 50:49.040
The rare anniversary pack was their thing, I guess.

50:49.320 --> 50:52.680
That's basically a glorified Xbox live arcade on a disc.

50:53.040 --> 50:58.880
Um, they did do, I didn't, they do the conquer, uh, hollow lens stuff that like

50:58.880 --> 51:02.520
people like threw up when they saw it because it was so awful.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.560
No, I don't know.

51:03.560 --> 51:03.960
Maybe.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.440
I think they did that too, but I mean.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.720
They just, they're the next ones to go.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.240
What if rare is getting fable?

51:12.680 --> 51:13.560
That could be interesting.

51:13.560 --> 51:14.800
That would be interesting.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.280
I mean, again, I feel kind of tacky though.

51:17.280 --> 51:20.680
Like, you know, like obviously people were impacted jobs.

51:20.680 --> 51:21.000
Yeah.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.840
But just, just like all the time, Peter Molyneux left though, to do his, his

51:25.840 --> 51:29.960
what's in the cube crap and all this other weird stuff that also is terrible, but he

51:29.960 --> 51:32.880
kind of, it's, it seems like he left them hanging.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.560
I get this, I get this weird feeling.

51:35.640 --> 51:38.040
I think he left them hanging while he was still there.

51:38.040 --> 51:41.960
So, um, no, but the thing about, you know, these studio closures is that when

51:41.960 --> 51:46.440
everyone gets announced, you go to Twitter or you go to like LinkedIn, you've got

51:46.440 --> 51:49.960
all these other companies that are supportive of these people that have just

51:49.960 --> 51:53.000
lost their jobs and like, Hey, we have spots open, come apply for us.

51:53.280 --> 51:59.920
So it sucks that the studio closed down, but I don't think that the talented people

51:59.920 --> 52:04.440
there won't find work elsewhere at a place not owned by Microsoft.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.560
Therefore probably not going to be closed.

52:06.880 --> 52:09.120
Microsoft is the new, new EA.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.040
Well, I hope they do a fable for one way or another.

52:12.080 --> 52:14.760
Like I really think they should attempt another fable game.

52:14.760 --> 52:15.200
I really do.

52:15.200 --> 52:19.000
Like not a spinoff game, a real fable game in the same game.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.200
Who would you want to do it though?

52:20.320 --> 52:23.320
Let's just say not rare because again, they're next to be closed.

52:23.640 --> 52:24.160
Shit.

52:24.160 --> 52:24.720
I don't know.

52:24.760 --> 52:28.280
Um, and it's going to have to be Microsoft first party.

52:28.480 --> 52:29.760
Who do they have left?

52:30.600 --> 52:32.120
They have the people that do Alan Wake.

52:32.160 --> 52:34.880
I think that's first party, but they're doing quantum break right now.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.040
Halo, uh, three, four, three.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.400
I think they need to just worry about halo.

52:40.400 --> 52:40.600
Yeah.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.720
Then that is probably exactly what they're doing.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.600
Um, and then who else do they have?

52:46.720 --> 52:48.760
Now's not a good time to ask me after I've been drinking.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.840
You wouldn't have known the answer anyway, so it's fine.

52:52.440 --> 52:54.960
I don't know who else they have either, but, um,

52:54.960 --> 52:56.960
SSJ100 Matt says, who does Forza?

52:59.400 --> 53:00.960
Oh, I want to play car fable.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.840
Uh, well, I, I can answer who does fable.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.560
It's a under Microsoft studios.

53:05.560 --> 53:06.720
No, that's Forza.

53:06.840 --> 53:07.880
That's not fable.

53:07.880 --> 53:08.760
Try reading it again.

53:08.760 --> 53:09.800
Playground games.

53:10.560 --> 53:11.240
Okay.

53:12.040 --> 53:15.520
Well, some of it, no, cause somebody in chat says, no, but you said I can tell you who does fable.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.160
Oh, sorry.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.120
I meant Forza.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.240
Cause you're drunk.

53:18.240 --> 53:23.280
And Bobby Black Wolf says, uh, turn 10 and playground does horizon.

53:23.280 --> 53:23.800
Oh, excuse me.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.880
A Forza horizon was what I was looking at over there.

53:25.880 --> 53:28.560
So, well, maybe they could do it.

53:28.560 --> 53:31.920
And I prefer horizon to the regular Forza series anyway.

53:31.920 --> 53:36.680
So if they do do car fable, as long as I can kick a chicken with my car.

53:39.600 --> 53:40.560
All right.

53:40.600 --> 53:41.680
Now you're just getting silly.

53:41.720 --> 53:43.840
Uh, but that was the best part of fable one.

53:43.840 --> 53:46.240
When I played the demo of it was kicking chickens.

53:46.240 --> 53:48.680
Good luck to those affected people.

53:48.680 --> 53:50.240
And I really hope something can happen.

53:50.440 --> 53:55.080
Maybe it's not a hundred percent sure that they're going to shutter lion heads still, but it is.

53:55.200 --> 53:59.360
Can I do, can I do one tinfoil hat thing before I go on to the next story?

53:59.560 --> 54:02.880
Cause it wouldn't be an episode of OLR if I didn't break out the tinfoil at some point.

54:02.920 --> 54:03.120
Okay.

54:03.120 --> 54:03.600
You ready?

54:04.240 --> 54:06.320
So let's say this studio closes.

54:07.040 --> 54:14.360
What's to stop somebody else from coming in and funding the company to reopen and make games for them?

54:14.680 --> 54:16.440
Such as, Oh, I don't know.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.440
Sony.

54:18.600 --> 54:24.960
Now, not that I'm saying fable four is going to be on the PlayStation, but what about a Fable-esque game?

54:25.000 --> 54:30.800
They can totally do that, but I don't think the chances are very likely.

54:31.080 --> 54:31.280
Yeah.

54:31.280 --> 54:36.320
They would have to know the demand is there and I'm not totally sure it is after the last three fable games.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.640
I mean, I just don't think.

54:39.280 --> 54:40.280
I have this weird feeling.

54:40.280 --> 54:45.480
Nintendo would be more interested in that, but at the same time, they've got legend of Zelda and that's close enough.

54:45.520 --> 54:46.560
Yeah, I guess.

54:46.640 --> 54:46.920
Yeah.

54:46.960 --> 54:53.120
I mean, they're not very similar, but if you put them side by side, I think people would be like, Oh, they kind of look similar enough.

54:53.160 --> 54:53.920
Yeah, I guess.

54:54.520 --> 54:55.000
All right.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.360
Well, it was, it was worth a tinfoil hat.

54:57.680 --> 55:00.760
Was it edited out?

55:00.800 --> 55:02.280
No, I'm not going to edit it out.

55:02.280 --> 55:02.800
It's live.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.040
All right.

55:04.040 --> 55:05.280
Uh, let's move on.

55:05.480 --> 55:09.320
So a followup to something we talked about last week.

55:09.320 --> 55:22.760
So, um, do you remember last week on the show, we had talked about a very interesting rumor about the fact that beyond good and evil two may be getting the Bayonetta two type of treatment.

55:22.840 --> 55:31.960
But on the NX, meaning that Nintendo is funding beyond good and evil two, hypothetically, allegedly for these rumors, uh, to be an NX exclusive.

55:32.280 --> 55:35.000
And while many of us said, Oh, okay, you know, rumor, LOL.

55:35.000 --> 55:35.960
Wouldn't that be interesting?

55:35.960 --> 55:45.720
But then very interesting development this week, Ubisoft asked Destructoid, the original source of the story to remove that story.

55:46.560 --> 55:49.280
And what happens when that happens?

55:49.840 --> 55:51.440
Your tinfoil hat goes back on.

55:51.480 --> 55:52.000
Yes.

55:52.400 --> 55:56.360
It's something we call the Streisand effect, which I'm, I've never heard of that.

55:56.360 --> 55:57.680
You never heard of the Streisand effect?

55:57.680 --> 56:07.560
No, it was, um, where there were, uh, there was a picture of her house on some website somewhere and she didn't want people to know where she lived.

56:07.920 --> 56:15.760
So her lawyers requested that the picture get taken down and it only caused the picture to go everywhere on the internet.

56:16.400 --> 56:20.360
The type of thing where it's like, when you try to hide it, it just shines a giant spotlight on it.

56:20.440 --> 56:22.160
That's, that's what the Streisand effect is.

56:22.600 --> 56:28.680
So, um, and I really abbreviated that story, but you know, I'm a couple glasses in at this point.

56:29.160 --> 56:34.400
Um, so anyway, now that Ubisoft has come out and said, please take that story down.

56:34.640 --> 56:37.840
It kind of lends credence to the fact that it's true.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.520
Uh, so we'll see.

56:41.280 --> 56:47.520
I'm just saying we here at OLR have experienced something like that firsthand.

56:48.360 --> 56:54.360
And I'll let those of you who were around in 2006 fill in the gaps on what, uh, what that all meant.

56:55.600 --> 56:57.560
Meanwhile, why don't we go to another story, Dar Sakura.

56:58.680 --> 57:00.760
Well, I have to thank Reginator for this one.

57:01.640 --> 57:09.520
Um, there is a browser run NES emulator, except it's not just any NES emulator.

57:09.880 --> 57:12.400
It runs them in a kind of 3D.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.960
It's kind of weird.

57:13.960 --> 57:15.360
It's called 3Dness.

57:15.880 --> 57:19.640
Um, it's not perfect.

57:19.640 --> 57:32.520
I think it's still kind of beta right now, but, um, it basically has like any kind of surface, like a walking surface and a wall have a 3D effect to it.

57:32.920 --> 57:41.440
Um, now the, the sprites themselves, like the, uh, you know, character sprites and, you know, like one of the examples was the pills in Dr. Mario.

57:41.920 --> 57:48.680
Those are really flat kind of Parappa-ish, but it's kind of, kind of interesting.

57:48.880 --> 57:52.200
And yeah, it runs, um, actually only in Firefox, but it runs.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.600
Um, some people have speculated as to what makes it run.

57:56.240 --> 58:03.680
Um, but I think that the end goal is that there's going to be, uh, an executable version of that later on for everybody.

58:04.920 --> 58:10.640
It gave me a bit of a headache watching it because, yeah, it's okay.

58:10.680 --> 58:19.400
It's one of those things where it's like, it's a really neat concept, but, um, and yeah, going to our chat over at live.fognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says it perfectly.

58:19.600 --> 58:22.320
The 3D looks cool, but it's not practical.

58:22.600 --> 58:24.920
Uh, Dartitsuya says, I've seen videos of that on YouTube.

58:24.920 --> 58:30.840
It still looks a little bit rough in spots, but I'll forgive them for still being in early stages, but it's a neat effect.

58:31.240 --> 58:39.080
I mean, if you want to see, like, I was just looking through the little video on that again, and one of the bad ones, at least as far as the splash screen was Contra.

58:39.560 --> 58:44.720
The Mega Man ones look pretty neat, you know, it's just got like an odd shadow effect to it.

58:44.720 --> 58:54.880
And then it's, I think what it does is that it takes the side parts of the layers and the top parts of them and sort of extends them back like an image.

58:55.400 --> 58:58.240
It looks okay, but it just is kind of disruptive.

58:58.240 --> 59:02.000
And when I watch it, it makes my, my head hurt more.

59:03.080 --> 59:05.040
Bobby will love me for this comment.

59:05.040 --> 59:12.440
Maybe it's to help 8-bit games be easily ported into the Oculus Rift by adding that 3D element.

59:12.440 --> 59:14.800
Okay, here's another weird one is Super Mario 3.

59:15.480 --> 59:23.040
This one's really kind of screwed up because Mario runs behind the bushes and everything.

59:24.400 --> 59:32.080
And then like the ones that you can actually do the drop down behind, like the white one, he actually shows up behind it.

59:32.080 --> 59:37.400
It's just really an odd effect for the way that this turns out for the emulation.

59:37.400 --> 59:39.880
Like the clouds are kind of drifting backwards.

59:39.880 --> 59:53.400
I'll put it this way, this effect only really works for, I would say just block images and not any of the rounded sprites or graphic effects.

59:53.400 --> 01:00:04.320
You know, what might be an interesting use of this is that when you look at the YouTubes and stuff, it kind of goes, it goes like full throttle with these effects.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.120
And maybe subtlety is the key to make this a really awesome effect.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:19.520
And what I'm thinking of is, you know how on the 3DS, you have the pictures that you collect the puzzle pieces right on StreetPass, and you make these pictures.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:34.880
And when you unlock the pictures, they're in 3D, but they have a very subtle effect that if you actually use the control pad, you can tilt it a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right, up and down, but not like crazy, like 360 degrees and all this stuff.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:43.480
Maybe it'd be kind of cool, like for any defect that maybe like with the tilt or a little bit, it would do a very slight tilt in the 3D or something.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.880
But again, how practical is that? I don't know. It's more one of those like, cool, now turn it off.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.360
Well, it looks like it's a blanket effect that tries to apply it to everything.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.560
And I don't think it's got any sort of way of...

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.120
Actually, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think that it's extending the surfaces into the into the background.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.640
I think it's extending them into the foreground.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:17.960
So that's why when you see a character walk around something that might be kind of a separate layer, it's actually having him go behind it when it tries to apply the effect.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:24.680
Yeah, I think this is like a blanket effect that's supposed to be doing the whole thing, but it doesn't quite work for everything.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.840
So just saying.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.960
OK, well, we'll see, you know, this is probably going to be one of those things.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.240
It's like, oh, it's really cool.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.040
But then, you know, we probably won't see a lot of practical use for it.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.200
But, you know, I'll link video of it to the chat room.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.640
Just because it's not necessarily practical doesn't mean this guy hasn't had a heck of an achievement with it.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.800
And I think that's that's a really cool kind of tech thing to show that he can do it.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:59.840
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, actdeftinchat says, I prefer what the 3D classic games on the Nintendo 3DS do or what Shovel Knight on the 3DS does.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:06.720
Yeah, I like I like the classic games on the 3DS too, just with the very subtle like the planes are just on different levels.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.120
I think that's that's cool.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.240
So it's it's interesting if this might automate a little more of that.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.200
But anyway, let's move on.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.680
All right.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:32.480
So if you remember that show you guys did after PlayStation Experience, one of the games I raved about and probably my game of the show, if it wasn't for like ResVR, was Thumper, which is a rhythm violence game.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.320
And it's amazing.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.320
And there was a PlayStation blog about it this past week.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.160
And it's coming to PSVR.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.000
And that is so cool.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:54.360
So now there are at least two games for PSVR that are worth your time and it can still be played in 2D on PS4 or if you get PSVR, it's going to be in full 3D.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.720
And that just makes me super excited for this game.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.720
And I love Thumper and it's so much fun.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.560
Apparently at Best Buy, it's on the demos.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.760
They're kiosks.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.000
I had no idea until I just read about it.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:15.880
So everybody should go out to your local Best Buy and try it out and see if you like it, especially if you're a fan of rhythm games, because that's what it is.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.520
It's just a rhythm game that's really intense.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:27.160
So since you've played Thumper and since you've had time on the PlayStation VR, obviously you didn't get to do both because it was an announcer there.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:27.320
Yeah.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.280
But do you think Thumper is a game that will work well in VR?

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:31.840
Yes.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:39.400
Do you think it's a game that's going to translate into VR and will be given something additional from the VR?

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.800
I'm not sure if it'll be given something additional.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.080
I think it may be the preferred way to play.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:53.640
It was actually a question I asked the guy at the booth was if it was going to come to PSVR and he said he wasn't sure at that time.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.960
Clearly he was a liar because there's no way this just started happening.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.120
But I think it's going to be a lot more fun in VR.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:12.880
However, if you have like a really nice sound system for your entertainment setup, that may be the better way to go because the music, I mean, it's all about musical cues for the rhythm aspects of this game.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.320
So like the better you can hear it, probably the more you'll get out of it.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.560
But I would want to play it in VR.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.120
I think that'd just be way too much fun.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:27.360
So even though you're on a game hiatus, I can still be super hyped for an awesome game like Thumper.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.360
But do you think PlayStation VR is going to break you?

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.840
No, because I'm pretty sure Pokemon Sun and Moon will be out before PSVR.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.960
Well, we'll know this. We're getting the answer this week.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.680
We are?

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.760
On PlayStation VR, yeah. Isn't GDC this week?

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.240
But did they say they're going to announce the date?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.560
Well, PlayStation is doing a VR press conference, basically.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:54.760
So and we know it's about VR, so I'm not sure what else there is to announce, especially since they said.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.280
I know they just announced Thumper.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:56.960
So what else?

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.000
I mean...

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.600
Date and price. Call me crazy, but that would be...

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.280
Crazy.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.720
All right. Well, I am crazy for a little game on my cell phone called Ingress.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.040
And I'm really excited that the same company is making a game called Pokemon Go.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.720
And I'm really, really excited to check this out.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.800
But what's weird is that Niantic actually backed out of GDC to do a panel there.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.200
And we've talked about that before.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:28.440
But what did come up this week is that they are going to be doing a beta test for Pokemon Go.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.280
A legit one.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.240
Not one of the spam things you see online that's trying to get your personal information.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.680
But Niantic has actually announced a legitimate one.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.400
And you have to have an Android or an iOS device.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.800
You can go to the official website at NianticLabs.com and register.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.600
Oh, and you also have to live in Japan because it is a Japanese...

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.520
Darsaka just made a face.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.800
Like she was really excited for this.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.360
And now, oh, by the way, you also have to live in Japan.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.920
And that is something that's supposed to kick off a little later this month.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.240
There will be an NDA attached to it, but ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.280
That is going to get broken within seconds.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.040
Let's be real.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.960
So, yeah, we'll see what the game is all about once that rolls out a little later this month.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:17.800
I really wish there wasn't an NDA because I would like to see what it's actually going to look like if it's worth the time.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.200
It's going to get broken.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.200
I know, I know, I know.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.800
But I don't want to have to wait an extra minute to know the information.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.560
I want it as soon as I can.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:31.480
Uh, SSG100Matt over at live.vognetwork.com says, I don't trust any Pokemon Go beta signups.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.920
There are so many scams involved with fake beta signups.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:40.880
That's why you should only go to Niantic's official site, NianticLabs.com, and that will have the link if you're in Japan.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:46.160
If you are AkumaJP, who I don't see in chat right now, the Daylight Savings might've messed stuff up for his time, but...

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160
Do they even have that there?

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:53.600
Uh, well that's why, because we observed it and other places didn't, the time shifted of this show for other people.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.320
Um, so, but anyway, maybe he'll sign up.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:04.440
I don't even know if this is something that interests him though, but hopefully somebody we know over there will get in and send me some screenshots and let me know what to look forward to.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:16.280
But I just, I feel like, especially within the Ingress circles, people will start sharing screenshots within the Ingress circles and they'll make their way out as things tend to spread around the internet.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.400
That's what usually happens.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.880
Uh, I do want to mention this though, since we are talking about Pokemon.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:30.560
Pokemon Go will not be the only Pokemon mobile game, which makes sense because we already have the Pokemon, uh, match three game.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.240
I always forget the name of, what's that game called?

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240
The Pokemon, uh, shuffle, shuffle full.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:34.720
Yes.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.600
I actually like to say Pokemon Puzzle League.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.320
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.280
That's a different match for game.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:49.200
Uh, anyhow, the Pokemon company has announced a collaboration with Heroes, which is a Japanese startup on a free to play strategy board game called Pokemon Co-Master.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:55.720
Uh, this is something where, uh, Heroes, I guess previously did board game apps and an AI system.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.360
Um, so this technology is going to be used in Pokemon Co-Master.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:06.440
So this is a, uh, uh, app that is scheduled to come out in the spring in Japan around iOS and Android platforms.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.720
So lots more Pokemon coming to your cell phone for the 20th anniversary.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.400
Let's move on Dark Soccer.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.160
You know, it's not going to come on your regular 3DS SNES games.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.800
Oh yes, this again.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.120
Well, Nintendo did put out a statement and I'm just going to read it as is.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:34.600
Um, as previously announced new Nintendo 3DS has an improved CPU, which enables Super NES games to run on the system with quality results.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:46.800
The Super NES games also include perfect pixel mode, which allows players to see their games in their original TV resolution and aspect resolution, um, which sounds to me like

01:08:50.800 --> 01:09:03.240
I mean, I understand that emulators have proved proven that there are some games that won't handle perfectly, but still if the 3DS can play Nintendo 64 games.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.160
Why can't it do mode seven?

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:13.240
You know, the, the, here's the thing, the tech stuff, I got into it on Twitter this week, not into it, but you know, respectfully.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.880
And so I had a lot of tech stuff thrown at me on Twitter.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.000
And so it's kind of like, okay, I get it.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:30.160
You know, I understand that there is some complexities that come with the emulation, especially with all the different, um, like they, they use this game as an example.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.080
The, um, Speedy Gonzalez, I think is the game they use as an example.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.360
Um, where certain things won't happen if a mode is not enabled perfectly.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:47.160
And I think it has to do more with, do you want to emulate the Super Nintendo perfectly takes a lot of power or do you want to do it half-assed?

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:59.560
But one of these stories that I was linked to, actually, I kind of think gave a little credit to the whole, well, if Nintendo put a little more work in it, they could probably pull it off.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:06.520
And that was about the whole emulator, SNES 9X, which back in the day was an early Super Nintendo emulator.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:15.080
Uh, and what it did for certain games was for like the top 50 games, it had pre-established speed settings already in there for the top 50 games.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:22.440
And I think that was part of the problem with the emulation is that because it can really vary so much on Super Nintendo, some games will run too fast.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.360
Some games will run too slow.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:35.160
Uh, for example, you might try to go play The Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo and the Triforce animation in the beginning will be wrong because it rotates too fast, like that type of thing.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:49.560
So, I mean, from that perspective, I kind of get it, but I, here's the thing, a lot of what goes on in gaming, like it or not, a lot of what goes on in gaming is perception.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.080
Like it or not, perception goes a long way.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:11:06.120
And so the fact is when the 3DS can emulate Game Boy Advance, but it can't do Super Nintendo, the perception is Nintendo's holding off because they want more money.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:14.680
But the reality at this point for me and this story is I'm kind of like, there's really no debate left here.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.760
Like if you're telling me they can't do it from a technical standpoint, fine, I accept that.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:28.920
The reality is, was I going to buy this anyway? Was I going to buy Pilotwings for the third time anyway? No. I'm not going to pay full price for another game like that.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.240
Wait, buy Pilotwings for the third time? Why did you buy it for a second time?

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.160
On the Wii and on the Wii U.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.000
But it's just Pilotwings. It's not worth the second purchase.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.440
But I'm just saying that the reality is that it was purchased twice.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:57.320
Anyway, so I'm not going to get, but even if it was the second time, I still wouldn't, because some might argue, but there was a discount that, okay, fine, whatever, I still wouldn't get it again just to play on the 3DS because it's just not.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:09.400
Now, if Nintendo was putting out more virtual console games or virtual console games that were kind of new and interesting, like I don't know, second Densetsu 3 or something that we never got to experience before,

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.720
then maybe I would care a lot more, but the games they're putting out, and yes, I'm even saying this about EarthBound.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.880
I'm totally content with the fact that I can just play EarthBound on the Wii U. That's fine. I don't need it on my 3DS.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:31.240
Disagree. I'm like happy that, at least for some of those games, that they're going to be portable on 3DS now.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:38.040
Having Super Metroid on there, brilliant. Love that. Having Link to the Past, great.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:44.280
Having EarthBound, even better. When it came out on Wii U, I was like, man,

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:51.000
I wish this was just on the 3DS instead because I actually prefer my RPGs handheld now for some reason.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.320
So I just want more games from Nintendo to come out. I want the Japanese list.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.200
Well, I have a Japanese 3DS, so it doesn't even matter, but that would have been so much better to have all those games.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:10.360
So here's the thing. If my old 3DS could have played them, would I be buying a few games here

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.320
and there to check it out? Probably. I probably would have ended up picking up EarthBound and

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.440
some of the, like Super Metroid, yeah. Okay, Super Metroid's a game I'll buy 50 times, let's be real.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:26.680
I probably would have bought that, but am I really, am I going, I think the question on the table is,

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:31.800
am I going to buy a new 3DS just so I can play Super Nintendo games? No, but you should buy it

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:36.600
for other reasons. What? What other reasons? Xenoblade. Which is playable on the Wii.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.920
Yeah, but it's not on your, it's not handheld. Like, I'm not convinced the new 3DS, but here's the

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:49.560
other thing, Shane. The NX is how far away? I'm just gonna wait for the NX. That's the, that's the

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:55.960
biggest thing right now against me getting the new 3DS is that we have a really good feeling, like,

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:01.480
you know, our guts say the NX is going to be a partially portable system, so why would I drop

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.520
200 bucks on a new 3DS right now when I know an NX is about to come out? I'm gonna wait. How much

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.360
did you say you were gonna drop on it? I don't know, what are they even right now, 179? They're

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.880
175 at some places for the XL and then, like, you can get deals on the regular. But I don't,

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.760
I don't play enough portable gaming to justify that, like, why won't you accept the answer that

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.880
I'm just not interested? Because, as somebody who buys every Nintendo handheld multiple times,

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.680
I just don't understand. Great, then buy another one for me.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:38.520
Anyway, uh, all right, let's, uh, you know, in college I got two Game Boy Advance SPs,

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.520
a blue one and a red one, because I was going to a university whose colors were blue and red.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.600
I'm with Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.360
I can't even with Shane right now.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.720
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Country Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.880
use the passphrase, tooth. So, all right, uh, let's, let's travel around the world and check

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.880
out some release dates. Let's check out some games that you can play on a variety of platforms,

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.360
and we'll start with the US. Were you able to get the US dates in Loki's absence, Shane?

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.520
Yeah, I'm just using the, the link you told me to go to, so if they're wrong it's your fault.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.240
All right, cool.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:22.760
All right, um, so this week, on the 15th, for Xbox One and PS4 you've got EA Sports

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:30.920
UFC 2. Uh, on PC you've got Need for Speed. On PS4 you've got something called Salt and Sanctuary.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:38.520
On Win- or on PC, PS4 and Xbox One you have Sheltered. On the 16th, on Xbox One you have

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:45.160
Dungeon of the Endless. On Xbox One you also have Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:53.560
On the 18th you have, on the 3DS, Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. And then the big,

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.200
probably released for Nintendo this week, really, on Wii U will be Pokken Tournament.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.200
That's this week.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:00.920
Kind of a big deal.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:06.920
Yes, and remember to buy your early copies so you can get your Shadow Mew Two card.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:07.960
Or don't.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.240
But you probably will.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:09.880
You probably will.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.600
All right, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.160
On the PlayStation 4 this week, Battlefield 4 gets a premium edition into the Best Hits

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.520
collection, so a little price reduction on that. As far as new stuff goes, though, there is

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:33.400
Senran Kagura Estival vs. Shoujo Tachi no Sentaku Regular and Sakura edition come out this week,

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:41.000
on the 17th. Over on the Wii U, Pokken Tournament gets its release in Japan as well this week,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and you can get a tournament controller or a Pro Pad that goes with that if you want,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.760
over in Japan. On the Vita this week in Japan, Wanda Fortune R comes out on the Vita. Also,

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:59.080
Omerta Code, Tycoon Kai, and Digimon World Next Order comes out in Japan this week.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.600
Which reminds me, I forgot to watch the new episodes of Digimon Try.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.880
I did not even know new stuff for Digimon was airing.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.840
It's set after Digimon Zero 2, so it's the original team.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:17.560
I see. And then over on the 3DS this week, there's really not a lot of new games,

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.600
but Japan is getting that same... You know how we got a bunch of price reduced games here on

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.000
Nintendo platforms? What are they calling that, Shane? Do you remember?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:25.720
Nintendo Selects.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.800
That's it, Nintendo Selects. In Japan, they're calling it the Happy Price Selection.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.600
So the Happy Price Selection is getting releases such as Luigi's Mansion 2,

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.680
Kuma Tomo, Nintendogs Plus Cats, and what might be of interest to some people,

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:47.000
Taiko no Tatsujin, Chibi Dragon 2, Fushijina Orb is also getting a price reduction.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.240
So check out some of those releases in Japan if you want.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.320
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.400
Well, I'm trying to still act deaf something, but fine.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.240
He can wait.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:05.080
Yeah. For the UK, we have, on the 16th, Dungeon of the Endless on Xbox One,

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:11.160
the 17th Mutant Mud Super Challenge, Need for Speed, and Obscura Test for PC.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:14.840
And on the 18th, we have Pokken Tournament, and that's it.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.200
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.240
But first, Shane.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.680
Oh, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. What?

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.280
Wake up, next story.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.520
Okay, and I don't know why I'm getting all the things being cancelled stories.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.000
So, also cancelled.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.840
You're a downer. Let's be real.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:39.000
Also cancelled is EverQuest Next. Sorry.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:47.480
And so, that's it. It's cancelled. I didn't read the story. I was watching dog video.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.360
Um, um, um, um.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:50.920
This is something-

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:51.720
Hold on!

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.180
Okay.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.160
You want more wine, Shane?

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:55.720
What?

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.840
You want more wine?

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.600
I already poured me more wine. Thank you.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:05.480
Um, so, President of Daybreak Games Russell Shanks said,

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.880
uh, when we decided to create the next chapter in the EverQuest journey, we didn't aim low.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.600
We set out to make something revolutionary.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.200
Unfortunately, as we put together the pieces, we found that it wasn't fun.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.680
That is the best reason to cancel games.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.680
Did he really just say, sorry guys, we didn't set the bar low enough?

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.520
Is that what I'm hearing?

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.720
No, no. You have- because you're drunk. No.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:34.440
He's saying that they were trying to make the best game they could, but what they made wasn't fun.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:40.280
I wish more developers would realize this, like, before they get too far into the process,

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:45.400
because I have a story from Konami that is just hilarious that I probably shouldn't talk about.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.680
Um, anyway.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:54.120
So, while EverQuest Next is not going forward, Landmark, um, is.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.280
And it's going to launch this spring for 10 bucks.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:02.920
So, Landmark, I think, was the, uh, like, the build whatever you want sort of thing in EverQuest.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.120
Yeah, and some of the, like, all-star stuff from that game was supposed to make its way

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.440
to EverQuest Next. Like, the two were supposed to kind of, uh, be in the same universe anyway,

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.600
so maybe they can just fold whatever they had into Landmark, which would make sense.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:19.720
Maybe. Um, but hopefully they don't fold the un-fun things that he was talking about into it.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.840
Hopefully it's a pretty safe bet that those are not coming over.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:30.680
Mmm. All right, uh, well, let's get into this next story, and, uh, this is a tricky situation,

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:36.520
and, um, it involves people we've had on this show before, and people that, um, may actually

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:41.400
still listen to this show. Um, so I have to kind of be careful how I, how I, uh, approach this,

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:46.280
because I'm going to admit, I don't really know a lot of what is going on here. I'm just seeing a

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.920
lot of the fallout on what's happening on Twitter and so forth, and, uh, it's very interesting.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.600
And then, unfortunately, I think just shows the difficulty and what goes with

01:20:54.600 --> 01:21:00.520
releasing a new console and putting out, um, new ideas out there. So, here's the deal. About a

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:06.120
month ago, the Coleco Chameleon, do you remember what the Coleco Chameleon was? This was that retro

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.720
video game console that was born of that retro magazine community, uh, ended up, I guess,

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:15.800
teaming up and getting the rights with Coleco to put their name on it, and, uh, so it was going to

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.800
end up being the Coleco Chameleon. I know we've talked about this on the show previously. So,

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:26.680
the Coleco Chameleon actually showed up at a toy fair and people were able to, uh, check it out.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.720
That same toy fair that had all the Power Rangers toys. I was going crazy.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:36.440
Yes. And you didn't go to, and so you didn't get to do this. Um, Coleco ended up as a result of

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.320
what happened at toy fair and showing the device at toy fair is that Coleco actually basically

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:47.080
terminated the association they had with retro VGS and the whole Chameleon project in a statement

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:52.040
saying, retro has decided that the work they have created is not sufficient to demonstrate at this

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:56.760
time. Consequently, we can no longer proceed with the project and the Chameleon project will be

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:02.760
terminated. This separation is amicable. We wish retro luck in the future. The thing is, this was

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:08.840
a bit of a one, two punch because the managing editor of retro magazine actually announced on

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:14.280
LinkedIn that he was going to be leaving the company and cited, in fact, the ongoing issues

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:21.080
with Chameleon as part of the reason why they were leaving. I have to separate myself from

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:28.120
everything associated with it. Retro VGS, the Facebook page, I guess suddenly disappeared.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.240
I haven't checked the Twitter today, but when I checked the Twitter the other day, it hadn't

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:36.680
updated in a little bit. I will have to look into that. Um, and then, uh, yeah, so unfortunately

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:42.280
it's, it's not looking too good over there. I will say this, since I do know that there are

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:47.320
people involved with the project who may still be listening to OLR, uh, open fair forum. If you

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:53.240
want to come on here and just, just tell us like it is what's going on, uh, happy to have that,

01:22:53.240 --> 01:23:01.960
uh, open invite. Um, and with that, I kind of feel like, and again, this is perception. What did I

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.840
say during a few stories ago? So I'm just going off perception. I don't know the inner workings

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:12.600
of what, you know, happened with this, but my perception is that when you are creating a big,

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.000
big project, and this can even be a video game and even tying into what we said about, you know,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.040
Microsoft and Lionhead Studios and all that earlier is that when you're making a big video

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.120
game, there are certain steps along the way, certain hurdles you have to clear, certain

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:28.280
deadlines you have to meet to be able to convince people that the project should continue to be

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:34.840
funded. And the perception I'm getting is that maybe they had to cut some corners. We'll put it

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:41.560
that way to get a device out at Toy Fair that would, uh, be able to get this out in the public

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:46.360
and meet some of those goals. But unfortunately, when it kind of turned out that what they were

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.520
showing at Toy Fair was not really the same thing that they were saying this device was going to be,

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:56.520
that's when essentially the landmark was considered failed and Coleco had to pull out that

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:02.120
that seems to be my perception of what's going on here. Um, anyway, I know people are looking

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.800
forward to the device. I hope they're able to find a path forward and continue this,

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.280
but I can certainly imagine that this one, two punch may be a little tricky to recover from,

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:16.520
but maybe they can find another investor. Uh, who knows, uh, some comments from chat over at live.vog

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:22.120
and network.com. Dark Tetsuya in chat says word was the proto was just a Super Nintendo and or

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.960
a video capture card in the Coleco shell. Yeah, I was hearing that too. Um, I wasn't there, so I

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.440
can't say. Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, I really don't know what to make of everything that happened. I

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.320
heard a lot of things. Everything just seemed to go downhill since the Toy Fair fiasco. Um,

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:44.120
well, I mean, if, if it was coming that Coleco was going to pull out, some people see that as,

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.760
oh shit, I might be on a sinking ship. And that might be the cause of what's starting to snowball

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:55.480
from this. But, um, I don't know. Again, this is, this is tricky. So I'm going to try and end this

01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:02.760
on a positive note with something that I think is kind of neat. The Coleco folks are coming out of

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.320
this and pretty quickly getting around to asking on their Facebook. And they did this on Friday.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:13.800
They actually went to social media to ask the public, would they be interested in a mini arcade

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:19.560
revival? Now I love these things when I was a kid and surely Dark Sakura has to know these little

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.520
devices. They were the very tiny little tabletop devices that actually looked like arcade machines.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:30.120
There was Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Frogger, Donkey Kong. Yeah, I always wanted one too. And I never

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:36.680
got one, but apparently Coleco is considering bringing those back. Um, and they use this thing

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:42.040
called a VFD, a vacuum fluorescent display, which sort of, you know, they're able to do color with

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.960
it, although it's still kind of limited, like an old LCD game, like a Mr. Game and Watch type of

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:52.120
thing, but it actually looked kind of cool. So, uh, anyway, they're actually having a discussion

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.120
on their Facebook page. Uh, and you can check that out over on the Coleco Facebook page. That

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.560
might be an interesting thing that might come out of this. Uh, I would like to see those games. I

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:05.400
don't know about you. Anyhow, uh, let's move on. We're going to get to the classic game of the

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.480
week. Every week, uh, Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:17.240
hey, you brats ought to check this game out this week. Uh, sadly not a Coleco game this week,

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:22.040
but a very good game nevertheless. So Dark Sakura, what did you decide that the kids need to play

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.000
this week? The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening. No need to break out the brick for this.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:38.760
It's just sound familiar. Um, in Japan, it was called, um, Zelda no Densetsu Yume no- Yumeo

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:48.120
Mirishima, which was, uh, Legend of Zelda Dream Island. Um, it came out in 1993, um, developed by

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:54.360
Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, and it was published for the Game Boy. It was the,

01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:01.320
uh, fourth installment in the Legend of Zelda series. Um, it was also the first portable

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:09.800
version. Um, so it actually began as a port of Link to the Past, uh, developed just after hours

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:16.680
by Nintendo. Um, and the project then, uh, grew into an original one. Um,

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:25.400
and, uh, basically it did a few more firsts. It was the first one not set in Hyrule.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:33.000
Didn't include Zelda or the Triforce. So it starts off with Link stranded on, um, an island,

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:41.720
uh, guarded by, uh, the Wind Fish. And so basically you fight through puzzles and

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.440
search for these different musical instruments so that you can wake the Wind Fish and escape from

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:57.560
the island. Um, it did, uh, so well. It was so, uh, so loved that there was a remake for the Game Boy

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:05.160
Color in 1998, um, called The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening DX, and it had full color graphics,

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:12.760
and you could use the Game Boy Printer with it, and had an exclusive color-based dungeon. Um,

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:19.160
the two together, the two versions have sold more than six million units around the world, and it's,

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:28.280
uh, a classic. I mean, really it is. Um, as far as, uh, you know, more of the story, you do have,

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:35.480
like, a mention of Zelda but not too much else. Um, the game also, interesting, has, uh,

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:42.840
advice given to you by other NPCs, um, that, like, there's actually a character who communicates with

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:50.680
Link by the telephone. Um, there also are cameos from other Nintendo titles. There's Wart, Yoshi,

01:28:50.680 --> 01:29:01.320
Kirby, um, Dr. Wright from SimCity, who's called Mr. Wright, and, um, uh, another, uh,

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:09.960
character from a, uh, looks like a Japanese-only game. Um, his name is, uh, Richard, and he's from,

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:17.720
uh, Karunotame ni Kanewanaru, so, which, yeah, that looks like old school Game Boy.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:24.680
It's called For Frog the Bell Tolls, to translate it. Um, you also have Chomp. You remember Chomp

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:33.800
from the various Mario games. He's so cute. Um, there's also a glitch involving the,

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.960
the Chain Chomp, from what I understand. You also see Goombas and all kinds of other things, so

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:48.760
it's basically just kind of out there for a Legend of Zelda game. In fact, the director, um,

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:56.360
uh, Tezuka Takashi said that it's supposed to be, it makes it feel more like a parody of the

01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:02.440
Zelda series. Um, including characters even breaking the fourth wall, um, like the little

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:09.160
children telling you how to save the game, but then they don't admit that they understand what

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:16.120
they're talking about. So, it's a pretty, pretty interesting one. It's, you know, it's again

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:23.880
another, uh, overhead perspective, a Zelda game, but there's also jumping mechanics and

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:30.680
side-scrolling sequences that are kind of like, um, Zelda 2, and, you know, special items and

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:37.880
different things like that. And, uh, you can also fish in it and play songs on an ocarina,

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:45.000
um, so different type of, you know, stuff like that. And it is a classic, but, you know, the

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.480
other thing too is it really did, the DX version did make advantage of that old Game Boy printer.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:57.240
Who remembers that? You could print out, like, really bad pixelated pictures that you would take.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:06.120
Um, so there you go. That's the game. I remember playing this on Game Boy Color,

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:09.560
because I think that's the only way you can do it is on Game Boy Color. I could not do it on the

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.160
black and white one. Did you know that this game also has, um, a Guinness World Record award?

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:20.200
No, I didn't. Um, it's 42nd place in the Guinness World Records 2009 list of top 50 most

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:26.600
influential and important video games of all times. Interesting. I wonder how many Zelda

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:34.840
games made that list. I'm sure a lot of them did. So there it is, your classic game of the week,

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:41.160
Link's Awakening, the classic one in the Zelda series. And of course, with the whole, uh,

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:45.800
Twilight Princess being re-released on Wii U, it's very timely as well. All right, we're going to

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.800
take a quick break, everybody. Uh, but when we come back, there is plenty more OLR to come.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:54.600
We'll get to the Fugu question of the week. We'll get to, uh, an acquisition in the gaming industry

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.320
and, uh, Ooh, the latest in copyright infringement on YouTube. That should be fun.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:04.280
We'll talk about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:17.320
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with the continuation of our 634th

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:25.000
episode for this March the 13th of 2016. Myself, Dark Sakura here in studio with Shane filling in

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.960
for Loki tonight, who is home with a sick kid and we hope they are feeling better soon. Uh,

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:35.800
this week, St. Patrick's day. Uh, do you guys do anything to celebrate St. Patrick's day? No. I

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.640
know some cities have big events and things like that. I was seeing some pictures from my friends

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:43.400
in Chicago that were having a good old time this weekend. Which is purely an American holiday

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:50.920
anyway. Well, it is. Let's be real. We've, we've ruined a lot of holidays here. I'm sure, uh,

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.960
Cinco de Mayo here is probably not like what it is other places. Let's be real.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.800
Well, and I'll, I'll tell you this. Cinco de Mayo is not really celebrated anywhere else in the

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:08.440
country. No, I'm serious. I had never even known it was an actual holiday. Um, until I moved to

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:14.520
California. And then again, we had Mardi Gras first. People just use it for $5 margarita

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:20.440
specials. Mobile, Alabama had Mardi Gras first. Don't let anyone tell you differently because

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.160
they're lying. But was it the kind of Mardi Gras where you showed your boobies for beads?

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:31.800
No, because New Orleans took that and ruined the holiday. And for that, by the way, I guarantee

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.920
you anyone who does that for real in New Orleans will end up arrested within the next 10 minutes.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:42.360
I kid you not. They have the entire force out in patrol.

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.320
All right. Uh, enough holidays. Let's, uh, let's get back into some gaming news with some rapid

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:50.200
fire news. We're going to get to the Fugu question of the week after this. And of course,

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:55.000
your phone calls coming up later in the show at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.320
orange lounge radio. Skype is probably the best way to do it. Since everybody has that on their

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:03.640
smartphones at this point, you can add us on Skype, orange lounge radio. That's all one word.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.840
Meanwhile, let's get into some rapid fire news. Shane.

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.240
Okay. I'm just going to talk about them super quick because they're rapid fire. Uh, there is

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:17.320
a Xenoblade Chronicles X, a little model kit coming out for one of the scales. Uh, the formula

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:24.920
zero frame looks like it's going around for about $70. It's super cute. The scales are awesome in

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:32.520
that game and it can transform into the vehicle mode. So that's cool. Okay. Enough about that.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:40.600
Next, uh, round one is expanding into other places, New York, Georgia, Colorado,

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:45.400
and Pennsylvania. Um, I still haven't been to a round one. We have one in San Jose.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:50.360
Why haven't we gone? Anybody? This is up for like anybody can answer this.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.520
It's got to have given me enough incentive to go. No, I'm just kidding. I don't have a good reason.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:02.360
Is that what you want? I keep wanting to go there. Um, but in San Jose this weekend,

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.880
we could have made a trip of it because rockage was this weekend in San Jose.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:12.360
And I really wanted to go, but a the weather be just, I've been like, nonstop, go, go, go. I was

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:19.000
like, I need a down weekend or I'm going to just crack. So anyway, we'll go eventually.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:29.480
Sure. Um, lastly, harmonics has ditched, um, mad cats and is now working with PDP or performance

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:36.600
design products. Um, they are going to be, uh, working with them to make the instruments for

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:44.840
rock band. And, uh, this is apparently going to, um, come out alongside a major update coming this

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:52.200
fall for rock band four. So as much crap as everybody's given mad cats over the past,

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:58.760
I don't know, whenever they started putting stuff out, um, I felt for the most part,

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:06.840
their rock band stuff was pretty quality. So it's not surprising that they are moving on since

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:13.240
I think mad cats lost like so many like high up people recently because they had a bad, bad, uh,

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:20.600
financials, but, um, maybe PDP can make even better instruments. And I'm kind of curious

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.080
about what this major rock band four feature update this fall is going to be.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.000
It almost sounds like they're going to relaunch the game in a way for this holiday season.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.840
Like you had last holiday rock band four and there'll be like the real rock band for this

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:38.920
holiday. Well then what's next year, the real, real rock band for maybe rock band 4.5. Well,

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.360
maybe that'll be this year. Maybe. All right. Um, Hey, how about rocket league? Are you guys

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.840
enjoying rocket league? Cause that game's a lot of fun and there's a new mode that's being teased

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:55.640
for the game. Rocket league is going to get a basketball mode as if, uh, hitting the ball into

01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:01.080
the goal was not enough to soccer base mode. Now there's going to be a basketball mode and yes,

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:06.760
uh, you are going to have a big wide net on the ground. It's not very tiny. It's actually a huge

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:11.000
wide net, but you do have to get the ball in the net, which means you're going to have to know the

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.920
skills with your car to be able to launch the ball into the air. So it's going to be even more

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:20.920
of a cluster fuck, honestly. Um, now we don't know when this is coming out, but considering

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:25.160
March madness starts March 15th, it's a pretty good guess that it's probably going to be time

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.520
for this month. We'll see. Um, we talked a lot about Twitch earlier in the show, but it's

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.240
important to note there are other places to stream games and YouTube gaming of course is one of them

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.880
that's been trying to gain more and more traction. Well, YouTube gaming is actually now in some more

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.360
countries. Uh, YouTube gaming earlier this week made its way to Canada, which I didn't realize

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:49.480
it wasn't in Canada. Like usually, usually they're pretty good about getting most stuff that we get

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.800
here in the U S but YouTube gaming finally expanded to Canada and three more countries,

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:59.160
Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Of course, that is the mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:05.000
Um, and YouTube is saying it will go into many more countries soon. Uh, there's also some updates

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.480
that went with that. The Android app now supports the 60 frames per second playback. So that's

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:15.000
pretty cool. Uh, and also an update on desktops. The homepage is simplified with no more sidebars.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.240
There's a live tab on the homepage that will take you to a lineup of all the top streams and games

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:23.400
that are on the air. And then you can manage games and, excuse me, and channels that you are

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:31.400
subscribed to. Uh, and lastly, if you are looking for a place to buy Japanese video games, like let's

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.400
say maybe there used to be a retailer that you used to use, and then they kind of went cuckoo

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:40.280
bananas on social media. And so you've been looking for somebody else to use, uh, Amazon

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:46.440
may now be a resource for you guys. That's so cool. Uh, Amazon, Japan will now ship video game

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.240
hardware and software international. Wait, wait, wait. Hardware's go. I heard last I heard hardware

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:57.720
was not working. Uh, according to this story, it's hardware, but, uh, cause the, the NeoGaf

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:03.960
post I was reading, um, people were trying to get a PS4 consoles. Interesting. And those weren't

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:09.880
working, but anything software related. What about Amiibo? Why there's like plenty of places

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:17.320
that sell them for just as cheap. I was worth asking. Excuse me. I don't know. I, I would assume

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:22.840
yes, but anyhow, uh, shipping is less than $10 a game. It should be noted. It doesn't matter if

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:28.600
you're an Amazon prime member. Amazon, Japan is a little bit separate. So keep that in mind. It'll

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:33.080
be interesting to see how that shifts the dynamic, uh, around, uh, dark Sakura.

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:42.360
Well, we have some interesting, uh, news from, uh, about the BAFTA. Um, there are nominations,

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:49.880
uh, out for the, uh, Academy, British Academy games award in 2016. We have, um, everybody's

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:56.200
gone to the rapture. Yay. It should win her story and the Witcher three, not Witcher three.

01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:01.800
Um, well, uh, actually let me do by, uh, the number of nominations. Everybody's gone to the

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:08.440
rapture has 10 it's the leader. Oh, um, her story and the Witcher three have seven Batman,

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:15.400
Arkham Knight, life is strange and rocket league. I'll have five. And, um, they also said that

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:22.920
Dara O'Brien is to return as the host for the award ceremony. So that's cool. And then, um,

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:30.520
Rhapsody, which is a music streaming service is going to be coming for the Wii U, um,

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:39.160
sneaking ahead of other services, such as Spotify. Um, you can also get a 30 day free

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:46.280
trial directly through the Wii U. Um, and if you live outside the U S Rhapsody operates as

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:53.960
Napster. I remember Napster over here. When it was really good and when you can get useful.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:59.480
Yes. I got so much Eurobeat that way. That's how long ago that was. Yeah. I'm like,

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:04.600
I think I got a lot of dance mania albums out of hamster. I'd also like to ask if I'm like the

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:11.160
only one of us in the room that got the meat Omo invite. I didn't get an invite, but I signed up

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:18.200
for their little network. Yeah. Um, well, Nintendo, um, has announced that the app, uh,

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:24.920
me Tomo is going to be, um, launching in Japan on March 17th. We don't have the U S state,

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:30.680
but you can register for it. I got an email for that for the Japanese one. Um,

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:34.680
since I have a Japanese Nintendo account, but I didn't pay attention.

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:43.320
Oh, is that it? Uh, yeah. All right. That's what I said. That's it. Oh, I didn't hear,

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:47.400
I didn't hear that. I'm multitasking. Takes a lot to do a radio show over here. I'm here.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:54.360
I thought I was the old one. Anyhow, let's get to the foogle question of the week. Every week,

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:57.960
uh, we ask you guys a question on our Facebook community and our Google plus community.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.280
You slam those words together and you get foogle.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.720
Uh, this week we decided to ask, how do you get your gaming news?

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:16.600
Uh, do you use a popular or indie website that you get your news from?

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.520
Does it come from social media? Cause I don't know about you guys. I get a lot from Twitter,

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:24.920
uh, podcasts or YouTube. I swear. I'm not like self promoting or what I'm generally

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:29.160
curious. Do you use podcasts or YouTube even or what have you? How do you stay informed on your

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.280
favorite games and development? So it's just kind of curious what sort of answers we'd get with

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.640
this. So, uh, Mike B starts us off saying I use YouTube. It's awesome. I used to watch G4 back

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:42.360
in the day. Now I don't think cable TV has a game show like X play, et cetera. Kind of sad since it's

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:47.800
a billion dollar industry. Uh, Bryce H says, I usually get my gaming news from my Nintendo news,

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.720
whenever someone posts to Twitter. And of course you guys. Oh, shucks. Uh,

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:55.320
Dark Tetsuya says, I also want to shout out my Nintendo news, especially in recent months. And

01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:00.520
with the NX rumblings, they've been keeping us busy with news rumors. Uh, Winston H says,

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.920
I used to get most of it from joystick before it became a part of Engadget. Otherwise now pretty

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:09.960
much from OLR and the co-optional podcast, uh, other games websites just simply have been copying

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:14.360
and pasting articles from other websites, which has become a disturbing trend, not just in games

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.880
news outlets, but also mainstream. I could go on a tangent on that, but I'm going to try really hard

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.440
not to. Okay. I'll say a little bit. The part that gets me is that somebody will copy and

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.840
paste one of those articles and then they'll put it on Facebook with one of those stupid,

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:34.280
like, here's the top six reasons why Donald Trump is a fucking asshole. As if we didn't already

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:40.280
know you won't believe number five. And it's like kind of playing on that emotion where it's like,

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:44.280
Oh, I got to see this hideous accident or whatever, you know, what's going on. It's just,

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:50.520
it's crazy. Anyway, that's just a side tangent. Um, let's see. Renji221 says, well, if I don't

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.320
get my gaming news from you guys at OLR, I usually get it from Facebook. Critical Myths says

01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:00.360
combination of podcasts and Facebook mostly. Andrew S says, my gaming news mostly comes from

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:05.640
OLR. Otherwise it's the little bit of advertising I see on Facebook and then look into on YouTube or

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:11.640
word of mouth. SSU100Matt says, I mostly follow a few indie people and a few of the major gaming

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:16.280
news sites on Twitter, but I leave it up to OLR and Bobby Black Wolf to give me the full detailed

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.000
rundown of everything I miss. Redertainment says, I like to get my news from a diverse number of

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.200
sources, not leaning towards one outlet over any others. I do avoid getting any news from Kotaku.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.480
Kotaku is the only Gawker outlet I expressly avoid. Veronica Isabel says, I get my gaming

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:37.240
news from Go Nintendo, VOG Network and word of mouth. Andy R says, pretty much all social media

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:41.160
and podcasts and occasionally straight from company press releases thanks to the site I write

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:45.560
for. Well, you have a little bit of a different perspective if you're actually working in the

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.960
media. Raginator says, I tend to check epic bundle.com, a deals aggregate site to find out

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:57.240
about any freebie games that are being given away for free. That's an interesting response because

01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:02.760
instead of following gaming news, Raginator is following gaming deals. And it's like,

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:07.720
that's the part I care about. Show me where it's cheap right now. And I imagine, you know, sites

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:11.880
like CheapAssGamer and a lot of the similar sites probably have a lot of fans that do that exact

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.280
same thing. That's what they're in it for is the deals. We do have a couple answers over on Google

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:21.000
Plus as well, where Act F says, I get my news from Reddit, Facebook and Twitter, news outlets

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:26.840
or blogs. And of course, podcasts. And lastly, Prince Peach Fuzz says, I like to watch Total

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.800
Biscuit or Angry Joe on YouTube. Podcasts are the easiest way to get it, especially for when you

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.000
have long drives and radio stations suck here in SAC. Well, except Jack FM. I had no idea that

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.360
Prince Peach Fuzz was a local. Go figure. All this time, I had no idea. So there you go. And

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.880
yeah, most of the radio stations do suck. I will say that. I'll say a shout out. I don't mind

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:52.200
saying, I like 94.7. They play a good mix of music there. So. That's like the only station I have

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:58.680
on my car. But, but usually. I listen to the USB stick station. Yeah. I just listen to my,

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:04.200
my iPhone. Honestly, most of the time it's Spotify or podcasts for me, but once in a while,

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:09.000
it's like, okay, I'll listen to the radio. And actually, what even surprises me is that sometimes

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.040
I listen to talk radio. And for some reason, even though the talk radio station here is a hugely

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.040
conservative slant, which is not my political leaning. So I usually don't have interest in it.

01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.200
But I still can't help but listen to it because it's also where you get the,

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.600
it's also where you get the traffic and weather updates and all that stuff.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:35.080
So, anyhow, that is it for the FUGL question of the week. Let's get to, actually, I'm curious

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:41.160
about you guys. What do you use for your news? For me, it is like all social media. I am so

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:48.520
informed thanks to Twitter. That is what I use is social media for news. What do you use, Dark Sakura?

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:57.880
I like, I don't really, I usually pick it up here and there. Believe it or not, I actually get

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:04.920
information from Forbes, from Fortune, because that's the financial side of it. I really like

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:13.320
Game Politics. I like the announcements from, there's actually a couple of

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:19.160
mailing lists I'm still on, press release mailing lists from some of the contacts I made at E3 years

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:26.680
ago. So I'll get some of that. But mostly, I'll also get a few of them from Rocket News,

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.520
actually, which is a more like a Japanese cultural news site, but I'll get like game

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:38.200
information and things like that. And then also just from my friends. So.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.800
Shane, what about you? How do you get your gaming news?

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.800
Most of mine come from websites. I go to, am I allowed to list them?

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:47.800
I don't really care. Whatever.

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.960
So I go to Destructoid, Silicon Era, and Kotaku. And that's it. I don't go to

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.800
any other video game sites, really. And then Twitter, I get my stuff from.

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.200
And those are my four things.

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.480
You know, what's interesting is that I wasn't, I swear I was not fishing for people to say,

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.880
Oh, LR, I love Oh LR for my news. I'm very flattered that a lot of you mentioned Oh LR.

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:16.120
But the thing about that is that I actually don't consider this a new show. Yes, we do go over video

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.960
game news. And so I'm flattered that some of you kind of rely on us to get that. But I always

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:27.000
thought of us more as a discussion show. I sort of set the bar at that people who tune into this

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:33.240
show probably already have an idea of what's going on in the gaming world. So I like to sort

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.800
of give bullet points and then talk about it. And you know, and I've mentioned that before is that

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:44.520
this show was born of, we used to go to the arcade, play DDR and Soul Calibur 2 and whatever

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.240
else was out. And then we would go to the diner that was in the parking lot, eat those fucking

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:53.960
delicious mozzarella sticks and talk shit about video games. And when I say talk shit, I mean,

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:58.120
you know, the good and the bad. And so that was always what I wanted to bring onto the radio was

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:02.120
that, you know, we would kind of have that same atmosphere where we're just at this virtual table

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:07.480
that we're all sitting at just talking about video games, but we're all informed through whatever

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.880
means. Although, and again, I'm not saying like, Oh, you can't be here if you're not informed.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.480
We still try to give the high level bullet points just in case you hadn't heard. I mean,

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.320
usually there's a couple stories here that, Oh, I didn't know that until OLR brought it up. Like

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.840
some of you probably don't follow Twitch stuff. So you probably had no idea about that divorce

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.160
thing we talked about in the beginning, but you know, some of you probably knew more about that

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:32.760
than we did. So anything you want to add to that DarkSucker? I was going to say though,

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:42.520
informed commentary is very welcome though. Yeah. Uninformed out of your ass comments. Right.

01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:48.520
Not so much. Yeah. I mean, as far as our banter and response with other individuals, I should

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:53.720
say. Sure. And I'm always for, you know, there's going to be times when we disagree. We all

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:59.240
disagree here in studio. Except you're wrong. And we can have that respectful disagreement. And even

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:03.480
with the listeners, you know, like for example, Bobby and I disagree on a lot of stuff out there,

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:08.360
but we can have a respectful dialogue and even listeners will call in and, you know, might say,

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.120
Hey, I think you guys are wrong on such and such topic. And I'll kind of hear that out.

01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:15.640
I might needle them a little bit and get them to express their viewpoint a little more,

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:20.760
but I'm all about hearing the different opinions. I just demand we keep it respectful when we get

01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:28.200
into the whole, like, you know, F you and the, the just disrespectful name calling and all that

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:32.760
stuff. I can't, I can't really deal with that. Like it's just, I'm too old for that. I am actually

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:38.760
too old for that. I really am. So what am I older than that? No, you are also too old for that.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:45.240
There's a certain bar around the age. I don't know that you just, you just get too old for this

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:54.520
shit. What? I think that was like 25. Uh, yeah, probably, probably. All right. Anyhow. Uh, let's,

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.520
let's see. I just leave you in chat over at live.vog network.com. Uh,

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:03.560
Kaijuto in chat says everyone has an agenda. So I pretty much stay away from video game news and

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:10.200
just check out release dates and try myself. Or if it's PC, I read steam reviews. Kaijuto in chat

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:15.560
says sometimes a good F you is all you need to say. There there's an appropriate way and an

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:21.160
inappropriate way to say, fuck you. Like there, there really is. There's, there's a way you can

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:27.560
say it respectfully, but it's an art. Um, you guys know I love and I take most of my cues in life

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:33.320
from RuPaul, right? And RuPaul has a great quote that I think is very appropriate. I don't care if

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:37.480
you're straight, gay, wherever on the sexuality spectrum you are, gender spectrum. I don't give

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:45.960
a fuck because I think this, this quote applies to everything. Throwing shade takes creativity.

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:53.000
Being a bitch takes none that, and I owe that one to RuPaul. Would you agree to our soccer?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:52:00.040
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. All right. I should just end the show with a RuPaul quote every week. No, I

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:04.600
don't know. All right. Uh, let's move on. Let's, uh, get to some more stories and then we'll get to,

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:09.800
uh, the, um, phone calls. So you can call in and disagree over at, uh, Oren Santerio.

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:13.480
We'll get to the mailbag too. Maybe we'll have some disagreements in the mailbag.

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:17.560
If I'm, if I can. Well, let's try to get there. Let's, uh, let's get back into some news. We'll

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:26.360
start off with Shane. So Diablo 2 got a patch. Um, now they're trying to make it so, uh, more

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:36.120
people can play it. So they patched it to work on modern platforms. Um, who cares? There's Diablo 3.

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:41.560
Go play that. You know, a game that's really supported. And don't even play that because

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:48.200
Blizzard fired Zarem. And what's the point? Just, I don't understand. You're very salty

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:53.320
about that. Aren't you? We don't know he was fired by the way. Yes, we do because he didn't get a

01:52:53.320 --> 01:53:04.120
blue post saying goodbye. He just left and that's fired. So all that personal business aside,

01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:07.880
you're not going to go back and visit Diablo 2. I've never played Diablo 2. I don't care about

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:13.240
Diablo 2. Also, I'm not playing video games, so that doesn't matter. But, um, no. Who cares about

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:19.880
Diablo 2? Diablo 3 is fine enough and that's it. Sometimes you have to know your roots in gaming.

01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:25.160
Nope. I'm never going to go play like old games that I've never played before. Well, something

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:29.400
else you probably don't care about Warcraft 3. I don't. Is also supposed to be getting a patch.

01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:35.320
Like Blizzard's patching all their old games. Who cares? Some people still play those games.

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:41.960
So they're patching the, um, crap. No, I forgot the name. The Three Vikings. Lost Vikings. That

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:46.600
would be rad if they did. They're patching the Lost Vikings to work instead of the Super Nintendo.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:52.600
It'll work on, you know, El Capitan. I think they have to patch all these things so that they run

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:57.480
better in Windows 10 since it's becoming more and more obvious that Microsoft will place you on

01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:03.080
Windows 10 one way or the other. That's not happening. They will physically remove you

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:11.480
from your workstation and put you on 10. Unless, Rob. Buy a Mac, right? No. What? Turn off your

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:16.040
updates. I heard that even if you turn off your updates, like somebody did that and then they

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:19.480
woke up the next day and it was like, welcome to Windows 10. And the person like was going to

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:25.640
throw their computer out a window. You know what? What? I still have Windows 7. Hang on. Well, I,

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:31.080
I don't hate Windows 10 though. I really don't, but it's, I, every, everybody's different. I,

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:36.440
I didn't care for Windows 8 and there's like one random laptop at work on Windows 8 and every time

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:41.800
I have to use it, I'm like, how do I computer? Like, it's just so different for me, but Windows

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:47.400
10 is fine. No, Windows 10 is garbage. Windows 8.1 was great. All right, whatever. We still use,

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:50.440
do you guys know we're still, I'm not, I guess I'm not supposed to advertise. Somebody told me

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:56.040
I shouldn't advertise this, but too late. I always run my big mouth. We still run Windows XP here on

01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:03.160
the studio computer, but it works. I am scared to upgrade to even Windows 7 because this method,

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:07.960
you heard about the crazy ordeal when I updated fucking Skype and it shut down the Skype line for

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:14.760
like a month. I'm afraid to update to even Windows 7. But anyway, I probably will eventually. I just

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:24.040
need to stop being a, a jerk. All right, let's move on. Other stories. How about League of

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:27.720
Legends? Although this story isn't actually about League of Legends, but the parent company,

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:32.200
Riot Games, who's had a lot of success with League of Legends. Well, Riot Games this week

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:37.880
acquired Radiant Entertainment. Radiant Entertainment has fighting game technology.

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:43.480
It's staffed by folks that are high up in the fighting game community, including Seth Killian,

01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:47.640
which was a former Capcom community manager and he used to do Street Fighter commentary.

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:52.840
The studio originally created by Tom and Tony Cannon. They had also founded the Evolution

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.800
Championship series. Radiant has the online fighting game Rising Thunder and the town

01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:02.840
building simulator Stonehearth. So anyhow, Rising Thunder is going to be going offline on March

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:07.960
18th. So the team can start on a new game, but Stonehearth will continue development as planned,

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:14.920
but now it will be under Riot Games. Riot Games, by the way, is not the end all be all because

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:21.480
Riot Games in turn is owned by Tencent, which is a Chinese company. But it doesn't surprise me that

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:26.040
Riot Games is trying to expand its portfolio a little bit. After all, Blizzard is much more

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:30.680
than World of Warcraft and we've really seen them expand their portfolio in recent years with things

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:34.520
like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm. So it makes sense that Riot Games wants to get into

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:41.400
other places as well. And, you know, with League of Legends being such a huge esports game,

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.640
I'm not surprised at all that they want to acquire a fighting game because that's a universe that

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:50.920
Blizzard isn't in, for starters. And that's something that, you know, they could take all

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:56.120
this expertise and try to get a fighter out there that will be at these, you know, Evolution

01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:00.920
Championship Series and these huge fighting game tournaments that will make Riot a bigger

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.240
competitor in that space. So I think that's very interesting, a very interesting turn of events

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:13.400
there. And I will check that out. DarkSagra. Well, and Bobby alluded to this in the chat room.

01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:24.360
There, Nintendo had a claim open for a video. The video was called Captain Toad Head Butts Toad

01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:31.640
Out in the Crotch. Yeah. I'm not going to say the video is the classiest thing or the most mature,

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:40.920
but it was posted under fair use and Nintendo basically put out a claim on it on copyright

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:49.000
grounds that it used footage from Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. So the claim was disputed.

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:58.040
And then four weeks after that, Nintendo rejected the dispute. So the person appealed,

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:07.640
which gives them 30 days to release the claim or issue a takedown. And so 31 days later,

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:15.960
they haven't said anything. They haven't done anything. So and even the thing about it is that

01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:24.920
the person who did it wasn't really doing it for any money. But the fact that Nintendo hasn't

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:30.840
really pursued it might give an indication on just exactly how seriously they take these

01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:43.160
kind of things. I don't even think that Nintendo even watches any of these videos or tests them.

01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:48.680
They just look out for something that has a mention of it or has been reported as having

01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:52.840
content and they just try to take down as many of them as they can. So.

01:58:52.840 --> 01:59:01.400
And on top of that, too, it looks like they also didn't give much of an explanation as to

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:04.920
really why they did it or why they didn't even reply. So that's it.

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:11.560
They really need to do something about that whole copyright system on YouTube. It is so

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:16.920
jank right now. And I've gone off telling Blue in the face about it. So I'm going to really try to

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:21.960
not do that again this week. But I'm glad to hear that when appropriate, they are backing off.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:26.200
Well, it's not a thing that they even backed off. I think they just didn't

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:33.640
care enough to put out a comment on it. But I like what the person that wrote the article

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:38.600
is the person that posted it. And I agree with this one line here. There should be some type

01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:44.680
of penalty for filing bogus bad faith copyright claims. Thank you. Absolutely. I stand by that.

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:52.680
Absolutely. And he also suggests that claimants should be required, and I'm just quoting this,

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:57.080
to actually respond to disputes and appeals, not just rejecting them with no explanation.

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:02.360
So that's it. All right. Let's move on. Shane.

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:10.920
So remember when Sony got hacked several years ago and it sucked for everybody? Well,

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:18.120
they had a class action suit that was done in 2014 where you could actually

02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:24.520
sign up to get some free stuff from them. Apparently, since March 2nd, Sony's actually

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:29.720
been compensating people for it. So if you filled out that really long form, which I'm pretty sure I

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:37.000
did, you could be eligible to get free copies of Infamous, Big Planet, and the God of War HD

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:46.760
collection on your PS3 or Vita. There was also account credits and PlayStation Network

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:51.560
subscriptions. I haven't seen anything come through, but I could have also sworn

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:56.680
that I already got compensated for this. I feel like this has happened already.

02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:02.760
We were, and this was some type of follow-up. The Sony thing was more of in good faith and not

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:07.800
ordered by the court. But there was that class action anyway, which is why a lot of companies

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:14.280
have updated their terms of use so that you can't do a class action anymore, if there's any legal

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:22.600
standing to that. But I digress. All these claims essentially were filed with the class action,

02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:27.320
and now this is the official court response. But I guess if you participated in the prior

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:32.840
reimbursement, you can't get as many games. I think you'd only get one game as opposed to two

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:35.720
or something like that. I don't even care. It's whatever.

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:41.800
NintendoManiac64 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:46.840
When Sony got hacked, which time? The 2011 time.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:54.360
No kidding. No kidding. All right. Let's move on to this story about

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:59.080
Zelda Wii U. I know a lot of people very excited about that. Who knows if Zelda Wii U will stay

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:03.800
on Wii U or if it's going to go to NX as well, although I'm sure it will at least be on Wii U,

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:11.880
if nothing else. There was a new interview that Anuma, the producer behind Zelda, did with

02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:16.920
Famitsu this week. And he mentioned that the development is progressing well and that they

02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:21.640
are very busy. He says that the game has taken shape and things have gotten easier. This means

02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:27.000
things are progressing well. I think the base of our secret sauce has always been Ocarina of Time,

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:33.560
but this time the change in flavor will be like going from Japanese food to Western style food.

02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:38.280
Perhaps players will be surprised. Look forward to it because I think we'll be able to make

02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:42.440
something new like Ocarina of Time was. So it really sounds like they're going to shake up

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:48.360
the formula with Zelda, but this isn't completely out of line with, you know, what we are expecting

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:53.080
because they've mentioned previously that they're taking more of a Skyrim influence this time and

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:57.960
so things are going to be a little different. So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.

02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:05.720
Nintendo of course has this on the schedule for late 2016 and of course the rumors are out there

02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:10.920
that it could launch on Nintendo NX side by side, but I think they will have to release on Wii U

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.600
because they've promised that. But it could be a Twilight Princess type of situation where they

02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:21.080
actually release on the GameCube and the Wii, so it'll be, you know, the Wii U and the NX.

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:26.760
So we'll see. All right, we should have enough time to get in the mailbag. Yes, so Dark Soccer

02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.000
is going to dive into the mailbag and you guys can email us every week over at participate

02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:37.000
at orangeloungeradio.com. Again, that's participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.080
email. Dark Soccer is going to dive in head first and read the emails right now. Hi, this first one

02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:51.400
comes from, well it's unsigned and has no nickname, so I'm just gonna say Sam. Um, it's about Rock Band 4.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:57.240
I just, uh, just wanted to say back when music games were huge, I purchased Guitar Hero 3 for PC.

02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:03.080
The game was a port done by Aspire and when they added in graphics, and they added in graphics

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:08.920
options. The game was a super, was super resource intense, but was gorgeous and ran so much better

02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:15.240
than the console options. The only thing that sucked was using the Xbox guitars, as that is what

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:21.560
you had to do, wired ones at that. Just wanted to point out that sometimes the PC port can be badass,

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:27.400
just depending on the port company expertise and love for the platform. Thank you, Sam.

02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:37.480
And then, hmm? No, that's it. You were lifting your mic. Oh, sorry. Okay. God, this is a long one. Okay.

02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:46.280
Hello, LR. Hi, YYR. Um, I don't normally do this, but back when the Fig campaign for the PC version

02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:52.600
of Rock Band 4 went up last week, I was, uh, browsing the site where many of us formally discussed

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:57.960
music games and found a post that basically sums up my argument against it. It was made by user

02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:04.680
GTC and here it is. By the way, thinking, speaking of old music sites, you know what shirt I'm wearing

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:13.000
tonight? My DDR spot shirt. That is old school. On top of that, this fit me when I initially got

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.520
the shirt and now it's like a size too big, so. All right, a little reminder about their Amplitude

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:23.400
Kickstarter. No physical rewards are out yet. No updates when they will be sent. The only preview

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:28.760
we've had for physical rewards was a teaser clip of the vinyl test print a few days ago.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:32.520
Never released the digital art book that was supposed to launch with the game late December.

02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:36.440
They never even released the whole soundtrack digitally or even the full campaign soundtrack

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:42.440
minus licenses. PS3 version was supposed to launch alongside or damn near to the PS4 release. No word

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:49.000
on that still. Campaigns talked about the DLC. Now there are no plans for it. So, F-Harmonics,

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:54.760
they're still trying to rebuild Rock Band 4 into something that won't even match Rock Band 3.

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:59.640
They haven't fulfilled their previous campaign and now they're coming around again with their

02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:07.400
handout. Fuck that. All right, moving back to this. Back to my personal opinion, my belief is that

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:12.360
it's just plain bad form to start asking for money again before fulfilling the commitments you made

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:16.760
to the last time you asked for money. The only positive thing I saw in their sales pitch was the

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:22.600
Sumo Digital is supposedly handling the port. They are fantastic, rest assured, and I'm certain that

02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:27.560
they will do a great job. But the whole thing just feels so disrespectful toward their previous

02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:33.560
supporters that I can't bring myself to get on board. On last week's show, you discussed

02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:39.640
Microsoft's announcement of rolling Xbox One hardware upgrades. But expressed skepticism

02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:44.600
regarding how consumers would receive them. I think there is an easy way to do this that is both

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:50.920
easy to understand and consumer friendly. It takes after the way Capcom handled the last two

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:56.280
Street Fighter IV upgrades, which were released as both a full retail disc and expensive DLC

02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:02.440
for Super Street Fighter IV. Microsoft could call the first upgrade Xbox Two. They could sell it

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:08.360
both as a new console, which would replace Xbox One at retail, and an upgrade module that would

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:14.520
connect to the existing Xbox One, from which could sell for under $200. That makes me think of how

02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:25.000
the Famicon disc worked or the 64DD for the Nintendo 64. If they have the strategy in mind

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.720
from the beginning, then they would already have designed the Xbox One to interface with such a

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:36.440
module. Games could then be sold as Xbox One games, which would run on both. Xbox Two games would

02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:41.240
require the better hardware. Or games that would run on both with increased performance for Xbox

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:46.840
Two. I would be shocked if in the future, Microsoft encourages developers to create games in the

02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:55.320
latter category. Right? Yeah. I think that that's an interesting concept. It still makes me think,

02:07:55.320 --> 02:08:08.440
though, of the Nintendo 64DD or the Famicon disc. There's one paragraph. I didn't know if you were

02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:13.800
going to make a comment. I figured their vision of the future is one where a guy can walk into

02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:19.080
the store, buy a game that says Xbox, and run it on his console, regardless of which Xbox he has.

02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:24.200
But the better his hardware level, the better it will look. Though perhaps we might start thinking

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:28.680
of labels like requires Xbox Two or better. What would you think of a future like this?

02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:35.880
Happy World Championship Xboxing YYR. That's it.

02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:41.240
All right. Sorry. I missed if there was a question. I got distracted with something

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.280
else. Is there a question in there?

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:51.320
I was talking about, first of all, that Harmonix has their handout asking for stuff

02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:59.400
when they haven't even fulfilled their previous commitments. So it's very disrespectful to their

02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:07.400
initial supporters. And then the second was that you have an Xbox One and then an Xbox Two that

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:12.840
has a port for an upgrade, like an expansion module or something like the 64DD was,

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.400
and that you market the games accordingly.

02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:22.200
You know, and I kind of mentioned last week about the whole fact that Nintendo

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:28.360
isn't exactly completely different with the whole the Wii U is kind of an upgraded Wii

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:32.440
is kind of an upgraded GameCube. And I think if they went that way with marketing it,

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:38.120
it may be less confusing. But at the same time, a lot of people thought that the Wii U was just

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.440
a Wii upgrade when it was a completely different system. So I think there will still be some

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:48.120
confusion out there. But I think there's ways to do it. If Microsoft gives it a very traditional

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:52.440
sort of naming convention, there's ways to do it. I just don't know if that necessarily means

02:09:52.440 --> 02:10:00.760
they should. So anyway. All right, that's that does it for emails tonight. Participate

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:07.240
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send an email to us in a future week. In the meantime,

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:14.760
let's get to the FUs of the week. Sometimes we get really angry on this show. Why? Because.

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:37.800
FU2 ongoing migraines and actually now adding sinus pain on top of it.

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:44.440
So now I have like I feel what's the double headache, the sinus headache with my normal

02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:50.040
migraine. It's not good, but it's time for me to go home anyway. So I will bid everyone adieu.

02:10:50.040 --> 02:11:01.080
Bye. Well, feel better and we'll see you next week here on the show. Shane, I have no FUs.

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:11.000
I don't really have a big FU, just FU2. FU2 really wasting my day yesterday and the rain

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.640
has been nonstop. And I know we need the rain. We're in a drought state and, you know, we need

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:21.480
it. So I shouldn't be complaining about it, but my God, it has been terrible this week. So yeah,

02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:28.840
that's it. All right. Let's, uh, let's move on with, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:34.360
Then we're going to get to phone calls. So Shane. Um, okay. I guess we have to talk about Blizzard

02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:41.880
again. There's an expansion coming out for Hearthstone. Uh, it starts, what's it tomorrow?

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:51.880
The 14th. Um, it's called Whispers of the Old Gods. You can pre-purchase a 50 pack bundle of

02:11:51.880 --> 02:12:04.120
cards for $50. You're an idiot if you do that. That's ridiculous. Um, so yeah, go, go, go do

02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:11.160
that. You'll play this crappy game. You're not a big fan of Hearthstone? It's fine. It's not a

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:21.880
bad game really, but I just hate Blizzard cause they fired Xero. It's a bad game for bad people

02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:26.120
and you should feel bad. I think so. That's correct. You know, some people really enjoy

02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:30.680
Hearthstone though. Oh, I know. I have a friend that really, really, I have a couple of friends

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:36.360
that really enjoy it. I know. I know. You can walk by practically anyone's desk and find them

02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:41.880
on their lunch playing Hearthstone. And by the way, I forgot to mention next week,

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.600
um, I will be on my new schedule, so I will be able to stay for the whole show again.

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:55.160
Hooray. Hey, bye. All right. Have a good one. All right. Uh, let's get to a story on Final Fantasy

02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:02.600
15. Yeah. Final Fantasy 15 is supposed to be an emotional experience that will make you cry

02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:06.840
and hopefully not cry at how horrible it is. No, I'm just kidding. It should be great.

02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:12.600
But, um, there was a, uh, interview in Game Informer, uh, where, uh, Hajime Tabata,

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:17.240
the director behind Final Fantasy 15 said that he wants to give a moving ending due to the time

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.040
that you will invest or that folks will invest playing the game saying, quote, I want to create

02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:27.000
a very emotional ending to the game and want to make as many people cry as possible. You're

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.160
spending so many hours playing the game. So when I finish a game and it ends on a sour note and it

02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:37.320
doesn't move me, it gets me disappointed. Um, uh, they're taking on the challenge of trying to

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:43.240
exceed that title saying Final Fantasy 7 once more, that Final Fantasy 7 is an inspiration,

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:50.280
uh, for the game. So there you go. Um, very curious to see, uh, uh, what turns out from this game.

02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.080
Uh, but I would say, you know, 13 had a really good ending. It was short, but I thought...

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:58.520
Don't spoil it. I haven't seen it. I won't, I won't, but I'm just saying it's not,

02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:04.120
it's not like 13 was a bad game by any means. I, I really think it was great actually. So,

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:09.880
um, you started talking about that and the whole opera scene from 6 went into my head. Yeah. And

02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:19.800
that was a better story than, than 8. I love 8. It's the WB, but in video game form. Uh,

02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:24.680
Nintendo maniac in chat says, how do we know that Final Fantasy 15 isn't just going to be an other

02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:31.880
M? Don't buy into any hype for anything. No, I suppose anything's possible. So, uh, there you go.

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:38.200
Uh, also a rumor that Final Fantasy 15 is going to be releasing in September. And I would think

02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:44.760
a release for this year makes a lot of sense. Uh, September 30th is the date that is being rumored,

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:50.760
uh, corroborated by three independent sources. Uh, there is an event by the way in Los Angeles

02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:54.920
on March 30th, where I would expect we're going to hear this date and price information,

02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:00.120
um, September 30th as a launch day makes a lot of sense. It's before the holiday period,

02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:04.760
but far enough into it where it will still be on many, uh, Christmas and holiday lists. Um,

02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:10.280
but not like so far out, you know, it will compete with the other holiday stuff. So

02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.840
we'll see what happens. But everybody hopefully at that point will still be too engrossed in

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:23.160
Persona 5 to care. We shall see. All right. Uh, let's get to the Skype line. Orange Lounge Radio,

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:28.040
all one word on Skype is the place to call. Um, please give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio,

02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:34.680
all one word on Skype, or you can give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Uh, if you want to do it the old

02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:44.680
fashioned way, but the Skype line is open now. Um, so, oh, thank heavens the phone is already

02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:47.720
ringing. Cause usually Loki does last minute stories, but I don't think Shane's prepared

02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:53.640
for that. I would just play with my, my morpher and it'd be like this. All right. Uh, hi, you're

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.040
on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Rama. Hey Rama, how you doing? Pretty good,

02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:04.440
but I have an interesting question for you before we begin. Okay, try me. You listen to

02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:13.480
mainstream radio? Once in a while, not like all the time. Yeah. I mean, the only time I actually

02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:18.600
listen to mainstream radio is when I'm hanging out with Mako-chan because there's only one decent

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:23.080
rock station in her area that we listen to. And then when we get out of the area for that,

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.200
we actually pull up the app and continue streaming from there.

02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:34.680
I, I love that. Um, yeah. And you know, I, I don't get me wrong. Like I do listen mostly

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:40.200
to Spotify and podcasts and VOG, especially when there's like live stuff and premiere stuff, but,

02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:45.560
you know, once in a while I have to stay on task on what's on the radios and so forth. So.

02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:52.920
I guess, I mean, at work, since we do have like access to groove radio throughout the store,

02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:58.520
everyone has like a different playlist and I'm not one for mainstream radio and I hear this

02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:04.280
music. I'm just like, this is what's going for music. And then I just go into the break room,

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.160
put my headphones on. Am I listening to J-pop or I'm listening to something from the 80s

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:19.240
or the 90s, or I'm just like deep into my 3DS. Hmm. Well, I, I apologize that I, uh, I'm sticking

02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:26.760
with the, uh, uh, terrestrial radio, but whatever. Well, Hey, somebody has to, like I said,

02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:31.000
in a blue moon, I will do the same thing. Yeah. So what else is on your mind tonight?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.640
I just also want to say in regards to the beginning of the show, if Shane is going to go

02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:41.000
on his video game, uh, drought, he's going to switch over to ranger toys. You, you know, this.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.240
What do you mean switch? Yeah. That's naughty. Like that's its own thing. That's never going to

02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:51.640
go away. That already happened. I spent so much on Jojo already. Like I have all the

02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.920
toys that have come out that are important. And we went to like four targets and two

02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:03.320
toys or us is today. Yeah. He won't give that up. Okay, fine. He'll increase the budget for it.

02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:11.480
Yeah, I can see that. Yeah. I'm fine with that. That's great. That just means I can get a cube

02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:19.320
gorilla when it comes out and a cube rhinos. That works for me. Fair enough. Fair enough.

02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:26.760
So is that you just called into a taunt chain? Uh, no, no, no. Well that, and it was my turn,

02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:31.880
but one more thing and I'm going to just, I'm gonna get up on out of here. Now in regards to

02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:38.280
Twitch, you mentioned earlier, I have noticed that within my circle, there are people who

02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:45.000
Twitch stream, but they do more than just Twitch stream. They're on there doing commentary with

02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:50.920
programming that they're watching or they're working on costumes, doing artwork and stuff

02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:56.600
like that. It's getting to the point where if they stream five days a week, maybe three,

02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:01.320
four of those days, they'll be Twitch game streaming. And the other day they'll be doing

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:06.440
other hobbies and stuff. And I'm like, that kind of sort of defeats the purpose of what

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:13.640
Twitch TV is for, but I get it, you know? Well, Twitch TV also kind of expanded not that

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.960
long ago into the more creative outlets, which is why the Bob Ross thing had happened in the

02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:26.520
first place. So Twitch wants people to expand more into that and do that. But, you know,

02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:30.360
it's kind of like one of those, where do you draw the line? Because I can definitely see where

02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:35.960
costume making, video game talk shows, that's all part of the gaming community,

02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:41.160
certainly doing the artwork and so forth, but is watching a movie and doing live commentary?

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:48.440
Probably not. So, no, I mean, if I really want to watch a movie, do commentary. I can just

02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:53.720
round up people, my friends on Skype, turn my webcam towards my TV and put something on and

02:19:53.720 --> 02:20:01.800
we can all have a field day doing it. Yeah. But, you know, that's up to Twitch, I guess,

02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:06.600
to draw the line. But it's interesting because a lot of this stuff was on Justin TV before,

02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:10.520
and then they ended up closing that down. But Justin TV also did a lot of life stuff,

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:16.200
which was just, hey, here's the webcam pointed at me doing actually nothing. So, I don't know.

02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:24.760
Point taken. So, yeah, it'll be up to Twitch to draw the line on that stuff. But, you know,

02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:29.160
if people are having fun and making content that people seem to enjoy, I think that personal stuff

02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:35.480
makes it more interesting. I don't necessarily like to just watch a game with nothing on it.

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:38.920
Ironically, that's what I'll use YouTube for. I think YouTube's almost a little better just

02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:44.440
getting the plain game streaming, game play stuff, like long play, I guess you would call it. But,

02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:48.440
you know, if I'm going to watch Twitch and watch somebody doing it live with the chat room and all

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:53.000
that stuff, I kind of want to be able to interact with people and get some more of that personality.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000
You know what I mean? Yeah, I get what you're saying. I get what you're saying. Yeah. So,

02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:02.600
all right. Interesting comment. Kaijuto in chat says Periscope kicks Twitch's ass.

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:08.520
You know, I know Periscope is definitely a growing thing for the live video and Facebook badly wants

02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:14.760
a piece of that too. So, interesting. All right. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:21.800
Major Nelson says hi. I saw that on Facebook. He had no idea who we were. Come on.

02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:27.560
But still, I did say I would try and he did say hello. All right. Well, I appreciate that. He

02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:30.280
always said that because he had to and he didn't want to look like a jerk, but no, I seriously

02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:35.000
appreciate that. That's so funny that you did that. Are you kidding me? He was in the break room

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:41.240
chilling out with us, having a good time. Okay. Well, that's cool. He's a normal human being. He

02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:46.200
will relax in the break room sometimes too. Yes. Yes. And next time I'll tell you a Major

02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:51.880
Nelson story. All right. Sounds good. Awesome. All right. Take care, buddy. You too. Yep. Bye.

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:59.160
All right. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to do that the

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:05.080
old fashioned way. Um, I don't really have any last minute stories tonight, unfortunately, but

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:10.360
oh, good. The phone is going off. So let's get to it. Hello. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:17.000
this? Hello. It's Embryon. Hey, what's up? I am calling to say hello. Hello. Good to hear you.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Like, what's up? Yeah. So I was thinking about you, uh, this weekend because I found an old book

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.440
of CDs in my, the trunk of my friend's car. I don't know how they got in there, but they were

02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:37.400
my book of CDs from like a decade ago. And among those CDs, I had all of these Bimani mixes in

02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:43.720
addition to these like unmarked MP3 CDs that were hundreds of tracks long. And, uh, I was listening

02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:51.160
to, one of them had the Erotic Hour Megamix on it. Oh my God. It is everything to this day.

02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:59.160
I cannot get enough of Erotic. That's, that type of music is why DDR was so fun. Is it brought

02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:03.960
that stupid cheese ball pop music? I say that in the best possible way. It brought all that stupid

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:08.120
cheese ball pop music into my life. And for that, I'm always going to be thankful for DDR.

02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:12.680
I know, me too. It's just like, it's funny because I remember when I was younger, um,

02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:16.600
the question that kids like to ask you to suss out if you're cool or not, it's like,

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:21.240
what kind of music do you listen to? Or who do you like? And I don't always be like, oh, um,

02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:27.880
you know, Erotic. Uh, I like, uh, Naoki Yoshida or not Naoki Yoshida. What's his name? Naoki.

02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:28.360
Midea.

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:31.080
Midea. I'm thinking of the Final Fantasy producer.

02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:31.580
You are.

02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:36.280
I'm getting my Naoki's mixed up. I'd always come up with these, like these, uh,

02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:41.240
DDR in-house artists and be like, yeah, that's who I like. And they'd be like,

02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:43.640
oh, it sounds pretty underground. Cool.

02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:48.200
Dr. Tsuya in chat says, I think they're still around. I think referring to Erotic.

02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:52.680
Yeah. There was some video, uh, that they, they did a song called, I think, Murder Me.

02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:59.080
It was on Facebook. I just saw some random thing. So I think they are back. But of course those,

02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:03.640
those groups never had the same singers for more than like five years. So, you know,

02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:09.320
Like, uh, that happened with Etro Anime. They did the opening theme song to Digital Devil Saga,

02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:13.720
which is where my name is from. And, uh, they put out a second album years later with a different

02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:19.720
singer and I was like, man, it's just not the same. So Erotic, I guess suffers a similar fate.

02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:22.040
Suffers? I don't know. I haven't heard the new stuff. So maybe it's great.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.080
It's, it's just as silly as the old stuff. At least what I heard.

02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:29.640
Fritz really, really loves her tits.

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.280
Man, some of that old school DDR music was so, so good and so silly though.

02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.440
I love how they're all like the same song with a different rap. Well, it's like this,

02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:43.880
it's almost the same rhythm and everything, but it's just different words.

02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:45.960
Anyway.

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:51.240
Indeed. Actually, I was just going to say, I, I could for, for just, I can play a little clip

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:55.320
just for listeners that have no idea what we're talking about, that missed the whole DDR thing.

02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:57.560
Here, here's, here's a sample of what you're missing. You ready?

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:17.160
Like how stupid is that song? Seriously.

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:18.600
And they're all like that.

02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:19.960
They are all like that.

02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.600
But I was totally doing the like head bobbing.

02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.960
I probably still remember the steps on DDR to that song.

02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:31.160
Oh yeah. Oh my God. Good times.

02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:35.080
Good times. I would definitely listen. You know what? If we ever go on a road trip someday,

02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:38.280
we'll have to jam to those CDs.

02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:39.640
Oh yeah. For sure.

02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:40.520
For sure.

02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:43.640
That's it. I just wanted to call in and reminisce a little bit about Erotic,

02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:45.320
my long forgotten love.

02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:48.520
No, I appreciate the walk down memory lane. And I think it's a good chance for all the

02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:53.640
old school DDR fans to just revisit or go listen. If you, if you happen to have them or have access

02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:58.120
to them, wink, wink, go listen to one of those old dance mania albums. It'll just take you back.

02:25:58.120 --> 02:25:59.400
Oh, they're so good.

02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:01.320
Good times. All right. Take care of my friend.

02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:01.720
You too.

02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:02.600
Good to hear from you. Bye-bye.

02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:03.880
Bye.

02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:09.560
All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:12.920
Dark Tetsuya is hinting a road trip to round one. Hint, hint. You know,

02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:17.560
I think if I were to bust up that as the soundtrack on a round one road trip,

02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:20.920
I think Shane may have a problem with that.

02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:21.400
Yep.

02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:22.120
So yeah.

02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:23.160
Definitely.

02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:27.240
But I'll try. He makes me listen to a lot of weird stuff. Although we usually listen

02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:29.480
to the FOMMC 14 soundtrack and that's something...

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.440
It just comes up a lot.

02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:34.520
We can kind of agree on that one. There's a lot of good stuff on that. Like the Alexander

02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:38.680
raid song and what was that you're playing today? The Separat song is great.

02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:38.920
Yes.

02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:40.760
Like industrial music. It's so good.

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:42.360
It is.

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:45.080
Like you don't even really need to play that game. The game is fine,

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:50.040
but the music is where it's at for Final Fantasy 14. Just get the soundtracks.

02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:51.720
Sometimes that's actually better than the game.

02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:57.640
That guy, Soken, does such a good job with the soundtrack. He really does.

02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:05.640
Yes. I'm guessing that you're doing something, so I'm trying to fill time.

02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.960
No, I was actually trying to find... Here it is. Just so you guys could hear a little bit of it.

02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:22.200
This is actually battle music in 14.

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:26.120
The fight is really fun.

02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:45.320
You like skip around a bit, don't you?

02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:49.320
And I'll tell you what, hearing that music when you're actually trying to do a boss fight...

02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:50.360
You did a good part.

02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:00.040
Love it. It's so good.

02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:05.080
It gets you going during one of these boss fights. Especially when you have no idea

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.360
like what the F is going on in the fight. It's insane. You're just like,

02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:11.960
Oh my God. Oh my God. It's crazy.

02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:13.480
I'm going to listen to that as I drive.

02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:18.440
Let's see. Embryon is actually in our chat room saying,

02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:22.200
The first time I heard that song, I screamed. Couldn't decide if it was hilarious or super

02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:26.040
energizing. Why not both? It's not hilarious. It's amazing.

02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:30.360
It is amazing. It's great. Let's see. Fifth Dream yells,

02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:33.320
This is what it's like when worlds collide. Yeah, I think we talked about that some time

02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.960
ago that Powerman 5000 took issue with that. Who knew that Powerman 5000 was still around?

02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:41.320
Who knew? It sounded more like a Nine Inch Nails song to me, but different singer.

02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:45.400
All right. Well, I guess nobody else is calling in, so that is going to do it for the Skype

02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:50.120
line tonight. But if you think of something late and you want to chime in later, you can always

02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.560
leave us an email. Participate at orangelandradio.com. You can also tweet at us,

02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:56.760
twitter.com slash O-L-R. I do read all the tweets you guys send this week.

02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:00.680
But I believe that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Land Radio.

02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:04.600
If you like what you heard here at the show, please consider telling a friend or two about

02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:10.120
the show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we don't

02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:16.600
know the voice unless you guys actually use them. So send us your emails and so

02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:23.720
forth. We would really appreciate it. I think that is it. Shane, do you have any

02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:26.200
final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Thank you for being here and filling in.

02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:27.560
No problem. I appreciate that.

02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:30.840
No, I don't have any final thoughts.

02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:33.800
All right. Well, we'll probably see you again in a few weeks.

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:38.120
No, because my schedule also changes at work, so this won't be a thing that will be happening.

02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:42.280
Oh, no. So we won't see you for a while. Well, nope. Good luck with Ranger Pride.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:43.640
Good riddance. Thank you.

02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:49.960
What do you mean good riddance? Screw you. I never liked you anyway. All right. That's it.

02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:53.640
We're done. We'll be back next week. Hopefully, Loki will be back and Dark Soccer will be here

02:29:53.640 --> 02:30:00.840
as well. And we'll tackle the latest in news as we move on up to SAC Indie Game Arcade in April

02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:05.400
and lots of other great events coming up. So stay tuned with us here at Orange Land Radio.

02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:07.480
Thanks. We'll see you again in seven days. Goodbye.
