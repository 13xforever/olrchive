00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Sup

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey how you doing?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm full

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Full of BS that she's going to spew all over the show tonight

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Girl please

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm just teasing you

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
After I bring you cookies

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She didn't just bring me cookies, she brought me like my favorite cookies

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Macaroons

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Coconut and chocolate and I've already eaten four

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's okay I've had about as many today. We had Belgian waffles and muffins and like all of the carby things in the world. Like looking at it would just give you diabetes by association

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well it's a holiday we earned it I guess. My mom called today and we were talking a little bit and she said you're still doing a show on Easter?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I'm like yeah? And she's like how are you? I said it's me and my Jewish girlfriend. She doesn't care about Easter

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I think most people that do Easter stuff kind of get it over with in the morning so I think usually by the evening everybody's kind of pretty free

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Except for unfortunately Techmaster Loki. He would be the exception of somebody that is doing something with Easter evening

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Actually I think it's the fact I think he went to the Bay Area today for family stuff so sadly not joining us in the studio Techmaster Loki

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But we do have filling in tonight we are happy to have somebody who doesn't have to work today due to the holiday

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Say hello everybody to Alan

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How are you doing?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Good to have you back on the show

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're going to be helping out with some of the news tonight and we'll talk to you a little later about your latest gaming addiction

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Because I can tell you first hand there is a game that he stays up until 3am playing every night and I'm always asking

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
How have you not finished this game yet? You are still playing it

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll get into that there's a very specific reason I haven't finished the main story and I'll get into it

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Alright fair enough I'll leave you guys guessing over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
vognetwork.com

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And if you are listening live head on over to our chat room live.vognetwork.com

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But we do have some other very special guests in the studio tonight I want to introduce here at the top of the show tonight before we get into our gaming weeks

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've been promoting this for a couple weeks so this shouldn't surprise anybody but maybe they're new to the show or what have you

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Welcome back to the studio from the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA, International Game Developers Association

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Say hello to Gabe

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Good evening

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And Brianna

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hi

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hi how's it going you guys?

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Fantastic

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you for coming back

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you for letting us come back

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm glad we didn't scare you off last time

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Never you'll take a lot more than that

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
God they just left a mess at the Colonial and no I'm just kidding we always do our best to clean our stuff up

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But welcome back to the show

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you so much it's an honor

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I know you guys are here to talk about your big event here locally the Sacramento Indie Game Festival

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Did I get that right or is it the Indie Game Expo?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I always mess that up

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a bunch of different things but it is the Sacramento Indie Arcade Expo

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know what people need to know it's Indie Games and it's fun and just be there like it doesn't matter what it's called

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They can call it like Rainbows and Kittens Fest and you should just still go

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We should probably do that next year

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Those are actually two wonderful things I think you might even you know

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There's something we can roll with that I smell unicorns versus bunny rabbits we can do something

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well it is Easter so you know

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's true we totally could

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the SAC Indie Arcade is going to be in two weeks right now we won't be here next Sunday

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've told the listeners that I'm actually on a personal out of town trip so we won't be here next Sunday

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But the Saturday after next which is April 9th is the event here in West Sacramento right?

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yup yup too big for Sacramento we gotta go West

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go West

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes that's what I did

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah I came from New Jersey

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right you came here from New Jersey settled a new life here in Sacramento and now it just keeps moving West

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What do people have to look forward to at SAC Indie Arcade 2016?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think the two words that and I've been trying to wrap my head around this

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Professionally fun

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think that's going to be the main thing for this event because you're going to have you're going to see an incredible amount of indie game developers

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But you're also going to learn how to be one of them or work with one of them you know if you want to

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's you know it's that's essentially what this event is all about it's going to be fun a huge amount of fun

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You know good good music gaming tournaments you know a lot of nerd banter and then but you're also going to learn

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're going to hear from a lot of experts and leaders in the industry within Sacramento and the Bay Area and beyond

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I learned honestly and this is not just a line I learned so much last year from attending just because you know

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Look we do we do talk about games we've been talking about them a very long time here at Orange Mountains Radio

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I don't know a lot when it comes to how to actually sit down and make one

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know granted I've done levels in ZZT which I'm very proud of on the PC

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A little big planet or some of those get Mario maker love that one you know things that enable you know with those easy

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Creation tools, but it I and I have found because we tried to do this thing earlier in the year the vogjam

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I I really tried to sit down and learn unity for me in my time

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It was just a beast like it's so much work that goes into it

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I think you kind of have to you know know a little bit about you got to know a little bit of logic to understand programming too

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And yeah, you know that's like learning math some people are good at it some people need help

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think one of the you makes you makes it you made an interesting point

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't it's it's not just the because for me

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I thought it was all the animation the 3D graphics because that's what got my attention in the first place

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But it's for but for me it's like what makes a fun game

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know like any you know the level design the level design aspect of it

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And just knowing what game it starts with looking at a game that you that you adore with your heart

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then asking yourself how could I do better than that and then then coming to a lot of

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Forced realities where you know on one end

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Damn, I'm gonna make this more fun than this you know because this inspired me and then on the other end

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's gonna be well. I don't have the budget to make something this big

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How do I do better with less

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, but at the SAC indie arcade you know you can network with other people

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And I know this is also through IGDA is that you know you don't necessarily have to be a unity beast

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
To be interested in IGDA because maybe you're somebody who wants to be a voice actor or a level designer

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Or a musician I know is a big one too

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, there are so many other elements that go into games that you don't necessarily have to be a game

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like the actual game maker to get stuff out of IGDA

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, and I'm living proof of that. I'm the idea person. That's me. I'm an idea man

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I just I you know for me I came to

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Accept and understand my limitations some years ago. You know I can't code. I can't do art

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can't do animation as much as I love those things. I can't do it

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So what good am I if I want to make if I want to start a game studio make a game at all

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So I said I can write and I can do a little bit of music

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Write my ideas down and then find someone who can hopefully believe in what I'm doing and that's that

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, I remember one really awesome speaker you guys had I mean you guys had Kate the president of IGDA

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Last year it was wonderful to hear her speak and to you know we were talking with her too

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And that was right at all the height of some of the like Twitter drama last year

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, and so you know having a very frank conversation about that

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You know it was great, and she was very eloquent in the way. She was speaking about that so she was very great

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I remember one of my favorite speakers you guys had last year very dynamic was this lady that you had from

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think she was like a business association downtown. I want to say it was like a women's business

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But like she made it very clear like you don't necessarily have to be a woman to be in this association

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And she it made me think about like oh my gosh

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If I'm a game designer and I make my product and I want to you know

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know put it on unity

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,640
And then it's like okay now I want to go on Steam Greenlight, and then all of a sudden. It's oh shit

129
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm a business owner mmm-hmm. I didn't even think about this end of thing we don't we know we don't we never do

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,920
Yeah, never never we're so focused on the game. We're not thinking about the legalities

131
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,720
We're not thinking about anything else. You know like oh my god

132
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,000
I have to trademark my title because someone else is doing it in another country or in another state and whatever the case may be

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,280
So and it's happened so even some of our own people here in Sacramento people had to change names last minute

134
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,320
Oh, and and they would spend a good year

135
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,760
Talking to their game about you know talking to their you about their game and sharing it and everything like that and all of a

136
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,320
Sudden we see them again a couple months later, and it's a total different game title

137
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,960
They were like what just happened, and then they're like remember that session. We've had some time ago. Oh

138
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,040
Oh, I'm sorry so yeah, but but that's important like if we don't do that now

139
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,540
When so yeah um and I just remember and I didn't get the sense that she was a big gamer

140
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,020
But she was but she you know how I knew she was smart because she was really good at adapting and I swear she read

141
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,060
It off some dude's t-shirt in the front row. She did she started going cuz she even delivered the line

142
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:25,220
She goes it's dangerous to go alone and everybody in the audience cheers is like oh, yeah, this chick plays Zelda. She's hardcore, right?

143
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,180
She read it off the dude's t-shirt in the front row

144
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,740
She and she made it she made a point with it because she was right right and when you go into business

145
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,460
That is a scary thing to take on when you are

146
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,260
I just I love that she like made that up on the fly up. It was probably connected with the audience

147
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,180
Yeah, it was by far the greatest part of the entire event the entire event was fantastic

148
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,820
But when she said that I said we're not even an hour an hour and a half into this event and I'm done

149
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,500
I could leave that's right. We could leave because I was crying Brianna was crying. We were we were dying

150
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,740
We're done. Yeah, that's it ship at home all right awesome awesome

151
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,320
Brianna I know you guys have been busy booking guests and events for this year

152
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,480
Tell us a little bit about some of the things that people have to look forward to it sack indie arcade festival

153
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,860
So in addition to the professional aspect where you'll get to hear from a speaker

154
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:23,020
panel of speakers with from diverse areas of the game industry everything from education to

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
What is it motion capture?

156
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,160
Virtual reality even to some of the ethical portions you'll have a chance so if you just love playing games

157
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,200
That's also what the Sacramento indie arcade is about we want you to come out have fun

158
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,860
Bring your friends family cousins whoever you'll get to play some old retro console games by consolecade and cafe colonial

159
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,600
They're hosting a little exhibit, and then we also have our friend Bill Kendrick with Atari party at a Dave love Atari party

160
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
I went for the first time

161
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,640
Between the last time you guys were here and this year

162
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,160
I went for the first time what a great event that was Dan

163
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,920
And I always participate every year with bringing our 5200 yeah, so awesome. Love it. I love that Atari's gonna be there

164
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,500
Yes, Bill has been fantastic in helping us with them promotion for the event so he's gonna have a bigger setup this year

165
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
And he's bringing his own volunteers

166
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,980
So for people listening who may not have ever touched an Atari and you're local to Sacramento come on out and see what that's about

167
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,000
You know it always gets me

168
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,360
You know it always gets me in the fields as this like late 30-something jaded old gamer is

169
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,980
When I go to these events where the Atari's are around and like seven-year-old kids are

170
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,840
And I'm like oh my god. It's me, but like

171
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,640
That was us, but this kid is like seeing kind of like what we went through like type of thing

172
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,200
It's it's got to be the way like my parents feel when I watch like the Grapes of Wrath or something some old ass

173
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,360
I mean, he's gotta be John Wayne like similar, right?

174
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,840
I don't know

175
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,360
But it's like it gets me in the fields and I see the kids playing it and they're actually having fun

176
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,640
And they're not like going like it's all there

177
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,880
It's why is it all green you know and I think what you brought up now really hit me in the heart last year when?

178
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,160
I was just kind of observing our guests that came through is we have parents who have a you know background in Atari

179
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,960
And that's what they used to play and now they're bringing their kids. I didn't expect as many families to come out as they did

180
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,840
So that really you know melted my heart to see that and then we've also introduced board and card games this year

181
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,640
So you'll get a chance to play new games by local board and card game developers as well, so we've got any developers

182
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
We're gonna have capital fight district

183
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,240
Taking care of our game tournaments. We have Street Fighter

184
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Super Smash Brothers, so it's gonna be an all-around are we having poking because I know how to button mash and poking

185
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Gabriel

186
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,760
Well I don't think we might we might okay, yes can't confirm or deny okay cool come and find out

187
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
That's okay, that's okay, if nothing else

188
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,280
I'll bring my Wii U and you can find the poking over by vogue that works, too

189
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,040
And we will be there

190
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,160
We're gonna we're gonna be set up in the theater

191
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,980
Helping to run all the panels and thank you for asking us to do that

192
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm so excited to be a part of that

193
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,580
I'm so glad to have found you guys and you found us and it's a beautiful thing that that came together

194
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,100
Yes

195
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,460
anything like I said anything we can do to help and I do want to because I know we have an international we're very fortunate that

196
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,020
We have an international audience that listens to Orange, Montreal. You know we do have a few listeners in Sacramento, and I'm always surprised

197
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm like oh you're local

198
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,380
I never do that, but we have listeners that are in New York City or you know that are in Florida or you know Europe

199
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,460
You know possibly even so they might be wondering like okay well

200
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,300
Am I just am I gonna fast-forward through this cuz I don't live in Sacramento, so I can't go to this event

201
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,140
I would say no for to read

202
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,300
There's there's two very important reasons we still talk about this even though it might not be local for you

203
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
and you can't realistically attend a

204
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,840
You know I'm gonna pimp some sort of live stream. We're gonna be broadcasting this

205
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,580
Didn't I hear this year? We're gonna be doing our best to do the vlog stream again on Saturday fingers crossed

206
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:09,260
Our wife our Wi-Fi isn't it because it's a new location our Wi-Fi will not be having to go through a concrete wall this year

207
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,020
So we're a lot more you know and I was even like just tell me where the damn box is

208
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,660
I've got a 50-foot cord. We'll make it work

209
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,700
We'll put a nice rug so people don't trip, but anyway all that stuff aside

210
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,420
We're gonna do our best to do that, but I heard I don't know if this got worked out

211
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,660
We're gonna do some well not us, but you guys are gonna be doing some twitch stuff too, right?

212
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,100
Yes, our friend Jay with capital fight district is hopefully going to be streaming

213
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,300
His tournaments and the event on twitch this year nice. That'd be great

214
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,380
And then of course the second reason why I still think this is important is that okay?

215
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,280
So we're talking about this here in Sacramento, and you might be thinking. Oh, I can't really go to that event well chances

216
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,660
Are folks there's an IGDA chapter in your neck of the woods?

217
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,540
They're probably doing an event like this

218
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
Maybe not same time, but at some point

219
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:00,760
So you know if you have any type of interest in games you seek it out if you're I imagine any major city in America

220
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,300
There's probably an IGDA chapter there in addition to the IGDA chapters around the world if you are listening to

221
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,960
Olr anywhere in the world and you hear about a certain game that we might talk about tonight or that Rob

222
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,000
Mentions during the show you know our game developers sell their games internationally, too

223
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,260
You can download them from the App Store you can go on steam, so we're really just kind of promoting

224
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,900
What's here in Sacramento, but if you love Rob in the show?

225
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,720
You might love some of the games that they're gonna talk about too

226
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,460
Awesome yeah, I think I think that was the first place that Loki had done

227
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,880
VR ever was that Sakai GDA last year, so you know we all get to try things for the first time

228
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,760
And there were some really great games that were at the festival last year, so I'm looking forward to seeing how they've evolved

229
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,040
Or what new stuff I'm gonna see this year. Do we get some new stuff this year?

230
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,100
We do get some new stuff. We have some developers coming up from Southern, California also

231
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,580
Nice yeah, we have one from yeah red the game is called red cobra

232
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,360
And they're coming all the way from San Diego, so yeah

233
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,460
I had connected with them a few times when they did some indie events down there

234
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,900
And pretty crazy move from you to just like you know oh going to San Diego to meet a bunch of strange people

235
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,760
I ain't never met before, but that's how determined I was to

236
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:24,020
Try to somehow create some sort of inner inner connectivity within the indie scene even if it meant me only going a couple of times

237
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,260
But they remember me we all stay in touch

238
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,060
And and now anytime they try to do something

239
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,180
They're like can you help us or are you coming down and you know the last couple times?

240
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,980
I wasn't able to but it's fine because now they're coming here, and that still says something that made my

241
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,460
Little investment in that trip worth it because now I've given them the opportunity where they would have not

242
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,220
Had an opportunity otherwise and now they're gonna be able to tell their people down there like well

243
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,940
It's not happening in San Diego. Why don't we go up here road trip?

244
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:03,940
So yeah, so we've got you know we definitely our arms have been stretched out a bit further this time, and it's it's wonderful well

245
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,720
Congratulations, that's awesome

246
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,560
And I know even there was some stuff that I remember going to an event up in Reno

247
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,240
Yes, I know you're in touch with them mm-hmm, so yeah, you kind of get get all over yep

248
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,180
You're making a name for Sacramento. Yeah, we're the cat. We're the capital

249
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,460
We have to

250
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,100
Going to our chat room over at live dot vog network calm

251
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,580
Why why are one of our favorite indie developers is in the chat room

252
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,820
We like why we are because he's actually made games based on inside jokes on orange on radio. I

253
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:38,700
I literally shit you not. It's he made a game called pixel shits. That was based off a joke here on olr

254
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,260
That's like an Atari remember how I came up with the name

255
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,760
I don't I don't either, but it was an attorney like he literally like it's this Atari

256
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,300
2600 style game where you actually like little dudes are running through a park

257
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,580
And you actually leave little shit piles for them to get stuck in and then they don't make it across the park

258
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:02,060
But the this is the this is the part that like like every game needs that twist that just makes it like oh my god

259
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:09,080
This is amazing the twist in this game is when you when your poo meter runs out you go to the Taco Bell in the corner

260
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,860
Yes, well wasn't that our White Castle I mean absolutely

261
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,620
That's wonderful

262
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,860
But also why we are he was actually showing at magfest and we just talked about last week his game

263
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,180
Multitasking got greenlit and a big part of that was because the word-of-mouth he got at magfest

264
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,460
Yeah, so getting your game out to these festivals. Yeah, you have to yeah, you have to yeah

265
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,640
there is a there is a challenge of course being you know I mean and I know this because I

266
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:48,560
co-run the department for magfest at the indie showcase, but you know because we had I think we had

267
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
for the latest round

268
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,500
Yeah for this latest event. We I think had hundred fifty two hundred submissions

269
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,400
Oh my god, and we only accepted like it probably a third of them. If that how do you say? No

270
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,780
There you know and and and I mean this for any and I apologize

271
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,460
Well, I sort of apologize to any developers out there who really work hard but may have missed things

272
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,140
But I don't apologize to those developers who really never bothered to make the effort

273
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:22,100
Because for some it was very easy to say no because they just never bothered sure and I mean that in the nicest most adult

274
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,500
Mature way possible. You have to have a little bit of enthusiasm

275
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,300
Yeah, yeah

276
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,820
Yeah

277
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:34,020
and you know when when someone's doing it for the actual reason and when whether it's is if

278
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,100
Are they just trying to make a quick buck?

279
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,460
You're gonna you can tell you can absolutely tell but when there's heart in it you you definitely see that that's when it gets difficult

280
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,700
Because then when you see others that have maybe one game was made with heart

281
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,540
But then there was another one made with heart but more fully fleshed out then. Yeah it that's where it becomes a little difficult

282
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:58,180
So yeah, very very challenging and and you know, fortunately for us at the indie arcade

283
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,000
For for our event we haven't I haven't gone there yet

284
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,140
I've essentially put blind faith in my people because a lot of them I already know what they're doing

285
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,380
So it's not it's not a challenge

286
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,900
So it's to see who's doing what and I just I have to make this clear in chat because why we are is like is

287
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
This why I got wait-listed at magfest

288
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,620
Gabe did not do magfest this year. I didn't do that. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, he did not do magfest

289
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,340
No, where is why anyway he is out in New York. Yeah, my neighbor my old neighbor cool

290
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,420
Well, have you ever come to Sacramento dude? Yeah, I'll let you you're accepted right right then and there

291
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,620
We will talk off air because my understanding is that could be happening

292
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,620
At least for a visit at least. Okay, so all right

293
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,280
Let's see also comments in chat actually why we're had said something else to that

294
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,180
I thought was worth repeating here over from our chat room live dog network calm

295
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,260
Why are say gameplay design level design art design story design if applicable game creation?

296
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,820
Involves all of those and then talking about the business

297
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,080
Why we are says it helps to have a business mindset or think about it in the back of your mind

298
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,200
SSJ 100 Matt says I just looked it up and I see a few IG DA New York City chapters

299
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Yes, there's probably one in each borough

300
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah, I think there yeah, I think there might be I think there's one IG DA Brooklyn or something like that

301
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,400
Yeah, but even IG DA New Jersey they have they have their own and you know and Boston, you know

302
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,280
Not that far away everything so close up there. So yeah, just a couple hours away

303
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,680
So yeah, they have a whole ton of options out that way

304
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,240
So and I like the point that he made though about all those other aspects

305
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,680
You know story level sound, you know, they're all all that adds up to

306
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,260
Cohesion cohesiveness and consistency. So yeah, beautiful good

307
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,960
You kind of have to have a good you also have to be a bit of a people person

308
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I think to learn some of those skills

309
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Even if you don't necessarily get a long hundred percent of the time like to be business professional in working with people like that

310
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,200
That that doesn't come naturally for everybody. No and you know something

311
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm super relieved you said this because

312
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:12,000
Just yesterday we had our game jam and one at one of the one of the teammates on the progressive game

313
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Jam team made a made a very striking remark and it's something that I've said for a very long time and I would typically get

314
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,920
The you know tilted face response like what are you talking about? But he said I'm an introvert. I

315
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Under no circumstances

316
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,120
Want to deal with a bunch of people I just want to make my game and sell it and that's it

317
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,360
And he was like, I'm a programmer. I don't like having to deal with others like that. But that is

318
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:47,480
Absolutely, like I get that because I've said the same thing for a very very long time. We are all very nervous

319
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
To just get it out there

320
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,700
Because and that's why we forget so often about the legalities and the business aspect because we're so dead focused on hoping that

321
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
someone is gonna like what we've made and

322
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
And and I'm telling you and you know, we think when we hear about all these

323
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,080
I don't know if you know when we hear about these, you know

324
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,040
These sensitive comments and the sensitive reactions and and the people the person outside looking in says damn

325
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,960
They're really kind of overdramatic a little over theatrical about it all but not necessarily

326
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,820
Because we are so consumed by the fear of being accepted just once

327
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,760
Not consistently just once and even for me

328
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:38,720
That was a huge thing for me that I had to overcome as outgoing as I had been in other aspects of my life

329
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,540
But when it but when it comes to believing in your dream

330
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,120
It's you you're so focused on you believing in it because it took you so long to believe in it yourself

331
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,360
That you have to hope to God that someone else is gonna believe in it, too

332
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,120
That's a great point because I'm an extrovert by nature. All right, so

333
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
What a shot I have my moments

334
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,360
Well, you know, I'm an extrovert by nature and sometimes like I I even get the mindset where it's like

335
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,440
Why can't you just why you just get up there and talk about her?

336
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
Why can't you just make that call, you know those types of things and you know

337
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,320
So an Allen is usually the one that actually kind of grounds me a little bit and will you know?

338
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,800
because he's the introvert and we'll kind of remind me that like, you know, I

339
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,600
Doesn't come that way. It's not it's not like that all the time

340
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,200
Yeah

341
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,700
We want it to be if we want it because we're so excited and that and you'll see us because when an introvert gets super

342
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,520
Excited you can't stop us because it happens it happens to us because we just start we're on it and on it and on it

343
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,760
So yeah, I mean so when he so when when our colleagues said that yesterday, I was like, yeah

344
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,380
Absolutely, absolutely resounding. So yeah, you know, but that's why we that's why this our chapter is

345
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,580
To help

346
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,980
Relieve those issues, you know relieve those issues or at least give some balance to that

347
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,940
that's why the indie arcade is a celebration of those things because it's like we're giving you the

348
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,060
opportunity to

349
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:03,100
kind of break from your shell even just a little bit even if you just crack the shell just a little bit and then

350
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,380
give yourself we're gonna help you give you that courage to

351
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,140
Be able to show your game to the general public and and and feel have that bit of confidence

352
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,260
That holy crap, they actually do like it

353
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,700
We're at this

354
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,020
Conversation is getting a huge response in our chat over at live fog network calm

355
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,180
Dungeon buster saying there are quite a few devs that are amazingly savvy creators

356
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,060
But terrible a business part of a good Kickstarter pitch is to make everyone excited about your game

357
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,320
If you can't do that, then why should I fund you? Yep

358
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,820
Yyr says everything's being spoken is 100% true

359
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,460
It helps 200% if you love your game enough that even if nobody else loves it

360
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,740
You will still be satisfied with it. That way you have nothing to lose

361
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,140
Act F just says this applies on so many aspects

362
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,260
Very true. Same thing same thing even from my side where it's like I'm not really making a game, but I have like this podcast

363
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,060
But if I can't speak positively about the podcast if I'm like, yeah

364
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,140
I have this show and it's kind of it's kind of it's really nerdy

365
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,180
You know, it's no biggie, you know, if I if I sell it like that people gonna be okay, then I won't bother

366
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,980
But you know if I'm excited about like yeah, you know, we've been going a long time and we love games

367
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,580
You know, then people get more enthusiastic about it. So that's just that's just goes on anything. Sure. Absolutely. Absolutely

368
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,580
Brianna tell us a little bit about and I don't know if you know this off the top of your head

369
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:26,340
But I'm hoping you you know some of them tell us about some of the speakers that we're gonna hear from this year at IGDA

370
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,340
Cuz I know you have a new lineup this year. Yes

371
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,720
So our keynote speaker is going to be Kat went

372
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,940
She was the 2015 MVP as voted by the IGDA

373
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,340
She's one of the founders of the women in gaming for the International Game Developers Association

374
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,300
she's very

375
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:54,160
Proactive about diversity in games making sure that both genders are well represented. She's about community. So she's gonna be speaking on that

376
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:01,180
Next up. We'll have Ian Pollock. He is the director of the graduate program at CSU East Bay

377
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,900
he takes game designing and

378
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,220
Jant game jams to a whole different level. He's very big on

379
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,900
Well in the East Bay is like where a lot of your games come from. Yes

380
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,700
So it makes a lot of sense East Bay South Bay. It's like

381
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,260
Funny enough though the IGDA chapters out there haven't been too involved

382
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,500
But we've been mentoring at their game jams Gabriel and I have interesting

383
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,300
So Sacramento has been pouring into the East Bay and we invited Ian to come up

384
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:37,580
He is big on incorporating multiple disciplines whether you're a science major or you have an art background

385
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,280
We want he wants to create games based around things like that

386
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:49,300
We also have our local developer from rocktastic games. William Tan will be speaking to give a perspective on

387
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:56,580
What indie developers go through he's been in the industry for a while now and he's had a lot of success in the mobile side

388
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,620
So now he's developing for console and he's gonna share his perspective on things like that

389
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,500
Michelle Hill

390
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
she is

391
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:12,500
We have Michelle Hill who is a Sacramento native who found out that Sacramento has an IGDA chapter

392
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,620
She was an IGDA scholar in years past had the opportunity to learn from triple-a studios in the Bay Area now

393
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,700
She works in the bay, but is returning back home to give back to her local community. She'll be giving a speech

394
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:32,700
I'm sorry. It's very I got super excited about her because she's our first person from a triple-a studio

395
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,300
She's from 2k games. She's a technical animator for 2k games. She's actually working on

396
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,620
Oh my god

397
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:48,220
She's she's working on Mafia 3 and she which I can't wait for and she's working on the the XCOM sequel as well

398
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,940
So she kind of knows her stuff and we had the pleasure of meeting her at the most recent GDC

399
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,940
so the fact that we have her speaking on both the benefit the pros and cons of working on indie and

400
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
triple-a

401
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,500
So yeah, we have someone for 2k games coming through for that which means we hope more from 2k game shows up down the road

402
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
But anyway, I'm sorry. Yeah

403
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:18,140
Yeah, she was previously with an indie studio and in 2015 they were nominated for a game award out of GDC

404
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:26,060
So she'll be coming back and then we also have ninja pandas who have been helping and teaching game development courses over the last year

405
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,080
So husband and wife team JT and Claire, they're wonderful

406
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,020
They're relocated here to Sacramento to help grow the scene as well and their

407
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,480
Prior experience their professors. They were professors out of CSU East Bay, too

408
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,420
and

409
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,580
Who am I missing? Am I missing anyone?

410
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:50,060
We have seven speakers, so the keynote starts at 1030 on the spot she is

411
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,440
The keynote starts at 1030 and we go until 3 so it's gonna be a full day

412
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,940
Lots of learning lots of Q&A will be available and like Gabriel was saying earlier in terms of the scene

413
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,020
like it's just two people kind of coordinating this whole event right now and

414
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,060
You guys have been working your tissues

415
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,380
Gotten to know the developers and the community and

416
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:20,740
It just makes me so proud to be able to host something like this and to incorporate our local indie media also in our

417
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,940
Podcasters and our twitch streamers. It's really a wonderful labor of love and to see that you guys are excited about it, too

418
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,540
Makes all of this work and my sleepless nights and my dreams

419
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,540
Thanks

420
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,340
Everything worth it, you know, I'm a casual gamer so to speak I do more of I am the businessperson. I'm the numbers

421
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,020
I'm the legalities kind of girl, you know, I'm not a creator. I'm not a developer

422
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,900
I have a love for music but to hear and experience what all of these devs are going through

423
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
I don't have the patience for any of that

424
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:59,420
But if I can create a platform for everyone to show off what they are passionate about that makes me so happy

425
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,380
Oh

426
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:11,300

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,260
But you guys actually both went and you got to take in everything at GDC just some quick impressions on this year's

449
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,380
GDC is something that really caught your attention that you really enjoyed or what have you

450
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,380
So I spent a lot of time in the GDC play area. They had some alternate

451
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:11,800
Alternative controllers they had a controller this year where you lick it and that's what moves I kid you not

452
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,880
The eyes and in the studio just their eyes got so big right now

453
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,240
Especially since I have a macaroon in my mouth, okay

454
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,600
Like when people use the oculus rift you have the sanitary wipes so you can wipe it down

455
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,100
So, you know, you don't give somebody Zika virus or whatever

456
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,680
But I don't want to lick something that some complete stranger especially at a gaming conference has licked

457
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,680
Do you want ants cuz that's how you get ants? Yeah, if you see a demo kiosk for that at Best Buy now

458
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,480
I'm not using that

459
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,240
So if you're near a PC or your mobile phone look up planet liquor

460
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,320
I think that's the name of it planet liquor and and the arms in this right now

461
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,440
They were switching out the pieces obviously, you know each new player gets a new one. I know they're on Instagram if you look up Instagram

462
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,580
Oh, oh joy you it there were three different things to lick

463
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,820
You gotta lick it

464
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,520
Yeah, you put you bring my god you bring the controller to your mouth

465
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,880
That was at the game developers conference my friends

466
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,300
Now put that with the virtual reality stuff and you're good to go and I can't wait for what porn hubs gonna make

467
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,340
Coming but a bump you could just nickname this girlfriend pleaser the game

468
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:45,000
It's a strength it's a strengthener for that particular oral muscle Wow, wowie Wow Wow Wow Wow

469
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,580
All right anyway

470
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,760
So you got to lick things that strangers had like before you

471
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,760
How was your experience did you lick anything nope, just my pride

472
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
So

473
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,460
Yep, nope, not at all. Not at all. So not at all. So I can't even follow up on that one at all. I

474
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,480
I

475
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,000
Had the pleasure of experience of I shouldn't even say pleasure Jesus worries. Everything's gonna sound suggestive

476
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,160
I'm so sorry everybody, but so part of my experience with GDC

477
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,880
I had I got a got accepted into a new boot camp that they introduced called

478
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,640
amplifying voices and I and I

479
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:42,480
submitted for it for this boot camp and the idea behind it was it was about growing leaders within different communities and you know that

480
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,640
Were helped contributing to the industry somehow and so I submitted and I got accepted

481
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,200
So I would so we saw I was part of the very first class to you know of 30 to you know

482
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,080
actually beach be like

483
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
mentored and coached on how to

484
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,720
You know, you know speak better than you already do now be a better leader, you know

485
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,080
Continue to be a great leader in your community so on and so forth

486
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,480
My coach happened to be the marketing director for Oculus Rift

487
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,560
So so yes, I actually got to meet her and she was she was really cool

488
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,240
And you know, we got I got to meet Robin Robin Haniki from that game company who now runs her own

489
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:27,040
Fun phenomena so indie game studio you got to go to like the equivalent of like when a seven-year-old wants to go to space camp

490
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,640
Just got to do. Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was

491
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:39,400
It was extremely uplifting. It was extremely uplifting that day. And so and so with that, you know, yeah

492
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,560
So then I got to see you know when I was able to go, you know other other facets of the event

493
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
You know a couple different sessions

494
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,480
Oh

495
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,880
I a lot I actually invested a was a I was fortunate enough to have my my 3d art director of my NASA game studio

496
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,680
Team to attend the different animation boot camps that were that were there

497
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,700
And he said they were absolutely incredible. He got to meet some of like his biggest

498
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,520
Inspirations, you know for different game studios. I liked and this is me

499
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,720
With the whole pathless traveled mentality is you know where if I see something trendy?

500
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,300
Buzzwordy I get irritated real quick and I'm like, okay. I'm already tired of it

501
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,800
But yet we talked that you know, there's VR

502
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,800
alternate AR

503
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,080
Very that was the thing and it it was exciting but it got me super nervous

504
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,520
It's like okay

505
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,960
Are we really that ready yet?

506
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,880
I'm like because they kind of did the same thing with like the big with like the big TVs back in the day

507
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,460
It's like oh you got to watch this and you know, you gotta you gotta get this TV now and you know

508
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Look what they're trying to do with 4k now. It's like not gonna happen for a while. So and

509
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
But anyway, you know all that all that aside

510
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
it was

511
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:01,280
Very incredible event and probably the best that that you know minus some funny antics that happened throughout the event

512
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Thanks, Microsoft and things like that. And I think Bree wants to contribute on that. Oh, yeah

513
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,720
Well, it was their 30-year celebration, too

514
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,620
So they had a whole 80s section like a throwback to how GDC first started

515
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,200
You know the humble beginnings at someone's home. I think it was so they did a little throwback section

516
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:27,720
But yeah, Gabe was saying a lot more virtual reality. They did a combination GDC VR D VR DC

517
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:34,240
Yeah this year. So instead of just having one expo hall with you know, oculus and you know, the major game players

518
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,800
It was throughout the whole thing

519
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,960
So there was not a section that you could go without having a headset on someone lingering through the halls. I

520
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,620
Heard there was just a ton of VR GDC this year

521
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,460
So it's gonna be interesting to see how that plays out in the living room a year or two from now be very interesting

522
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,720
Well, your friend is all about it. That's right

523
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,900
Looking at chat over at live dog network comm sg 100 Matt says space camp and he didn't even have to play double dare

524
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,000
No, he didn't he didn't and I don't think there was a physical challenge at GDC

525
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,420
Actually, Bree might have done the physical challenge at the licking station that might have been yeah

526
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,760
It's kind of like they they were a team there anyway

527
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
No comment. Oh

528
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,900
My gosh. All right

529
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,500
This has been too much fun. So anyway, uh, sac I GDA

530
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,420
The indie game Expo is gonna be next or excuse me two weeks from yesterday

531

537
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,500
But you guys will hopefully stay for a little while and chat with us about

538
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,180
This week in gaming news and some of the latest and greatest what's going on

539
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:08,660
We do always like to start off the show here talking about start off ha ha talking about our gaming weeks. So dark Sakura

540
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,660
Let's start over with you tonight. What kinds of video games have you been playing this week?

541
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,300
Dan and I finally started the remaster of Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and

542
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,100
it's funny because I named my cat Midna and

543
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,780
she

544
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,120
hopped up on the TV while we played her introduction scene and

545
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,420
Just started looking at the TV and she hardly ever does that when we're home watching stuff

546
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:40,740
So she was up on the TV in front of the TV and behind our center speaker and she's like I'm in a video game

547
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,620
Yeah cat get down

548
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,500
So

549
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,460
And then I played a little bit more Dungan Rumpa. I had to take a little bit of a break

550
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,460
Just because I've had a really busy week

551
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,760
And I should change schedules at work. So like now I'm you know able to stay for the entire show

552
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,600
And I got my my new amiibo. I got my Timmy and Tommy nook

553
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,780
for Animal Crossing because the ones I'm collecting are on the Animal Crossing ones and

554
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,940
So I I haven't played them in happy home designer yet, but I did do Roper's house

555
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,060
so

556
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:25,980
The happy home designer is like stupidly fun. I'm also still playing Heroes of Dragon Age. Mm-hmm, and

557
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,100
I'm

558
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:36,300
Level seven in ingress now. Congrats. Thank you. And I have I think I might have pissed off that Smurf who?

559
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,700
Tried to take my home thing because in retaliation I took out eight of his

560
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,620
That's what the game is all about getting back at people sorry not sorry

561
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:55,260
And that's it. Awesome. All right, let's go over to Alan. Let's talk about let's talk about your gaming week

562
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,480
I'm low or year. How you doing?

563
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,740
Good good. What kind of games you've been playing this week fallout?

564
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,380
Fallout one. Yeah, I played and beat that did you yeah, that's right

565
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:11,020
You went back and actually played follow one and two because I have the discs from when I bought them from the early 90s

566
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,380
So no actually late 90s early 2000s. They still work, of course, and I was like

567
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:21,340
Apparently the first one if you have fought if you cheat and follow a walkthrough and I'm like, I'm I'm a grown adult

568
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,620
I don't have time. Just tell me tell me where to go

569
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
It's actually a fairly short game

570
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,600
The first fallout so I played that but I mostly been playing fallout 4

571
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,960
And all of the mods that have come out for it in spite of the fact that the creation kit isn't officially out yet

572
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,480
from Bethesda

573
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:43,560
So that's cool. So you will play this game till like 3 in the morning. Yeah, how have you not beat a game yet?

574
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,800
So without giving away too many spoilers

575
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,760
There are

576
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:58,200
four factions and the main story only goes so far and then you complete the main story by siding with one of these

577
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,040
Factions and then from that point on the how the main story

578
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,800
I mean ultimately it all goes to the same ending but it's just who's alive and who isn't there's the neutral faction

579
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,920
There's like faction a versus B that if you side with one you have to kill the other and then there's like the quote-unquote

580
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,800
evil faction all four my point is all four are lame and I don't know who I don't want I don't know who I want to

581
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,600
stake my claim with because I'm like

582
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:28,180
Who's the least guys are all boring or you always all have like really glaring moral problems that my character doesn't agree with

583
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Where's the party faction?

584
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Because there's the cool Marines in the iron armor suits

585
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:45,180
But they're like kill everybody that aren't that that isn't human including androids and then there's the the pro Android faction

586
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,680
but they like

587
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,440
Will like erase their memories and give them a new life and I'm like wolf the Android

588
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,020
Freed themselves because they have autonomy. Why would you want to delete who they are in the name of saving them?

589
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,460
So like everyone's it's so everyone's lame. So I love this

590
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:07,000
So, uh, so our chat room in response to you being like everybody's lame SG 100 Matt says so it's like the presidential race

591
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:16,540
Are we talking about the Republican side because that's like there is yeah, there isn't a single horse in that race. No politics

592
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,540
No politics now. All right

593
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:25,340
Yeah, so that's all so I'm I'm trying to get my affinity with all of the companions up

594
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,940
Oh you trying to romance everybody

595
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,220
well, not what you get a perk if you get someone to like really really like you and I have

596
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:39,700
Strong who's like the super mutant giant who just who basically likes it when you like if you take the cannibalism perk which no thanks

597
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,700
I'm not doing that if you eat

598
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,180
Like he likes that that that's the kind of stuff you have to do to get him to like you and you're trying to romance

599
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,840
Him no, he's not romanceable, but he's still a companion. Okay, but one thing about fallout

600
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,580
You can romance as many characters

601
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:01,180
There are 14 companions and I think like seven or eight of them are romanceable so you can be like sister wives

602
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:07,540
Yeah, you yeah, I'm I've I've maxed out McCready and Hancock and I'm in a relationship with both of them

603
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,420
Cuz modern cuz normally in Dragon Age, there's the there's the jealous bitch conversation

604
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:21,860
And with Mass Effect 1 with either Ashley and Liara or Liara and Caden. There's the jealous bitch conversation line

605
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,780
So we compared notes and we need to have a conversation with you

606
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:32,940
About what's going on and you need to pick and it's like okay $60 for this. Can I just you a ho?

607
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,140
Yeah

608
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,660
Yeah, exactly but with follow forks like do what you want

609
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:47,260
Do who you want whenever you want good times one of these days off to sit down and play that game

610
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,980
But I just I don't with all you know, you know, you're the best Allen

611
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:56,620
But I just don't want to become you when it comes to fall out and I'm worried that I might go down

612
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,980
You're totally not wired that way

613
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:03,340
I have that very I have very introverted an addictive personality that once I find a game that's doing it for me

614
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:10,180
That is all I play and then all of a sudden I get burned out. I'm like I've 500 hours of Skyrim is enough

615
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,180
I'm not gonna play Skyrim ever again

616
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,140
Then like with and then you'll be like, why aren't you playing this game? Oh that game. I'm not playing that anymore

617
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,060
What happened you've been playing that game non-stop for three months and I moved on

618
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,260
Yes, it's like something like he just dumps one and give another that's called binge gaming

619
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,540
Let's see why we are says the main quest is pretty long on

620
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,220
I had known this about any of those games that were just mentioned

621
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,460
I may have been more inclined to try playing them

622
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,460
Oh

623
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:50,460
Well, you're on the business side of things so, you know you get right down these marketing things following remark is not responsible of IGDA

624
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,460
Sacramento wives

625
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,220
Cannibalism. All right

626
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,540
Well, I was talking about what why oh, sorry

627
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,300
I thought there's a comment about fallout, but I guess why where has been playing guacamole, which you know, that's always that's a great

628
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,300
Great one

629
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,660
Raginator saying watched Alan play fallout for a little bit last night

630
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:15,540
Oh, yeah, you you don't really live stream, but you do he just will he'll be held on the steam notify

631
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,940
Raginator wants to watch your stream via this steam thing and I'm like, okay, so then steam takes care of it

632
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,100
It's all seamless. I don't even know what it's doing. You keep that steam thing open basically all the time. Yeah

633
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:32,420
Yeah, I I kind of do that like sometimes but as far as like routing it through twitch or whatever the play TV

634
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,500
I think is the new one that comes with the Raptor app. It's like a twitch competitor. Oh, I have that. Mm-hmm

635
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
I just never run it. Yeah

636
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,340
Cuz then I always feel like if I'm gonna stream a game then like I don't want to just stream gameplay

637
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:49,180
I have to be entertaining and like and I explain this to people when somebody asked me like why aren't you streaming your game?

638
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:53,860
Did it cuz I'm like sometimes I don't want to be on like talking about that whole like extrovert introvert thing, right?

639
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,280
like sometimes I just want to play the game and I don't necessarily want to be on because I do feel a

640
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,760
Responsibility when I'm live streaming a game to not just stream the gameplay but to be like

641
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,140
Commenting to talk about memories to talk about make jokes be funny. And so I was like, I don't want to be funny

642
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,680
I just want to vegetate in front of the game, but that's me

643
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,760
I'm not I'm not knocking other people because some people do stream just broad gameplay and that's totally fine

644
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,840
That's just not like like I want to kind of be consistent with my channel

645
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:27,320
And so that consistency would be me being on when I feel like it when reginator watches me stream

646
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,480
I don't even open up my headset mic so that I could talk to him through it

647
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,120
I mean he can hear the game obviously, but otherwise, there's no feedback from me. He's just watching me

648
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,640
It's just a real way to just like watch somebody play a game with no

649
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,320
BS and some people like that more in stream like everything I said about live stream

650
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,100
So people hate that some people want to just see the damn game

651
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,940
And so, you know, that's well like if you look if you look at the do's and don'ts of how to do stream like that

652
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,600
It'll be like the first rule do not read the dialogue on the screen people hate that

653
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,640
But then you'll see people that do it and they'll use silly voices and then it's suddenly it's funny

654
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,740
Okay. Well, this guy has a million subscribers and he reads the talk on the screen

655
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,620
So that's my that's my pet peeve is reading the dialogue on the screen

656
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,500
Well that and I'd say over-the-top acting. Yeah, that's why I do not like markiplier

657
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:21,000
Hmm at all. Mm-hmm and everyone will worship the ground he walks on and kiss the office chair

658
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,820
He sits in and no, I don't think he's funny

659
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,540
But over the years we've done this there have been people that are like I don't like olr cuz you guys do blank and I'm

660
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,080
Like, alright. Well, hope you found the show

661
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,860
You do like markiplier is sort of this safe respite that people ran to screaming from pewdiepie. So

662
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,360
Yeah, he's very when he takes a shirt off it's very nice I don't need to listen to him

663
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,260
Can we not? All right. Anyway, let's

664
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:52,400
How about how about our guests Gabe you get the mic what kind of games you've been playing this week? Oh goodness

665
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,400
I didn't let you pimp your game either. Oh, yeah. No, it's okay

666
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,900
Okay, so the games that I've been working on are my

667
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
crumple episode 1 and

668
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,420
Kinship now I will and this is how I will pimp it nice and ninja like youtube.com

669
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,000
slash nascent games and a s

670
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
C E N T

671
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:22,420
g-a-m-e-s I just uploaded two new gameplay videos for both games last week and

672
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:29,600
And for the first time you're actually able to see some early gameplay of kinship and updated gameplay for crumple

673
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:35,120
So yeah, we're doing really well with that. We recently announced that crumple will soon

674
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:41,340
Well at some point this year will be also available on an additional platform the Amazon fire

675
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,020
So

676
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,200
So yeah, so that so we've started implementing early touch controls

677
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,720
Yeah, so it's it's it's really really exciting unexpected stuff

678
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,240
Anyway, so yeah youtube.com slash nascent games check us out and we're on Twitter too at nascent games

679
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,060
Now the games that I've been playing. Um, I've normally I mean for a very long time

680
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:09,680
it's normally Xbox one always has my soul and I rarely touch my PlayStation 4 but

681
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,220
Earth Defense Force 4.1

682
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,420
The game I was yelling and screaming about that needed to be out because it because you know

683
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,220
There was the shadows of new despair only in Japan, but they brought it here

684
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,740
Finally, although it was delayed

685
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,600
Finally, it finally came out. So I'd been all over that game

686
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,420
Just earning whatever weapons I possibly can because that game is crazy crazy fun

687
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,140
and

688
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,900
Been playing that I had I started playing

689
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,820
Oh

690
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,180
goodness, what else I finally started messing around with Killzone Shadowfall because I'm just like

691
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,860
You know because I finally beat last of us remaster because I never played last of us only until the remake for the ps4

692
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,440
And my god, what an astounding game, but most of you probably peed it already. So I still haven't played it

693
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,720
Astounding game absolutely astounding game

694
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:05,160
But the game I'm you know, so I've been messing with those and of course force of six force of horizon two sometimes

695
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,140
But then I will but I'm waiting for quantum break quantum break comes out next just pre-ordered it today. Yeah

696
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:17,620
Yeah, I pre-ordered that months ago cuz anything from Alan Wake developer. I'm ready for that. Yes

697
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,980
So yeah, so that's what I've been messing around with

698
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,500
Yeah, Alan Wake is actually on my list to go revisit because Xbox one the backwards

699
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:30,860
Compatibility thing has been like this really awesome like rediscover games you played like literally it's been a godsend

700
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,480
And I'm gonna talk about that in just a minute because actually the game I've been playing almost

701
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,600
Exclusively this week has been one of those games. Thanks. We'll talk about that a minute

702
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,100
I want to check in with Bri too

703
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,940
But first I want to go to a chat room over at live dot vog network calm because why we are points out

704
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,880
That is ironic a game about a scrap of paper on a device called fire

705
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,080
But if you actually play the little demo

706
00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:00,360
There's there's like actually fire is kind of a big deal in this game spot-on spot-on remark. Actually, I love it

707
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,760
In the chat room. There are people fussing at me because markiplier does all this great work for other people

708
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,480
That's not what I was talking about at all. Mm-hmm. I was just saying he's not funny, right?

709
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,840
So you can still appreciate like oh this person does good charity work, but I don't really like well

710
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,920
I don't watch their TV show, you know that type of exactly

711
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,280
Exactly. It's kind of like I feel like there's like actors and actresses like that

712
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:28,480
I would say Angelina Jolie, but actually I really do love her and I will watch anything she's in so I can't that's not the best

713
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:34,100
It's like everyone on the cast of Big Bang Theory may be great brilliant wonderful people, but I don't watch the show

714
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,260
There's a great exam because it's fake nerd. Yes

715
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,220
Perfect. I love that

716
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:46,580
It's it's nerd humor for people who aren't you can love Mayim bialik and think that show is she I love her so much

717
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:52,620
You can love will we and not like I have learned so much from her about neuroscience and being Jewish

718
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,700
fantastic

719
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,900
Bree your gaming week how what kind of video get I I know I know you're no more the business

720
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,760
Surely you take a break with a game once in a while. Yes

721
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,640
I am reminded that I need to play the games and just promote the games

722
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,560
so I

723
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:13,560
Participated in my first marathon last year and that did not end. Well, so what did I do to console myself?

724
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,520
I bought a game and that was Yoshi's wooly world. I

725
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:24,420
Love Yoshi's wooly world. Why are we why are we like confessing this like we're at an alcohol rehabilitation clinic

726
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,420
It's so cute

727
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,200
You know what it doesn't it does not matter gamers are gamers and I have to show Bree what I got hold on keep talking

728
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:39,280
So I I've been playing Yoshi's wooly world and I'm actually progressing through it

729
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,640
And I'm really proud because my gameplay lasts all of 20 minutes and then I get frustrated and then I stop

730
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,000
it doesn't matter if it's a mobile game or if I'm playing on my Xbox one and

731
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,620
Make a yarn Yoshi and it's the first time I see it and I want to just cuddle with it

732
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,120
How cool

733
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,220
See, so I was gifted a Wii U for my birthday

734
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,360
But I don't have any fun amiibo or anything. Like I don't even know what to do with that. I

735
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,700
Here's a tiny one you can cuddle with that's out of the box

736
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:24,780
And I also started playing never alone on my Xbox one and I really admire that game because of the

737
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:31,600
Story behind it and the purpose behind its creation. So I would love if I were to get into game development

738
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,740
I would love to do something that represents my Hawaiian culture because there is a whole story there

739
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:40,280
That's not told hula is not like a sexual dance at all

740
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,620
But you know not a lot of people know about those things. So that's what I'm playing now

741
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,400
That is an awesome like I never alone was was really cool in that regard like that it kind of blended the whole like

742
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,860
Education, I don't want to say you're not education in the way like Carmen Sandiego did education

743
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,820
But you know like just like you kind of like oh, I'm learning something about

744
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:05,720
You know, maybe something I would have experienced otherwise, which is why diversity is. Yes. It is important in games. Yes. So anyway

745
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,560
Great. Thank you for sharing about your week. All right

746
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:14,540
My gaming week, so I mentioned there's been a game that I've been playing a lot on Xbox packers compatibility

747
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,360
So here it is. Here's the funny thing. It was on the Xbox 360, but it actually didn't start there

748
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,760
This game is like 20 years old and it's I really believe this is like

749
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,060
One of the best video games ever made and we talked about it a lot on the show

750
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,020
But I haven't really revisited this game in a long time

751
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,560
But I have fallen in love in love again with Castlevania Symphony of the night

752
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,560
That is a game that I'm sure most of the people listening have bought at least one

753
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:49,180
I'm sure I'm sure and I've like three copies. It's not the first time I've played it people. Oh, yes star Sakura

754
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,560
For copies of it

755
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,320
No, and I actually you know what?

756
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,480
I was actually thinking today as I was playing through the game again because you know again

757
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,240
It's been when was the last time you went for two hundred point six percent in the game or more?

758
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,320
It's probably been a long time for most of you

759
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:10,700
So I think I really love that this backwards compatibility has made me revisit some things and what was funny is that I got a new

760
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,740
Achievement in the game today, right and I looked at my history

761
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:20,880
Okay, here's the here's the hilarious thing. My other achievements in the game were unlocked on

762
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,860
March

763
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,860
27th tomorrow, right

764
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:31,780
2007 oh wow. Oh my god, if if leap year. Mm-hmm

765
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,620
Existed. Mm-hmm. It would have been two days before I know

766
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,040
But anyway, I was thinking as I was playing today

767
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,080
I was like I really need to harass dark Sakura to figure out how to get a

768
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,040
Saturn from her for a little bit and a copy of the other I could just give Alan back his

769
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,560
Perfect so I can

770
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:56,560
Okay, so yeah so I can experience this because I've never played the Saturn version and I like I must play Maria's story

771
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,840
It's all Maria is like the most overpowered character in the history of anything. That's okay

772
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:08,760
All you have to do is stand in a corner and do the Santa you attack over and over and it's this big

773
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:14,680
Blue dragon that just flies all over the screen and you can control it too. So it's like hi

774
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,520
I'm completely overpowered and she has I don't did you did you play?

775
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,720
Dracula X any at all. Uh, I played a little bit. I played the the Super Nintendo port, which wasn't

776
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,480
Maria as playable in that one. I played a little bit you brought it to an episode of all our ones I did but

777
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:38,180
She's like kind of hard. She's easy and hard at the same time because her attacks are really useful and she has her animal friends

778
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,780
but

779
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:46,780
She's way overpowered in in not turn in the moonlight. Mm-hmm. I have that on the turbo graphic 16 actually

780
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,700
So, yeah a person owed us a hundred bucks and paid us back with that

781
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,780
So that that's just like rediscovering

782
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:02,160
Castlevania Symphony Night because I don't I find that you know, it's been what like nine years since the last time I played I don't

783
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,980
Remember where I like it. I remember. Oh, yeah, I have to get missed for this

784
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,420
I have to get the bat which came first we get the miss first the bat first

785
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,100
I don't remember it's been so long. So I had to you know, and actually at one point I was like Alan

786
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:20,740
Do you remember where the miss thing is? Cuz I can't find it. What we still have a strategy guide for it

787
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:25,780
Oh, yeah heat. Well, he just went to game facts or something. Yeah, so I cheated for you so that you had plausible

788
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,780
Yeah ability exactly. So I'm I have I haven't looked at a single guide

789
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,340
there's only two things only two

790
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,020
A

791
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:39,300
Armor only two things you ever need in that game. One of them is the walk armor

792
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,180
The second one is the Yota tuna

793
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:48,500
Which you can only get from one creature and it has a 1% drop rate. Oh, yeah, I've heard about that

794
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:54,680
But when you have the Yota tuna, it may not be the strongest weapon, but it's the fastest and it hits multiple

795
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,900
Yeah, that's awesome. I spent three hours getting one

796
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,300
It's when you were revisiting that game we noticed that

797
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,740
One of the things that's so fun about it is that the eat the monsters they're all so melodramatic

798
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:15,060
Like when you kill them, they're like bones everywhere in flames and whining and crying. It's like this is a little plant creature

799
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,760
There's 20 of them on the screen and they're all gonna go through this

800
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:23,580
Oscar performance because just because they die like a thousand bones very very little stem

801
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:30,060
Yeah, or you killed the little the little sword lady ladies, yeah, yeah, they'll go and then when you kill

802
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:37,460
Noises and then like they they fall over in these big explosion anybody this place

803
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,700
Are you like your best fight?

804
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,780
Anybody this place to be tonight recently knows exactly what the hell I'm talking about the blood zombies

805
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:46,220
I hate them that noise they make when the blood fountains out, but I'm like, that's so gross

806
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,740
And they all do it every time

807
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,140
What is a man so?

808
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:59,020
Miserable pile of secrets the horrific voice acting of the PlayStation 1 era just I'm interested in this

809
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:04,060
I'm interested in this. I'm interested in this. It's like can I just buy potions without having to hear you?

810
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,780
Alucard, I'm interested in this shut up

811
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:14,820
Little fairy flying around with you. There is something funny about this wall and you want to know what's funny

812
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,980
It's actually just as annoying in Japanese

813
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,780
it literally is just

814
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:25,380
Alucard still has this gorgeous rich voice and it's really annoying either way

815
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,980
It's just like they talk too much

816
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:35,060
Stopped so yeah, I just you know, I know we've talked about this game on other episodes and it's a classic

817
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,180
But just I'm just reminded this week. There's a damn good reason for that

818
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,300
you know, you can go back to this game and just fall in love with it all over again and

819
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,700
You know the 50,000

820
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,420
Games like it that have come since you know what?

821
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:53,660
Even close which you know which but I see my other the castle thing is probably honestly in like my top three games of all

822
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,540
time but like the number one is going to be Super Metroid and it's like

823
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,780
You might as well have just named like two of the same thing for your name

824
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:07,420
It's because they have so much in common, but yet they don't you know, so I just so so good

825
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:13,580
Nothing had the ending of Super Metroid. No, nothing especially the first time I saw that I I almost cry

826
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:17,980
Yeah, the end of that like save the animals. Yep save the Metroids

827
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,820
So there was that and that is honestly taking up a big chunk of my gaming week

828
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:26,940
But there's been some other stuff too actually on Steam, you know, I'm a retro guy. I love my retro stuff

829
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,940
So on Steam this week, I actually did pick up

830
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,860
Atari vault came out this we heard about steam how much is that it is

831
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:40,140
I think they have a discount this week only where it's 1699 as opposed to 1999 for all of the Atari for all of it

832
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:44,420
So here it's like a hundred it's a hundred different Atari games arcade and 2600

833
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:50,280
So here's the thing. They took that iPad app and iPhone app they have and they ported it to the PC

834
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:56,500
It's that so at first glance I was like, oh they just ported the app and they got rid of all the mini

835
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,380
Transactions you just pay for the whole damn thing in one swoop

836
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,460
But the good thing is as opposed to my iPad or iPhone

837
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:05,940
I actually have tangible controls like the way this thing is meant to be played

838
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:11,220
I have to use my thumb or anything ridiculous like that, right? So that part's cool. Um, but

839
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,300
Yeah, I feel like they actually have added to it as well because the cool thing is on Steam

840
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:23,540
You can actually do multiplayer through Steam and that in itself is like, okay shoot. This is cool

841
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,820
This is different and there's leaderboards, you know achievements things like that

842
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:32,420
so and the achievements are not easy like the only one I've gotten so far because

843
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,860
I have played a shitload of yards revenge one of the greatest

844
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:41,240
600 games ever made right? Yes, one of the achievements is you have to be able to shoot the flying spiral

845
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,700
Not just kill the base, but shoot the flying spiral and that I get that I can do

846
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,700
Oh my goodness

847
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:52,660
That's how you unlock Howard Scott workshop initials you have to shoot the flying spiral then you fly into the pixel the dead pixel

848
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,660
That's like on the right hand side of the screen

849
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,580
muscle memory from when I was like seven this is

850
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:03,460
It's that's been the cool part about Atari vault is almost called that Atari party

851
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:09,940
But you might as well it might as well as well. It was sorry party is kind of getting to revisit all that

852
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,580
So yeah, so I'll try vaults on Steam if you are a retro whore like me

853
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,680
You're probably gonna love it if you're not then

854
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:20,340
Don't but I think I think there's a lot of good stuff in it

855
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,760
Or I would say if you did buy the whole thing on iPad or iPhone or I'm sure it's on Android, too

856
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,600
Maybe you don't need it twice depends on what you want if you want it on Steam

857
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,720
I think it's I think it's still a good deal. So check that out

858
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:36,400
But that's really made up the bulk of my gimme week. I guess I've had a very retro week screw new games

859
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:43,800
Not really. Hey, if it's any consolation I played I played Little Nemo Dream Master on my NES sweet

860
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,040
I just got picked it up last week. So yeah

861
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,720
What's funny is that Castlevania Symphony of the Night has also made me go I

862
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,520
Really want to play Simon's Quest again?

863
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,720
Only on the Wii U because you could save it whenever you want that is because otherwise

864
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,360
God forbid you didn't find the red jewel now, you got to go back

865
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,080
Alan do you wanna say something real quick? No. No, I thought you were

866
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:14,520
Know that you mentioned Little Nemo the Dream Master. Now. The first level music is in my head. I

867
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:19,220
Love the music in that Capcom. Why can't you be that awesome anymore? Oh

868
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
Because Street Fighter 5

869
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,500
Which is a disappointment. Oh, thank you for reminding me the other game. I played this week Pokken tournament. Ah

870
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,280
nice

871
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,240
You thought I was gonna say Street Fighter 5

872
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:38,600
No, I've been playing the game that everybody quit Street Fighter 5 to play which is which is Pokken boss

873
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,880
Which I fight I beat the Green League. Whoo

874
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,520
I'm better than beginner. Yeah, I'm not so beginner, but it's still kind of bad

875
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:52,960
There you go, and then Alan for some reason doesn't like Alan thinks I'm very cheap when I play Pokken

876
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,980
Right. It's just the character that you play

877
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:04,400
Braxian Brax, there's lots of projectiles and you just sort of spit fire at them and the enemy just kind of maybe it's the difficulty

878
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,240
You're playing on but they really just kind of get the shit kicked out of them. I'm like they can't even move Alan

879
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,240
I'm just that good. Yeah that guy

880
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,440
I

881
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,320
Just like Braxian because she's funny. So there you go

882
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:21,440
I do like her super where it's all like hearts and rainbows and pretty princess magic and then why I had the player and then

883
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,620
It's like okay. Well that just blew up and killed that person. So great job. Thanks rainbows

884
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,480
Thanks killer rainbows

885
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,920
Anyhow, some quick housekeeping then we're gonna get into news tonight. So we will not be here next week

886
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,200
There will be no show next Sunday because Alan and I will be out of town and we're like getting back at six o'clock

887
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,240
So we'll be back too late for orange lounge radio

888
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,920
But you know, we'll we'll see you guys in two weeks

889
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:51,440
And actually it's gonna be a double weekend because sack IG sack IG DA in the arcade is going to be that

890
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,580
Saturday and then that Sunday there will be a new OLR. So that's gonna be a very busy weekend

891
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:00,480
So you get no OLR next week, but you get like twice the broadcasting the week after to make up for it

892
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,000
Oh, yeah, so some of those things let you deposit an episode of the bank and you get much more

893
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,120
Alright, so that's that's really uh, that's really all we have for housekeeping

894
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:15,000
Otherwise, follow us on twitter twitter.com slash OLR. We're all we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

895
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,640
We are overdue for some news. We're only an hour and eight minutes. We haven't touched a single news story yet

896
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,220
So let's get to it Alan starting us off tonight within the last week

897
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:30,560
The internet was all a flit a buzz about yet another leak of the Nintendo NX

898
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:36,620
Controller and allegedly what it what it looked like like whether it was a proof of concept or developers kit or whatever

899
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,700
So all of these sites, you know when a leak like that is released

900
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,980
If it's hard to verify

901
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,060
They're like, okay

902
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:52,860
Well, our competitor sites are getting clicks on this so we need to run this story too so that we're not

903
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,860
behind

904
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:59,500
but the whole thing was fake and that was confirmed by the two people that um

905
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:06,120
Did the mock-up of it? It's just all fake. It was all fake. It was an incredibly elaborate fake, too

906
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,440
Yeah, like it was very well done

907
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,520
I mean you could have fooled me and we did we talked about it last week on this show and we entertained it and I'm

908
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,680
Sure, there's some people that want to be like haha you fell for it, especially like because you know

909
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:22,580
there are some things about that leak device that lends reason to be critical of Nintendo and even I

910
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,160
Was not a fan of the fact that there were no buttons

911
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,120
But I still think you know

912
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:32,240
There's a lot of people in the community that are talking about this right now and we don't necessarily break news on this show

913
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,920
We discuss what's being talked about in the gaming community

914
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,480
So, you know, I kind of kind of don't apologize in that regard for talking about it last week

915
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,720
But I think we've all learned, you know

916
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,640
We've got to be a little more cautious with some of these leaks is that Wow

917
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,160
Photographs are getting more and more and more convincing because I mean if you think about it

918
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:55,000
Even though like the reddit team and I'm not singling them out on purpose, but it's just who comes to mind

919
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,480
You know, they were trying to figure out

920
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,560
Oh, it was this particular developer office in Sweden based on the tree

921
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,040
That's for a reflected in this and the fact of the keyboard all this shit. Okay, it's like Mulder calm down

922
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:09,120
Yeah, there's all this no but my point is there's all this detective work going into it and still couldn't tell it was a fake

923
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,400
so

924
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,640
You know, and I'm sure there's some people out there. They're like, I knew it was a fake the whole time

925
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:22,080
Yeah, well, you know, we didn't have the receipts really so, you know now that they've come out and said that it was fake

926
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,520
It is what it is, but I hope if nothing else

927
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,120
maybe Nintendo because they're

928
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,840
The reason why a lot of people were so ready to believe what was seen is because it matched

929
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,920
The patent that had been filed previously, right?

930
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,200
So that's why there were so many people that were ready to believe what they were seeing because it was in line with the patent

931
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,000
That Nintendo had filed

932
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,640
So I hope if nothing else

933
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,560
Maybe Nintendo at least did hear some of that feedback and so that they do make sure whatever it is

934
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,440
They're doing does have

935
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,400
Buttons or you know some of the other, you know things that people were complaining about last week me for me

936
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,320
It's really the buttons. I don't it's cool

937
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,000
If they want to do the whole thing a touchscreen or whatever and they want to change the shape

938
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,880
I don't really care about any of that. I just I need tangible buttons. That's what separates my console from my iPhone, honestly, so

939
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,000
but I

940
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,200
I really wish I really wish Loki was here to give us a follow-up

941
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,560
But we'll have to check in with him in a couple weeks when we're all back

942
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:26,520
Let's see going to our chat room over at live dot vog network comm yyr said this dude on neo gaff made a mock-up with

943
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,200
a 3d printer s class troll lol lol lol

944
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,680
Dark Tetsuya says I just don't get the motive for going that far out of their way to deceive people

945
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:41,560
But that's just me. Well that dark Tetsuya. The answer is because the internet

946
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,880
For three whole days or however long you got one over on all of the internet

947
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:52,280
Yeah, and you got to see all these sites running your bullshit. I literally that dude was masturbating to those Kotaku articles

948
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,320
I'm sorry to be so vile

949
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:58,360
but that's why people do it because they're just like oh man Kotaku just ran or

950
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,920
Some people like boobs

951
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,600
Like attention

952
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,840
Other people that's right for stealing my joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry other people like buttonless controllers

953
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,680
some people like fakes

954
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,920
Some people like fake boobs

955
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,440
All right, I just hurt my eyes rolling them

956
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,640
Anyhow

957
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:31,720
Let's see s 200 Matt says buttons are not just preferable for some people. It's necessary for disabled gamers

958
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,740
I hope Nintendo considers this. Hmm. That is an interesting

959
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,920
Conversation that came out of it came out of it. Kai judo says I don't mind it

960
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,360
They fool us for a few days than say it was a joke. No harm done

961
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:47,980
That is a good point. At least they did come out and say okay before y'all get too crazy. We're done

962
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,720
You know, we got what we needed out of it. We've had a good laugh. It was fake

963
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,880
Fooled you April Fool's. Yeah, I was gonna say stay the hell off the internet day

964
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,400
aka April Fool's is

965
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:02,080
Next week this whole but I'm glad we're not having a show

966
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:08,560
Are we gonna be in the air in the plane on the first cuz I can't view the internet when I'm 30,000 feet in

967
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:14,700
The air so that's fine with me. Yes, you can now. Well, we'll be we'll be hanging out with our buddies in Tucson

968
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,280
This is the day before our nerd thing on Saturday. So we'll be hanging out with our buddies in Tucson all day

969
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,360
Eating copious amount of Mexican food. Yeah, however

970
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,560
Please go to mass affecting dot tumblr.com

971
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,200
And look at the glorious joke. I made making a mockery of

972
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,040
April 1st, I

973
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,780
Always always one to self-promote here on the show. All right, because my blog is amazing

974
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,480
so let's talk about some other rumors and things that have a lot of

975
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,120
Attraction on the internet this week

976
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,000
the Nikkei

977
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,600
Japanese news publication was reporting that Nintendo is going to cease

978
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:59,220
Wii U production at the end of the year to make way for their next platform the Nintendo NX

979
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:05,840
The publication saying that poorly selling software and lack of interest in the hardware is the reason why production is ceasing

980
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,240
Nintendo of course pretty swiftly denied this

981
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:16,220
In a statement here, I'm trying to see where the actual quote is here on the statement

982
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,720
The news did not come from Nintendo

983
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:26,080
Of course and the company is still going to produce more hardware units during the next fiscal term and beyond

984
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:34,140
So they said Nintendo said the Wii U is seen hit titles recently such as Splatoon and Super Mario maker and Nintendo is going to continue

985
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,680
with shipments so yeah, and I

986
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,520
When I saw that thing I was like there's got to be a mistranslation here or something like why a

987
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,800
Why would Nintendo possible? Well, I don't think it was something it was meant to be announced. It was a leak or whatever

988
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,680
But Nintendo is still planning to release games through holiday

989
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,880
We know that Zelda is going to be a holiday release now granted

990
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,780
I know there's the whole thing like well, it could be an NX game as well as a Wii U game

991
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,040
Well, okay, then if it's a Wii U game

992
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:09,200
It's still going to necessitate more Wii U units because the Wii U is going to become the budget system

993
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:13,680
That's what always happens at the end of the life cycle of the games is that you know

994
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,280
They didn't just you know

995
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:22,080
Kill off the PlayStation 3 the minute the PlayStation 4 came out the PlayStation 3 simply became the budget system

996
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,580
It was the one that was significantly cheaper so you could buy one for your kids bedroom to babysit them all day

997
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,460
That's what's gonna happen with the Wii U

998
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:34,220
So I had a really hard time believing they would just kill production this year

999
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:39,740
You would at least have another year or two. That would really be unheard of to just end production the same year

1000
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:46,860
I mean, I would they be trying to force more people to buy the new and I it just seems ridiculous to me

1001
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,940
Unless there's something about the NX that makes the Wii U

1002
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:56,140
Redundant, but I I can't really figure that out

1003
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,860
I just it would be out of character for Nintendo

1004
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:03,860
There has to be a backwards compatibility thing perhaps on that thing because I mean they did it so well with the Wii and the GameCube

1005
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,660
You know, I mean, we're the Wii U and the Wii. Yeah. Yeah precisely

1006
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:14,700
They didn't just murder the Wii now what it could be and I'll give this maybe there's going to be a new

1007
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,420
Skew at the end of yeah

1008
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:22,240
They're gonna kill off the existing bundles and they'll have like a and they did this with the Wii

1009
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:28,560
They had a Wii that didn't have what DVD playback or something. Yeah, it didn't have backwards compatibility either just yeah

1010
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,800
Something there's something like to like drive down the price even for it's super tiny, too

1011
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:39,280
Yeah, so that I would believe and I think that's where the mistranslation is is that maybe it's not going to be the same Wii U

1012
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:44,120
But there's gonna still be a Wii U and it might just be a different color or a different, you know

1013
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,320
It'll just be something a little different. So that's all

1014
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:55,380
Let's see over in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com YYR says the Wii Mini actually had no internet. Oh, that's right internet

1015
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,380
That's what it was. Didn't it still have the Wii shop?

1016
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,440
Like you have to have the Wii shop. Come on. Well, they stopped the Wii shop

1017
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,920
Well, you still access it, but they didn't put anything new on there. Yeah, it's

1018
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,160
They'll still happily take your money if you'll give it to them

1019
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,580
Oh, yeah, and there's still virtual console things on the Wii shop that aren't on Wii U. Yeah

1020
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:18,140
Um, wow YYR says yeah, no Wii, no Wii shop, no anything. Well, that's crazy

1021
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,500
Dungeon Buster says I wasn't sure the Wii U news either

1022
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:27,680
Nintendo had usually ended production of the previous hardware gen after the introduction of a new one. Yeah, so

1023
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,360
Anyway, we really don't know anything until E3 happens. That's for sure

1024
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,140
Anyhow, Dark Sakura on a different note

1025
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,660
Well, there are some interesting things going on

1026
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:43,380
Especially since we've been talking about the whole let's play controversy and the

1027
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:51,320
Copywriting and everything, but there's actually been a copyright filed for that dragon cancer

1028
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:57,220
let's plays in particular and the big reason is that because the game itself is

1029
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,140
short and

1030
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:04,760
Rather linear. It's not something that you're going to play again and again and so

1031
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,660
Having a let's play of it out

1032
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,620
Sort of eliminates the need to have to someone buy it themselves

1033
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:18,540
Especially since they had a small development team and you know need to actually pay their developers

1034
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:24,220
You know for games that have it was actually quoted on here for games that have

1035
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:31,260
More expansive and replayable gameplay having let's plays can directly benefit their developers

1036
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,540
And then here's where the actual quote is

1037
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:38,300
However, for a short relatively linear experience like us for millions of users viewers

1038
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:44,860
Let's play recordings of our content satisfy their interest and they never go on to interact with the game in the personal way

1039
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,860
We intend it for it to be experienced

1040
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:53,020
They go on to say later on is that people have been posting the entire

1041
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:55,420
soundtrack online

1042
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,020
without even linking back to where to buy it from or

1043
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:02,740
even to the game a lot of the let's plays don't link to where they they can get the game or

1044
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:10,380
Soundtracks for themselves. So this actually in a case like this. It does take money from an indie developers pocket

1045
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,220
This is money that likely is

1046
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:16,240
What they're trying to live on, you know

1047
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,860
so in that way that the let's play ends up being a

1048
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:26,220
Detriment and I will go ahead and read this quote because I really do like it

1049
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,220
We

1050
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:33,340
Are asking that you return the favor by creating let's play videos that don't

1051
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:37,500
Just rebroadcast the entirety of our content with minimal commentary

1052
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:44,900
But instead use portions of our content as a context to share your own stories and start conversations with your viewers

1053
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:50,500
Isn't that interesting because I literally had just talked about I believe let's play streams should be this

1054
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:57,780
Versus just flat gameplay that people want to see and here's a game developer kind of saying that is that we want to hear the

1055
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:03,500
Commentary and the talk and the discussion about what this game makes you feel don't just do a straight rip of our game

1056
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:11,140
Well, that's a little different though from a game that talks about the experience of people dealing with cancer in their lives

1057
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,780
versus

1058
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,780
Mario maker, you know

1059
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:21,680
I was gonna say Borderlands, you know going around shooting people in zero gravity, you know or

1060
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:28,000
Low gravity, you know, it's it's a different story. I don't think that Borderlands really has a

1061
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:32,400
Very or Mario maker has a very deep story

1062
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:36,580
To tell that relates to human experience. Those are escapism

1063
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:42,820
this is trying to get a story across to share an experience and to get a dialogue started and

1064
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,060
Doing

1065
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,060
The let's plays with no commentary or minimal commentary

1066
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:54,380
Does defeat the purpose the point is to talk about it and start a conversation and I also do agree

1067
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,180
You know when you're dealing with

1068
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,860
with independent development for games

1069
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,620
The let's plays can be good

1070
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:08,740
Advertising to an extent but you have to make it a vehicle for for that, you know

1071
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:14,260
In their quote they really just said can you just link back to where people can buy the game and I was like that is

1072
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:20,260
Really not too much to ask people. Well, see that's that's one another one that they asked is, you know

1073
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:25,720
If you're gonna do something like this donate a dollar or two to the studio if you believe and I'm gonna say that what we

1074
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:29,100
Did has value the small act will allow us to continue to work

1075
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:32,260
So I would actually encourage everyone right now

1076
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,980
That's listening to this

1077
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:39,500
You've got a dollar I'm sure you have a dollar if you can pay for your internet access you have a dollar

1078
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:46,220
Go to that dragons cancer calm that dragon cancer calm and give them a dollar

1079
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:51,380
Right now do it. I want to see your receipt. Wow. I think this is the first time in

1080
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:57,100
13 years that Jamie hasn't said give me a dollar. She's saying give somebody else a dollar

1081
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:00,040
You know, it's because I'm actually employed now

1082
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:04,960
And I have been for two years fair enough, you know, you can get me a taco

1083
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:12,000
But I want you I will I will donate all of my I want everyone to donate the taco money

1084
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,680
To that dragon cancer calm, um, you know

1085
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:21,940
I'm gonna ask the indie dev in the house your thoughts on this whole situation with the let's plays and everything

1086
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,480
Has crumple had let's plays because I know you have a demo out there

1087
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:30,560
There's um, I know a couple of and a couple of folks had had done some twitch streams

1088
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:35,480
The beauty is that my you know, my demo is what I have out there. So that's that

1089
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:41,160
So what they've played in the demo is essentially maybe a quarter of the entire episode

1090
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:45,600
And I think that's where I'm really happy. I I went that I went that route

1091
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:52,160
But you know because what they're playing now, I mean what was in that demo compared to what's in it now

1092
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,320
It's not even there's so much more so I'm not even sad about it

1093
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:01,040
But I do I do think it it it's a huge problem

1094
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,600
I think it's a huge problem because I mean, let's look I mean, let's look at yeah

1095
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,320
Let's look at the steam the steam refund policy, you know, they're trying they're trying to

1096
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,740
Extend the the length of time again, you know one can play, you know

1097
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:18,320
Two hours is enough because what if I beat the game in under two hours and I didn't like it

1098
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,560
Even though I beat the game. I want my money back

1099
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,760
You know what I'm saying?

1100
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:28,020
And it's it's really it's it's so so it's so so tough right now to be able to do that

1101
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,880
I thought you have to I mean, I don't want to spend too much time trying to figure out

1102
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:39,120
Suggest other ways that they're like, you know, make you know make up cut those losses. But yeah, it's

1103
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:45,700
We in the chapter we you know, even with myself. We just try to say how else can we can we get?

1104
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:50,240
You know, how else can we market our product how you know, what else can we do apparel?

1105
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:56,560
And things like, you know, you know apparel art things like that, you know other little things that are tangible

1106
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,600
This has been my thing with digital versus physical

1107
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:07,080
You know, what's funny what you're saying there that used to be the line that people used to use to justify stealing music

1108
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:13,800
Mm-hmm was the whole well, I bought the poster about the t-shirts with the concert. So I'm gonna take the album

1109
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:20,040
Right, you know or I only want these two songs from this album because the sorry because the rest of the album

1110
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:25,600
Is just awful. So that's why I only style. I downloaded these two songs. These are the only two songs I wanted

1111
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,200
I didn't want to pay $15 for it

1112
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:32,520
and and yeah, and you know, but but it's so funny because now we seem to be going back to

1113
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:41,240
That old way of things because you know, it's like how do I prevent you know, my digital product being?

1114
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:49,720
pirated and copied and I had mentioned I affect I sent Brianna a big article about that there was a particular game studio that

1115
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,040
can't remember the name of the game off the top of my head, but

1116
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,160
They had hit a milestone where they sold 300,000 copies

1117
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:03,280
but they had they had a but there was a pirated amount of 1.6 million and

1118
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:09,600
Most of them were from Russia Brazil Wow, and that that's that's insanity

1119
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:15,480
That's utter insane. So you so they're like, yeah, we've sold we've met, you know, we've sold over 300 grand

1120
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:20,920
In our game, but 1.6 million have sexually stolen it. So it's like what do you put on the box?

1121
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,080
Sold 300,000 copies or played by two million, right?

1122
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,280
By played by two million pirates. What do you do about that? Yeah. Yeah

1123
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,040
Going to our chat over at live dog network calm our pal

1124
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:38,800
Bobby black wolf says there was even that one guy who liked the game, but it was less than two hours

1125
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,560
So they wanted their money back. Anyway, I think with firewatch

1126
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:46,520
Yeah firewatch game but like I view it see I view the short games

1127
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,040
Especially the ones that tell a story like that like firewatch. I enjoyed firewatch

1128
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:58,200
I didn't like firewatch as much as like gone home or I think everybody's gone to the rapture was my favorite of those

1129
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,200
Walking simulators. Yeah

1130
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,000
But I still view them as movies

1131
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,600
Right movies are only gonna be like two hours and you my god

1132
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,840
Do you know how much you fucking pay to go to a movie these days?

1133
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,360
But that's the expert but I think that's the thing, you know, it's that perception and that expectation

1134
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:21,040
What we have we sold us have we as indie game developers sold ourselves so desperately short

1135
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,520
Because it's like we have to make it free

1136
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,840
Otherwise, no one's gonna give a crap about our game and because even my game

1137
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,040
I know my crumple game is gonna be short

1138
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,820
Hope probably depending on how it's played, but I'm gonna sell it for a dollar this so

1139
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,640
This is what blows my fucking mind. You ready? Okay, so

1140
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:45,240
What what was said right there the guy who sold back firewatch because it was too damn short or whatever it I bet

1141
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,360
that son of a bitch went this weekend and

1142
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:56,320
Went and saw Batman vs Superman. Mm-hmm, even when they probably read all over the internet. Oh god

1143
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:01,060
I'm gonna fucking hate this movie. It's gonna be garbage and sad Ben Affleck and oh god

1144
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:04,040
It's gonna be look at the Metacritic rating. It's gonna be so fucking terrible

1145
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,020
And yeah, give me a $5 soda and popcorn with that, right? Yeah

1146
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:12,020
Yeah, but then went to Starbucks before that and it's like look and I'm not saying I didn't see Batman vs Superman

1147
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,500
I don't know if it's good or bad

1148
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:19,140
My whole thing is that like dude probably talk shit about the movie on the internet went and paid the money to see it

1149
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:24,260
Anyway, but yet wants a refund on firewatch. Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah, apparently it's so bad. It's hilarious

1150
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:28,300
I don't I've heard some people like it. Some people think whatever I haven't seen it yet

1151
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:34,620
I have no I know I'm just saying based based on Twitter, which I judge a lot of things based on what I see on Twitter

1152
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:36,620
It's my perception of the entire world

1153
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,300
It was about Batman vs Superman, but we don't need to go down

1154
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:48,220
And and funny enough this happened to um, there was a guy in the news about someone someone had pirated. I think it was

1155
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,660
Diablo 2 or something like that Diablo 2 and finally actually like paid for it like 19 years later or something like that

1156
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:59,360
I don't know if it was Diablo 2, but they did that. Okay, since you brought that up

1157
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:04,220
Do you know what's fucking crazy about that story Jamie? Did you did you hear about that story? Huh?

1158
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,500
So apparently

1159
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:14,340
Someone I think it was Diablo 2 someone had pirated a copy of Diablo 2 like 19 years ago

1160
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:19,180
And they and they just put in the news like a dick couple days ago that that person who pirated it

1161
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,860
Finally bought the game. Okay, you know, yeah, here's the punchline. It was shivam

1162
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:30,460
Why really? Yes, our old pal that we used to play DDR with what that was him. Oh

1163
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:36,860
My god, yes, cuz I saw I read about it on his Twitter feed on his that was not

1164
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:38,860
That was not what I was expecting you to say

1165
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,260
These years later and I'm like, oh my god, like he yeah, he's been all over the

1166
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:48,740
Tacos and all that stuff like dude pays Diablo developer 40 bucks. Yeah, it's our old pal show him

1167
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,540
We just play DDR with oh my good. Oh, I just outed him as a DDR player, too

1168
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,060
Sorry

1169
01:28:55,060 --> 01:29:01,420
Now looking up his name no, I was okay with people knowing that I was a thief but a DER person

1170
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:06,900
Yeah, I have I have limits don't put my business in the street wrong

1171
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:11,200
You're just in Sacramento. Stop doing that

1172
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:17,300
But that scares me though, like that scared that scares me as a developer that scares the hell out of me

1173
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:22,660
It's like how much super impressed after years of actually not talking to him that I remember his last name. Yeah

1174
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:26,580
Right, and it's it's one of those things were like if you know the guy like, you know

1175
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:30,480
We just played either are with him like when I read that this didn't surprise me whatsoever. Like this is just

1176
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,180
Like when I when I heard he did this I was like, oh, yeah

1177
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:39,380
Even though I probably last like saw him in person probably like ten years ago. This is still doesn't surprise me whatsoever

1178
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:46,040
Anyway, it's funny. Yeah. Well, I mean again it you know, I think just as a

1179
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:52,640
As a you know as a chair for the chapter, you know, you know and Brianna and I we just we just

1180
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:57,100
Try to give all the suggestions that we possibly can to just market your stuff

1181
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:02,740
I mean, I have to remind myself Brianna has to tell me sometimes Gabriel, by the way, don't forget this

1182
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:08,140
Don't forget that because it's the only way you know, that's gonna help you get that word out there

1183
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:14,660
So, I mean, it's yeah, it's a meant that digital meant to help us, but it's biting us in the ass

1184
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:21,240
All right. Well, let's let's move on. I this let's play thing really doesn't have an easy solution

1185
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:28,440
I'm really curious to see what's gonna happen legally with this stuff as something like twitch gains more and more and more traction

1186
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:32,520
But honestly and like I I do a little bit of streaming myself. I don't do a lot of it

1187
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,240
I really need to do more admittedly as a media personality or whatever the hell you want to call it

1188
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:43,140
I need to do more of it, but I have no problem like linking back to buy the game

1189
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,640
Duh, like why not? Yeah, that's give me good reasons

1190
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:52,180
Why not because I can't think of any so anyway, let's move on with some more news Alan

1191
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:59,120
So it has been rumored that they a Sony is making a PlayStation 4.5

1192
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,920
Console, which is that sort of the pet name that the rumor Mills given it

1193
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:11,040
Digital Foundry released a report that says that the existence of this thing has been corroborated

1194
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:17,320
From independent sources and it's been independent which sort of sounds like my friend who I can't tell you who he is

1195
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,200
But he's like super serious and he works there like it sounds like one of those

1196
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:27,040
But apparently a prototype exists and Sony devs do have it and are messing with it

1197
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:35,420
The speculation now is what would a PlayStation 4.5 be in relation to the current one?

1198
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:41,120
Would it be a replacement like it would be the PlayStation slim where they're just like if you buy a PlayStation 4 it will be

1199
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,660
this version

1200
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:48,980
Will it be something that is only advertised to those that have the technology like a 4k TV that can use it

1201
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:54,760
Like you absolutely do not need this unless you're goddamn loaded and you have the TV then we've made this for you

1202
01:31:55,100 --> 01:32:00,020
To cater to the the bleeding-edge people or will it be a weird sort of?

1203
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:04,860
3ds versus new 3ds type console where it's like a side grade

1204
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:12,260
But then I guess from the Digital Foundry report the see the GPU that they would put in it is so powerful

1205
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:18,360
It really is something that could wait for like a next generation release

1206
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:23,960
So why would they spend the money? It wouldn't be very affordable to put that in for something that would just be a side grade

1207
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,860
It's better than 4.5

1208
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:44,260
And Gabe can probably attest to this a little bit

1209
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:49,260
Even programming for HD and doing graphics for HD is a bitch

1210
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,260
Can you imagine 4k?

1211
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:58,340
Well, that's just it because you know and again you you touched upon this earlier when you were talking about

1212
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:04,580
The the NX controller without the buttons all we know when someone said in the in the in the room about you know

1213
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:10,020
What about those who need the buttons because you know of disabled players and such it would be the same thing here

1214
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:13,420
you know like people can barely see you know, like

1215
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:17,900
Okay, watch out watch the my and by the way most like my I am funny

1216
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:22,340
I shouldn't be complaining my my thumb had hit the switch and my mic was off and I was talking a minute ago

1217
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:33,000
Thank you, so because yeah, it takes so much and what and the problem is is that you know for for reading

1218
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,780
It's really difficult for the just the the average person just really like what is that saying in there? Oh my god

1219
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:44,000
I need I need a tube TV. So yeah. Yeah 4k. No, thank you. We're not ready yet

1220
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:50,180
Why why are in chat did say that the rumor is that it's going to be capable of 4k media playback

1221
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:54,800
But it's not gonna do anything for the games that makes a little more sense since yeah

1222
01:33:54,800 --> 01:34:01,100
You know the devices in your living room aren't just for games anymore and that makes a lot more sense. Mm-hmm

1223
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:06,540
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about some more rumors

1224
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,540
It's like an all rumor edition of

1225
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:14,300
Orange lounge radio, but apparently actually I think Microsoft is actually

1226
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,940
Clarified this one here. So

1227
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:23,020
Microsoft recently did a customer survey talking about digital trade-in which started this whole thing that all

1228
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:27,260
Microsoft's looking at doing digital trade-ins. Well Xbox games marketing

1229
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,220
Aaron Greenberg actually mentioned on Twitter

1230
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:35,740
We are not actively planning such a thing always asking questions to understand the needs of our fans

1231
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:43,620
No need to worry and in a reply to games analyst Michael patcher. I'm sorry. I always say it wrong games analyst

1232
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:48,640
Michael patcher said we are not actively planning such a thing surprised

1233
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:55,460
It was even asked in a survey not fire being played with so if you were excited about the digital trade-ins just wait longer

1234
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:57,460
Isn't that what they got?

1235
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:01,060
Obliterated over the that's sort of the theme. Oh, no, no

1236
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:04,260
No, nobody would have cared if you could actually trade in your digital games

1237
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:09,660
But it was the whole fact that it was going to be that the disk things would still be tied to your console

1238
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:13,260
That was the whole it was like a license that was bound. Yeah, exactly exactly

1239
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:18,400
That was the thing that was getting rubbing people the wrong way. But what do you three was that?

1240
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,780
2013 12. Yeah, I think 13. Yeah

1241
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:31,580
Because then there was the one where like well that was in the whole pre build-up and that nothing was out yet. Yeah, and then

1242
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,620
Sony came out on the stage and

1243
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:41,140
Literally punched them in the face with the whole video that said they literally did it like you came out with a big

1244
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:47,780
Honestly, that's what it felt like did you all did you all not see Microsoft getting punched in the face of that e3?

1245
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:50,540
That's gonna be awesome. We look back at the decade in gaming

1246
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:55,540
That's gonna be one of the top ten moments easy for the record. Hmm the misuse of the world literal

1247
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,060
Figurally makes my head explode. I

1248
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,460
Literally am not sorry

1249
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:02,900
I

1250
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:05,800
Agree with you. I agree with you Jamie

1251
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:11,580
Well, then why don't why don't you tell us a literal news story over there at our soccer

1252
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,820
Well

1253
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:21,500
You know, it would actually help if it had pulled up and not frozen on me. There we go. Okay, so minecraft stuff

1254
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,940
We like minecraft only

1255
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:29,020
Yes, I used to like my I've never played it and I'm not I'm not trolling sort of goodness

1256
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:34,940
Never played minecraft and I thought I was living under a rock not playing the last of us

1257
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,540
Minecraft for me is just oh

1258
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:44,980
Happy quiet music dig holes dig holes. It's a Zen game. It's a very Zen game to play is

1259
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:46,820
so

1260
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:50,740
Minecraft is getting another real-world crossover

1261
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,740
There

1262
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:59,540
Is a tech conference in Norway called the gathering and they're hosting a live concert in

1263
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:08,180
Real life actually know they already did this according to this. Sorry. They hosted a concert in real life and in Minecraft

1264
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:10,060
so

1265
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:12,060
They have volunteers

1266
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,060
Um

1267
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:18,940
Mimicking the artists in Minecraft that you know, the ones that were parading on the stage

1268
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:22,340
They're having it do it in Minecraft with people playing it

1269
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:26,380
So and it was a pretty big deal from what I can tell

1270
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,440
so

1271
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:32,840
Yeah, there apparently was only room for like 3,000 people on the server for that

1272
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,920
I'd love to know if anyone actually watched this thing and what they thought of it. So

1273
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,560
That sounds awesome, yeah, I think so kind of like Second Life and almost sounds like what's second

1274
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,460
Flying dicks

1275
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,460
Show up in Second Life

1276
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,920
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

1277
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:58,040
Let's look at some video games coming out this week around the world

1278
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,460
Starting off with Allen's gonna help out with the US States since Loki's not here

1279
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:05,680
So it looks like a shit ton of oculus drift games are coming out this week

1280
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,900
Oh, could that be because the oculus rift retail release is happening. I think so

1281
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:14,620
I'm sorry not oops scratch that not retail release, but the like the first

1282
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:22,000
Version is finally hitting the hands of like real people. Okay, so for the oculus rift

01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:29,020
We have a drift adventure time at Magic Man's head games blaze rush chronos dead Street or dead secret

1284
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:33,240

1285
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:41,400
Eve Valkyrie fly to Kuma keep talking and nobody explodes

1286
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:46,220
Lucky's tail ratty radial G

1287

smashing the battle and

1288
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:56,080
Winlands that's the big lineup for oculus rift. That's all on the 28th tomorrow. Sounds good

1289
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:00,080
29th we've got killer instinct season 3 Minecraft

1290
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:07,560
Story mode episode 5 order up and they'll be 16 the show. Yay another annual sports game. They get shit out, you know every

1291
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:13,260
13 months look some people love. Yes. I know there. Yeah, don't poop on them

1292
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:22,360
Night, cry Knights of Azure for ps4. No time to explain ps4 the Walking Dead Michonne episode 2 give no shelter

1293
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,180
on epic for the ps4 and ps Vita great game

1294
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:34,580
Epistory typing chronicles for Windows. I wonder if that's typing to the dead alternative who knows

1295
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:40,420
Ashes, maybe what Mavis beacon evolved into finally the final this is my final form

Ashes of the singularity

1298
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:54,460
Hyperlight drifter for Windows and Mac Oh out sleeping dogs definitive edition for Mac

1299
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:59,160
Which is worth noticing just because it's a it's a game not made by Blizzard for the Mac. That's you know

1300
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,420
triple-a title

1301
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:04,140
star ocean integrity and faithlessness

1302
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:10,800
For ps4 and then taking it to the first which is I think the end of next week Adam's venture

1303
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:14,780
origins for a Windows ps4 and Xbox one and then stick bold

1304
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:20,940
Exclamation point a dodgeball adventure for Windows. Is that related to Dax exclamation point? I

1305
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:25,820
Don't think so, I think that game knows the lyrics to I will survive

1306
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:31,660
Anyway, not everybody's gonna understand that that's okay. Is that it? Yeah, I finally get that

1307
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,800
Moving on let's go to Japan. Let's all go in a plane right now

1308
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:39,820
Okay, since we can't let's look at their release calendar

1309
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:43,020
So March 31st on the PlayStation 4 sees star ocean 5

1310
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:48,780
Integrity and faithlessness which Alan just mentioned is also coming out in Japan this week as well as winning post 8

1311
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:54,560
2016 please note. This is not actually a game about post horses. That's right

1312
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:01,900
It's a horsey game and they love horsey games in Japan in chat ikuma son says, oh, yay. Welcome to Japan

1313
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:03,840
That's right. We're all staying at your place

1314
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,740
Yeah, I think you missed the episode of Kuma where we actually talked about we're coming to Japan and crashing at your place

1315
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,740
So hope there's room. All right anyway

1316
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:16,460
On the Vita Kona Ozora needs to bust out. Whoa, he'll get a cruise sign

1317
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:22,820
Comes out in regular and limited edition. I'm assuming this is based off an anime called cruise sign

1318
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:25,160
I am NOT up to up on my anime

1319
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,780
But that's what this kind of looks like here

1320
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,900
dating sim

1321
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,300
visual novel

1322
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:36,760
What you know, you love those so why not and then on the 3ds this week nothing

1323
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,020
Nothing in Japan this week on the 3ds actually wait April 2nd

1324
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:45,020
Yokai-san go kushi not to be confused with

1325
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:50,580
Yokai watch this is oh, no, it is it is the characters from yokai. Well, I take that back

1326
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:53,620
it is the characters in yokai watch in a

1327
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:58,540
Different type of game this looks a little bit more like some type of

1328
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:03,380
Tactical type of the romance of the three kingdoms. It actually means

1329
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:09,880
Records of the three empires. So it's yokai watch three romances. Well, that's an interesting little crossover there

1330
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:14,640
So yeah, I'm assuming that's gonna be the big release in Japan this week then because yokai. Yep

1331
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:21,920
So coming out in the UK just a few things on the 28th. We have a drift for PC and

1332
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,600
we have gun jack and

1333
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:32,520
pinball FX to VR and then on the 29th, we have Resident Evil 6 for ps4 and

1334
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,640

1335
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,640
Sorry Xbox one

1336
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,640
The Xbone, you know

1337
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:42,080
I'm innocent and no one saw that except us

1338
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:44,960
That's it

1339
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,960
La la la. All right, just a couple more stories for you guys

1340
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:52,440
And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week Rob's real favorite game

1341
01:42:52,440 --> 01:43:00,080
I I'm so excited about this week's classic game. You guys don't I can't even I literally cannot even but first Alan

1342
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,720
Game stop for their shareholders having a rough time

1343
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:13,440
A game shop share game stop shares are collapsing after the company said it expects sales to fall this quarter

1344
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:17,720
So they put out, you know a release saying hey, we know what our numbers are looking like

1345
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:25,080
So we're you know, it's not gonna be a surprise. This is what's happening. And of course

1346
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:31,360
Shares fell as much as 7% I don't really actually to see if this has

1347
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,360
This

1348
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,920
Story caught me by surprise so close after the release dates, so

1349
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,080
So game stops in trouble, basically

1350
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:49,440
yeah, they're losing money which I don't want to say yay cuz like people work there and a lot of people who love video games

1351
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,160
get their foot in the door by working at GameStop until they

1352
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:58,540
Become jaded and miserable and leave because they're apparently not really a good place to work for really

1353
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:02,460
I'm not gonna shit on the employees really because do you know what I was gonna say about GameStop?

1354
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:17,220
Regardless of what they represent like people who absolutely have to buy their groceries at Walmart because that's what they can afford

1355
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:21,100
Don't hate on them hate the fact that just Walmart's a big gross company. All right. All right

1356
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:26,160
Yeah, I think as of March 24th they were

1357
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:33,800
They they were 30 bucks a share which doesn't really seem all that bad to me but

1358
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:41,760
Well, if the company used to be like $60 a share now, they're $30 a sure it actually would be so it's not even like

1359
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:44,720
They're there in their death throes, you know

1360
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:49,280
Get get ready to put them on a boat and set them on fire and kick them out to see it's not to that point

1361
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,280
Yet they're just they're not doing well

1362
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,080
But

1363
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:59,240
But but they're gonna they're gonna make all that money through nerd licensing and they're gonna they're basically gonna become hot topic

1364
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:03,320
But instead of like shirts for your favorite topic is the video game hot topic

1365
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:09,200
You know, it's like half kirby t-shirt Zelda t-shirts. That's true. It's like instead of the metal band t-shirts

1366
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:13,760
It'll be like oh and here's our used. It's all Kingdom Hearts and Adventure Time, which I'm all for that's true

1367
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:18,140
I'm like, I'm fucking 37 years old still shop a hot topic cuz that's where I get some really funny shirts

1368
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:24,660
So, what can you do and they got think geek now too, I think yeah, they're thinking with merchandise soon

1369
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:30,340
Well, I know GameStop's also been getting into that whole like use tablet and like, you know devices

1370
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:33,600
so, you know that I will give them at least that as much as you know,

1371
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:38,860
I have to razz on in a little bit cuz you know GameStop at least they are trying like they can kind of see the

1372
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:40,980
end coming so they're really trying to

1373
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,220
like

1374
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,220
Think fast and not have that happen

1375
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,700
So, all right

1376
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:52,180
Well, anyhow, let's move on one more story here and then we'll get to the classic game of the week

1377
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:56,420
And this has to do with making your own steam controller. That's right

1378
01:45:56,420 --> 01:46:02,140
You can just if you have the technical know-how, why don't just build your own damn controller. You think it's so easy

1379
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:08,140
You think you think we charge too much of this controller here go build your own damn controller because valve

1380
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:13,980
Actually released the CAD files the computer-aided design CAD files for the steam controller

1381
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:20,900
They actually post it on Steam. Here's a zip file. And if you have the technical know-how, you can actually use a 3d printer and

1382
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,540
Be on your way like you know

1383
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:26,420
You're gonna have to know the technical know-how to like wire it together and shit

1384
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:31,000
But if you are that person go ye forth and build your own steam controller

1385
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:39,100
That is kind of crazy for a company that is first getting into hardware like valve to be doing that but I found that

1386
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:40,580
fascinating

1387
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:47,360
But valve does say as far as commercial use goes valve will have to approve designs and give permission

1388
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:52,960
Before users are allowed to sell their work because you know right now somebody is like, okay

1389
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:58,780
Well now these CAD design is out here. How do I place these two directional pads right on top of tits?

1390
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:04,540
Somebody is thinking that right now

1391
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:06,620
So if they want to be able to sell that commercially

1392
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:11,100
They're gonna have to get valves permission and I can think I think Lord gave him in his temple Michael

1393
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:20,460
No, so, you know, I I don't think I don't think the tit controller will actually be available or balls whatever you're into

1394
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:26,060
You know, there's some somebody's trying to figure. I will allow a half-life episode 3 before I let those things

1395
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:29,420
We all know how that's gonna go down

1396
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:35,100
Akuma JP in our chat over at live dot vog network comm says darn there goes my idea. Well, I'm sorry. Sorry

1397
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:40,580
Sometimes we break the difficult news here on this show. I'm sorry to say. All right

1398
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:45,580
Let's get to the classic game of the week every week dark soccer steps into the gaming vault

1399
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:53,600
And she finds a game that she thinks hey you insufferable little brats of the world. I mean you adorable children

1400
01:47:54,020 --> 01:48:01,960
Why don't you take a take a look back on a classic game at least 10 years old that you need to respect?

1401
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,280
Respect

1402
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:07,300
Because all future games have this game to thank for where they come from

1403
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,320
And I think that's especially true about this week's game

1404
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:16,560
Which I'm so glad you decided when we have such esteemed guests here from the Sacramento IGDA

1405
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:22,200
I'm so glad you picked this dark soccer this we had to pick it out the classic game

1406
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:26,160
I had to pick it out from a bin under the bed that was covered in dust bunnies

1407
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:32,320
And then I like how to make sure the cat didn't pee on it so so what is it what is this week's classic game?

1408
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,780
Of the week shy swirled. I mean spice world

1409
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:47,500
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah, it's appropriate because we had the the news of the 20th anniversary tour this week

1410
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,240
So this is this is by the way

1411
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:54,120
Hello, by the way. Hi there. How are you doing?

1412
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,800
By the way

1413
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,500
This game. I'm sorry. The Spice Girls are celebrating their 20th anniversary this year

1414
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,560
How old are you?

1415
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:11,400
All right quiet. We're trying to do a segment here. He's my segment. I was only three years old when wannabe came out. Yeah, right

1416
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:18,240
This game well, I believe that this was what 1998 yeah

1417
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:25,520
Yeah, well the Spice Girls were really only around for about four years so yeah, I had to be he was hilarious

1418
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,920
I love the movie. It's so bad. It's

1419
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:35,960
Meatloaf and back before like he was like fucking crazy meatloaf and Richard O'Brien and ab fab girls

1420
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:41,800
Like it's oh my god. You showed me that movie when we started dating and he didn't dump me on the spot

1421
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:46,440
I was really I was super on board with it until the aliens showed up and I was like, okay

1422
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:51,160
Is this for real? Is this really happening in this movie when the flying saucer came?

1423
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:54,960
I was hook line and sinker and that that was what broke it for me

1424
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,600
So

1425
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,000
To move on

1426
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,540
Basically in this game you have to prepare the Spice Girls for a live

1427
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:12,120
Television concert and you have to teach them their dance steps because they don't know this by heart

1428
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:19,160
You have to choose what song to perform and the sequence in which the songs lyrics will be sung because without

1429
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,040
Teleprompters, how are they ever gonna remember their lyrics?

1430
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:24,720
you know, so

1431
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:28,280
So then you play once you get all of that put together

1432
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:34,320
You play as the camera person and you pick what shots will go and the angle and everything

1433
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,320
So you were basically their manager designer?

1434
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,840
camera person and PR

1435
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,640
and then

1436
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:46,700
You also get instructed by it says a disco King

1437
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:52,080
let's do so anyway, the Spice Girls all it's all their voices in here and

1438
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,760
Who cares about the game because the Easter eggs are hilarious

1439
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,360
so first of all

1440
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:06,120
In the menu, you have the mixing room dance practice dance record television studio spice network and options the songs in the game

1441
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,800
Are wannabes say you'll be there

1442
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:15,920
Who do you think you are spice up your life move over and if you can't dance is in the intro to become one is

1443
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:21,120
Only in the spice Network and naked is only in the spice Network. So this game

1444
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,760
got a

1445
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,120
Two out of ten from IGN

1446
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,940
3 because you can't spell ignorant without IGN

1447
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:37,620
It got a 2.3 from EGM electronic game monthly gaming monthly

1448
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:42,140
There's a reason why they're out of this game. We know why they're gone

1449
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:48,020
I'll blow low gave them 2.3 out of 10 now a gamer which I don't think I've ever heard of

1450
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:51,900
Was 2.5 out of 10 and the New York Times said it was unfavorable

1451
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:56,020
New York to reach that rag

1452
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:58,940
And

1453
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:02,860
Out of the game rankings site they got

1454
01:52:03,860 --> 01:52:11,900
40% out of four whole reviews. So what about all the good things spice world did it's still better than et apparently

1455
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:18,260
It kept meatloaf relevant for a while. I have had some of the biggest laughs

1456
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:24,080
I have never liked some of my best gaming memories are actually with this game because I laughed so hard that I

1457
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:29,600
Actually peed my pants like it is just this game. Is that funny? I'm sorry

1458
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,520
Not so I have to give you the codes for this the cheat codes because they're hilarious

1459
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,560
There's one called spiffy you dance moves

1460
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:45,800
So you get new moves by holding start and then square triangle circle triangle and you get dance studio and just dance a lot

1461
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:50,520
And then of course, this is PlayStation 1. Okay, then you get naked spice

1462
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,120
Ooh

1463
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:56,200
so if you do the hidden messages code and then you do

1464
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,200
L1 l2 r1 r2 select and start

1465
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:07,580
Simultaneously to reset the game and you get an alternate title screen that has them all naked except for sitting in chairs covering their bits

1466
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,880
Get out. That was a thing. That was a thing. I

1467
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,080
shit you not I

1468
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,880
Somebody just put that on Wikipedia. Oh

1469
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:21,200
Oh my god, I never knew that was the thing that you could actually do

1470
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:28,640
Rob has to see this. That's okay. You just I'll see you during break. Well, I'm gonna put it in the chat room

1471
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:34,520
Oh, will you now? Oh boy. All right, check that out over at live dog network calm. Here comes some naked spice girls

1472
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:42,480
Naked spice so the premise is that you have to help them with their dance moves and they're remembering the lyrics

1473
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,520
Oh my god, cuz it sounds like

1474
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,280
it sounds like the game starts off as

1475
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,480
The Spice Girls aren't very bright

1476
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:56,780
You need to you need to help them like with their with what they do for a living the part that's killing me

1477
01:53:56,780 --> 01:54:00,660
I am like I'm like laughing crying over here. Look at the

1478
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:05,680
expressions on like Jerry's face and like scary space like

1479
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,520
fucking scary spice is like spread-eagle in that chair going

1480
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:15,160
No, that's posh in the middle oh

1481
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:20,760
My god, I'm scary is the one on the left looking like a rabbit, honey. I know my Spice Girls

1482
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:27,440
Scarier anyhow, go ahead. Sorry. Sorry, go ahead and finish

1483
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,280
Anyway other codes you can get a new title screen

1484
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,640
With codes you can get giant spice

1485
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,440
So

1486
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:46,440
At the main menu when your characters walking across the globe if you hold start and press circle square circle square

1487
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:50,200
Then they'll grow up to giant size

1488
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:55,660
You also can get the hidden messages. This was the thing that takes you to the naked spice

1489
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:03,080
Where when your characters walking across the globe you hold start button circle triangle triangle circle

1490
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:06,040
And then you'll get a code to confirm and you enter in more shit

1491
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:10,160
You can look this up for yourselves and then the handbag code. This is great

1492
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:15,260
Set the globe you press the start square triangle circle triangle

1493
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,240
After that when you go to the television studio when your act is ready

1494
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:25,880
Instead of everyone standing in a line all the Spice Girls will be crowded around a pile of handbags on the floor

1495
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
That's it

1496
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,040
Ah

1497
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,040
Game of the year game of the millennia. Really? I mean, is there is there a more important?

1498
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:40,560
I mean, I know I just said that whole thing about Symphony of the Night, but then I'm like, oh, yeah Spice World shit

1499
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:48,160
Like Castlevania doesn't even fucking matter anymore. No, no, what is a man a miserable pile of naked spice girl codes?

1500
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:54,960
Alan I feel like you're dying to say something over there about Spice World. No. No, did you play?

1501
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,000
Did you play this game when it was first out? No, you will you know, it's hilarious

1502
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:02,800
Is that our buddy Brad from pod culture celebrated 500 episodes last week in here?

1503
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:10,000
They Brad actually sent me a copy of Spice World for PlayStation 1 and I have yet to do a live stream of it

1504
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,560
Cuz I didn't get my PlayStation 3 cuz you have to do like some bypass protection on PlayStation 3 so long story short

1505
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,360
I haven't done it yet, but I really think Alan

1506
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:22,040
I think we should sit down and take some serious time to actually play through the game. What do you think? Sure sound like

1507
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:25,120
You're so easy to please

1508
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:30,480
Hello what what I have another game that is

1509
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:35,160
Not oh, yeah, it's it's kind of I guess the same theory

1510
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:39,080
But I'll tell you what at the time I couldn't make my way through the game

1511
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:45,720
but it's on Dreamcast called super producers and it's basically you're controlling a pop idols career and

1512
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:49,960
It kind of makes me think cuz these came out like around the same time

1513
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:53,800
That I wonder if one or the other wasn't the inspiration or something

1514
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,720
All

1515
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:59,720
Right. Well, we're gonna take a quick break guys. We're running a maybe a little bit long tonight

1516
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:02,920
But when we come back, I think our guests are still gonna be here you guys do you stay?

1517
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,040
Okay, so they're gonna stay a little longer

1518
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:09,400
We'll talk to them a little more and we'll get your calls at one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange

1519
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:14,360
Lounge radio plenty more of orange launch ready to come when we come back right after this

1520
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:26,000
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number

1521
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:29,480
636 for this March the 27th of

1522
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,640
2016

1523
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:38,620
Joined tonight with our special guests here in studio Gabe and Brianna from the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA

1524
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:40,080
Thanks for having fun with us tonight

1525
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:44,460
I know I know you guys must have loved the spice world pick their classic game of the week. That was

1526
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,320
hilarious

1527
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:47,840
Yes

1528
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:52,200
Educational too. Yeah, it was it was educational. It was better than chubby cherub

1529
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:56,480
how how is spice world inspired you as a game designer, um, I

1530
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,800
Yes that answer

1531
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:09,640
That's all I've got. Yes. I'm still convinced to this day that the Jerry at that time

1532
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,120
Would have probably qualified as a bioqueen

1533
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:18,320
You you have been like all like like drag-queening your life this past week

1534
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:22,860
Not that I'm gonna complain, but I feel like you like just now finally suddenly figured out. Oh, yeah

1535
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:27,440
I should be watching RuPaul's Drag Race. No, it's not just that it's that I appreciate art

1536
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:29,200
and

1537
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:31,200
I have discovered this is an art

1538
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:34,200
And so I have absolutely fall in love with it because you know

1539
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:38,160
I pick an obsession like that lasts me for six months and then I'd move on to something else

1540
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:40,160
It's like Alan playing games

1541
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,780
But am I wrong no, I would recommend

1542
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,320
It's 25 minutes long

1543
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:50,380
Which is actually sped up from the normal to our process of just watching

1544
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:55,280
Trixie talk through putting on her makeup. Oh, I have and it's a couple times

1545
01:58:55,280 --> 01:59:01,760
It's incredible and doing makeup on that other guy the bald guy st. James. Yeah, who is one of the club kids

1546
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:06,400
So I knew him from that. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Okay, so if

1547
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,400
Drag queens are art

1548
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:12,680
And if video games are art

1549
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:17,440
Where is my RuPaul's Drag Race video game?

1550
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:21,600
This is not like I feel like this is an SAT equation

1551
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:26,760
That has not been accurately based channel 5 came out for the second recast in 1999

1552
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:34,440
What's that from here out? I am going to combine dragon cosplay. Oh

1553
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:41,640
Okay, interesting starting with my cosplay this year for gamer X are you are you going as ooh la la

1554
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:47,320
This is a bad list. Okay. All right. I am going I've already decided to do my moto kuma outfit

1555
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:49,840
It's gonna be

1556
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:55,560
I'm actually going to invest in a good wig. I'm going to buy makeup specifically for this

1557
01:59:56,040 --> 02:00:01,200
Just remember if you're not wearing nails, you're not doing drag. I'm having bear gloves. All right

1558
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:08,160
Anyway, I'll paint the nails on them fifth dream in chat says drag in age get it

1559
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,600
Over here dying over here

1560
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,640
maybe

1561
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:16,640
Well, I was not in the first game before

1562
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:24,520
Corrects me with an email. I do know there was an iPhone game that like I think was calling dragopolis or something

1563
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:29,200
Yeah, because I know they were advertising going gamer X but I know it was a runner, right?

1564
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:37,400
Dorian's contour work, but but here's my thing. I need my full like immersive we you

1565
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:42,520
Tablet actually know now I want to aim for PlayStation VR now

1566
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:45,320
I think we should be able to actually walk the main stage

1567
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:51,280
No, just have it on ps4 with an option for VR

1568
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:57,640
No, right for those of us who get completely motion sick and would throw up on the heels. All right, fine fine

1569
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:02,160
Maybe ps4 K. This is this is a use. This is a justifiable use of 4k

1570
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:07,680
I need to see all of the colors and Kim she'll you murder face says it perfectly a drag race MMO. I

1571
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:15,800
Love it. I love it. Why not? But see I I think the cosplay in and of itself is related

1572
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:21,120
I think any dude that's playing a female tune in an MMO is kind of doing a drag race

1573
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,480
To begin with

1574
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,640
That's just the way I approach things I

1575
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,920
Have been considering that cosplay really isn't that far of a step off. It's not

1576
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:40,200
Especially for cross players. Mm-hmm, you know, it's art dress-up is fun period dress-up is fun. That's it

1577
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,200
Yeah, and putting on a lot of makeup

1578
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:47,400
That takes an hour. Mm-hmm is very satisfying when you're done with it and even more to wash it off

1579
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:50,400
Why don't you cross play for a sack indie arcade? I bet they'd love that

1580
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:56,480
I don't have a costume for that right now. Just have my I just have my Grey Warden

1581
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:01,800
And I ain't wearing that it then when it's hot. I was gonna say Grey Warden. Yes

1582
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:09,120
I do have my Joker outfit from Mass Effect 3, but if I'm gonna be working all day, I probably it's so it's such a

1583
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:13,160
Like actually it makes me not like night. Hey bitch, I'm hot

1584
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:17,060
Like I know like I'm physically hot and sweaty and fucking nasty

1585
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:22,680
Well, the thing is that as warm as your outfit is I've got more layers on mine

1586
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:28,440
Yeah, yeah, and I was hot in the middle of December at the beginning of December in that thing. So

1587
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:36,200
All right. I I am I am really pleased at how the chat room is really engaging in this whole conversation

1588
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:40,340
I love our listeners fifth dream in chat says I want a rocky horror picture show game

1589
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:47,060
They made two based off the play believe it or not. There was one in on like the Apple to eat all those years ago

1590
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:53,420
Yeah, well it had graphics but it was like derpy graphics. Yeah, it was like the original King's Quest type of graph. Yeah

1591
02:02:54,780 --> 02:03:01,260
And then they made one for the revival on CD-ROM in like the late 90s

1592
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:07,220
But it was what you would expect on early CD-ROM games. First double six says drag racing star

1593
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:12,340
A drag racing star. That's actually it's called sing star Abba. I don't know if any of you have it

1594
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:17,540
I do I own that and sing star Queen. So it's kind of I'm kind of already there. I'm one step ahead of you, buddy

1595
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:22,120
Tiger conscious is the drag race game should be Mario Kart style

1596
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,900
Sold. I

1597
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,900
Agree, I oh man. I

1598
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:32,100
Take a road to a whole new level as I say rainbow road blue shells. Oh

1599
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:35,820
Yes, seriously, like when you blue shell somebody it could be bitch

1600
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:38,940
a

1601
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:42,180
Kuma son says that they wish that they had drag race over there

1602
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:46,220
Yeah, there are ways of obtaining that's right

1603
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:52,060
You gotta you gotta use especially even when we whitelist the logo site and it still won't let us pass the commercials

1604
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:57,360
All right, that was five minutes of drag queen talk here on the show. So there we've met our quota for tonight

1605
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:03,700
Let's go around the gaming industry and do some rapid-fire gaming news help coming late to it. It's fine. It's fine

1606
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:06,780
I'm fashionably late to nobody's perfect. Except me. I understand

1607
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:09,220
All right

1608
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:11,820
Let's do some news real quick very quickly

1609
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:19,020
I believe Ubisoft has Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell movies coming out historically video game movies

1610
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:23,820
Don't do as well because they're generally not good

1611
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:30,020
a lot of hype is riding on the World of Warcraft movie, but Ubisoft has made it clear that

1612
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:35,260
once Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell once they come out if really if there's

1613
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:38,700
If it looks like they're gonna make their money back and there's any positive buzz

1614
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:45,000
They're just gonna bankroll the sequels almost immediately. Like they're very interested in making both of those franchises or both of those

1615
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:53,340
IPs franchises, so there's gonna be an Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell 2 movie unless of course it bombs

1616
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,860
Spectacularly and maybe they'll probably make them anyway

1617
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:01,860
As an aside there have been like three or four hitman movies and I've they've had a different dude play

1618
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:06,140
Because I was at Target and I saw the hitman blu-ray and I was like

1619
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:11,540
I thought the drug dealer from go or whatever that guy's name is was the hitman but it's like no they've they made another one

1620
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:13,540
With a different dude in it. Yeah, that's very true. Yep

1621
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:21,240
Again quickly the founder and creator of the oculus rift Palmer lucky

1622
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:28,460
Has worked, you know blood sweat and tears and getting this thing developed and working and to make it a viable

1623
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:35,660
Consumer product that it was just available via retail and wasn't some weird exclusive dev kit and he said damn it

1624
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,660
This has been you know, my life's work

1625
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:40,420
I'm not gonna let some scrub at UPS

1626
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:43,160
delivery guy give the first customer

1627
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:50,940
This this baby of mine, so he flew to Alaska to give a pre-order to a dude like two days before everyone else

1628
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:57,220
Making great use of Facebook's billions. Just no I it's cool. I think that's cool

1629
02:05:57,260 --> 02:06:00,500
So yeah, everyone else I guess gets theirs tomorrow, but he made a point to fly out

1630
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:03,340
To give this random

1631
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,340
Alaska dude his rift

1632
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:08,820
Rock band for say I didn't even know about this rock band for

1633
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:13,700
PC which I believe it's not a Kickstarter. It's a fig. I think it said

1634
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:21,020
Crowd crowdfunding thing harmonics is trying to get a rock band for released unlike previous

1635
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:23,660
licenses on let's say the

1636
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:26,460
PlayStation or Xbox

1637
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:28,580
none of the DLC or

1638
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:34,280
a la carte songs that you would buy for it would carry over even if you own one of those previous licenses because all the

1639
02:06:34,340 --> 02:06:36,060
PC is a different

1640
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:37,380
method of

1641
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,780
Delivery every iteration of how you could play a piece of IP has to be licensed

1642
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:45,740
Well, if you are willing to give twenty five hundred dollars

1643
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:54,260
To this fig campaign for rock band for to come out on PC. You will get every single a la carte song

1644
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:57,620
That has been that is available on the rock band store

1645
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:00,940
every single song and I imagine that's possible because

1646
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:04,500
What medium or what platform is?

1647
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:10,300
Dot saw song on dogs songs digitally licensed for first

1648
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:15,660
iTunes Amazon Google which are all PC

1649
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:18,460
Methods of

1650
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,420
Purchase or Mac or whatever

1651
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:24,660
So I imagine that's how they're able to do that so you can scroll through the entire list and go

1652
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:26,020
I don't know what I want to play

1653
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:31,860
Yes, so for if you have $2,500 you and this game is made as a super hella donor

1654
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:37,660
Whatever you will get every single DLC a la carte song for rock band. All right, I'll get right on that

1655
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:44,620
How's that sound take some of our savings and buy every DLC song ever. Is that sound good? Yes. Yay. I don't need a car. I

1656
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:46,300
I

1657
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,300
Need a rock band. I don't need a car

1658
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:55,100
Let's talk about game trailers. I remember it was about a month or two ago game trailers kind of shut their doors suddenly

1659
02:07:55,100 --> 02:08:00,040
Well, guess what happened? Some of the team has actually reassembled and now they are called easy allies

1660
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,460
You can find that on you know

1661
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:05,340
Twitch and Twitter and all that good stuff and of course

1662
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:09,900
They're on patreon because that's the way a lot of these companies are doing business these days

1663
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:15,300
So, there you go, if you want to check out the personalities from game trailers, they're probably over easy allies now

1664
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:22,720
So check that out killer instinct season 3 is on the way and season 3 can be purchased either through a combo breaker

1665
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:25,100
ultra-edition and supreme edition

1666
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:30,860
Apparently the windows 10 players are gonna get the supreme edition for $10 less than the Xbox one

1667
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:37,500
This is because there is no killer instinct classic or killer instinct 2 classic in the PC version of the bundle

1668
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:42,380
So anyhow, the combo breaker will have eight new fighters including rash arbiter

1669
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:49,340
Kim Wu and tusk that will be available on Xbox one for $20 and then the ultra edition has a VIP

1670
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:52,680
double XP booster retro costumes accessory sets

1671
02:08:53,140 --> 02:09:00,160
And a bunch of other crap for 40 bucks and then the supreme edition is crap upon crap in the game for $60 for a lot

1672
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,380
of crap

1673
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:03,620
Anyhow, you might be interested

1674
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:09,500
We've talked a lot about Castlevania tonight. And if you are a fan of old-school Castlevania, I'm talking to 8-bit Castlevania

1675
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:11,660
You might want to check out brave earth

1676
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:16,700
prologue brave earth prologue was first announced in 2011 and

1677
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:20,720
This is from the same developer as I want to be the guy

1678
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:27,740
And he's actually went over to steam greenlight to kind of pitch this game and get the game greenlit

1679
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:30,840
So you can check that out over on steam greenlight

1680
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:37,760
Inspired by Castlevania Ninja Gaiden these old games a 2016 release is almost assured

1681
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:43,840
For difficulty settings in the game from I'm assuming easy to dear God make it stop

1682
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:47,080
Let's move on dark soccer

1683
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:50,440
Well, there is gonna be a new gaming show in the UK

1684
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:58,180
Well, it will be on UK TV later this year called Dara O'Brien's go 8-bit and it could suck

1685
02:09:58,180 --> 02:10:04,700
It could be good. But basically it's combining retro gaming with the latest technology and

1686
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:10,300
Viewers of all ages so should come out autumn 2016. So

1687
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,520
okay, and then

1688
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:19,500
David hater has words to say about Kojima

1689
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:24,660
Basically

1690
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:30,360
He was asked if he was going to play the phantom pain his response was yeah

1691
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:36,700
That'll be 60 hours of humiliation that I can't get to I haven't played the latest two iterations because it's just too painful

1692
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:43,440
And he asked if you would work with Kojima again, and he says I've got no particular love for Kojima

1693
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,440
I don't feel any need to go back and work with him again

1694
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:47,220
and

1695
02:10:47,220 --> 02:10:49,220
Then last but not least

1696
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:51,620
There we were really quick on the Kojima thing

1697
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:55,980
I think especially because now you actually know the backstory behind this dark Sakura

1698
02:10:55,980 --> 02:11:01,700
I think after you talk about like what David hater said about Hideo Kojima you need this

1699
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:12,020
It's the shade button people it's the shade button when you throw when you throw shade, you know

1700
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:16,220
You got to use the little button there. So if I you know say a little zinger like, you know

1701
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:18,820
well, you know we we

1702
02:11:19,060 --> 02:11:21,060
Breakups are very hard to get over anyway

1703
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,900
so

1704
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:28,780
Also, it could be possible that we may have Tekken 7 on

1705
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:33,140
Home computers on PC

1706
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:36,900
So there were there was a poll out

1707
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:42,200
This one was a very extensive poll asking for impressions of fighters

1708
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:46,500
but also there was a mention about seeing if

1709
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:52,740
There would be any interest in having it on PC, I think this was

1710
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:57,220
Japan only so far

1711
02:11:58,420 --> 02:11:59,540
but

1712
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:03,640
Who knows I wouldn't mind it and then we'd all get to mod it and I could have you know

1713
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:07,900
All kinds of pretty things happen on the screen then

1714
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:13,420
All right, we're gonna get to our frugal question of the week

1715
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:19,860
But first I want to point out a kaijuto and chat talking about the shade button says if you have to explain the sound effect

1716
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:21,860
It's not a good sound effect

1717
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:28,180
Thank you for that kaijuto appreciate that you're just feeling left out by the way

1718
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:30,660
I want to apologize some folks in the chat room are complaining

1719
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:35,300
I guess some mic is making some weird noises and unfortunately, one of the things about live radio is that

1720
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:38,740
No, I think it might it's either mine or it's Alan's

1721
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:41,200
I don't know because I know Alan's mic has been having some issues. But anyway

1722
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:42,600
Sorry about that

1723
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:44,520
If you are hearing like crackling or something

1724
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:50,680
It sounds like one of these wires might be dying and to be fair these mics which were graciously donated by our buddy Brad from

1725
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:52,680
Podculture they are reaching

1726
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:56,160
Several years old at this point. I mean they were in the last studio

1727
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,720
Yeah, it might be time for a shopping spree

1728
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:01,400
Time to buy ourselves something fancy

1729
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:06,920
Can't wait. So sorry for sorry that you guys are putting up with that. So we'll we'll work on that

1730
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:11,720
Meanwhile, let's get to the frugal question of the week every week

1731
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:17,520
You guys go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and google.com

1732
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:21,280
Slash plus orange lounge radio and we ask a question and you answer it

1733
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:39,920
Over on Facebook and Google Plus we asked we have our special guests tonight from the Sacramento IGDA to talk to us about the indie arcade gaming expo

1734
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:41,920
So we thought we'd ask about indie games

1735
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:47,220
What is your favorite indie or underground game that you've played that you don't think many people have heard about?

1736
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:50,800
So we did a little thing for indie games. So, let's see

1737
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:56,640
Andy are actually replied over on Facebook and said I think a lot of people have heard about it

1738
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:01,760
But guacamelee is probably one of my favorite indie games hand of fate might be a little more obscure

1739
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,520
It is one I'd recommend to anyone who is intrigued by a roguelike

1740
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:09,400
where you build a deck of cards that determines the pieces that the roguelike builds on as

1741
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:13,080
G100 Matt says for a long time. I was playing the forest on Steam

1742
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:16,920
The game is a survival horror game with plenty of crafting and jump scares

1743
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:19,400
The game has been in early access for the past 20 months

1744
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:24,720
But excuse me, the creators and dev team updated at least one to two times a month and chat with fans frequently

1745
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:27,880
The game has gone through a lot of changes, but it's a lot of fun

1746
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:33,360
Even though there's no real ending to it yet. I would definitely recommend it to people but keep in mind that it's still in early access

1747
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:42,240
Retertainment says I just got into her story on iOS her stories narrative and presentation hooked me in a way that no other iOS game

1748
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:46,640
Has I don't know how well-known her story is considering the awards at one last year

1749
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:49,520
But her story is a game that should be more well-known than it is

1750
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:55,880
Ragenator says the closest thing that fits the bill for me would be super stardust HD a PSN game on PlayStation 3

1751
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:57,580
When I was a console gamer

1752
02:14:57,580 --> 02:15:01,000
This is an early PSN purchase for me and ended up being one of my favorites

1753
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:06,660
Being played regularly up until my system was stolen very addicting. That's a shitty ending though. Sorry to hear about that

1754
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:10,620
Degenerate I remember hearing about that when it happened, but it sucks hearing about it now

1755
02:15:11,140 --> 02:15:18,020
Jenner Johnny says I think everyone shouldn't be surprised with my choice. Although many have heard of its controversies and a successful Kickstarter

1756
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:22,900
It's apparent that very few have actually experienced the MMO card game hex shards of fate

1757
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:26,700
It's well thought-out RPG elements strategically structured campaign

1758
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:31,420
Beautiful artwork on its vast library of cards and it's extremely flexible tournament schedules

1759
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:37,780
Hex trading card game has been placed as my favorite indie underground game as well as favorite card game of all time

1760
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:41,700
Fifth dream says I love a game called chroma squad

1761
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:47,340
It's a strategy RPG that simulates running a TV studio shooting a super sentai series

1762
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:54,020
You are the director and customize your team manage their costumes weapons sponsors insurance, even their giant robot

1763
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:55,300
You have to keep awesome

1764
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:59,040
You have to keep your ratings up and fulfill fan requests during TV episodes

1765
02:15:59,140 --> 02:16:04,980
One of the fans in the game is me since I pledged to a kickstarter way back when it's a really funny and fun game

1766
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:09,580
And dar Tetsuya on Facebook says I actually completed labulana on Steam a few weeks ago

1767
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:13,940
I can't recommend it enough though. You may want to walk through or some guide to help you if you get stuck

1768
02:16:13,940 --> 02:16:19,460
It's very much like Simon's quest as far as hints go my last completion clocked in at 60 hours

1769
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:26,620
So you'll be getting a lot of playtime for the asking price and lastly over on Google+. Josh why said our lux

1770
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:32,300
This is the very essence of an RTS and I think it's the AI that makes it

1771
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:36,460
It doesn't give any quarter and it's always in the balance if you can make it through

1772
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:44,300
So it's available there on Windows and Android and iOS. So you left some little links there over on our Google+. page

1773
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:50,440
So there it is our frugal question of the week any guy anything you guys want to plug here a great indie game

1774
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:52,440
You think more people need to know about?

1775
02:16:53,380 --> 02:17:00,660
Without your own game. Sorry Gabe. Yeah, you have to plug that Alan anything that I can think of like for example hotline

1776
02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:03,020
Miami incredible soundtrack very violent

1777
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:07,460
There's tons of hype for that game. So everything indie that I can think of

1778
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:10,420
Already has you know?

1779
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:14,540
Momenta behind it like there are no real sleeper hits that no one knows about that. I've played

1780
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:18,820
Hot duffel boyfriend

1781
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:23,040
Because it's great and pigeons

1782
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:28,740
And I know this one is is huge and it's gaining a lot of steam lately

1783
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:34,780
But I still think there are some people maybe in this room dark soccer that very badly need to play stardew Valley

1784
02:17:35,060 --> 02:17:38,820
So I'm just saying well and don't forget though about off

1785
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,460
mm-hmm and

1786
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:47,580
Great now, I just forgot the name of it and I know the game and I gave it to you Undertale Undertale. Yes

1787
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:49,580
Oh, yeah Undertale

1788
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:55,140
Yeah, everybody knows Undertale. Yeah, but off was really good. It was kind of big on tumblr for a while

1789
02:17:55,140 --> 02:17:59,060
Yeah, but I still like my bird dating game. Mm-hmm

1790
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:04,260
Jamie mentioned how to full boyfriend there is a game

1791
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:07,580
that

1792
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:10,740
I'm kind of hesitant to recommend because it is

1793
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:16,300
It's an adult game and the fact that it has sexual elements and it really does hurt

1794
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:21,020
What the game otherwise would be it's called Super Health Club. You've seen me play this game Rob

1795
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:26,980
It's a gay visual novel slash romance simulator where you're at a gym and there are four different guys at the gym

1796
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:29,980
and there is

1797
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,300
Explicit there are porny moments. Yes

1798
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:38,300
And it's like if there was a game like that when I was 15

1799
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:44,260
Minus the porn it would have been incredibly important to me to play a game where I could like be a boy flirting with other

1800
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:46,260
boys

1801
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:49,180
Yeah, that's Philip that's the guy who I romance first

1802
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:52,980
So that I think is definitely a game

1803
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:56,140
An indie game that doesn't have really a lot of hype to it

1804
02:18:56,140 --> 02:19:00,340
But it would help to be gay and it would be it would help to be okay with that type of content

1805
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:02,540
What was that a Super Health Club Super Health Club? Okay

1806
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:06,820
Indie game Gabe, I mean you've obviously played a lot of them

1807
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:10,780
Yeah, there's so many

1808
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:15,180
I'm gonna I'm gonna totally name something like not recent at all

1809
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:20,260
It's it's actual physical this game on the 360. It's called the El Shaddai

1810
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,540
Yeah

1811
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:25,340
Awesome. Yeah

1812
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:27,340
Yeah, that that is um

1813
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:30,140
That was a game. I did not expect whatsoever

1814
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:38,220
Wow, what a game what a game it touches upon a lot of historical religious references, which is something I'd you know, it's

1815
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:44,700
Never it where it's rarely ever executed really well, but El Shaddai on the 360. Oh my goodness

1816
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:46,180
I think it may be on the ps3 also

1817
02:19:46,180 --> 02:19:51,660
but but yeah, that was I think it was sort of a sleeper hit because it plays just like

1818
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:55,620
Devil may cry with like the gameplay

1819
02:19:55,700 --> 02:20:02,520
But it's a whole different whole different other ball of wax of what's involved and stuff. Nice. Yeah

1820
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:04,520
All right. Yeah, cool. All right

1821
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:06,140
Well, let's move on

1822
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:11,320
We're gonna get back into some other news and then we're gonna open up the skype line here before too long over at

1823
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:19,000
1877 game olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio, but first Alan with another news story. I

1824
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:22,960
Was talking in chat and I got distracted

1825
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:27,840
How about now you good yes, I'm good now, right

1826
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:32,480
Nintendo has applied for a trademark on

1827
02:20:33,240 --> 02:20:36,240
Actually, Rob, you may be able to help me with this story and pull it up on YouTube

1828
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:39,560
I'm not putting you on the spot Nintendo apply totally are

1829
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:43,480
Nintendo applies for trademark on the iconic

1830
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:47,560
Mario coin sound which has been a

1831
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:55,200
Notification on people's cell phones for when they get an email. It's a very very easily easily found on the internet

1832
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,200
Just a little wave clip of that

1833
02:20:57,280 --> 02:21:03,100
Ding or I can't even which actually there isn't one on this story, but everybody knows the Nintendo coin noise. Everybody knows it

1834
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:08,000
I love though that it's actually they have the musical notes written here. Yes, that's

1835
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:11,280
Fantastic, so they're trying to get that trademark

1836
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:15,680
They registered it in Japan first obviously on the J

1837
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:22,720
Platt Pat website and the part of the trademark like you just said is the sheet music of the tone

1838
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:27,460
It's because a lot of ROM hacks or like super super indie

1839
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:31,720
Bike will use that sound effect because it's so recognizable and they kind of want to put

1840
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:37,200
A pin in that and make it to where they can't just be used willy-nilly

1841
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,120
Well, obviously the Mario coin sound is iconic

1842
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:45,360
But you know what else to me is iconic is the sound that you get when you get a ring in Sonic the Hedgehog

1843
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:51,600
Yeah, and if you go to a gas station, I swear to God the cast registers some gas station with the same damn noise

1844
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:55,440
I throws me every time I'm like, no no, I'm giving you money

1845
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:00,840
Yeah, it's their UPC scanner. So when they are doing your vitamin water and pack of gum

1846
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:02,440
It's like the sonic ring noise

1847
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:07,600
Yes me out now always throws me is that around the nation or is that just here that like I think chevron?

1848
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:11,600
I feel like has that I don't know but it always throws me

1849
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:17,680
Okay, some other folks in chatter like yes. Yes, they do it is around the nation. Thank you. Okay, it's not just here

1850
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:20,200
Throws me every time

1851
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:26,400
So, there you go, I guess they have to trademark it because the cell phones and people that want that type of stuff so

1852
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,840
And

1853
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,560
Probably for knockoff things to like, you know

1854
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:36,400
When flappy bird had like pipes that like looked a lot like the pipes and Mario Brothers

1855
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:38,060
Yeah, you know that whole type of thing

1856
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:43,120
So they probably don't want the sound effects in other games because people may confuse it is

1857
02:22:43,360 --> 02:22:50,000
A Mario game when it is in fact not well, no Mario games will be available on the Xbox one

1858
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,680
But if you do have an Xbox one

1859
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:56,480
There were a bunch of new updates to the firmware that were released this past week

1860
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:03,280
The Xbox a new firmware update went out and it improved Xbox elite wireless controller thumbstick precision

1861
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:05,280
It launched the new Xbox

1862
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:12,200
Accessories app where there's now a page that will show you the firmware version as well as battery status and other details about the controller

1863
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:17,000
And now party chat can be included in twitch broadcasts

1864
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,800
So if you're gonna broadcast your game on twitch

1865
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:24,280
You want other people to be able to comment along with that you can now do that through the party chat on twitch

1866
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:30,360
So that's pretty cool. If you're playing like a group game so you can all swear at each other across the entirety of the internet

1867
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:33,880
You know what? I still miss the Netflix party chat

1868
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:39,760
That was all that was probably next to that between that and one versus 100 on the Xbox 360

1869
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:45,440
Don't get me started gay. Forget it. Forget it. Those are my two favorite things. I miss that

1870
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:46,700
You had it yeah

1871
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:50,200
couldn't for those who don't have no idea what I'm talking about Netflix had a

1872
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:56,440
Had a feature where you and like what was it eight people up to eight people up to eight people can all sit in this

1873
02:23:56,440 --> 02:24:00,760
Little makeshift theater that Netflix created and you can all watch this movie together

1874
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:04,680
Do you know how bad I know that for watching Pee Wee's big holiday?

1875
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:07,080
Do you know how bad I needed something like that?

1876
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:10,580
Cuz like I needed to be able to talk with Shane or something during that movie

1877
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:14,560
Which by the way, I did watch a couple days. Did you finish it? Oh, yeah

1878
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:20,560
It was it was corny but like there were parts where I like laughed till I cried like it was like really like it's like

1879
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:25,920
Stupid funny. My only issue with it is that it's like pretty much the exact same formula as the first movie

1880
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:32,080
Yeah, no, it's it's it's better than big top Pee Wee that's for sure

1881
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:38,560
But it's probably not as good as Pee Wee's big adventure, but will anything ever be I forgot that the Italian lady in that one

1882
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:40,600
Mm-hmm was also in

1883
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:42,760
Escape from LA

1884
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:46,240
Really no kidding. Yeah. Yeah, she got killed really quick

1885
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:53,580
Well, and what's great is that the you know the waitress that Pee Wee falls in love with and goes to the big dinosaur

1886
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:56,680
And Pee Wee's big adventure. Yeah, she's in this new one. Oh cool

1887
02:24:56,680 --> 02:25:00,120
Yeah, so it was really cool to like see but in a different role, obviously

1888
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:03,880
So it was just really cool to see that but the part that killed me

1889
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,440
Absolutely killed me for those that have seen the movie

1890
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:11,360
I'm not gonna totally ruin it but it's the part where he goes to the Snake Ranch and they put him in the room and

1891
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:16,920
With the with the the scary snake and that's all I'm gonna say is his reaction to the scary snake

1892
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:22,640
I just I wasn't expecting that so I just cried like I was laughing so hard it was and it's so stupid

1893
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:28,600
Anyway, that's all I'm gonna say those that have seen the movie know what I'm talking about those they haven't will we'll see it soon

1894
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:34,640
Alright, uh, anyhow moving on also about hey Xbox one, not just my Netflix device

1895
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:39,280
you can also do backwards compatibility, which I've been doing a lot of this past week because

1896
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:44,880
Up next on my list after I beat Symphony of the Night is to go back and play Alan Wake before Quantum Break comes out

1897
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:48,640
So anyhow, but other games you can check out right now, you know

1898
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:50,740
Some folks want to go back and play Dark Souls

1899
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:56,200
Before Dark Souls 3 comes out and you can do that now Dark Souls now on backwards compatibility

1900
02:25:56,200 --> 02:26:02,200
Yeah, that's good. Also released this past week Tekken tag tournament 2 was a part of the backwards compatibility update

1901
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:07,280
So I got I gotta say a Microsoft's been doing a great job kind of doing the slow trickle on

1902
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:14,640
It's almost like virtual console releases that I don't have to repay for I love it. Thank you Microsoft. Good guy Microsoft

1903
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:19,840
All right. Let's move on Dark Soccer. I think you have another story for us. I

1904
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Do indeed?

1905
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,560
So there is a study that went out from Ohio State University

1906
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,100
basically

1907
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:31,400
293 female gamers who play online games

1908
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:40,040
Were surveyed on this and they were asked if they received abuse in online games and what they and if they thought about it

1909
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:42,040
Or how much they thought about it offline?

1910
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:49,840
And how the companies that produce these games are dealing with the harassment and then their own coping mechanisms

1911
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:56,260
So as it turned out that basically they didn't like, you know, swearing and name-calling or skill based insults

1912
02:26:56,260 --> 02:27:00,600
But they they dealt with it. They put it aside. It wasn't a big deal

1913
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,600
Sexual harassment on the other hand

1914
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:07,180
Definitely sexist comments rape jokes rape threats

1915
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:10,640
did cause a lot of trauma and

1916
02:27:11,480 --> 02:27:16,480
Almost made sure that they didn't want to go back and play the game again. It ruined the experience

1917
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:24,000
You know and it was that they they get trash talking for what it is, but when you make it personal

1918
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:31,460
That it lingers it makes you really uncomfortable and then it becomes associated with the game

1919
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:33,620
Not with the people playing it. So

1920
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:38,200
Hopefully

1921
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:42,960
You know, it's something that the game companies will take into account or try to help with a filter

1922
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:48,340
But they also said that they didn't blame the they didn't hold the companies accountable for it

1923
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:52,760
But they did blame them for not doing more to curtail it. So

1924
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:54,760
yeah, and I

1925
02:27:54,760 --> 02:28:00,200
Imagine it's got to be tough to when you're the game developer and there's this open environment like Xbox Live and yeah

1926
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:05,240
I can totally see where if I'm playing a game online and the community is just really awful to me

1927
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:10,180
like I'm gonna blame the game and I'm not I'm probably not gonna go back because I don't want to see those people and

1928
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:15,040
It might kind of suck for the developer who quote-unquote may not have control over it

1929
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:19,280
Although granted you got a police your environment a little bit make sure it's not happening

1930
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:22,840
But I mean Xbox Live voice chat can be a very very difficult thing to

1931
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:29,320
Police, I think people just need to like fucking act mature a little bit mature on these games

1932
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:32,840
It's like Kai judo says in our chat room over at live.vog network.com

1933
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:36,800
Some guys go full-on dumbass when a girl gets on a game. It's so weird

1934
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:39,440
I was hanging out with a dude online for like two weeks

1935
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:43,560
The guy was cool. Then one day a girl beat him in Halo 2 and he went batshit. I was shocked

1936
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:47,740
It was the same guy like that's the problem dude needs to fucking

1937
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:55,020
Learn to be a human being well, I've had you know, things like that happen with me just a few times

1938
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:56,540
I've played online games

1939
02:28:56,540 --> 02:29:00,420
I got one guy to shut up by telling him at stick a centipede in his dick hole

1940
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:03,700
Wow

1941
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:08,100
Yum Brianna's applauding over here. I

1942
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:15,060
Mean, you know I can give back cuz I'm not really gonna do it and he's probably you know

1943
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:19,100
Wouldn't and the other one I was like, so this is your username

1944
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:21,440
I bet I can find you on the database and tell your mother

1945
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:28,060
Taking a hint from the girl who did do that when she was harassed online

1946
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:33,380
She found every single one of those guys copied and pasted the conversation with their parents

1947
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:34,940
It's awesome

1948
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:40,660
a lot of times these guys's emails will be like first initial dot last name at the place where they work and it's like I

1949
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:45,260
Can find you so easily and you're saying the most nasty shit on the internet

1950
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:50,860
Or or you know when I will remember when that happened even in a forum

1951
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:55,020
It was a certain somebody we used to play DDR with his friend

1952
02:29:55,540 --> 02:30:02,300
Mmm, and so I tracked down, you know, I basically looked up their IP found out where they lived and said so you live here. Oh

1953
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:05,020
I'm sorry. This will never happen again

1954
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:07,020
It's

1955
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:11,380
The internet we can find everything we need to yeah people just need to

1956
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:15,980
Just need to be a little a little bit mature is a little maturity too much to ask online

1957
02:30:16,460 --> 02:30:21,460
Apparently, well, this is why I rarely play with strangers if I play with strangers. I don't have voice chat on here

1958
02:30:21,460 --> 02:30:25,820
Yeah, I hardly do it anymore either. I think I'm trying to remember what game it was

1959
02:30:25,820 --> 02:30:29,780
I think the centipede when I remember what that was that was fantasy star online

1960
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:37,100
That explains

1961
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:42,140
It was just random group. I was running through rooms with mm-hmm

1962
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:47,980
And I don't even remember the situation, but he said just the most vile thing

1963
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:53,580
So and that was the first vile comeback I could come up with it's pretty good. Well, thank you. I'm pleased with that one

1964
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:56,940
I've been keeping it in my arsenal in case I ever needed the Rolodex of hate

1965
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:04,120
No, no, no, no, I can't I can't steal that from the fabulous Bianca del Rio, however

1966
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:08,920
I would probably have like the speed dial of pissiness

1967
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:11,340
about that

1968
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:13,180
All right

1969
02:31:13,180 --> 02:31:17,220
Let's move on. We got some more news. We want to cover before we open up the skype line. So Allen

1970
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:20,820
Footage of

1971
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:23,560
Pokemon go the smartphone game was

1972
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:27,180
Leaked from South by Southwest that just happened. It's

1973
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:34,500
Niantic, which is an offshoot of Google which is made of the game ingress, which I know if Matt was here Loki Robin

1974
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:40,380
Him would go on and Jamie we play to um, don't act innocent. Yeah, I know we just had to do a lot

1975
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:45,380
Ton of farm level 10. Why are we going? Why are we going to Tucson? Can we not? Okay, that was that

1976
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:47,380
Has that been revealed? Oh

1977
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:55,340
There may or may not be a very big ingress event happening in Tucson that I may also

1978
02:31:55,740 --> 02:32:02,500
We're only real reason to go to Arizona for anything and hold up hold up hold up and some really good

1979
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:08,420
We are meetings of my internet friends that you've already met. Yeah, I met a play ingress. No, they don't play

1980
02:32:08,420 --> 02:32:11,980
Okay, so we had to get them hooked on ingress. Well if they're willing

1981
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:17,700
But so like Friday is friend day Saturday is nerd day. So, you know what?

1982
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:19,380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right

1983
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:25,620
Anyway, so the Pokemon go the way it's gonna work is if you have the notifications turned on your phone will buzz or beep when?

1984
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:29,900
There's a Pokemon near you you load up the game if you have any pokeballs and you decide you want this

1985
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:33,740
Pokemon you could tap the screen and throw the ball at it. Yeah, you have another Pokemon

1986
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:38,420
You get your gear. I believe this is with the in-game currency

1987
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:41,320
It says that the stores are gonna be at museums

1988
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:48,660
Monuments so in order to buy stuff in game you can't it's not just like you go to an NPC

1989
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:52,980
From the comfort of your living room. It sounds like you have to actually go out to get your Pokemon gear

1990
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:58,700
Also types of Pokemon will be specific to the environment that you go to

1991
02:32:58,700 --> 02:33:00,700
So if you want a water or ocean

1992
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:06,820
Pokemon if there's a park that you go to that has a lake go there if you live on if you're lucky enough to live

1993
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:08,820
Coastside go to the beach. I

1994
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:11,380
imagined for landlocked areas a

1995
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:17,740
Public pool anything of like a fountain at a bank, you know, if you want to squirtle that's where he'd be. So

1996
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:20,540
Really excited for this

1997
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:24,420
There's a video of it

1998
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:30,060
You can actually I think you go on Engadget and see their embed of the footage that was leaked from South by Southwest

1999
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:33,980
But yeah, if you want to stock up on stuff you need to go

2000
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:39,800
To a place of significance and also just go out and if you want a certain type of Pokemon

2001
02:33:39,800 --> 02:33:41,800
It's it's all based on your geography

2002
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:47,880
I'm still curious and a lot of people on the the various forums that are out there are like so what about the battles?

2003
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:52,580
What about the battle because they haven't really said a lot about that yet. Yeah the PvP, but I'm I'm curious enough

2004
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:54,420
I mean, I'm definitely gonna check out Pokemon go

2005
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:57,180
I don't know if it's gonna be make be enough to make me quit ingress

2006
02:33:57,180 --> 02:34:03,860
But I mean if they are have a decent battle system in it, I I may not be playing ingress as much

2007
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:04,060
Yeah

2008
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:09,820
I just want to know like the people over there what their timeline is for the monetization because they haven't really revealed

2009
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:14,420
Mm-hmm what the cash shop is gonna feature. I mean, there's that little wrist

2010
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:17,140
doodad thing that you get

2011
02:34:17,420 --> 02:34:19,140
That I imagine you buy separately

2012
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:23,260
But that's I really want to see because ingress their cash shop

2013
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:27,300
Which I think the game was out for nearly three years before they even put a monetization

2014
02:34:27,420 --> 02:34:32,580
Well, they were a part of Google in the beginning. So Google was just you know, it was an experiment

2015
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:38,660
Yeah, but then after the separation when Google split into alphabet that Niantic is no longer a Google company

2016
02:34:38,660 --> 02:34:41,060
They are now financed by Nintendo

2017
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:44,580
I think Google is also still a financier but Niantic had to come up with new ways to make money

2018
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:46,660
So gotcha enter cash shop

2019
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:53,020
Which has done very well and hell we paid what 45 bucks for super VIP tickets to this thing

2020
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:58,260
We're going to and in Tucson, but worth every penny. I don't want to hear it. Well, it comes with souvenirs and eat stuff

2021
02:34:58,260 --> 02:35:01,380
That's right. You all spend money on dumb shit, too. So, you know what? I don't want to hear it

2022
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:05,220
Right, that's all. All right, awesome

2023
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:14,120
Okay, less awesome though is the news that a studio is closing and Sony did confirm this week that evolution studios

2024
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:18,460
was shut down and evolution studios latest game was drive club which

2025
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:22,660
You know not gonna lie drive club kind of had a rough, you know

2026
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:29,820
It was big expectations for it and then it came out late and then the online was kind of a fucking mess

2027
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:31,820
Like there's no nice way to say it

2028
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:35,860
So unfortunately, I think because the game ended up being a comedy of errors

2029
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:41,320
Unfortunately, people are now out of a job because of it. I see you sighing over there Gabe

2030
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:44,180
Yeah

2031
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:46,540
Yeah

2032
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:51,580
Yeah, I felt this same way about drive club although graphically speaking

2033
02:35:51,580 --> 02:35:55,060
I thought I thought it was a beautiful game, but there was

2034
02:35:55,740 --> 02:36:01,720
I fell in love, you know racing games are racing driving games are like my favorite of all time

2035
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:07,960
Like outrun on the Sega arcade was the game that wanted that got me to want to make games in the first place

2036
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:10,700
yeah, and

2037
02:36:10,740 --> 02:36:13,660
But you know fell in love a Gran Turismo need for speed games

2038
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:19,900
but then I played Forza and then force a horizon and I never looked back and I when I play drive colors say it is

2039
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:25,620
trying too hard and that's not good because they have a so much potential but

2040
02:36:25,860 --> 02:36:28,860
It's in four. It's really really unfortunate. So yeah, that's why I kind of

2041
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:32,780
Well some other stuff that

2042
02:36:33,220 --> 02:36:38,420
Evolution had done they were also responsible for World Rally Championship on the PlayStation 2 is them

2043
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:42,020
But I think the game that you know, a lot of people were like, oh, yeah

2044
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:46,180
This was a great game was Motorstorm on PlayStation 3. That was that was a release

2045
02:36:46,180 --> 02:36:49,940
That was a release team. I think with with the system system release. Yeah

2046
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:54,520
Yeah, it's a bummer. But unfortunately some of those things where you go

2047
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:57,340
Well, you know and it's it's so shocking like one

2048
02:36:58,100 --> 02:36:59,260
I mean and again

2049
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:04,940
this doesn't happen in the movie industry one dud doesn't kill a studio in the movie industry or we would have never had Batman as

2050
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:06,940
Superman in the first place even though it's making buku bucks

2051
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:09,820
Yeah, but then though I hear it's a festering pilot crowd

2052
02:37:09,820 --> 02:37:14,660
But that studio did also what the Jupiter ascending which didn't make any money back

2053
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:18,680
I wanted to see there was something else that they had done to that

2054
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:21,120
so

2055
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:24,740
Everyone I know on Facebook that has seen Batman vs. Superman has said

2056
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:30,900
It's not great but it was entertaining

2057
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:34,180
Like it was fine

2058
02:37:34,420 --> 02:37:37,460
Honestly, I want to see it well, I love Batman so I'll see anything about it

2059
02:37:37,460 --> 02:37:41,540
I want to see it just for Wonder Woman to be honest. I want to see everyone

2060
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:47,380
Yeah, the critics are like it's the worst thing. It's like showgirls but superhero movies and most people are like no, it's

2061
02:37:49,380 --> 02:37:53,660
Is going through a case of oh us to us to we'll have gritty characters everyone likes Batman

2062
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:55,660
We'll make all of our characters Batman

2063
02:37:56,140 --> 02:38:01,860
Including like normal, you know, oh, I'm a hero and classic hero. No, I'm gonna be Batman. Mm-hmm

2064
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:06,420
Let's get to the mailbag

2065
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:12,700
What no, but every week you guys email us at participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read your emails

2066
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:20,340
You're live on air or we don't if you actually send any when you don't send an email. I'm giving you one last refresh

2067
02:38:20,340 --> 02:38:25,740
It's because they're all busy at church or something. I am I see how it is. Y'all are just too busy gaming to send us an email

2068
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:31,580
It's fine last week. I said, oh, there's seven emails. There's too many to read and then over then

2069
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:37,300
It's $30 of marshmallow peeps and those Reese's peanut butter eggs insulin shock, they're all just

2070
02:38:38,700 --> 02:38:40,700
Like they can't send emails

2071
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:47,860
You know what, you know, you know what where's my red velvet peeps, where are they I haven't I have yet to you know

2072
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:49,860
if a red velvet peep

2073
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:53,740
Had shown up in a store. I would've been like, yes, they have all the crazy flavors now like Oreos

2074
02:38:53,900 --> 02:38:56,260
Yeah, you know what? I still want to find you a peep plushie

2075
02:38:57,260 --> 02:39:00,900
I've seen them. I mean there were two of them at Hannah's house today

2076
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:05,580
There was an official peep store like two blocks from magfest. You better believe I went there

2077
02:39:06,060 --> 02:39:10,140
Hi, there's a picture of me somewhere in front of the peeps car. So anyway

2078
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:11,380
All right

2079
02:39:11,380 --> 02:39:16,980
Well, no emails but maybe next time participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to participate with our show

2080
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:20,380
Well now we definitely have a reason to get angsty here on orange lounge radio. So

2081
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:24,120
Hold my earrings. Here comes the F use of the week

2082
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:29,260
I

2083
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:46,620
Really don't I guess I really don't have a major as you other than

2084
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:50,380
Holiday related for medical

2085
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:52,940
issues as

2086
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:59,260
People on my facebook have probably read by now, which I don't mean it to have a problem with people's religious preference

2087
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:01,260
I just don't get the grammar

2088
02:40:01,780 --> 02:40:05,100
Don't get it. I hate misuse of any word and

2089
02:40:05,740 --> 02:40:12,420
This use of tense and it's really getting on my nerves because I've started writing again you believe in the one true grammar God. I

2090
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:17,580
Believe I am a follower of sir Oxford of comma

2091
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:19,580
Because

2092
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:22,260
It's the difference between

2093
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:28,340
The hookers JFK and Stalin and the hookers comma JFK comma and Stalin

2094
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:33,160
Instead of JFK and Stalin wearing pasties of my favorite is actually

2095
02:40:34,060 --> 02:40:36,860
Let's eat grandma and let's see grandma

2096
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:40,900
And when you're talking about

2097
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:42,580
Your

2098
02:40:42,580 --> 02:40:47,660
Pet you don't say you are pet you say your pet

2099
02:40:48,820 --> 02:40:50,820
when you're saying and

2100
02:40:51,620 --> 02:40:56,100
Rob I love you to death, but you do this and it gets on my nerves a lot

2101
02:40:57,640 --> 02:40:59,380
When you use

2102
02:40:59,380 --> 02:41:01,380
so and such and eyes

2103
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:05,540
That's grammatically incorrect. The tea is hot. The tea is scalding

2104
02:41:05,540 --> 02:41:09,380
I think he means like eyeballs it should be so and so and mine

2105
02:41:10,060 --> 02:41:12,060
well

2106
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:17,260
You're not the only person I know that doesn't all those mistaken people and I don't give a fuck

2107
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:21,800
That was grammatically correct

2108
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:26,500
The most grammatically correct insult to the most smartest

2109
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:30,020
Smart asses

2110
02:41:30,260 --> 02:41:35,680
Alan do you have better to be a smartest than a dumbass Alan you have any of use of the week that do not pick on me

2111
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:37,120
I

2112
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:40,160
Not not anymore because of that last caveat. No

2113
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:44,640
I guess it's a little gross, but I'm getting like a blister on my foot

2114
02:41:45,160 --> 02:41:48,480
And I'm like, why am I even getting this blister?

2115
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:52,200
And I just need to figure out what I need to do about it before it gets gross

2116
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:55,320
Self-diagnosed on WebMD. That's everybody else does

2117
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:58,080
It's cancer. No

2118
02:41:58,080 --> 02:42:01,080
Yeah foot foot blisters gross you why?

2119
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:03,080
Is it your shoes may be lying out?

2120
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:07,280
That's the thing. My shoes are fine. And it's in a weird really weird spot

2121
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:12,880
That's what I'm thinking

2122
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:19,840
All right, I broke his toe by the way speaking of medical conditions

2123
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:26,340
Sorry to hear that see you medical conditions a few of the week goes to my sunburn. I got a sunburn yesterday

2124
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:28,860
You're a real ed actual redneck. Yes

2125
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:31,140
Okay

2126
02:42:31,140 --> 02:42:33,140
fuck that but

2127
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:39,540
Just also the fact that you know, I am usually like, you know, if it's if it's like, you know the summertime

2128
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:44,300
I think oh, I gotta put some walk off work outside today. It's fucking March. It is fucking March

2129
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:50,460
This is like the time. I got sunburned in Canada. It's fucking March and it's 80 degrees during the day

2130
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:55,620
Only in Northern California when it'll it'll hit like 99 or 100 degrees in April

2131
02:42:55,660 --> 02:43:02,700
Like oh the summer's here early and I'm like, I'm scared because I'm thinking about July and August if it's 99 degrees in April

2132
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:04,860
I'm not about that 108 degree life

2133
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:10,380
No, but just at some point there's gonna be a wave and then everyone's gonna joke about it

2134
02:43:10,380 --> 02:43:12,260
And I'm like and then like I don't want to die

2135
02:43:12,260 --> 02:43:18,100
The air conditioner wasn't like working in my car yesterday and I was like son of a motherfucker. It was fine

2136
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:23,220
But I wanted to take everybody who was complaining about the rain and kick them in the nose

2137
02:43:24,060 --> 02:43:27,220
Because it's not hard enough to maim them and you can fix a broken nose

2138
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:33,260
And tell them we have a drought and on top of that

2139
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,900
Important I

2140
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:43,820
Want to tell whoever created that law that says that when Folsom Dam it reaches higher than earth when Folsom Lake

2141
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:49,740
We just higher than 60% that they have to drain it. We're in a fucking drought. We need it. Okay

2142
02:43:50,060 --> 02:43:53,140
No, obviously now I interrupted you I was gonna say we were just it

2143
02:43:53,180 --> 02:44:00,280
Mathur Lake Park Rob and I earlier for angry stuff Lake was full beautiful green everywhere grass is growing. All the rain is great

2144
02:44:00,820 --> 02:44:02,820
It's very pretty right now in California

2145
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:08,220
Do our guests have any F use they'd like to get out of their system game. What are the rules with the F use?

2146
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:10,220
Is it just anything at all?

2147
02:44:11,820 --> 02:44:16,760
Okay, well keep it like nothing that you want we're already go back to your co-workers

2148
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:22,540
Oh, yeah, we're already five minutes into this segment. So, you know, I'll be Jonas

2149
02:44:22,580 --> 02:44:24,660
I know you don't understand what that rule means, but don't be Jonas

2150
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:29,060
I'll have I'll just say one wouldn't one quick thing then

2151
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:37,460
Drivers in the left lane going 55 miles an hour get out of there get the hell out of there. That's enough

2152
02:44:37,580 --> 02:44:42,060
That is enough. And I said the price I joke with Brianna one day I said I said recently

2153
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:45,920
Being from New Jersey. I want to build a massive

2154
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:52,640
Racing rate racetrack and I want to place all the drivers all the bad drivers in Northern Southern, California

2155
02:44:53,400 --> 02:45:00,800
versus New York, New Jersey and Connecticut drivers and just go to war in this big thing in the middle of Kansas and in the

2156
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:02,080
middle of nowhere and

2157
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:07,120
Yeah, because God helped me. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They don't know what the hell they're doing

2158
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:13,240
Okay, it cracks me and even work even better when it they're normally going slow because they're using their phone

2159
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:16,360
So once they put their phone down because someone blared the horn in them

2160
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:21,480
They have the nerve to give the finger to that person to blue that who blared the horn and they haul ass doing 90

2161
02:45:21,960 --> 02:45:28,040
Crossing three lanes of traffic without signaling. So telling you I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do a twisted metal thing one day

2162
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:34,880
Bri any F use from you

2163
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:37,840
She's saying no you love everything

2164
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:40,720
No comment

2165
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:47,720
I'm learning to drive right now and I'm gonna get my license hopefully by the end of April and whenever I see someone do a

2166
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:51,520
Dickish thing like what you've described I'll turn to Robin be like I'm not getting my license now

2167
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:55,620
Because someone just cut across four lanes doing 90 without a blinker

2168
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:58,080
It's like you you deal with it

2169
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:58,880
I'm fine

2170
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:02,120
And I always have to tell Alan like do as I say not as I do

2171
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:07,960
When I'm teaching him how to drive like don't fucking do the things I do when driving because they're all illegal

2172
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:13,240
Alright, by the way, may I make an announcement now that we've gotten the frustrations out of the way? Absolutely not

2173
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:15,800
All right. Go ahead

2174
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:19,440
My

2175
02:46:19,440 --> 02:46:23,760
Middle I would say of the three of us who my mother birthed from her loins

2176
02:46:24,280 --> 02:46:29,760
My brother Philip the middle child has given finally taking me off the hook

2177
02:46:30,280 --> 02:46:38,440
By spawning a little version of him who looks like a very small potato person with a 55 year old man comb-over

2178
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:47,240
He looks like well Philip when Philip was a baby he also looked like a scrunchie potato with a bad comb-over

2179
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:52,520
Actually, he didn't have the bad comb-over. He had the the frizzy spike. Mm-hmm. So anyway, I

2180
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:59,200
I have a nephew now his name potato named potato slow Spuddy

2181
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:03,920
Actually, it's funny cuz I've been just trying to decide whether that's call him tater tot

2182
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:06,640
Because his last name is Tate

2183
02:47:07,480 --> 02:47:10,200
or if I'm gonna call him Minnie Phil

2184
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:19,780
Minnie Phil, so I would like to say congratulations to my my brother Philip and congrats and his fiancee Ashley

2185
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:27,420
For bringing Jackson into the world spell J ax so in it's a very millennial name up

2186
02:47:27,540 --> 02:47:32,460
What that's it's not a braid and jade and Kate and laden. So already they're

2187
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:41,220
Having names names after Mortal Kombat character. That's what I was thinking. He's gonna grow up get bionic arms and kick ass

2188
02:47:41,980 --> 02:47:48,620
One can only hope but still he's a very very pretty little bundle of joy. He's adorable

2189
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:53,940
Hey, I swear he looks just like my brother did as a baby. I was nine when my brother was born

2190
02:47:53,980 --> 02:47:59,740
No, I was a little younger than that. But anyway, and I remember him as a baby and this infant looks like my brother

2191
02:48:00,420 --> 02:48:07,100
And also several of my female friends who have had children say it's very unfair that she had such a smooth delivery

2192
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:09,140
so

2193
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:11,820
Much love. I'm so happy that I have a

2194
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:15,860
Nephew and I don't have to produce children for my mother

2195
02:48:15,860 --> 02:48:21,520
Well, congratulations to Jamie's relatives who I know don't listen to this show. This is why I'm saying it. All right

2196
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:24,940
Well, let's move on

2197
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:31,380
With just a couple more stories and then we're gonna open up the skype line. I want to borrow him gonna unleash the floodgates. I'm

2198
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:36,580
Borrow him and turn him into hash browns. No, I'm just gonna borrow him for a little bit go

2199
02:48:36,580 --> 02:48:38,580
Oh, he threw up here. You can have him back

2200
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:40,860
Alright

2201
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:43,200
Let's get to those stories Alan

2202
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:47,260
Jackbox games has announced they are making

2203
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:54,700
Jackbox party pack 3 just a surprise to no one because the first two are bugging incredible and they're tons of fun

2204
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:57,500
And you don't even have to be drunk, which I'm sure it helps

2205
02:48:57,780 --> 02:49:03,620
but they are amazing games and they've already said that a drawful 2 which I think was the sleeper hit or

2206
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:10,380
The most popular choice of the last party pack drawful 2 is coming out in spring of tooth of this year

2207
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:17,820
which would make me think it'd be out now or very very soon is not going to be a part of the party pack 3

2208
02:49:17,900 --> 02:49:22,420
Because obviously they don't want you to buy a game twice. They're not sleazy like that

2209
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:24,940
so look for

2210
02:49:26,500 --> 02:49:31,140
The jackbox party pack 3 as sometime during fall of this year

2211
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:38,380
Awesome tons of fun. Yay. I'm looking forward to it because you know Jackbox they make some good stuff

2212
02:49:38,380 --> 02:49:39,980
Of course

2213
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:46,860
They're such jokers those guys and here's what their press release says while we toyed with other names for this collection of party games

2214
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:55,140
Koala saga happy birthday mom and Tokyo blood to name a few we decided the jackbox party pack 3 works best

2215
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:58,540
All right, they're silly

2216
02:49:58,820 --> 02:50:03,780
Alright, well, let's do one more story here and it was funny because earlier in the show

2217
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:05,940
You guys were talking about the Capcom of the old days

2218
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:12,360
Well, isn't this interesting because Capcom is actually running a survey right now that asks. Would you like Megaman 11?

2219
02:50:13,700 --> 02:50:15,700
No shit. Yes, of course

2220
02:50:16,060 --> 02:50:17,460
but anyway

2221
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:21,260
This is after you know, the success of the Megaman legacy collection

2222
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:26,420
So Capcom is actually asking do you want to see a Megaman 11 the third set of questions asked?

2223
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:31,780
Would you like future collections of Megaman games and what games would you like to see such as the X series zero?

2224
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:38,100
Legends battle network ZX star for us. What do you want? By the way the surveys in Japanese? Sorry, you can't take it

2225
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:43,140
So they're gonna come I can take it for us. Yes. So Akuma you need to represent all of us. They're

2226
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:49,220
Making sure you take the survey. Enjoy. I would like to see Megaman 11. Why not?

2227
02:50:49,980 --> 02:50:52,260
Even for nothing else. I just want another soundtrack

2228
02:50:53,060 --> 02:50:55,740
Honestly, I could give or take the game. I just want another soundtrack

2229
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:59,460
I'm just getting tired of them asking do you you know do you know should we make a mega?

2230
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:04,060
Make the effing game. It's like Legends 3 you fucking fuck

2231
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:07,860
That too that too

2232
02:51:08,260 --> 02:51:12,180
Alright, hey skype lines open one eight seven seven game

2233
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:18,300
Oh LR or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word if you want to call in and talk to us or maybe have

2234
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:23,100
A question for our guests that we have here in studio tonight. You can give us a call and we will

2235
02:51:23,740 --> 02:51:28,220
Take them. So guess what the skype line already lighting up. So let's get to it

2236
02:51:29,180 --> 02:51:31,260
Hello you are on orange lounge radio, who's this

2237
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:35,140
Hey, buddy, how's it going Zaku? What's up?

2238
02:51:36,700 --> 02:51:43,300
Not much. I mean it's been a while like, you know, but well weeks months that last

2239
02:51:44,380 --> 02:51:47,900
Called in but everything's good. Everything's things solid

2240
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:52,180
just try, you know paxies is coming up and

2241
02:51:53,060 --> 02:52:00,020
You know, even though you know trying to find rooming was in a it wasn't turned out as I expected

2242
02:52:00,020 --> 02:52:02,020
I did plan for the worse

2243
02:52:02,140 --> 02:52:05,580
Although it's a costly and you know costly endeavor that I will have to take

2244
02:52:06,420 --> 02:52:08,420
Nevertheless, I'm not gonna miss the packs for

2245
02:52:08,940 --> 02:52:13,820
You know for the world. Well, that sounds like that may end up being my dragon con. I don't know yet

2246
02:52:13,820 --> 02:52:15,980
I have to chat with some people see what's gonna happen. But

2247
02:52:16,660 --> 02:52:20,380
Yeah, I I get it. So so paxies we looking forward to it paxies

2248
02:52:21,300 --> 02:52:24,760
Hopefully some you know a little bit more swag or you know

2249
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:31,860
Well from the show from the showroom the show floor, but aside from that, you know better at better like after parties

2250
02:52:32,700 --> 02:52:36,140
Although I probably missed the boat on like, you know, some of the you know

2251
02:52:36,140 --> 02:52:42,740
Some good ones that you know, probably are already sold out and or like booked up for free reg

2252
02:52:44,940 --> 02:52:48,180
Free shit is always a great perk to any convention. I'm sure

2253
02:52:48,180 --> 02:52:55,580
But I guess I guess more importantly like for some reason I've been on a buying spree for well

2254
02:52:55,580 --> 02:53:00,400
I guess in the past year for peripherals like obviously the headsets I got in a

2255
02:53:00,940 --> 02:53:06,560
taxi last year and then you know a couple of years back the joystick both the

2256
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:10,660
Solid stick that I have if you could yeah, you probably see it right now

2257
02:53:12,180 --> 02:53:17,940
So, yeah, whatever is there but yeah as you can see I'm still into flight simming but

2258
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:20,500
besides the point

2259
02:53:20,540 --> 02:53:22,540
Yeah, I

2260
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:26,340
Guess I'm looking forward to like, you know, what you know

2261
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:34,180
How this whole like VR thing's gonna play out because I do you do you think there's gonna be more VR to try like at

2262
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:37,100
This show on the show floor than we've probably ever seen before

2263
02:53:37,100 --> 02:53:41,460
I mean I seem to remember it packs that like oculus would usually have a booth of there to be something to experience

2264
02:53:41,540 --> 02:53:47,100
But now with like so many people getting into VR and does Sony do packs that are sometimes they do sometimes they don't are

2265
02:53:47,100 --> 02:53:50,940
They gonna be there. Yeah, I don't know but I mean it's a hit or miss

2266
02:53:50,940 --> 02:53:55,460
I know Microsoft's there with without a shadow of a doubt. Well, maybe they'll show HoloLens or something

2267
02:53:55,460 --> 02:54:01,380
It's you know, although I know HoloLens is probably still early on but it'd be interesting to see especially with the PlayStation VR

2268
02:54:01,380 --> 02:54:05,140
around the corner if PlayStation is gonna make a push with the

2269
02:54:06,060 --> 02:54:09,780
VR and Bobby Blackwell in our chat over at live dot vog network comm reminding us

2270
02:54:09,780 --> 02:54:12,320
Oh, yeah, Sony has done packs prime in the past. No

2271
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:14,980
Yeah, I know they but it's kind of hit and miss like they don't do it every year

2272
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:17,740
It's like it seems like if they have something to promote they do it

2273
02:54:17,740 --> 02:54:24,540
Oh like as of recent like these past few paxis, you know, a lot of the major players have you know, a lot of the major

2274
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:31,860
Developed, you know publishers have been pulling out, you know, obviously there's been in for me in the past where you know

2275
02:54:31,860 --> 02:54:35,380
the likes of like Ubisoft and or to well and

2276
02:54:36,060 --> 02:54:41,380
In the case of Sony. Yes, they pulled out and I believe Nintendo did it one year

2277
02:54:41,380 --> 02:54:45,740
I know I know squint, you know Square Enix is obviously a you know, it's a shoe in but

2278
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:52,140
It's been kind of varying like I remember five years ago when I first went. Yes. It was it was huge

2279
02:54:52,140 --> 02:54:59,040
Not well, it was it would be like what I would imagine e3 being but that's just my that's just my wishful thinking

2280
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:04,980
But now it's like geared towards like I don't know board, you know, like actual tabletop

2281
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:09,460
It's kind of like a you know, because of the atmosphere around there

2282
02:55:09,620 --> 02:55:14,300
You know half the shows like tabletop the other half is just obviously video gaming

2283
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:21,340
So it's it's having that, you know, it's trying to find that equilibrium that pleases every you know, every gamer

2284
02:55:21,740 --> 02:55:24,580
Yeah, and that's pretty much where it boils down to

2285
02:55:25,260 --> 02:55:30,220
Well, if nothing else Zaku, even if the convention hall doesn't end up having everything you're looking for

2286
02:55:30,220 --> 02:55:33,460
You can always sit in the hall with your 3ds and endlessly street

2287
02:55:33,460 --> 02:55:36,240
I don't have a 3ds. I have a tablet the 3ds

2288
02:55:36,240 --> 02:55:40,360
Do you know by the way tangent time the 3ds turned five years old today?

2289
02:55:40,480 --> 02:55:45,920
Can you believe that like what we were just talking about earlier in the show the Spice Girls are 20 BAM

2290
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:52,040
You're old. The 3ds is now five years old BAM. You're still old. Yeah. Oh my god, but you know

2291
02:55:52,040 --> 02:55:54,040
I didn't catch on to the whole

2292
02:55:54,240 --> 02:56:00,900
DS 3ds thing and I guess that's probably because I was always a PSP guy even though mine is still collecting dust up there in

2293
02:56:00,900 --> 02:56:04,200
The bin well, yes, and they actually released a new system called the Vita

2294
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:06,380
I don't know if you've heard of it it kind of good. Yes

2295
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:16,920
Well, yeah, I get your point, all right, but yeah, but being even then the beat is just like

2296
02:56:17,980 --> 02:56:21,080
People have forgotten about it. Well Zaku Zaku

2297
02:56:21,080 --> 02:56:23,180
I expect a full wrap-up when you get back from

2298
02:56:23,400 --> 02:56:26,540
Paxis because I want to hear about the show since I'm not really gonna be able to go this year

2299
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:28,540
So I want to hear about it when you get back

2300
02:56:28,700 --> 02:56:32,360
Also, I went to round one in Chicago earlier this month

2301
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:38,840
This is the arcade that has a bunch of like Japanese import games and stuff they have one in San Jose

2302
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:40,840
I have yet to go because

2303
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:47,280
I'm lazy. I don't know actually though with Dark Sakura's birthday soiree in the Bay Area coming up

2304
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:52,980
Mm-hmm. I may have to start going around one in San Jose. Oh, yeah, I just move the party there. I

2305
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:56,080
Mean, I look into it like it's not

2306
02:56:56,660 --> 02:57:00,640
There will be a small person there. Yeah, and we need alcohol to be present

2307
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:06,600
You know look into that anyway, sorry Zaku go ahead. Yeah, I mean it's not in Chicago proper per se

2308
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:13,000
It's like 45 minutes out of like the inner loop, which is the big, you know, the Manhattan over there and you know

2309
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:17,940
Thank God for lyft and the ability to expense these things in my expense report

2310
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:25,460
Which you know, obviously I was able to expense, you know, the you know, the actual game card and every must be nice

2311
02:57:26,300 --> 02:57:31,180
Yeah, I mean when you work for a company that has a Chicago office and most of the Android developers

2312
02:57:31,180 --> 02:57:36,180
I work with are all out there. So I get to expense this fucking show. How do I how do I get new microphones?

2313
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:42,100
Can I can I bill it to sack IGDA is there a budget over? No, no breeze give he's giving me the frown

2314
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:42,860
All right

2315
02:57:42,860 --> 02:57:46,500
It's kind of like the I mean, it's kind of like the the Japanese one

2316
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:48,860
Like I remember when I went to Japan almost two years ago

2317
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:54,220
I remember round ones just being like huge in terms of like the other arcades

2318
02:57:54,260 --> 02:58:00,860
I went around, you know went to in Tokyo and this one was kind of like that, but it also had a mix of the American

2319
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:06,980
Redemption games and whatnot. So you still have to have the gambling for children or it's just not an arcade

2320
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:11,340
Yeah, plus the pool, you know, plus the pool tables pink ponte. Do they have to go?

2321
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:13,860
Do they have a Chinko?

2322
02:58:14,140 --> 02:58:18,700
No, they do not that's separate. That's usually a dedicated

2323
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:21,420
Chinko is kind of like a dedicated thing

2324
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:27,660
You have to go to a dedicated place in in Japan or unless it's like in a certain floor of a Japanese

2325
02:58:27,860 --> 02:58:32,540
Arcade which is an average of like a few stories, but long story short. Yes

2326
02:58:32,540 --> 02:58:36,860
It's they had a lot of the bimani games that you know, I've been craving for a while

2327
02:58:36,860 --> 02:58:42,540
But you know, it's kind of like a marriage like there the American round ones are almost like a marriage between

2328
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:49,380
The Japanese one and a Dave and Buster's with a little bit less of Dave and Buster's a little bit more of the round one

2329
02:58:49,900 --> 02:58:54,660
All right. Well Zaku, I gotta let you go so we get some more calls, but thank you for the phone call

2330
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:58,340
I appreciate it and have a good night. Yep. Have a good night. I will talk to you soon. Bye

2331
02:58:58,860 --> 02:59:04,060
Alright one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call

2332
02:59:04,180 --> 02:59:09,760
I did want to point out because I've been informed that some of my pals that I play ingress with are actually listening right now

2333
02:59:10,360 --> 02:59:14,080
So I figured they could actually appreciate this joke that I'm about to say

2334
02:59:14,120 --> 02:59:20,080
which is that the reason why I would be in favor of you moving your birthday party is because I've already capped the portals at

2335
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:22,060
The mall where your birthday party is originally scheduled

2336
02:59:22,060 --> 02:59:27,160
I have not kept the portals at round one and I fucking you need uniques then let's do this

2337
02:59:28,160 --> 02:59:31,560
I'm done. Don't move your birthday party because of my stupid ass

2338
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:37,960
Don't get around one, but I told Becky that it would be okay for Julian there before they start kicking kids out. Mm-hmm

2339
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:41,240
And Becky is my bestie. That's very sir

2340
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:44,640
Really quickly since along those same lines. I'm Alan

2341
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:48,120
Did you want to describe for our listeners without giving any of the James Bond secrets away?

2342
02:59:48,120 --> 02:59:54,440
I actually took you out on a late-night adventure last night our first big like ingress like op we did together

2343
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:59,160
Did you did you want to share with the listeners what that was like like what what we did on Friday night?

2344
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:03,640
What's all involved in it? Yes without giving any of the secrets away if you know what I mean, okay

2345
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:07,120
Well

2346
03:00:07,120 --> 03:00:11,560
The the to get your team points and ingress you have to cover

2347
03:00:12,600 --> 03:00:15,680
Geography like you take three points and you make a triangle

2348
03:00:17,360 --> 03:00:22,160
Which you think all right you walk down to the supermarket the bank or wherever and you make a triangle there

2349
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:24,960
But people will do a big-ass field that will cover

2350
03:00:25,640 --> 03:00:27,400
several states

2351
03:00:27,400 --> 03:00:29,880
like huge undertakings and

2352
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:37,040
You when you link when you make the triangle you can't cross the lines with anything existing

2353
03:00:37,240 --> 03:00:40,600
So what we did for a field like that

2354
03:00:41,360 --> 03:00:43,360
It's my mic on. Yeah

2355
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:45,560
for basically we were

2356
03:00:45,840 --> 03:00:47,040
I

2357
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:49,560
Trying to decide what is too much or too little to say

2358
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:56,200
we weren't throwing the field, but we were responsible for making sure the lane was cleared so that the

2359
03:00:57,360 --> 03:01:00,120
The connect the dots that they were trying to do wasn't blocked

2360
03:01:00,400 --> 03:01:05,600
Because even if it's a line from your team from your faction, you can't intersect a line, right?

2361
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:09,760
So yeah, we went out drove out to the middle of nowhere and I'm on t-mobile

2362
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:16,560
So I'm like we're gonna go out to the boonies to take down this, you know innocent link that you know

2363
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:19,560
It's just in the way. It's just inconvenient. I may have no data

2364
03:01:19,960 --> 03:01:24,960
So luckily when we got there you you had data on your t-mobile connection and mine was the one that was yeah

2365
03:01:24,960 --> 03:01:28,840
You were on like one or two. We were like on one or two bars and I had five bars. It's really awful

2366
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:32,040
I was just expecting does that you actually went way more into I was just expecting you to say yeah

2367
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:34,680
It was really fun to sit in the dark for 45 minutes Rob. That was a lot of fun

2368
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:35,240
Yeah, no

2369
03:01:35,240 --> 03:01:41,520
So you don't want the other team to know that something really major like that is going on because they'll throw links and block the

2370
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:46,280
Path so yeah, we had to sit in a car in the dark, which is not creepy at all for like

2371
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:51,140
45 minutes until the person that was running the operation

2372
03:01:51,140 --> 03:01:57,280
They're like there's like 15 to 20 people involved out there on their cell phones in their cars involved in operations like this

2373
03:01:57,280 --> 03:01:59,280
So yeah, we had to weigh. Okay

2374
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:04,360
1040 it's gonna go up at 11 do it now like and we had to okay destroy it destroy it clear

2375
03:02:04,360 --> 03:02:07,520
Yay, and then have to see if they wanted you to drive anywhere else

2376
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:10,280
Yeah

2377
03:02:11,720 --> 03:02:13,720
All right, but you had fun right? Yeah

2378
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:22,440
All right, we're gonna take more calls one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word

2379
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:28,280
I think we've got another call coming in. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi. This is raging leader

2380
03:02:28,280 --> 03:02:33,560
Hi rage nader who apparently is using that avatar software to actually call in as a cat tonight

2381
03:02:33,560 --> 03:02:41,160
I've seen Tiger Claw use this before but I guess rage nader now expressing your a kitty cat side here on the video stream that

2382
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:44,000
Our radio listeners can't see but that's okay. What's on your mind, buddy?

2383
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,120
not whole

2384
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:52,560
Well, you know if I remember right you kind of sort of touched on something early in the show

2385
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:57,760
Yeah, recently I bought a carry vault no real steam

2386
03:02:58,280 --> 03:03:00,280
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I

2387
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:07,720
Know the one thing I don't remember you mentioning is what your thoughts are on that bundle

2388
03:03:09,360 --> 03:03:11,360
On which bundle I'm sorry

2389
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:14,360
Vault

2390
03:03:14,360 --> 03:03:16,360
bundle Oh Atari vault, um

2391
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:20,020
If you like classic games enough then yeah

2392
03:03:20,020 --> 03:03:25,400
I think it's worth the money especially because they put in the multiplayer where you can you know chat over the or I'm sorry

2393
03:03:25,560 --> 03:03:27,920
Actually play the games over the internet and all that stuff

2394
03:03:28,520 --> 03:03:33,040
But I they release something very similar to it already on iPad and iPhone

2395
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:36,200
So I think if you already own that it may not be worth the money

2396
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:39,680
But if you have an appreciation for old games, I think it is worth the money

2397
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:46,800
Just remember a lot of the old games were kind of one-trick ponies, you know, but that's also what made them great

2398
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:51,120
I think a game like kaboom is to which I don't think is in the pack because that was Activision

2399
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:55,480
But a game like kaboom is kaboom is still fun to play today in my opinion

2400
03:03:56,040 --> 03:04:01,080
That's you know, and it's it's disgustingly simple. It's just collect the ball at the bombs and the little little pots of water

2401
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:04,660
There's not a lot else to it. So, you know, it depends on

2402
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:10,640
How much you can appreciate those old games, but if you're the type that only spends five seconds

2403
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:14,240
On an old game, they're like, yeah, whatever done over it

2404
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:18,320
Then I don't think there's gonna be enough value here for you or if you already have these Atari games some other way

2405
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:20,800
Yeah, oh I kind of

2406
03:04:21,760 --> 03:04:29,100
Well, I just got the entire develop dollar day myself. Thanks to fifth ring. But uh, yeah

2407
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:34,180
You know, it is a nice package, you know, they're falling because no

2408
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:41,900
No, well two things. No, the target 2600 was my first system way back in day B

2409
03:04:42,420 --> 03:04:45,820
Now great. I did have some of these games via

2410
03:04:46,740 --> 03:04:51,480
Game room, but unfortunately, I can't read down the game room

2411
03:04:53,660 --> 03:05:00,220
Yeah, that's that I know I had a good guy Microsoft moment earlier, but that's a bad guy Microsoft moment to be honest

2412
03:05:00,220 --> 03:05:04,060
Yeah, but uh, no, it's a follow-up question

2413
03:05:04,060 --> 03:05:09,460
You know now that Atari well is out on Steam, you know, well, I were

2414
03:05:09,980 --> 03:05:12,820
Presumed is probably out for consoles as well. But

2415
03:05:13,380 --> 03:05:15,380
No

2416
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:19,540
Is there any other anthologies that you would like to

2417
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:23,180
See come out. No, like maybe a

2418
03:05:24,060 --> 03:05:26,560
version of the Capcom classics collections

2419
03:05:27,180 --> 03:05:33,660
Or something like that. I'm such a retro whore. I I'm I'll be happy. I'll be thrilled if they put anything out

2420
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:39,340
I'm always adamant for my guardian legend release on PC, but you know

2421
03:05:40,340 --> 03:05:42,340
Someone never fucking get it

2422
03:05:42,780 --> 03:05:44,500
Do an update?

2423
03:05:44,500 --> 03:05:46,900
Like a really good one that won't get shut down

2424
03:05:46,900 --> 03:05:52,580
I would appreciate a like Commodore collection of like old Commodore 64 classics

2425
03:05:52,580 --> 03:05:54,760
I would like to see that on Steam some games like, you know

2426
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:57,100
Good old jump man and jump man jr

2427
03:05:57,100 --> 03:06:02,380
And just this shit that we the temple as phi and and all these things that we used to play on

2428
03:06:03,020 --> 03:06:05,340
On the Commodore 64 would I would love that?

2429
03:06:06,100 --> 03:06:06,940
Ah

2430
03:06:06,940 --> 03:06:08,780
Cool. All right. Yeah

2431
03:06:08,780 --> 03:06:14,560
Yeah, I probably go with the konami collection now that they're ever actually do it

2432
03:06:15,300 --> 03:06:17,300
Cuz they're all there

2433
03:06:17,540 --> 03:06:24,220
Okay, they used to have a game tap one that was Contra and I want to say Castlevania was in it

2434
03:06:24,220 --> 03:06:28,420
So they did do so. No, what's the theme night? It was at the old 8-bit Castlevania's

2435
03:06:28,420 --> 03:06:31,340
I think we're on PC because you used to be able to play him through game tap

2436
03:06:32,340 --> 03:06:35,300
So it was sort of out there it was sort of out there

2437
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:41,220
But yeah, I don't know you could do the whole thing where if you have an Xbox one you can play the game

2438
03:06:41,220 --> 03:06:45,500
But that's kind of cheating. That's not really playing the games on your PC. But anyway, all right. We're aging

2439
03:06:45,500 --> 03:06:48,620
I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call. I appreciate it. Sure

2440
03:06:49,540 --> 03:06:55,340
You two pets for the kitty. All right, I guess that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight

2441
03:06:55,580 --> 03:06:58,660
If you didn't get through but you yeah, I still have something to say

2442
03:06:59,340 --> 03:07:04,460
Participate at orange launch radio.com is a great place to do it. I know we're running a little long tonight

2443
03:07:04,460 --> 03:07:08,460
It's about time to wrap things up and thank you for putting up with the audio things this week

2444
03:07:08,460 --> 03:07:11,460
I will look into that over the next week and try to figure that out

2445
03:07:11,580 --> 03:07:16,180
Looks like I'm going on a shopping spree fix that. I want to get that fixed before the

2446
03:07:17,540 --> 03:07:20,620
Indie arcade event that's for sure. I don't want that on the stream

2447
03:07:20,740 --> 03:07:25,860
But anyhow Alan say this podcast is single-handedly keeping the Guitar Center in

2448
03:07:26,540 --> 03:07:30,860
Sacramento probably business because whenever you need studio mics

2449
03:07:31,980 --> 03:07:34,560
Now now that Radio Shack is gone

2450
03:07:35,300 --> 03:07:40,680
That's really the only reason to go to Guitar Center true. Well, I Gabe Brianna

2451
03:07:40,680 --> 03:07:43,980
I really want to thank you guys for being here tonight taking the time out to be on our show

2452
03:07:44,220 --> 03:07:47,920
Best of luck with the rest of the planning for Sacramento indie arcade

2453
03:07:48,060 --> 03:07:53,140
I am very thrilled and excited to be a part of it with my co-hosts and yeah

03:08:09,940 --> 03:08:11,820

2461
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:22,320
We always at the end of the show like to go around and get everybody's final thought

2462
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:25,800
Do you guys have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight Gabe?

2463
03:08:25,800 --> 03:08:29,000
This is also a good chance to plug your personal Twitter's and stuff if you want

2464
03:08:30,400 --> 03:08:34,100
To keep up to date on what we're on what I've got going on with my team

Impeccable and and and so just so necessary for what we're trying to do

2470
03:08:55,440 --> 03:08:59,780
We need to know how we're doing. Otherwise, we think we're doing fine, and we know that's not the case

2471

And then hope to see you guys at our indie arcade in less than two weeks

2473
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:14,300
That's always that reality setting in that. Oh my gosh, it's here Rianna any final thoughts tonight

2474
03:09:14,300 --> 03:09:17,440
I know you have a lot of listeners that also play games, duh

2475
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:22,360
We do have an extra life team sack indie arcade

2476
03:09:23,440 --> 03:09:28,840
extra life is like the charity portion video game portion of the Children's Miracle Network and

2477
03:09:29,120 --> 03:09:33,960
The Sacramento indie arcade started a team to help benefit our local Children's Hospital here

2478
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:39,500
I love it the UC Davis Children's Hospital that serves 33 counties throughout Northern, California

2479
03:09:39,540 --> 03:09:43,560
So if you're already playing games and you want to accept donations

2480
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:49,880
Everything's done online you can play from anywhere in the world and you can just select the UC Davis Children's Hospital

2481
03:09:50,480 --> 03:09:52,480
We've partnered with them to show

2482
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:59,580
Others who aren't really big in the game scene that games are more than just Call of Duty and whatnot, you know, so

2483
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:03,760
Www.extra

2484
03:10:03,760 --> 03:10:09,320
Hyphen life org forward slash team forward slash sack indie arcade. That's awesome

2485
03:10:09,320 --> 03:10:13,320
And that should be something we should totally try to be a part of so we'll figure out how we can help with that

2486
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:18,740
We've always wanted to get into something like that. So it'd be great if you guys already have something established

2487
03:10:18,740 --> 03:10:21,840
Maybe we can piggyback on that. So awesome. Thank you so much

2488
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,800
Thank you guys both for being here

2489
03:10:23,800 --> 03:10:27,400
As I say at the end of every episode if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange launch radio

2490
03:10:27,400 --> 03:10:31,640
We are I'm an independent podcast. We don't have a multi-million dollar website or anything like that behind us

2491
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:33,420
So if you enjoyed what you heard here at the show

2492
03:10:33,420 --> 03:10:37,580
Please tell a friend or five or 20 about what you heard here at Orange Laundrio and spread the word

2493
03:10:38,300 --> 03:10:43,520

Alan thank you so much for filling in for Loki tonight

2496
03:10:51,840 --> 03:10:53,840
Alan do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

2497
03:10:54,320 --> 03:11:01,040
Trader Joe's plantain chips are disappointing and I'll be writing my congressman. All right, that's a very worthy cause I was very disappointed in them

2498
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:05,320
As well as expecting something sweet and I got something savory. It was it was a nasty trick very nasty trick

2499
03:11:05,980 --> 03:11:09,820
My final thought in addition to the always closing segment here

2500
03:11:09,820 --> 03:11:14,140
I'll plug my own Twitter because I forgot to at the beginning of the show. You can follow me on twitter at sky SK

2501
03:11:14,140 --> 03:11:19,020
ie and I am very much looking forward to our mini vacation next week and

2502
03:11:19,660 --> 03:11:25,060
Sorry, we won't be here on Sunday. But you know once in a while I earned a vacation so not sorry

2503
03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:30,000
Happy gaming though. Have a great week of gaming and all that

2504
03:11:30,580 --> 03:11:34,580
And lastly but not leastly never leastly dark soccer your final thought of the night

2505
03:11:35,500 --> 03:11:38,620
I don't think I want to go to the doctor tomorrow, so I might not

2506
03:11:40,820 --> 03:11:44,140
What and you're an adult so if you want to if you want to be like, you know

2507
03:11:44,140 --> 03:11:47,420
I don't want to do that. You don't have to if you're like instead of going to the doctor

2508
03:11:47,420 --> 03:11:54,100
I'm gonna go and eat ice cream. You can do that because you're a fucking grown-ass woman. I could sleep in and not go

2509
03:11:55,940 --> 03:11:58,700
I'm probably just gonna watch more of

2510
03:12:00,180 --> 03:12:02,180
Really Queen

2511
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:08,520
Because it's funny that sounds like a fabulous idea and finish up my bottle of provolone

2512
03:12:09,280 --> 03:12:14,160
To stay home and drink wine. You don't need to go to the doctor. You need to drink more wine and wine. All right

2513
03:12:16,560 --> 03:12:18,560
All right, but at the same time dark soccer

2514
03:12:19,700 --> 03:12:26,920
Get your checkups. Make sure you're healthy. If you have a symptom go see the doctor. Oh, it's the migraine thing but DFTBA

2515
03:12:29,360 --> 03:12:31,360
Don't get more sicker

2516
03:12:31,700 --> 03:12:33,700
Let's see if the grammar

2517
03:12:37,260 --> 03:12:39,260
What

2518
03:12:40,300 --> 03:12:45,820
And where's the button to her mic that shuts out, all right, that's gonna do it for another episode of orange laundry

2519
03:12:45,820 --> 03:12:49,560
Oh, we will see you again in two weeks because I'm going on vacation

2520
03:12:49,560 --> 03:12:53,300
So see you in two weeks with an all-new edition of orange laundry. Oh until then

2521
03:12:57,340 --> 03:13:00,900
Oops, let me try that again until then

2522
03:13:02,220 --> 03:13:04,420
Until then bye

2523
03:13:05,260 --> 03:13:08,140
