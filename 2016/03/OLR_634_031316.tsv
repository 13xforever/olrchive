0	17720	This week, some new adventure MMOs are unlikely to see the light of day, while one classic
17720	21600	adventure game gets a patch to update its compatibility despite having a popular sequel.
21600	24200	We're bringing you the details on these and the rest of the week's gaming news, and it
24200	31200	all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
31200	34800	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34800	36320	where every gamer has a voice.
36320	43960	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, March the 13th of 2016, episode number
43960	46360	634 of our show.
46360	49360	That's right, been running since 2002.
49360	54680	Myself here in studio, Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E,
54680	58600	and joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
58600	60440	Are you yourself the elf?
60440	62320	Uh, I think.
62320	63320	Is that a...
63320	64320	Did you ever hear of herself the elf?
64320	65320	Uh, is that a band?
65320	66320	The 80s.
66320	67320	Is that like a 90s band?
67320	68320	It was the 80s.
68320	69320	Is that a goth-y band?
69320	70320	No, it was a cartoon.
70320	71680	Did they open for Susie and the Banshees?
71680	73000	It was an 80s cartoon.
73000	74000	I see.
74000	75880	No, I guess I'm behind on my 80s cartoons.
75880	76880	I'm trying to think.
76920	80920	I mean, there was a lot of 80s cartoons I liked, but probably, I don't know, my favorite
80920	82840	by far, Muppet Babies.
82840	83840	That was my jam.
83840	84840	I watched that every day.
84840	89000	I was a big fan of David the Gnome.
89000	90680	I don't even know that one.
90680	91680	You don't know David the Gnome?
91680	92680	I don't think so.
92680	93680	I'm a visual person.
93680	94680	I bet if you showed it to me, it'd be like, oh yeah, it is.
94680	97080	They had Tom Bosley as David the Gnome.
97080	98840	Oh, maybe I did see that.
98840	102280	He had the big red hat, and they had the fox friend.
102280	105840	And then when they died, they turned into trees, and the fox cried.
105840	108480	Okay, I think I did see that.
108480	109480	Yes, I did.
109480	114600	But I was more raised on, I mean, I watched a lot of Nickelodeon.
114600	116800	You Can't Do That on Television was my jam.
116800	119520	Like that was required viewing.
119520	123160	The greatest thing Canada's ever given us besides Alanis Morissette.
123160	126400	However, Alanis Morissette, of course, was on You Can't Do That on Television.
126400	127400	For A season.
127400	128400	There you go.
128400	129480	For like two episodes, I think.
129480	134040	But anyway, then game shows was the big thing.
134040	137680	Like USA Network used to play game shows like nonstop all day.
137680	141800	The Scrabble game show and Supermarket Sweep, although I think that was a lifetime.
141800	148680	Rob decided he wanted to be what was his face from Press Your Luck to Markin.
148680	149680	Peter to Markin.
149680	150680	Yeah.
150680	151680	Right.
151680	152680	You decided you wanted to be him when you grew up.
152680	156480	Well, Bob Barker was always a personal inspiration of mine because the price is right.
156480	157480	He is very orange.
157480	158880	I saw the prices.
158880	161240	I think he's more orangy than Trump.
161240	162240	I'm sure.
162240	163240	I'm sure.
163440	168960	I'm sure at some point I've told this story on OLR, but I actually went to the prices
168960	172600	right in 2001 when you were blinded by the jacket.
172600	173600	Yes.
173600	176840	When Barker was still hosting it and Rod Roddy, rest in peace, was still alive.
176840	178600	And we went to two tapings.
178600	182240	And for the second taping, we were sitting right behind Rod Roddy and the jacket was
182240	183240	sparkling in my face.
183240	184240	Rest in peace.
184240	185240	He was a fantastic.
185240	187760	And Rob came back with a tan.
187760	193080	I'm just sad I didn't get called up on stage, but oh, my God, we had we had been at Coachella.
193920	194920	The day before.
194920	195920	So I was exhausted.
195920	199600	Speaking, ironically, Susie and the Banshees, we saw Coachella.
199600	205720	So go figure that it was it was Susie and the Banshees, the Chemical Brothers and Bjork.
205720	206720	Rob.
206720	207720	What?
207720	208720	Peekaboo.
208720	211040	That's pretty much what it sounded like.
211040	214320	That was pretty much if you could kind of combine Susie and the Banshees and Bjork
214320	217480	into one thing, it would be that anyway.
217480	218480	Not joining us tonight.
218480	223040	Sadly, tech master, Loki, one of Loki's kids is really sick and sitting on his chair.
224000	225000	Yeah.
225000	227720	So tech master Loki was afraid that he would bring the virus over here if he showed up.
227720	232960	So if you're out there, Loki listening, I hope you and the youngins feel better.
232960	235880	But filling in on a moment's notice tonight.
235880	236880	Very appreciative.
236880	238200	He could step in the studio tonight.
238200	240800	All it took was a little bit of wine to bribe him.
240800	241800	Say hello, everybody to Shane.
241800	242800	Hello.
242800	243800	How are you?
243800	246200	Isn't it pronounced, pronounced Coachella?
246200	247200	Not Coachella.
247200	248200	I don't know.
248200	251080	Like, it's not a co it's coach Ella.
251080	254640	Yeah, because you don't put a co it on.
254640	256000	By the way, I thought of you.
256000	257480	Or write a bow it.
257480	258480	Really good.
258480	262240	Did somebody mispronounce something horribly and kinda what I was watching?
262240	263240	I was playing.
263240	269100	No, I was actually finishing up the danganronpa anime before I finished the game.
269100	274280	And there's like they do one big point because Xanadu and they did a second when he goes
274280	275280	back Xanadu.
275280	277800	I was like, Oh, that's like Rob.
277800	279120	Shut up.
279120	280120	So what?
280160	281160	Anyway.
281160	283040	It made me think of you fondly, fondly.
283040	284040	Yeah.
284040	285040	Yeah.
285040	286040	Watching people get murdered.
286040	287040	It was great.
287040	291400	Shana Linco here in the house to fill in for or I'm just I don't know why you still use
291400	292400	a link.
292400	293620	Oh, I thought you use both.
293620	297480	That's just all my Twitter because I don't put my last name even though it's in there
297480	298480	anyway.
298480	300480	So I should just I'll change it right now.
300480	302480	Are you gonna change your Twitter handle?
302480	303480	Sure.
303480	304480	Why not?
304480	305480	All right.
305480	306480	Whatever.
306480	307480	Well, anyway, I don't know how I already gave up on this.
307480	312760	If you were going to follow Rob's theme, the OMG, you could be WTF.
312760	315760	No, I don't want to follow a Rob theme.
315760	316760	Okay.
316760	320280	Well, yeah, I know I use I use the name OMG, it's Rob and certain things.
320280	324160	And I kind of joke that if Shane wanted to follow my footsteps, his appropriate name
324160	327200	would be whatever it's Shane.
327200	332520	Just like the the character from that game I'm going to sue for ripping me off.
332520	334440	Oh, the Stardew Valley?
334440	335440	Yes.
335440	336440	We're talking about that in a little bit.
337000	341240	I swear to God, the guy that made Stardew Valley is an OLR fan because Shane is in
341240	342240	the game.
342240	343240	I'm not in the game.
343240	344240	You're not in the game.
344240	345240	Loki's not in the game.
345240	346240	Shane is in the game.
346240	347240	Like where to go.
347240	348240	One hundred percent.
348240	352500	It is me down to a T and his name is Shane.
352500	356240	So hey, that's the one that you were talking about when we were talking about cosplay,
356240	357240	right?
357240	358240	Yeah.
358240	361320	I was like, I should I could do that because all I would need is nothing because I it's
361320	362320	me.
362320	363320	All right.
363320	364320	All right.
364320	365320	Well, hey.
365320	368840	So guy who made Stardew Valley, if you're out there, A, come on the show because you
368840	369840	made a great game.
369840	370840	I'll talk about it later.
370840	374280	But B, thanks for putting Shane in the game, but not the rest of us.
374280	379520	Just just, you know, maybe the guy who made Stardew Valley is a fan of Ranger Pride, which
379520	380520	is your podcast.
380520	381520	I doubt that.
381520	382520	That's OK.
382520	384160	Who would be a fan of that?
384160	385480	Everybody should.
385480	386840	Tell us quickly about Ranger Pride.
386840	392400	It's about Power Rangers and Super Sentai and we talk about news and episodes and we
392400	397480	have topics of the week and we have a fun time and it's super positive show and we have
397480	399000	a good time.
399000	402640	And Shane finally forced me to watch some Super Sentai earlier today.
402640	403640	It was great.
403640	404640	I was busy trying to prep for the show.
404640	406040	We were watching Ju-O-Jir.
406040	410960	I didn't see as much of it as Dark Sakura did, but it was I kept laughing at how, like,
410960	411960	silly it is.
411960	412960	But it is for kids.
412960	413960	I mean, it's not like, you know.
413960	414960	Yes.
414960	415960	But it's still fun to watch.
415960	416960	Yeah.
416960	420600	No, you get you when you when I asked you before and you gave the whole superhero analogy,
420600	422360	like some people are obsessed with Marvel Universe.
422360	423360	Why can't I be obsessed with Power Rangers?
423360	424360	Exactly.
424360	425360	That was a very good defense.
425360	428980	It is a good defense and that's my, like, easy defense to go to.
428980	434280	People are freaking the fuck out about five seconds of Spider-Man in a new trailer.
434280	440000	We went to the movies, me and Flacco Jones and Exfer and Flacco Jones' wife, last night
440000	447220	and saw 10 Cloverfield Lane and then they put the Civil War trailer on and Flacco Jones
447220	451260	and his wife were so excited, but it was the old trailer and there was no Spider-Man.
451260	454700	I was like, maybe the next trailer that comes up will have it.
454700	456180	It wasn't though.
456180	457180	They'll play both trailers.
457180	458180	Yes.
458180	459180	No, but the next one was X-Men.
459180	460180	So I was happy.
460180	461180	Oh, there you go.
461180	462180	All right.
462180	464140	Let's get into the kickoff topic tonight.
464140	466780	I do quickly, though, have to plug our chat room.
466780	470020	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the
470020	473100	Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
473100	475580	Do tune in sometime for a live show if you never have before.
475580	480060	It's a different experience when you get to participate and join along in our chat room
480060	481060	over at live.vognetwork.com.
481060	482060	I'm exposing celebrities.
482060	483060	Are you...
483060	487780	You guys are talking about celebrities by one word because you're talking about Bjork
487780	488780	and now I see Cher.
488780	489780	Yeah.
489780	493560	Because I said that Bjork probably just goes by Bjork because she's got a really long complicated
493560	495460	Icelandic family name or last name.
495460	497420	Well, it's not like you know a ton of people named Bjork.
497420	501060	Gudmund's daughter, which means that was her dad's name, is Gudmund.
501060	504100	But Cher's is Cherlyn's Sarkeesian.
504100	507700	But Cher is Cher, she'll always be just Cher.
507700	511420	Which by the way, can we talk about quickly because Daylight Savings Time happened last
511420	512420	night obviously.
512420	517980	So everybody was sharing on Facebook that image of Cher that said, don't forget, turn
517980	522260	back time this Saturday and tell your friends and I'm sitting there going, uh-uh.
522260	523980	Someone did a different version of it.
523980	524980	I was like, no, no, no.
524980	526500	We don't turn back time.
526500	528940	This is turn forward time.
528940	533860	Or I would have gone with a picture of Cyndi Lauper and said this is the time after time.
534620	539980	Well, the people were reposting the Cher picture and it said, you idiots don't need to turn
539980	540980	back time.
540980	541980	It's spring forward.
541980	542980	Now share this.
542980	547220	Anyhow, um, let's see.
547220	550660	And I see you are talking about your addiction with Don Gunropa in our chat.
550660	556860	Yes, because Don Gunropa, I came to the game late because I didn't own a PS, well I mean
556860	560200	I have a PSP somewhere in my house amongst all the stuff.
560200	562140	But when was the last time we ever touched that?
562140	567820	And I don't have a Vita, so I've missed out on Don Gunropa for a while.
567820	573020	And so when it came out to steam, I was super excited and of course I get super irritated
573020	574020	at it now.
574020	577100	I know it's not talking about my gaming weekend, but I have to get this out.
577100	578100	Sure.
578100	579100	Of course.
579100	580100	Okay.
580100	583800	So I play with Japanese language and English, you know, text.
583800	588060	So what's so weird, and this is the annoying part of knowing enough about a language to
588060	595180	get the gist of what they're saying, is hearing the localization be completely bizarre.
595180	599340	Like there's a scene where they're talking about, well, where, first of all, they changed
599340	603020	genocide or show to genocide Jack for some stupid reason.
603020	608140	And then she's talking about like ramen and ramen, you know, how you have to choose the
608140	609240	noodles and everything.
609240	612820	And they're, instead change it to spaghetti, but they're talking about ramen.
612820	616900	And I hear ramen and I see spaghetti and my brain shuts down.
616900	621700	And I'm like, I can't even, I just need to learn to read Kanji.
621700	625380	Um, so that's been my, my annoyance with that game.
625380	628380	Kids today know ramen, especially poor college kids.
628380	629380	Definitely know ramen.
629380	630380	Exactly.
630380	635680	And I mean, it's not like we're, we're, you know, no one knew, you know, jack shit about
635680	636680	Japanese culture.
636680	639620	It's pretty much a lot more common knowledge these days.
639620	640620	So I thought.
640620	646860	Back in my day, I remember at WinCo, you could get ramen for seven cents a thing.
646860	650420	And that was like, what, let me finish.
650420	651420	Cause I'm annoyed.
651420	652420	I thought you were finished.
652420	653420	Sorry.
653420	654420	I wasn't.
654420	655420	Fine.
655420	658860	Um, it's just, some of the localization is pretty clever, but the rest of it's just really
658860	659860	aggravating.
659860	665980	Um, so I don't want to say bad job localization team, you know, you did badly, but at the
665980	672180	same time I would like to, you know, have the video game companies behind these things,
672180	678780	give us some kind of credit, you know, and not think that we're total plebeians and don't
678780	679780	know anything.
679780	684860	Um, let's see, uh, Brad from pod cultures and chat saying about the ramen thing and
684860	689780	broke adults, you know, you're broke when you see six for a buck and go, Ooh, a sale.
689780	696060	But we know the difference between cheap ass, you know, cup of noodles and actual good ramen
696060	697780	that you get in a ramen shop.
697780	701420	And you know what, we've all fallen on tough times and had to do the ramen thing.
701460	707260	So, you know, it happens, but I also know, um, certain unnamed people that I may or may
707260	711300	not happen to live with will enjoy ramen as a snack as well.
711300	713340	Like just eating the, that's pretty good.
713340	714340	Yeah.
714340	715340	I know so many people do that.
715340	717900	I don't really make ramen burgers that way.
717900	721460	That's a big trend thing too, is making the, the buns out of noodles.
721460	727420	But anyway, look, we can talk about food, um, a ton, but we need to get into my smoothie.
727420	731460	We need to get into video games and, uh, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic
731460	736220	tonight, which is an interesting story that I've seen floating around Twitter that I wanted
736220	737860	to bring up on the show.
737860	742220	And I don't know, um, Shane, you watch a lot more Twitch than I do and have watched that
742220	743220	really evolve.
743220	744220	Right?
744220	745220	Well, yes and no.
745220	746220	How so?
746220	748820	Well, no, because we'll talk about it in my gaming week.
748820	749980	All right.
749980	753100	But yes, because I was watching a lot of Twitch.
753100	754100	All right.
754100	759100	I don't know if you know this particular Twitch streamer, but there is a Twitch streamer out
759100	761860	there and she went by Arah Gaming.
761860	762860	I hope I'm saying that right.
762860	763860	No, I don't.
763860	767020	I know the story you're about to say, but no, I never watched this person.
767020	772560	And unfortunately she, she had a divorce recently or, or fortunately, I don't know the circumstance,
772560	775980	but a divorce happened in that particular situation.
775980	779940	And you know, those are always, you know, tough situations, but things happen.
780780	785220	And what made this really weird and why this is suddenly going all around Twitter and even
785220	786220	ending up on our podcast.
786220	789980	And I feel really weird talking about somebody's personal life like this.
789980	792420	So I don't, I don't, you know, I don't know the details about what happens.
792420	793420	I want to get into that.
793420	794460	I want to keep it classy.
794460	802440	But what's fascinating about this is that it seems like Arah Gaming's husband got access
802440	806300	in the divorce to her social media accounts.
806300	809180	So he has the Twitter and the Twitch account.
809420	810420	Isn't that illegal?
810420	816780	I, you would think, but apparently this is what's happening, is that somebody else showed
816780	824020	up on her Twitch stream, some other gal that wasn't her, like the stand in, I guess.
824020	828300	And you know, of course the first thing people are saying is, who's this stranger?
828300	829300	Who's this?
829300	832540	And there's a little part of me, and again, I don't know any of these people involved.
832540	836980	I don't know the story and it's probably a mess that I don't want to know, but you almost
836980	842780	have to kind of feel like, what did that other girl agree to get herself into?
842780	847780	Does she know exactly what's happening and that she is the splendor?
847780	850180	Maybe he's treating this like a season.
850180	855620	So this season it's this chick on the channel and then when they get a divorce, season three
855620	858300	will start and we'll get a new chick.
858300	863520	But I mean, and it's not like it isn't completely obvious what's going on, but the new woman
863520	867520	will not talk about why she's commandeering the channel.
867520	872360	So, and I believe people are jumping to conclusions that the husband got the Twitch channel and
872360	874520	the settlement and so forth.
874520	879800	And the new streamer says she can't comment on it due to legal reasons, but ARA Gaming
879800	884580	decided to stop streaming and incorporate the channel so people can still enjoy some
884580	889280	of the gameplay while she's no longer streaming.
889280	895960	I guess the channel was sold by the original streamer, although ARA Gaming has not said
895960	901320	anything since the divorce, has not said a single thing, and with good reason, probably
901320	905520	has stayed radio silent on all of this because here we all are speculating on what the hell's
905520	906520	going on.
906520	912560	So now of course there's a Twitter hashtag, ARAgate, which is going on with this and somebody
912560	917280	claiming to be the husband, so we don't know if it is or not, went into the Twitch chat
917280	923560	and said that ARA Gaming will not be streaming for five years.
923560	931940	So I don't know how that happened, but something in this divorce settlement may have made her
931940	935480	unable to stream for five years.
935480	938320	It's crazy.
938320	941920	By the way, this isn't the first time dramatic things have happened on Twitch.
941920	943960	Drama things happen all the time.
943960	949480	But again, I don't want to get into this person's personal business because it's tacky, but
949480	955880	I find it fascinating the whole fact that somebody's Twitch channel is now essentially
955880	959600	something that has to be divided up in a divorce.
959600	963400	And part of me wonders, and again, rampant speculation.
963400	965240	I don't know anything going on here.
965240	969640	Was the Twitch channel part of the reason for the divorce, which is why she had to give
969640	971640	it up?
972040	974120	It's probably an asset issue.
974120	976280	It's a revenue generating asset.
976280	980560	You know, like I would probably say something along the lines of like book rights and things
980560	983400	like that, especially if you had a co-written book.
984320	987040	You know, what state is she in?
987360	988240	Are they California?
988920	992840	I honestly do not know off the top of my head and did not dig deep enough to figure it out.
992840	996720	I know for California and actually for a lot of states out there, if you don't have a prenup
996720	1000760	for divorce, then assets are split 50-50 between spouses.
1001480	1006760	So it could be a legal divider that it is considered an asset.
1007080	1009200	Well, she had 30,000 subscribers.
1009200	1014480	That probably, I mean, that's not the largest Twitch channel, but it's a nice little chunk of
1014480	1015160	pocket change.
1015160	1019960	But you can't help but wonder, was the husband taking the channel just to be personal?
1020400	1024920	You know, and again, I feel a little tacky, but these are the questions we inevitably ask
1024920	1028440	ourselves when we don't have all the facts in front of us, because for whatever reason,
1028440	1033200	whether it's she's under a gag order or she just doesn't want to fucking acknowledge it
1033200	1034760	anymore, she's not commenting.
1034760	1036680	So we don't really have both sides of the story.
1037320	1044400	This is just sort of setting off every single spousal abuse trigger in my head.
1044720	1048200	You know, it's just sending off red flags.
1048200	1052360	And I think that it's nothing that we should be speculating on.
1052880	1054320	I don't know what the precedent is.
1054320	1055200	I don't know why.
1055360	1061200	And until we have that information, speculation, there's not really much that we can do.
1061200	1062920	We could also hope for the best, though, for her.
1062920	1065280	Maybe this is part of some sort of settlement.
1065280	1069760	And the trade off is, yeah, she can't stream and make that revenue, but maybe her ex-husband's
1069760	1072440	paying a nice chunk of change because of that.
1072440	1073280	Maybe he had to pay for it.
1073280	1075280	He could be paying taxes on revenue from it.
1075320	1076000	Potentially.
1076120	1081080	You know, and something, something to think about when Conan O'Brien got a divorce, haha, from
1081080	1088320	NBC, like, he was paid to not be on the air for, what was it, like six months?
1088320	1089360	That's why he went out on tour.
1089360	1090360	He did the live tour, remember?
1090360	1091760	And then the TBS thing started.
1091960	1096200	So, you know, five years seems like an awful long time, but maybe she'll be able to come back at
1096200	1100040	some point and maybe he's paying all the revenue in the long term.
1100040	1104600	Again, you know, I'm speculating, but I just, this is such a 2016 story.
1104880	1109080	Who would have thought, even five years ago, when we were broadcasting video of OLR on
1109080	1113760	Justin TV, that people would ever be fighting over the ownership of Twitch channels like this?
1113960	1114200	I don't know.
1114200	1118400	Shane, since you watch a lot of Twitch, anything, any other comments or insight on this?
1119000	1121480	No, not at all.
1121600	1128560	I think it's, if she had viewers, I'm sorry that they can't watch her stream anymore if she was
1128560	1129040	awesome.
1129080	1131440	So, sucks for that.
1131680	1135560	I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1135560	1140440	Alan Alchemy says, I get that streaming is very lucrative, but wouldn't he just argue for more
1140440	1141920	alimony if she was the breadwinner?
1142200	1144040	And the meat and potatoes is her personality.
1144080	1148640	He can broadcast using her subs, but they'll drop like flies once they realize it's not her.
1150080	1153600	And then Kaijuto went into saying, register a new account, case closed.
1153880	1158480	And Alan Alchemy said, yeah, but if she hit a certain subscriber milestone, she'll have to rebuild it.
1158720	1164240	Well, I mean, you know, despite how awkward this situation is, it is getting her a lot of press.
1164600	1169840	And so if she were to suddenly come out and say, I have a new channel, she'd probably get this bulk of
1169840	1172680	the subscribers back and then some in a short timeframe.
1172680	1178760	I mean, that's just, that's just the reality of how this kind of like, you know, drive by looking at the,
1178800	1182240	you know, car accident that happened on the side of the road, looky-loo type of thing works.
1182480	1182960	Oh, no.
1183720	1190360	Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com also says, plus Twitch is such a shithole now anyway, so she's
1190360	1191040	better off.
1191240	1193600	She can start a playroom show on Ustream.
1193600	1196040	Is Twitch, is Twitch turning into a shithole, Shane?
1196920	1202800	Um, to be honest, again, without going into our gaming weeks yet, the last stuff I was watching on it was
1202800	1204480	just a lot of Until Dawn.
1204840	1208000	So I don't care for like the big streamers.
1208000	1209920	I've never watched the big streamers.
1209920	1216120	Like if you have like over 300 subs, I probably wouldn't be watching you.
1216520	1220320	But the little ones I liked still, I still thought they were great.
1220920	1221120	Yeah.
1221120	1222880	I like the more genuine reaction stuff.
1222880	1227200	Although I would certainly say personality goes a long way.
1227240	1227600	Yeah.
1227600	1232800	But the people that get like the thousands of subscriptions, those aren't the personalities usually I like.
1232800	1238640	Those are like the over the top, like making random noises, saying weird things.
1238640	1243000	People that will read the dialogue in an RPG in a crazy accent while they're in the RPG.
1243000	1243640	That's okay.
1243840	1245520	That's that can be okay.
1245520	1250800	I don't mind that so much because then I'm, it's like listening to a story on tape or something.
1252120	1253880	All right.
1254080	1258480	Anyhow, I just thought that would be an interesting thing to talk about because
1258480	1263280	I can't think of anything more modern in gaming than that fighting over the rights of a Twitch feed.
1263480	1267120	Let's get into our gaming weeks before we get into the rest of the news.
1267120	1271000	This week, we're going to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1271000	1272720	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1272720	1274240	I've been playing Danganronpa.
1274440	1276640	I've been playing Heroes of Dragon Age.
1276960	1284120	I've been ingressing and Neko Atsume and I saw something on Twitter the other day.
1284320	1288200	Somebody was making necklaces of cat butts from Neko Atsume.
1288200	1290280	And I was like, oh, Dark Sakura needs one of those.
1290280	1291600	Maybe I'll get it for you for your birthday.
1291760	1292880	You want a cat butt keychain?
1293080	1293680	No, thank you.
1294520	1296080	I have way too many keychains right now.
1296080	1298240	And I'm sad the portal one that you got me broke.
1298520	1299280	Oh, no.
1299280	1303440	Yeah, those plastic ones don't really hold up that long to my insane usage of keys.
1303480	1306720	Yeah, sadly, I think those types of things are more for show than actual use.
1306720	1309800	I had a Pokemon one that lit up, that thing got busted in a year.
1310080	1313720	I wore out one of my Togepis and thankfully I found another one in the package.
1314800	1315920	I just had it lying around.
1317800	1324800	And Dan and I were, well, mostly Dan, but Dan was playing like elevator action today and breaking out the nest stuff.
1325120	1331200	He took apart our Nintendo last night, took out the lock chip and cleaned it like completely inside and out.
1331640	1332080	Wow.
1332320	1334960	So that he wouldn't have to unbox one of our other ones.
1335720	1336880	That's still in the box.
1336920	1339400	Is that cleaning it so that you don't have to blow on the cartridge anymore?
1339400	1342440	Like cleaning the contacts so you don't have to do the whole thing.
1342640	1346440	But he also took out the lock chip, so it was just like the pirate lockout.
1346600	1346960	Right.
1347000	1347360	Yeah.
1347400	1350680	So I didn't know he knew how to do all that, but that doesn't surprise me at the same time.
1350680	1352000	He learned it on YouTube.
1352800	1353520	Of course.
1353880	1354880	I watched him do it.
1355120	1356720	It was educational.
1356720	1360800	And then I went back to making my wine cork, uh, cork board.
1362600	1363480	Because Pinterest.
1364680	1365800	Do you actually use Pinterest?
1365840	1366760	I hate their website.
1367080	1374560	I actually use Pinterest for looking up, um, lately my thing has been, uh, medieval, um, instruments.
1375440	1380680	And Pinterest has actually been a pretty good source because I haven't found examples of certain ones.
1380680	1383440	So I'll just look through the various ones until I find the one that I want.
1383680	1387120	I can get the name of it and then I can search for it that way.
1387200	1390680	The only thing that bugs me about Pinterest is every time I go to their mobile site, something links me there.
1390680	1392240	It's like, download the app right now.
1392280	1393320	Download it, do it, do it.
1393560	1397800	It's just like, Oh my God, some of those, some of the mobile ads and some of those sites are horrendous.
1398040	1406480	I hate the ones that will automatically, like you go to the page and it's like, opens up the app store and it's like, get Candy Crush, Soda, Saga, Supreme, King Commander right now.
1406480	1407760	And I'm like, fuck off.
1407840	1409000	I will never download your game.
1409000	1409520	Block.
1409680	1410680	Report it for spam.
1411120	1415960	But I've, I've been using it more only on my computer.
1415960	1417640	I don't use it on my phone at all.
1417840	1418440	Well, that works.
1419200	1419480	All right.
1419880	1424240	Well, if that's it for Dark Soccer's gaming week, Shane, you said you had an interesting story here for your gaming week.
1424240	1425720	No, I didn't say it was interesting.
1425840	1426080	All right.
1426080	1427400	Well, what is, what is your gaming week?
1427400	1428800	I don't have a gaming week.
1429120	1431960	I quit playing video games for now.
1433000	1433720	Okay, wait a minute.
1433720	1436000	So you quit playing video games?
1436000	1436320	Why?
1436320	1436760	Yes.
1436760	1437680	Cause I don't know.
1437720	1444920	I, I seriously, all I did was watch some random movie on Netflix and afterwards I was like, I'm going to stop eating meat and quit playing video games.
1445360	1448840	And it didn't have anything to do with the movie whatsoever.
1449600	1451400	And that's just how it's been since then.
1451400	1459400	I haven't touched a single game, not like an iPhone game or an iPad game or a handheld game or a computer game or a console game.
1459640	1460360	Nothing.
1460360	1462440	So what the hell are you doing on a video game podcast?
1463200	1466080	Laying on a couch and playing on my iPad, but not a game.
1466080	1467640	Just looking on the internet.
1467680	1475360	Well, the way you'd phrased it to me earlier, which I was hoping you'd repeat was, was that you're not like, just because you're not playing video games doesn't mean you hate it.
1475360	1475880	That's true.
1475920	1479600	All my only websites I know to go to still are video game websites.
1479600	1481760	So I still read about video games.
1481760	1483200	I just don't play them.
1483760	1486720	And I canceled all my pre-orders except for one.
1486720	1489760	I kept my No Man's Sky collector's edition just in case.
1490200	1495880	And we know, uh, when Pokemon comes out, I will definitely be playing games at that point.
1496320	1500920	But, uh, until I figure out what I want to do about this, there's no video games.
1500960	1502320	What do you mean by what you want to do?
1502360	1517080	Like, I was kind of toying with the idea of maybe just, like, playing games at, like, a very, um, reduced, like, I don't know what the next word I want to say.
1517080	1519880	Like, I would want to play them less.
1520240	1526760	So maybe, like, only allow myself to play, like, three hours a week or something stupid like that.
1527080	1532680	And not for any particular reason, but I just think there's maybe more to do out there than just play video games.
1532680	1534440	Do you think you were addicted to video games?
1534440	1535560	And so this is something where you're like-
1535560	1538960	No, because I really have not been playing video games a lot lately anyway.
1538960	1544640	This is just, like, like, I was already at playing maybe, like, five hours a week at the most.
1544920	1548080	And I was just like, eh, lazy.
1548080	1550360	I don't want to play games now, so I just won't.
1550480	1551440	So what are you doing instead?
1551680	1552720	What do you do with the time that you-
1552720	1553600	Living life.
1553600	1554160	Yes.
1554160	1556600	And by living life, Hulu.
1557520	1558320	Well, yeah, I-
1558320	1562960	Okay, but to be fair, hold on, I've got to raj you on this, because how is that any different?
1562960	1563800	That's what I was going to say.
1563800	1568800	It's really not different, but it's really not different.
1568800	1571480	But it's just, in my head, it's kind of different.
1571800	1579400	So once I figure out what I want to really do with this time, then there'll be less Hulu.
1579600	1580920	But I just need to figure out what I want to do.
1580920	1583000	Like, I want to go out and do something instead.
1583400	1590240	I don't want to just, like, sit there and watch Hulu or Netflix or Amazon Prime or anything like that for hours.
1590240	1591520	I want to go out and do something.
1591520	1594160	And if I play video games so much, then I can't do that.
1594640	1596720	And if I watch Hulu so much, I can't do that.
1596720	1602880	So that's why everything's kind of just, like, taking a backseat or falling off a cliff and being gone.
1603640	1608440	Having known Shane, because some of you might be like, why the hell is he on this show if he doesn't play video games?
1608440	1608840	Because-
1608840	1612520	But I have, and, you know, just up until this week did.
1613200	1620080	Well, and also, like, you know, like you said, you still stay on tap with what's doing, what's going on in the community and everything.
1620360	1625560	And for me, just knowing Shane as long as I have, Shane is very much the type of person where he's either all in or he's all out.
1625560	1627440	Yes, yep, that's how it is.
1627440	1630160	When Shane says, I need to play less video games-
1630160	1630960	That means zero.
1630960	1637840	The only way he knows physically how to accomplish that is saying to himself, I need to play no video games.
1637880	1639800	Yep. That's just how I did, like, soda.
1639800	1640960	It's like, I need to drink less soda.
1640960	1642280	So what I do? Cold turkey'd it.
1642520	1645080	I need to eat less Taco Bell. What do I do? Cold turkey'd it.
1645280	1648000	I need to play less video games. What do I do? Cold turkey'd it.
1648000	1650400	But you're eating Del Taco right now.
1650400	1651880	That is not Taco Bell.
1651880	1653040	But it won't last forever.
1653880	1655080	It's already gone. I already ate it.
1655080	1656800	But it's- I mean, it's the same thing.
1656800	1659120	You're banned from Taco Bell. I'm sorry, Del Taco is the same thing.
1659120	1660880	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1660920	1663400	The Taco Bell thing was just because I ate it too much.
1663600	1668400	So if Del Taco becomes a problem, then I have to eat less of it, which means cold turkey.
1668400	1670640	Yeah, but Sunday night during OLR, we always eat like shit.
1670720	1672760	So, well, yeah, I was just like, what am I going to eat?
1672760	1674680	I think I ate very healthy, thank you.
1675240	1677120	All right. I apologize.
1677120	1679720	And since like once in a while, she eats shit too.
1679720	1680720	Once in a while.
1680920	1685840	Since I gave up meat, it's like, what am I really going to do?
1685840	1690400	Like, I have to find these alternatives and sometimes they're not the best alternatives.
1690680	1692840	So whatever. My gaming week is nothing.
1693040	1693960	The end.
1696120	1700280	Oh, except that, you know, my gaming week does involve apparently me farming and
1700280	1704000	working at a Wal-Mart type store in a video game that ripped off my likeness.
1707640	1711560	I feel like video games are just something you gave up for Lent, like in 40 days.
1711560	1712160	Maybe.
1712160	1713480	Maybe when Easter happens.
1713480	1716760	No, it might not even be 40 days, because again, I'm playing with the idea of can I
1717360	1720200	maybe do like three hours a week and hold myself to it?
1720520	1721040	Probably.
1721040	1722600	There's going to be something that comes out.
1722720	1727720	No, well, I just got Twilight Princess that came out last Friday and I was loving the
1727720	1728640	heck out of it.
1728720	1730240	And then, you know, this happens.
1730240	1735200	I'm like, I just want to play Twilight Princess, but I'm not letting myself at all.
1735200	1740200	And it sucks because I just did my absolute favorite dungeon in that game, which is the
1740200	1744600	one where you get the spinner, which is the best item in any Zelda game ever and has the
1744600	1747320	best boss fight because it's basically Jet Set Radio.
1747960	1749920	And I can't play beyond that now.
1750440	1751120	That's it.
1751240	1757680	Why don't you tell yourself, like, OK, if I go all day without eating meat or Taco Bell,
1757680	1759640	then that's one hour of video game I can play.
1759640	1760640	Or if I...
1760640	1763000	Because I will be like, oh, it's only an hour.
1763000	1766880	Maybe I'll just push another 30 minutes and then it'll be, oh, I've already done an hour
1766880	1767080	or three.
1767080	1768360	Why don't I do three hours?
1768360	1772200	Somebody needs an app or something that starts yelling at him once the hour is up or something
1772200	1777080	where, like, if I go to the gym for 30 minutes, then I can play 90 minutes of Twilight
1777080	1777840	Princess or something.
1777840	1778480	I don't know.
1778600	1780320	No, it doesn't work.
1780600	1781680	All in or all out.
1781680	1782560	That's the chain way.
1782600	1783440	That is my way.
1784040	1789680	Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love eating turkey, but I gave it up.
1789760	1791480	I went cold turkey on the turkey.
1792000	1794800	Oh, and like, dark meat turkey is really good, too.
1794960	1799720	You know what, though, I keep telling Shane that when he plays video games again, he needs
1799720	1800720	to play the game with me.
1801640	1803680	He needs to play Dungannormpa because it's great.
1804760	1808720	Hey, Bobby Black Wolf has a decent suggestion, Shane, for how you can force yourself to only
1808720	1809480	play a certain amount of time.
1809960	1812880	Bobby Black Wolf says, use the parental controls on the consoles.
1813440	1816320	Oh, no, because then I will unlock it because I'll have the parental control.
1816320	1818240	What if I had the parental control?
1818320	1820400	Do you really want me to bug you until you give it to me?
1820400	1822720	I kind of love this idea.
1822840	1827080	Do you want me to come over in the middle of the night and smash your windows because you
1827080	1828200	wouldn't give me the code?
1828400	1830240	Because that's a thing that could happen.
1830760	1831800	We have a guard cat.
1831800	1832160	Come on.
1832160	1833080	No, you know better.
1833440	1835960	Or do I know better or do you know better?
1835960	1839720	I will have half the code and Dark Sakura will have the other half of the code.
1839720	1841680	And then that's the only way it's going to be unlocked.
1841840	1844400	There are, I think Bobby had a good idea there.
1844440	1844640	No.
1844640	1848920	My first idea was just to leave my video game systems at different people's houses.
1848920	1849280	Do that.
1849320	1851440	I was like, I'm stronger than that.
1851440	1856480	I still want to borrow your Vita TV when I want to play Danganronpa too.
1856560	1856840	I know.
1856840	1859040	Now I'm like, I want you to bring your video games over.
1859200	1862520	My, my whole thing when I said, I don't understand why you're doing this is because you, you
1862520	1864360	weren't able to tell me what you were going to do instead.
1864400	1865960	You were like, I'm going to stop playing video games.
1866000	1869000	And I'm like, so you don't really have to have something to do instead.
1869000	1872480	I just didn't want you to sit around on the couch.
1874480	1875880	I could teach you how to knit, Shane.
1876320	1877920	No, that's scary.
1878080	1880680	Uh, SSG, SSG 100.
1880680	1882360	Matt says, yes, please do this.
1882360	1884360	I want this to happen and recorded.
1884400	1885240	I don't know about that.
1885400	1885720	What?
1885720	1886960	The breaking his windows?
1887000	1889640	No, I think that's what he's talking about.
1889640	1894320	So Bobby Blackwell is offering up a new YouTube video series on VoG network.
1894600	1895960	It can be like that show.
1895960	1897720	What the hell is that horrible game show?
1897720	1901200	It was on the reality channel where they were in solid solitary.
1901240	1907040	So did you say it was a horrible show and that's the best show and you would just, it's
1907040	1909400	like a reality solitary.
1909440	1909760	Okay.
1909760	1910320	Then great.
1910320	1912920	Since you love it so much, you it's like you're on it.
1912920	1914480	God, I can't even talk to you right now.
1914480	1918280	I'm going to break your windows for real, but you have to go without games.
1919000	1920360	Do I get a voice?
1920560	1921600	That's awesome.
1921640	1924160	That will make fun of me up on the wall.
1924200	1925480	Yes, but it's just Jamie.
1928480	1930200	Solitary was so good.
1930200	1931080	Jamie gets to be the glados role.
1931080	1935680	I'm so upset now that we brought up solitary cause it's like my favorite game show.
1936600	1937520	Oh my God.
1937560	1943520	Um, bonds double 06 and chat says, Shane, like every teenage male said about quitting
1943520	1946400	porn, I can quit, but I have to quit cold Turkey.
1946640	1947440	Well, okay.
1947520	1948880	Shane's not talking crazy.
1948880	1950880	Shane didn't ever say he was going to give up porn.
1950920	1954400	I said video games and that's what he is.
1954400	1956160	That's why he won't tell me what he replaced it with.
1956160	1958200	He just replaced it with more porn.
1958240	1959680	That's that's what it ended up being.
1959680	1960320	He's like, you know what?
1960320	1961120	I don't have enough porn.
1962000	1964680	Uh, act deaf to chat says Shane holding off on something.
1964680	1966560	I seriously want to see how long it goes.
1967040	1972840	Uh, well like soda has been like two years now, so I don't push me because if you
1972840	1977840	think like I'm one of those people that you tell me not to do something, I'll do
1977840	1980080	it and like, do it tenfold.
1980320	1982440	What's the saying 99 cent of everything I do.
1982480	1984920	99% of everything I do is motivated by spite.
1985000	1988560	That's 174% of everything I do.
1990680	1991200	All right.
1991200	1994560	Tiger con chat says the only way Shane will ever play a video game is if they put
1994560	1995120	porn on it.
1995160	1997360	Um, absolutely not even true.
1997360	1997920	Absolutely.
1997920	1999080	If they make a dyno charger.
1999080	1999880	Oh God.
1999880	2000240	Yeah.
2000240	2003840	If Jason Riley were on it and he can make chase and Riley make out, that's it.
2004280	2004960	It's over.
2005040	2005480	It's over.
2005480	2005960	I windows.
2006000	2006720	I will do.
2007000	2011280	Yeah, I'll smash them out of excitement either way.
2011280	2012960	Your windows need to be replaced soon.
2015560	2016200	All right.
2016240	2017440	Um, my gaming week.
2017720	2020360	So, uh, I've played a few things this week.
2020400	2023960	Uh, one new game that I played this week, actually a listener was kind enough to buy
2023960	2024480	this for me.
2024480	2027640	So I just want to, I give a shout out, you know who you are and thank you for giving
2027640	2028360	this to me as a gift.
2028640	2031920	Cause it was a game I was gender genuinely curious about anyway, because
2031920	2035040	Shane started talking to me about it one day.
2035240	2037640	He's like, so did you hear about this new game?
2037640	2039920	It's like the new Minecraft or five nights at Freddy's.
2039920	2040640	It's the new.
2040760	2044240	I said it was the new, um, that other game I've never played Undertale.
2044320	2044600	Okay.
2045000	2047440	It's, but it's the new indie sensation game, right?
2047680	2049200	He says it's called Stardew Valley.
2049240	2051480	And I said, I don't know anything about it.
2051800	2054760	Uh, and what you said, it was like animal crossing and harvest moon or something like
2054760	2054920	that.
2054920	2055240	Right.
2055400	2058480	So I was like, all right, well then I looked up the steam page and I put it on my
2058480	2062800	wishlist and I swear, not even like two hours later, I get a message on Twitter.
2062800	2066000	That's like, Hey, I, there's this game you need to play.
2066000	2070280	You need to play and I want to get it for you because I know you'll like it and it's
2070280	2071040	right up your alley.
2071040	2073480	And I was just kind of like, okay, well, I didn't know what the game was at that
2073560	2076160	point. But then when I saw what it was, I was like, okay, this is funny.
2076160	2078640	Cause I had just put it on my wishlist two hours before.
2078640	2079720	And yes, I do want to try this.
2080120	2080360	Okay.
2080360	2083680	So Stardew Valley, it's a new game that just came out on steam like one or two
2083680	2084080	weeks ago.
2084080	2084440	Right.
2084840	2090360	And yeah, it's, it's similar to harvest moon, but also kind of Minecraft.
2090400	2095840	I really feel like Stardew Valley in a way is Minecraft for people that hate
2095840	2096480	Minecraft.
2098640	2102920	I think that's one of the best ways to describe it because you, you're not in
2103000	2106440	that whole weird first person thing and you're not having to break the bricks.
2106440	2107480	It's, it's totally different.
2107760	2112240	You are on a farm and you have similar types of tools to what you'd have in
2112240	2112720	Minecraft.
2112720	2118120	You have a pickaxe, a shovel, a hoe, and those are all things for killing
2118120	2121720	somebody and burying the body, which you can probably do in Stardew Valley.
2121720	2122600	I just haven't got there yet.
2122800	2128120	So you, you can clean up your farm and then you can start to bury little plant
2128120	2130160	seeds and stuff and grow plants.
2130560	2134280	There's a town nearby and you start to get to know the villagers and I guess you
2134280	2136080	can romance the villagers.
2136240	2142000	Although there is one particular villager who like, well, when you try to talk to
2142000	2143360	him is like, I don't want to talk to you.
2143360	2145200	I'm very busy, you know, type of thing.
2145440	2146480	And his name is Shane.
2146560	2148320	And he's rude and rude.
2148360	2154800	He had, until today, he had my hair cut and he only wears blue and I saw
2154800	2156120	wearing brown actually.
2156120	2158320	Well, he wears like shorts and a hoodie.
2158320	2159400	That's what I do.
2160040	2161440	It's, it's ridiculous.
2161480	2162200	It's me.
2162640	2165480	But you can't romance Shane.
2165760	2170640	But I was reading some weird, uh, online article where the guy was actually
2170640	2173080	talking, the guy who created the game and I'm sorry, I forget his name in the
2173080	2176600	moment, but, um, the guy, it was all created by one guy, which is really
2176600	2177040	impressive.
2177440	2181760	Um, and the guy actually said, yeah, I want to work on some free updates and
2181760	2185000	items and people keep asking me to make Shane romanceable.
2185120	2187080	So that's one thing I'm going to add into the game.
2187480	2191920	Um, and so I was like, okay, that's super awkward, but that is the thing that I
2191920	2193440	guess they're going to actually put in the game.
2193760	2199720	Um, I, I am so, I'm still trying to learn about this game that I can't figure out
2199720	2201240	how to romance anybody yet.
2201280	2206520	I, my understanding is there's no, like they do the cool thing where whoever your
2206520	2210000	character is can romance anybody that is romanceable.
2210000	2212000	There's, you know, there's five guys and five girls.
2212000	2212120	Yeah.
2212120	2214080	There's no gender provisions or anything like that.
2214080	2216160	And there's a lot of customizability with your characters.
2216240	2218200	That's why the game doesn't really care about that, which is cool.
2218600	2224600	Um, but, uh, here's the thing about the game is that yet again, it's one of those
2224600	2229400	games like Minecraft, when it first came out, that doesn't really handhold you an
2229400	2230000	awful lot.
2230640	2235960	Like it doesn't really tell you a lot about what to do now, granted you do get
2235960	2239320	quests to go talk to villagers, you get quests to do plants.
2239560	2244040	So it does kind of give you little like hints and things, but like there's other
2244040	2247640	like things that I would think would be critically important that the game doesn't
2247640	2249320	really explain very well to you.
2249600	2255120	Things like you have an energy bar and if you don't eat, you will faint or you will,
2255120	2256680	you know, like other things will happen.
2256680	2260800	And I don't know, like it's, it's kind of hard to figure out like, okay, well, how
2260800	2263280	do I continue stocking myself with food?
2263640	2266280	And I've just basically gotten to the point where it's like, okay, if my energy
2266280	2268560	meter's done for the day, what did I do?
2268560	2273960	I think I, I think I dug through the garbage and found something to eat, but in
2273960	2278200	what, on the other hand, that's part of what's really cool about the game is that
2278200	2281840	it is so open because it doesn't tell you what to do.
2281840	2283640	I kind of think that's the point.
2283960	2289880	I think the guy who made it wants to see what people come up with and how people,
2290040	2294400	you know, um, experience and, and get over the certain challenges in the game.
2294560	2297120	And I think that's why this game is so popular right now because it's incredibly
2297120	2298320	popular on live streams.
2298520	2302200	He also said that there's like hidden stuff that nobody's figured out yet and he's
2302200	2303960	not going to talk about it either.
2304040	2307280	And the game does go beyond just having the farm.
2307480	2309440	You can end up doing fishing.
2309600	2311840	There's a mine that you go into later.
2311880	2315280	I heard it's very, just like Animal Crossing slash Harvest Moon.
2315280	2316080	That's what the game is.
2316080	2316680	It really is.
2316680	2320760	But I actually find, I don't know, I never really got into Harvest Moon, but I'm
2320760	2322840	enjoying what I've playing a Stardew Valley so far.
2322840	2327240	I just feel like, and this is kind of like my, my OCD coming in to play a little bit.
2327240	2330280	I keep feeling like I'm playing the game wrong.
2330560	2332880	I keep feeling like I'm going to die.
2332880	2333800	I'm going to lose.
2333800	2334960	I'm not doing this right.
2335440	2340880	And I have to kind of remind myself at some point, there is no right or wrong way
2340880	2343280	to be playing this, but it's just, it's a weird hurdle for me to get over.
2343280	2343800	Does it make sense?
2343800	2344280	What I'm saying?
2344520	2346480	No, it doesn't.
2346520	2347200	I'm sorry.
2347440	2348160	No, whatever.
2348200	2352040	There's a, I've seen on a video game site that you don't like to talk about, but I'll
2352040	2355640	say anyway, Kotaku, um, they have like tips for playing it.
2355640	2358600	Maybe you should check it out if you really feel like you're doing something wrong.
2358640	2360080	Well, maybe, maybe I will look into that.
2360080	2360480	Who knows?
2361000	2363280	Um, let's see.
2363320	2366120	I was seeing if anybody in chat was commenting on this, but no, they're still
2366120	2367280	talking about the window breaking.
2367680	2369240	Uh, see, they're really into it.
2369280	2370840	I think this is what should happen.
2371800	2372600	There should be a poll.
2372600	2375600	Can you put a poll up on VoG and see how many windows they want me to break?
2376040	2376760	No, I will not.
2376800	2378880	Also house or car?
2379360	2379840	What?
2380040	2381760	House windows or car windows?
2381760	2382320	Which ones?
2382360	2383080	Well, both.
2383440	2384800	This is the house is a rental.
2384800	2386320	My car is covered by my insurance.
2386320	2387240	So I guess the car.
2387320	2388680	No, no, no, no, no windows.
2388680	2390240	They get to pick.
2390280	2391800	They're the ones into this idea.
2391840	2392800	Stop it.
2393640	2394160	Anyway.
2394480	2400320	Um, so Stardew Valley, I played a little bit of that and it's, it's really kind of
2400320	2402320	addicting in, in a Minecraft kind of way.
2402320	2403920	And I will be playing more of that.
2403920	2404680	So thanks again.
2405000	2409040	Um, I never expect money or gifts or whatever from doing this show.
2409040	2413840	It's a really flattering thing when a listener spends their harder money to buy
2413840	2415840	something just because they think I'd get a kick out of it.
2415840	2416720	So I really appreciate that.
2417360	2422200	Um, also in my gaming week, I played a little bit of Tron run R because I had
2422200	2426400	yet to play the full game once they released it on steam and here's the
2426400	2428560	hilarious thing about Tron run R.
2428840	2430160	It crashes my computer.
2430560	2431480	I think that's great.
2431560	2433280	I can play the first level fine.
2433480	2435120	And then the second level crash.
2435240	2436640	Have you updated like your graphics?
2436640	2439640	I just updated my graphics drivers last night.
2439640	2442360	So I'm going to try it again, probably after the show tonight and see if it
2442360	2443240	still crashes on me.
2443520	2445160	Cause isn't it coming to console?
2445200	2447000	So too, it is already on console.
2447000	2447960	Why don't you just pick it up there?
2447960	2449560	Unless it's going to crash again.
2449600	2450320	But then yeah, you do.
2450320	2450840	It's Tron.
2450840	2451440	It is Tron.
2451440	2454920	If you support Tron, maybe they'll make another movie.
2455120	2458560	Maybe there's an achievement in the game called Tron three.
2458600	2461600	And I was like, is the achievement for getting that achievement.
2461640	2462120	LOL.
2462120	2462840	Just kidding.
2464360	2465160	No, I don't.
2465160	2465800	I, what was it?
2465800	2468560	Oh, you have to get like a combo through the entire stage or something
2468560	2469640	and you get that achievement.
2470000	2473160	I just, I randomly got that on the first stage cause I'd played the game before.
2473160	2474800	So I, I knew what I was doing.
2474800	2479880	So Alan alchemy and chat says, wow, that's impressive because
2479880	2481280	your computer is rock solid.
2481520	2481880	Alan.
2481880	2483640	It just means I need a video card upgrade.
2483640	2486720	Like we've been talking about, even though my video cards only, what a year
2486720	2488760	old, it's time to get the video card.
2488760	2490000	That'll run the Oculus.
2490240	2491240	Don't you want me to have it?
2493000	2496880	Uh, so yeah, I, I tried to play a little bit of Tron run R and, uh, that
2496880	2497640	didn't go so well.
2497920	2500600	So instead I went to the PlayStation four and I was like, Oh, what can I
2500600	2500920	download?
2500920	2501720	What can I check out?
2502040	2506200	And my buddy extra for that hosts a show with me called guys on a show.
2506240	2511080	Also here at vog network.com has been pimping a game for ever that
2511080	2512440	he really, really, really loves.
2512720	2516400	And so I decided to check this game out, even though I played Rayman legends.
2516440	2518200	No, it was not, I played that, but not this week.
2518520	2521800	Uh, I played it at E3 like two years ago.
2521800	2523880	It was a while ago on the PS four.
2524120	2526200	And then I played it on PC a little bit.
2526400	2531120	The game is assault Android cactus, and it was one of the games that was, you
2531120	2534240	could vote for it to be free, but unfortunately it didn't win because it
2534240	2535960	was up against a game called bro force.
2535960	2539160	There was no way anything was going to win against that.
2539200	2539440	Yeah.
2539440	2541080	Which is kinda, which is kinda sucky.
2541080	2542760	Cause I'll tell you what I've played both.
2543000	2545960	And I think assault Android cactus is kind of a more interesting game.
2545960	2546600	Sorry, bro.
2546880	2547400	Bro force.
2547400	2548400	Wasn't that bad though.
2548680	2550000	I, I haven't been into it.
2550040	2550880	I couldn't get into it.
2550920	2552640	Like some of the over the top stuff.
2552640	2553880	I was like, Oh, that's funny.
2553880	2558080	But like assault Android cactus kind of had me right from the get go because
2558080	2560520	it's, it's a twin stick shooter type of game.
2560760	2563320	But it has some different sorts of mechanics.
2563320	2566040	Like, you know, I could say like, Oh, it's like geometry wars, but it's
2566040	2570240	really nothing like it, like at its core where you have the two sticks move
2570240	2573000	and shoot smash TVS type of game.
2573000	2577080	Yeah, I guess it's that, but you can switch weapons midway through.
2577080	2579920	And there's actually, you have to think when you switch weapons, there's
2579920	2581160	going to be time to do that.
2581160	2582520	So you don't want to get yourself in a corner.
2582760	2586720	Uh, there's power ups and the level design is kind of interesting because
2586720	2588600	some levels the lights will go out.
2588800	2591360	So the only way you can see is the monsters that are around.
2591520	2594600	Some levels have conveyor belts, which is really weird.
2594600	2597720	Like, uh, you might have like a giant wheel and then the middle wheel is
2597720	2600880	spinning, so you kind of have to keep that in mind as the levels going.
2601000	2607520	So sounds kind of unfair, but that's mean that's part of it.
2607520	2608680	That's part of the challenge.
2608680	2611280	So they can't just all be nice square little stages.
2611480	2613880	So yeah, I I've been having fun with this all Android cactus.
2613880	2616560	I think that's kind of a neat game and it does the whole thing like Spelunky
2616560	2619200	does, where like there's a daily challenge that you can play and see
2619200	2620560	how you rank against your friends.
2620560	2621960	And there's like an endless mode.
2622240	2626840	So, um, yeah, I I've been having fun with this all Android cactus.
2626840	2629880	So I didn't play it a lot, a lot, but I played it enough to know that I enjoy it.
2630120	2632560	So, uh, that'll probably do it for my gaming week.
2632560	2633600	I think that's all I need to say.
2633800	2637200	So, um, I want to get into some housekeeping real quick.
2637720	2642640	Uh, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R we're also on Facebook,
2642640	2646120	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2646480	2650760	Uh, we will not be having a show in a few weeks.
2650760	2654920	It's April 3rd, just so you know, no live show, April 3rd, I'll be out of town.
2655280	2660080	Uh, but we will be back the next week on April 10th and on April 9th, we will be
2660080	2665960	at the Sacramento, uh, indie game, indie gaming arcade, uh, and, um, looking to
2665960	2669880	try and get Bree and Gabe back on the show in the next couple of weeks to tell
2669880	2671320	us a little more about this year's event.
2671320	2673000	I know they have a nice bigger space.
2673000	2673880	It's going to be a lot of fun.
2674080	2677360	So, uh, we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks when they come back onto the
2677360	2677640	show.
2678120	2681960	Um, otherwise we will still be here through the coming weeks.
2682280	2686760	Uh, one other thing I want to mention over at vog network.com, of course, where
2686760	2690840	this show is and broadcast live on Sunday night, uh, over at vog network.com, our
2690840	2693920	pal Bobby Black Wolf, who does the show right before us here on Sunday nights,
2694160	2699400	he just posted a cool little video, uh, over at vog network, uh, on our YouTube
2699400	2699760	account.
2699760	2701600	And then it's also there on the main page.
2701880	2705360	Um, that was his little road trip to magfest.
2705360	2711480	He actually drove from Atlanta to Washington, DC, but he actually kind of
2711480	2714400	now has, has, has come out as a Tesla owner.
2714400	2716760	Basically, it was kind of keeping it a secret for a little while.
2717000	2721320	Uh, but he actually has mentioned now, uh, everybody knows he has a Tesla.
2721600	2725160	And so when you have an all electric vehicle like that, you don't stop at a
2725160	2726480	gas station to get gas.
2726480	2729280	When you have a very long drive, you do this whole little thing where you stop
2729320	2730200	at superchargers.
2730520	2735120	Uh, so he actually planned his route and he did a really good job with this video.
2735280	2738640	It's like an hour long, so it's almost like a bit of a documentary, but I got to
2738640	2741840	say, and I'm not just saying this because I know Bobby and he's my friend and I
2741840	2745000	like to promote his stuff because if it wasn't good, I probably just would have
2745000	2746120	mentioned it and ended it there.
2746320	2750880	But it actually is really good because, uh, he actually explains it at a level
2750880	2756600	like a lot of the Tesla stuff he was showing me before was like at a level for
2756640	2759520	people that already owned the vehicles and already kind of know that stuff.
2759520	2763320	But Bobby kind of phrased it in a way where if you don't really know anything
2763320	2767800	about what being a Tesla owner is like or how the electric cars are very different
2767800	2771120	from the gas cars, he kind of explains all that and really breaks it down.
2771120	2773560	So I thought it was a good little like kind of entry level.
2773560	2779040	Like if you're curious, like why are those cars so damn expensive and, and what
2779040	2780120	is that all about?
2780120	2781240	Why are people so into it?
2781400	2785280	I think Bobby does a really good job explaining that and framing it in the
2785280	2788440	video game text of the fact that it was a road trip to go to magfest.
2788640	2791320	And if you get to the end of the documentary, he does have a cool little,
2791320	2792800	um, kind of montage.
2793120	2796120	Cause you know, it's not a movie without a montage.
2796120	2797600	So he has a fun little montage of the end.
2797600	2799160	There are some of the stuff at magfest.
2799160	2800120	So I check that out.
2800320	2803280	It's over on the vog network, YouTube, or you can see that on the main page.
2803520	2805920	Uh, vog network.com.
2806360	2811400	Um, act deft and chat says, uh, hopefully like black Wolf said, the cars get
2811400	2812400	cheaper with time.
2812760	2815640	Uh, and Nintendo maniac 64 is in our chat room.
2815640	2816600	I haven't heard that name in a long time.
2816600	2821760	Live.vognetwork.com and says, um, I decided to check in and funny thing
2821760	2825800	about Tesla, I've been following Tesla for longer than OLR.
2825960	2828600	So if anyone needs another Tesla expert, I'm here.
2828600	2832240	Well, Nintendo maniac, you definitely should go check out Bobby's documentary
2832240	2833480	and let them know your feedback.
2833840	2836400	I've been studying Tesla since I was a little kid.
2836640	2841760	Because Nikola Tesla was really awesome and Edison stole his shit.
2841800	2842280	Yes.
2842280	2843160	So, yes.
2843560	2847960	Uh, I was, Hey, uh, I actually rode in Bobby's car.
2848000	2850920	Uh, he picked me up at the airport for, um, dragon con last year.
2850920	2855240	And so we, we went on a little trip and I got to say, I was like, wow, I
2855240	2856720	can see why these are cool.
2856800	2858200	And I kind of want one.
2858480	2863040	It's going to be a little while before I can get a couple of folks at my, um, at
2863040	2864880	my work, have them in the parking lot.
2864880	2865880	So I've gotten to stare at them.
2866000	2866560	They're nice.
2866560	2867120	They're nice cars.
2867120	2870720	I mean, and as this electric thing gets more and more and more, I think we're
2870720	2872880	going to see more competition, which will be a good thing.
2872880	2875360	It drives the price down and competition drives the industry.
2875560	2877760	So it's, I think it's gonna be fascinating in a few years.
2877760	2879880	Anyway, I don't want to spend too much more time on that.
2879880	2883720	Cause it is a video game show, but, uh, Bobby did a great job and
2883720	2885080	it's worth the kudos over there.
2885160	2889440	So, um, let's get into some gaming news, some video game stuff.
2889720	2892160	Uh, Shane filling in for Loki this week and to start us off tonight.
2892160	2895240	But then I have to stop watching this video of adorable puppies that are
2895280	2898760	like huddled up and look, then they get, they all run away.
2899400	2899760	Okay.
2899760	2901280	A it's horrible radio.
2901280	2904080	When you describe a video, uh, well, let me hold it up to the
2904080	2904920	microphone so they can see.
2904960	2907800	Why don't you just pause it, read the story, and then you can go back to it.
2908480	2909640	That's not as fun.
2909640	2910520	That was so cute.
2911080	2916560	Anyway, let's talk about other cute things like, um, just that I play games.
2916720	2918600	It's just like, I do nickel.
2918600	2919000	That's amazing.
2919000	2919640	What are you talking about?
2919680	2924120	So another cute thing, just like those puppies is that lion's head, uh, studios
2924160	2927080	is probably closing down and fable legends got canceled.
2927360	2928200	How is that cute?
2928320	2931320	I don't know, but I'm sure there's something cute about that.
2931320	2933000	No, I don't think there's anything cute about that.
2933040	2934920	It's cute in the, Oh, that's cute.
2936040	2936360	Yeah.
2936400	2941720	Um, so basically a statement was made on the Xbox site, uh, saying after much
2941720	2945800	consideration, we have decided to cease development on fable legends and are in
2945800	2950800	discussions with the employees about the proposed closure of lion head studios in
2950800	2951880	the UK.
2952560	2955600	So no more fable, I guess.
2955640	2959440	It's not a flagship for Microsoft anymore unless they move it to another studio.
2959640	2960080	Yeah.
2960080	2965280	But I think what, this is the third, this was to be the third fable game since the
2965280	2967880	numbered series and it's the third fable game.
2967880	2969960	I don't think a lot of people were really excited for.
2970120	2976920	Well, I, I think maybe going away from the mainline series was a mistake in a way.
2977120	2979960	I mean, fable three wasn't as well received as fable two.
2979960	2981280	Well, the first half was.
2981360	2984480	The first half of fable three was super well received and then the second half
2984480	2984960	happened.
2984960	2985320	True.
2985680	2991320	Um, I just kind of think that they should have tried to do another fable game
2991320	2994240	because the problem with the games that came after fable is that they weren't
2994240	2995160	really fable games.
2995200	2996000	Remember that?
2996040	2997480	Remember, I don't even remember the name of it.
2997480	3000200	It was the connect fable game and they had to sit there until they were blue in the
3000200	3001560	face going, it's not on rails.
3001960	3003760	Um, it wasn't really that good of a game.
3003800	3007080	I didn't even realize that there was like a beta for fable legends.
3007120	3012040	That's how much that fables not on my radar and I'm guessing it's probably not
3012040	3013520	on a lot of people's anymore.
3014200	3017880	So it's really sad that they're possibly closing down.
3018160	3022520	Um, it looks like they also kind of announced that a Danish developer press
3022520	3027360	play, uh, the team that did, uh, max, the curse of the brotherhood is also being
3027360	3027760	shuttered.
3027760	3029440	Like that one's a hundred percent sure.
3029680	3035560	So, uh, not a good time to be a Microsoft, uh, first party studio.
3035560	3036280	Rare.
3037480	3038000	You hear that?
3039400	3041160	That the shuttering noise is your future.
3041160	3041560	Trouble.
3041560	3041840	Really?
3041880	3042560	Oh, I think so.
3042560	3043560	What, what have they done?
3044200	3045560	They don't do killer instinct.
3045560	3049040	The rare anniversary pack was their thing, I guess.
3049320	3052680	That's basically a glorified Xbox live arcade on a disc.
3053040	3058880	Um, they did do, I didn't, they do the conquer, uh, hollow lens stuff that like
3058880	3062520	people like threw up when they saw it because it was so awful.
3062560	3063560	No, I don't know.
3063560	3063960	Maybe.
3064000	3066440	I think they did that too, but I mean.
3067160	3069720	They just, they're the next ones to go.
3069720	3071240	What if rare is getting fable?
3072680	3073560	That could be interesting.
3073560	3074800	That would be interesting.
3074840	3077280	I mean, again, I feel kind of tacky though.
3077280	3080680	Like, you know, like obviously people were impacted jobs.
3080680	3081000	Yeah.
3081000	3085840	But just, just like all the time, Peter Molyneux left though, to do his, his
3085840	3089960	what's in the cube crap and all this other weird stuff that also is terrible, but he
3089960	3092880	kind of, it's, it seems like he left them hanging.
3093400	3095560	I get this, I get this weird feeling.
3095640	3098040	I think he left them hanging while he was still there.
3098040	3101960	So, um, no, but the thing about, you know, these studio closures is that when
3101960	3106440	everyone gets announced, you go to Twitter or you go to like LinkedIn, you've got
3106440	3109960	all these other companies that are supportive of these people that have just
3109960	3113000	lost their jobs and like, Hey, we have spots open, come apply for us.
3113280	3119920	So it sucks that the studio closed down, but I don't think that the talented people
3119920	3124440	there won't find work elsewhere at a place not owned by Microsoft.
3124520	3126560	Therefore probably not going to be closed.
3126880	3129120	Microsoft is the new, new EA.
3129760	3132040	Well, I hope they do a fable for one way or another.
3132080	3134760	Like I really think they should attempt another fable game.
3134760	3135200	I really do.
3135200	3139000	Like not a spinoff game, a real fable game in the same game.
3139000	3140200	Who would you want to do it though?
3140320	3143320	Let's just say not rare because again, they're next to be closed.
3143640	3144160	Shit.
3144160	3144720	I don't know.
3144760	3148280	Um, and it's going to have to be Microsoft first party.
3148480	3149760	Who do they have left?
3150600	3152120	They have the people that do Alan Wake.
3152160	3154880	I think that's first party, but they're doing quantum break right now.
3154880	3157040	Halo, uh, three, four, three.
3158560	3160400	I think they need to just worry about halo.
3160400	3160600	Yeah.
3160600	3162720	Then that is probably exactly what they're doing.
3162800	3164600	Um, and then who else do they have?
3166720	3168760	Now's not a good time to ask me after I've been drinking.
3169600	3171840	You wouldn't have known the answer anyway, so it's fine.
3172440	3174960	I don't know who else they have either, but, um,
3174960	3176960	SSJ100 Matt says, who does Forza?
3179400	3180960	Oh, I want to play car fable.
3181000	3183840	Uh, well, I, I can answer who does fable.
3183840	3185560	It's a under Microsoft studios.
3185560	3186720	No, that's Forza.
3186840	3187880	That's not fable.
3187880	3188760	Try reading it again.
3188760	3189800	Playground games.
3190560	3191240	Okay.
3192040	3195520	Well, some of it, no, cause somebody in chat says, no, but you said I can tell you who does fable.
3195600	3196160	Oh, sorry.
3196160	3197120	I meant Forza.
3197160	3198240	Cause you're drunk.
3198240	3203280	And Bobby Black Wolf says, uh, turn 10 and playground does horizon.
3203280	3203800	Oh, excuse me.
3203800	3205880	A Forza horizon was what I was looking at over there.
3205880	3208560	So, well, maybe they could do it.
3208560	3211920	And I prefer horizon to the regular Forza series anyway.
3211920	3216680	So if they do do car fable, as long as I can kick a chicken with my car.
3219600	3220560	All right.
3220600	3221680	Now you're just getting silly.
3221720	3223840	Uh, but that was the best part of fable one.
3223840	3226240	When I played the demo of it was kicking chickens.
3226240	3228680	Good luck to those affected people.
3228680	3230240	And I really hope something can happen.
3230440	3235080	Maybe it's not a hundred percent sure that they're going to shutter lion heads still, but it is.
3235200	3239360	Can I do, can I do one tinfoil hat thing before I go on to the next story?
3239560	3242880	Cause it wouldn't be an episode of OLR if I didn't break out the tinfoil at some point.
3242920	3243120	Okay.
3243120	3243600	You ready?
3244240	3246320	So let's say this studio closes.
3247040	3254360	What's to stop somebody else from coming in and funding the company to reopen and make games for them?
3254680	3256440	Such as, Oh, I don't know.
3256640	3257440	Sony.
3258600	3264960	Now, not that I'm saying fable four is going to be on the PlayStation, but what about a Fable-esque game?
3265000	3270800	They can totally do that, but I don't think the chances are very likely.
3271080	3271280	Yeah.
3271280	3276320	They would have to know the demand is there and I'm not totally sure it is after the last three fable games.
3276320	3278640	I mean, I just don't think.
3279280	3280280	I have this weird feeling.
3280280	3285480	Nintendo would be more interested in that, but at the same time, they've got legend of Zelda and that's close enough.
3285520	3286560	Yeah, I guess.
3286640	3286920	Yeah.
3286960	3293120	I mean, they're not very similar, but if you put them side by side, I think people would be like, Oh, they kind of look similar enough.
3293160	3293920	Yeah, I guess.
3294520	3295000	All right.
3295000	3297360	Well, it was, it was worth a tinfoil hat.
3297680	3300760	Was it edited out?
3300800	3302280	No, I'm not going to edit it out.
3302280	3302800	It's live.
3303600	3304040	All right.
3304040	3305280	Uh, let's move on.
3305480	3309320	So a followup to something we talked about last week.
3309320	3322760	So, um, do you remember last week on the show, we had talked about a very interesting rumor about the fact that beyond good and evil two may be getting the Bayonetta two type of treatment.
3322840	3331960	But on the NX, meaning that Nintendo is funding beyond good and evil two, hypothetically, allegedly for these rumors, uh, to be an NX exclusive.
3332280	3335000	And while many of us said, Oh, okay, you know, rumor, LOL.
3335000	3335960	Wouldn't that be interesting?
3335960	3345720	But then very interesting development this week, Ubisoft asked Destructoid, the original source of the story to remove that story.
3346560	3349280	And what happens when that happens?
3349840	3351440	Your tinfoil hat goes back on.
3351480	3352000	Yes.
3352400	3356360	It's something we call the Streisand effect, which I'm, I've never heard of that.
3356360	3357680	You never heard of the Streisand effect?
3357680	3367560	No, it was, um, where there were, uh, there was a picture of her house on some website somewhere and she didn't want people to know where she lived.
3367920	3375760	So her lawyers requested that the picture get taken down and it only caused the picture to go everywhere on the internet.
3376400	3380360	The type of thing where it's like, when you try to hide it, it just shines a giant spotlight on it.
3380440	3382160	That's, that's what the Streisand effect is.
3382600	3388680	So, um, and I really abbreviated that story, but you know, I'm a couple glasses in at this point.
3389160	3394400	Um, so anyway, now that Ubisoft has come out and said, please take that story down.
3394640	3397840	It kind of lends credence to the fact that it's true.
3398720	3400520	Uh, so we'll see.
3401280	3407520	I'm just saying we here at OLR have experienced something like that firsthand.
3408360	3414360	And I'll let those of you who were around in 2006 fill in the gaps on what, uh, what that all meant.
3415600	3417560	Meanwhile, why don't we go to another story, Dar Sakura.
3418680	3420760	Well, I have to thank Reginator for this one.
3421640	3429520	Um, there is a browser run NES emulator, except it's not just any NES emulator.
3429880	3432400	It runs them in a kind of 3D.
3432720	3433960	It's kind of weird.
3433960	3435360	It's called 3Dness.
3435880	3439640	Um, it's not perfect.
3439640	3452520	I think it's still kind of beta right now, but, um, it basically has like any kind of surface, like a walking surface and a wall have a 3D effect to it.
3452920	3461440	Um, now the, the sprites themselves, like the, uh, you know, character sprites and, you know, like one of the examples was the pills in Dr. Mario.
3461920	3468680	Those are really flat kind of Parappa-ish, but it's kind of, kind of interesting.
3468880	3472200	And yeah, it runs, um, actually only in Firefox, but it runs.
3472680	3475600	Um, some people have speculated as to what makes it run.
3476240	3483680	Um, but I think that the end goal is that there's going to be, uh, an executable version of that later on for everybody.
3484920	3490640	It gave me a bit of a headache watching it because, yeah, it's okay.
3490680	3499400	It's one of those things where it's like, it's a really neat concept, but, um, and yeah, going to our chat over at live.fognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says it perfectly.
3499600	3502320	The 3D looks cool, but it's not practical.
3502600	3504920	Uh, Dartitsuya says, I've seen videos of that on YouTube.
3504920	3510840	It still looks a little bit rough in spots, but I'll forgive them for still being in early stages, but it's a neat effect.
3511240	3519080	I mean, if you want to see, like, I was just looking through the little video on that again, and one of the bad ones, at least as far as the splash screen was Contra.
3519560	3524720	The Mega Man ones look pretty neat, you know, it's just got like an odd shadow effect to it.
3524720	3534880	And then it's, I think what it does is that it takes the side parts of the layers and the top parts of them and sort of extends them back like an image.
3535400	3538240	It looks okay, but it just is kind of disruptive.
3538240	3542000	And when I watch it, it makes my, my head hurt more.
3543080	3545040	Bobby will love me for this comment.
3545040	3552440	Maybe it's to help 8-bit games be easily ported into the Oculus Rift by adding that 3D element.
3552440	3554800	Okay, here's another weird one is Super Mario 3.
3555480	3563040	This one's really kind of screwed up because Mario runs behind the bushes and everything.
3564400	3572080	And then like the ones that you can actually do the drop down behind, like the white one, he actually shows up behind it.
3572080	3577400	It's just really an odd effect for the way that this turns out for the emulation.
3577400	3579880	Like the clouds are kind of drifting backwards.
3579880	3593400	I'll put it this way, this effect only really works for, I would say just block images and not any of the rounded sprites or graphic effects.
3593400	3604320	You know, what might be an interesting use of this is that when you look at the YouTubes and stuff, it kind of goes, it goes like full throttle with these effects.
3604320	3609120	And maybe subtlety is the key to make this a really awesome effect.
3609120	3619520	And what I'm thinking of is, you know how on the 3DS, you have the pictures that you collect the puzzle pieces right on StreetPass, and you make these pictures.
3619560	3634880	And when you unlock the pictures, they're in 3D, but they have a very subtle effect that if you actually use the control pad, you can tilt it a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right, up and down, but not like crazy, like 360 degrees and all this stuff.
3634880	3643480	Maybe it'd be kind of cool, like for any defect that maybe like with the tilt or a little bit, it would do a very slight tilt in the 3D or something.
3643480	3648880	But again, how practical is that? I don't know. It's more one of those like, cool, now turn it off.
3648880	3652360	Well, it looks like it's a blanket effect that tries to apply it to everything.
3653040	3656560	And I don't think it's got any sort of way of...
3657920	3663120	Actually, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think that it's extending the surfaces into the into the background.
3663440	3665640	I think it's extending them into the foreground.
3666520	3677960	So that's why when you see a character walk around something that might be kind of a separate layer, it's actually having him go behind it when it tries to apply the effect.
3678280	3684680	Yeah, I think this is like a blanket effect that's supposed to be doing the whole thing, but it doesn't quite work for everything.
3685320	3686840	So just saying.
3688280	3691960	OK, well, we'll see, you know, this is probably going to be one of those things.
3691960	3693240	It's like, oh, it's really cool.
3693240	3697040	But then, you know, we probably won't see a lot of practical use for it.
3697040	3699200	But, you know, I'll link video of it to the chat room.
3699200	3704640	Just because it's not necessarily practical doesn't mean this guy hasn't had a heck of an achievement with it.
3704640	3708800	And I think that's that's a really cool kind of tech thing to show that he can do it.
3709760	3719840	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, actdeftinchat says, I prefer what the 3D classic games on the Nintendo 3DS do or what Shovel Knight on the 3DS does.
3720200	3726720	Yeah, I like I like the classic games on the 3DS too, just with the very subtle like the planes are just on different levels.
3726720	3728120	I think that's that's cool.
3728120	3731240	So it's it's interesting if this might automate a little more of that.
3731240	3734200	But anyway, let's move on.
3735160	3735680	All right.
3735680	3752480	So if you remember that show you guys did after PlayStation Experience, one of the games I raved about and probably my game of the show, if it wasn't for like ResVR, was Thumper, which is a rhythm violence game.
3752840	3754320	And it's amazing.
3754320	3758320	And there was a PlayStation blog about it this past week.
3758880	3761160	And it's coming to PSVR.
3761720	3763000	And that is so cool.
3763080	3774360	So now there are at least two games for PSVR that are worth your time and it can still be played in 2D on PS4 or if you get PSVR, it's going to be in full 3D.
3774840	3778720	And that just makes me super excited for this game.
3778720	3781720	And I love Thumper and it's so much fun.
3782040	3784560	Apparently at Best Buy, it's on the demos.
3784880	3785760	They're kiosks.
3785920	3788000	I had no idea until I just read about it.
3788320	3795880	So everybody should go out to your local Best Buy and try it out and see if you like it, especially if you're a fan of rhythm games, because that's what it is.
3795880	3798520	It's just a rhythm game that's really intense.
3799520	3807160	So since you've played Thumper and since you've had time on the PlayStation VR, obviously you didn't get to do both because it was an announcer there.
3807160	3807320	Yeah.
3807320	3811280	But do you think Thumper is a game that will work well in VR?
3811520	3811840	Yes.
3813840	3819400	Do you think it's a game that's going to translate into VR and will be given something additional from the VR?
3819960	3821800	I'm not sure if it'll be given something additional.
3821800	3825080	I think it may be the preferred way to play.
3826520	3833640	It was actually a question I asked the guy at the booth was if it was going to come to PSVR and he said he wasn't sure at that time.
3833960	3837960	Clearly he was a liar because there's no way this just started happening.
3838560	3841120	But I think it's going to be a lot more fun in VR.
3841520	3852880	However, if you have like a really nice sound system for your entertainment setup, that may be the better way to go because the music, I mean, it's all about musical cues for the rhythm aspects of this game.
3852880	3857320	So like the better you can hear it, probably the more you'll get out of it.
3857320	3858560	But I would want to play it in VR.
3858720	3860120	I think that'd just be way too much fun.
3861080	3867360	So even though you're on a game hiatus, I can still be super hyped for an awesome game like Thumper.
3867360	3869360	But do you think PlayStation VR is going to break you?
3870360	3875840	No, because I'm pretty sure Pokemon Sun and Moon will be out before PSVR.
3875840	3877960	Well, we'll know this. We're getting the answer this week.
3878160	3878680	We are?
3878680	3880760	On PlayStation VR, yeah. Isn't GDC this week?
3881520	3883240	But did they say they're going to announce the date?
3883880	3888560	Well, PlayStation is doing a VR press conference, basically.
3888560	3894760	So and we know it's about VR, so I'm not sure what else there is to announce, especially since they said.
3894760	3896280	I know they just announced Thumper.
3896280	3896960	So what else?
3897480	3898000	I mean...
3899160	3901600	Date and price. Call me crazy, but that would be...
3901600	3902280	Crazy.
3904000	3908720	All right. Well, I am crazy for a little game on my cell phone called Ingress.
3908720	3913040	And I'm really excited that the same company is making a game called Pokemon Go.
3913600	3915720	And I'm really, really excited to check this out.
3915960	3920800	But what's weird is that Niantic actually backed out of GDC to do a panel there.
3920800	3922200	And we've talked about that before.
3922520	3928440	But what did come up this week is that they are going to be doing a beta test for Pokemon Go.
3928440	3929280	A legit one.
3929600	3933240	Not one of the spam things you see online that's trying to get your personal information.
3933520	3935680	But Niantic has actually announced a legitimate one.
3935960	3938400	And you have to have an Android or an iOS device.
3938600	3942800	You can go to the official website at NianticLabs.com and register.
3943040	3946600	Oh, and you also have to live in Japan because it is a Japanese...
3947080	3948520	Darsaka just made a face.
3949240	3950800	Like she was really excited for this.
3950800	3953360	And now, oh, by the way, you also have to live in Japan.
3954000	3956920	And that is something that's supposed to kick off a little later this month.
3957200	3962240	There will be an NDA attached to it, but ha, ha, ha, ha.
3962240	3964280	That is going to get broken within seconds.
3964280	3965040	Let's be real.
3966120	3970960	So, yeah, we'll see what the game is all about once that rolls out a little later this month.
3970960	3977800	I really wish there wasn't an NDA because I would like to see what it's actually going to look like if it's worth the time.
3977800	3979200	It's going to get broken.
3979720	3981200	I know, I know, I know.
3981200	3984800	But I don't want to have to wait an extra minute to know the information.
3984800	3986560	I want it as soon as I can.
3986840	3991480	Uh, SSG100Matt over at live.vognetwork.com says, I don't trust any Pokemon Go beta signups.
3991480	3993920	There are so many scams involved with fake beta signups.
3994160	4000880	That's why you should only go to Niantic's official site, NianticLabs.com, and that will have the link if you're in Japan.
4000880	4006160	If you are AkumaJP, who I don't see in chat right now, the Daylight Savings might've messed stuff up for his time, but...
4006160	4007160	Do they even have that there?
4007600	4013600	Uh, well that's why, because we observed it and other places didn't, the time shifted of this show for other people.
4013600	4016320	Um, so, but anyway, maybe he'll sign up.
4016320	4024440	I don't even know if this is something that interests him though, but hopefully somebody we know over there will get in and send me some screenshots and let me know what to look forward to.
4024440	4036280	But I just, I feel like, especially within the Ingress circles, people will start sharing screenshots within the Ingress circles and they'll make their way out as things tend to spread around the internet.
4036320	4037400	That's what usually happens.
4037920	4040880	Uh, I do want to mention this though, since we are talking about Pokemon.
4041640	4050560	Pokemon Go will not be the only Pokemon mobile game, which makes sense because we already have the Pokemon, uh, match three game.
4050600	4052240	I always forget the name of, what's that game called?
4052240	4054240	The Pokemon, uh, shuffle, shuffle full.
4054240	4054720	Yes.
4054720	4056600	I actually like to say Pokemon Puzzle League.
4056600	4057320	I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.
4057320	4058280	That's a different match for game.
4058840	4069200	Uh, anyhow, the Pokemon company has announced a collaboration with Heroes, which is a Japanese startup on a free to play strategy board game called Pokemon Co-Master.
4069520	4075720	Uh, this is something where, uh, Heroes, I guess previously did board game apps and an AI system.
4076000	4079360	Um, so this technology is going to be used in Pokemon Co-Master.
4079360	4086440	So this is a, uh, uh, app that is scheduled to come out in the spring in Japan around iOS and Android platforms.
4086480	4090720	So lots more Pokemon coming to your cell phone for the 20th anniversary.
4091400	4092400	Let's move on Dark Soccer.
4092680	4097160	You know, it's not going to come on your regular 3DS SNES games.
4097720	4098800	Oh yes, this again.
4100120	4104120	Well, Nintendo did put out a statement and I'm just going to read it as is.
4104840	4114600	Um, as previously announced new Nintendo 3DS has an improved CPU, which enables Super NES games to run on the system with quality results.
4115280	4126800	The Super NES games also include perfect pixel mode, which allows players to see their games in their original TV resolution and aspect resolution, um, which sounds to me like
4130800	4143240	I mean, I understand that emulators have proved proven that there are some games that won't handle perfectly, but still if the 3DS can play Nintendo 64 games.
4143640	4145160	Why can't it do mode seven?
4146320	4153240	You know, the, the, here's the thing, the tech stuff, I got into it on Twitter this week, not into it, but you know, respectfully.
4153920	4157880	And so I had a lot of tech stuff thrown at me on Twitter.
4157920	4161000	And so it's kind of like, okay, I get it.
4161040	4170160	You know, I understand that there is some complexities that come with the emulation, especially with all the different, um, like they, they use this game as an example.
4170160	4173080	The, um, Speedy Gonzalez, I think is the game they use as an example.
4173360	4178360	Um, where certain things won't happen if a mode is not enabled perfectly.
4178600	4187160	And I think it has to do more with, do you want to emulate the Super Nintendo perfectly takes a lot of power or do you want to do it half-assed?
4187720	4199560	But one of these stories that I was linked to, actually, I kind of think gave a little credit to the whole, well, if Nintendo put a little more work in it, they could probably pull it off.
4199560	4206520	And that was about the whole emulator, SNES 9X, which back in the day was an early Super Nintendo emulator.
4206920	4215080	Uh, and what it did for certain games was for like the top 50 games, it had pre-established speed settings already in there for the top 50 games.
4215320	4222440	And I think that was part of the problem with the emulation is that because it can really vary so much on Super Nintendo, some games will run too fast.
4222600	4224360	Some games will run too slow.
4224520	4235160	Uh, for example, you might try to go play The Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo and the Triforce animation in the beginning will be wrong because it rotates too fast, like that type of thing.
4235400	4249560	So, I mean, from that perspective, I kind of get it, but I, here's the thing, a lot of what goes on in gaming, like it or not, a lot of what goes on in gaming is perception.
4250600	4253080	Like it or not, perception goes a long way.
4253560	4266120	And so the fact is when the 3DS can emulate Game Boy Advance, but it can't do Super Nintendo, the perception is Nintendo's holding off because they want more money.
4267000	4274680	But the reality at this point for me and this story is I'm kind of like, there's really no debate left here.
4274760	4278760	Like if you're telling me they can't do it from a technical standpoint, fine, I accept that.
4279320	4288920	The reality is, was I going to buy this anyway? Was I going to buy Pilotwings for the third time anyway? No. I'm not going to pay full price for another game like that.
4288920	4293240	Wait, buy Pilotwings for the third time? Why did you buy it for a second time?
4293240	4295160	On the Wii and on the Wii U.
4295160	4299000	But it's just Pilotwings. It's not worth the second purchase.
4299000	4302440	But I'm just saying that the reality is that it was purchased twice.
4303400	4317320	Anyway, so I'm not going to get, but even if it was the second time, I still wouldn't, because some might argue, but there was a discount that, okay, fine, whatever, I still wouldn't get it again just to play on the 3DS because it's just not.
4317320	4329400	Now, if Nintendo was putting out more virtual console games or virtual console games that were kind of new and interesting, like I don't know, second Densetsu 3 or something that we never got to experience before,
4329480	4335720	then maybe I would care a lot more, but the games they're putting out, and yes, I'm even saying this about EarthBound.
4336360	4341880	I'm totally content with the fact that I can just play EarthBound on the Wii U. That's fine. I don't need it on my 3DS.
4341880	4351240	Disagree. I'm like happy that, at least for some of those games, that they're going to be portable on 3DS now.
4351880	4358040	Having Super Metroid on there, brilliant. Love that. Having Link to the Past, great.
4359640	4364280	Having EarthBound, even better. When it came out on Wii U, I was like, man,
4364280	4371000	I wish this was just on the 3DS instead because I actually prefer my RPGs handheld now for some reason.
4371640	4377320	So I just want more games from Nintendo to come out. I want the Japanese list.
4377960	4384200	Well, I have a Japanese 3DS, so it doesn't even matter, but that would have been so much better to have all those games.
4384760	4390360	So here's the thing. If my old 3DS could have played them, would I be buying a few games here
4390360	4395320	and there to check it out? Probably. I probably would have ended up picking up EarthBound and
4395320	4400440	some of the, like Super Metroid, yeah. Okay, Super Metroid's a game I'll buy 50 times, let's be real.
4400440	4406680	I probably would have bought that, but am I really, am I going, I think the question on the table is,
4406680	4411800	am I going to buy a new 3DS just so I can play Super Nintendo games? No, but you should buy it
4411800	4416600	for other reasons. What? What other reasons? Xenoblade. Which is playable on the Wii.
4417720	4422920	Yeah, but it's not on your, it's not handheld. Like, I'm not convinced the new 3DS, but here's the
4422920	4429560	other thing, Shane. The NX is how far away? I'm just gonna wait for the NX. That's the, that's the
4429560	4435960	biggest thing right now against me getting the new 3DS is that we have a really good feeling, like,
4435960	4441480	you know, our guts say the NX is going to be a partially portable system, so why would I drop
4441480	4446520	200 bucks on a new 3DS right now when I know an NX is about to come out? I'm gonna wait. How much
4446520	4450360	did you say you were gonna drop on it? I don't know, what are they even right now, 179? They're
4450360	4455880	175 at some places for the XL and then, like, you can get deals on the regular. But I don't,
4455880	4460760	I don't play enough portable gaming to justify that, like, why won't you accept the answer that
4460760	4465880	I'm just not interested? Because, as somebody who buys every Nintendo handheld multiple times,
4465880	4468680	I just don't understand. Great, then buy another one for me.
4473080	4478520	Anyway, uh, all right, let's, uh, you know, in college I got two Game Boy Advance SPs,
4478520	4482520	a blue one and a red one, because I was going to a university whose colors were blue and red.
4483480	4486600	I'm with Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4486600	4488360	I can't even with Shane right now.
4491240	4495720	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Country Radio at vognetwork.com,
4495720	4501880	use the passphrase, tooth. So, all right, uh, let's, let's travel around the world and check
4501880	4505880	out some release dates. Let's check out some games that you can play on a variety of platforms,
4505880	4510360	and we'll start with the US. Were you able to get the US dates in Loki's absence, Shane?
4510360	4514520	Yeah, I'm just using the, the link you told me to go to, so if they're wrong it's your fault.
4514520	4515240	All right, cool.
4515240	4522760	All right, um, so this week, on the 15th, for Xbox One and PS4 you've got EA Sports
4522760	4530920	UFC 2. Uh, on PC you've got Need for Speed. On PS4 you've got something called Salt and Sanctuary.
4531640	4538520	On Win- or on PC, PS4 and Xbox One you have Sheltered. On the 16th, on Xbox One you have
4538520	4545160	Dungeon of the Endless. On Xbox One you also have Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.
4545960	4553560	On the 18th you have, on the 3DS, Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. And then the big,
4553560	4558200	probably released for Nintendo this week, really, on Wii U will be Pokken Tournament.
4559000	4560200	That's this week.
4560200	4560920	Kind of a big deal.
4561560	4566920	Yes, and remember to buy your early copies so you can get your Shadow Mew Two card.
4567000	4567960	Or don't.
4567960	4569240	But you probably will.
4569240	4569880	You probably will.
4571240	4574600	All right, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.
4574600	4579160	On the PlayStation 4 this week, Battlefield 4 gets a premium edition into the Best Hits
4579160	4584520	collection, so a little price reduction on that. As far as new stuff goes, though, there is
4584520	4593400	Senran Kagura Estival vs. Shoujo Tachi no Sentaku Regular and Sakura edition come out this week,
4593400	4601000	on the 17th. Over on the Wii U, Pokken Tournament gets its release in Japan as well this week,
4601000	4605000	and you can get a tournament controller or a Pro Pad that goes with that if you want,
4605000	4612760	over in Japan. On the Vita this week in Japan, Wanda Fortune R comes out on the Vita. Also,
4612760	4619080	Omerta Code, Tycoon Kai, and Digimon World Next Order comes out in Japan this week.
4619080	4622600	Which reminds me, I forgot to watch the new episodes of Digimon Try.
4623400	4625880	I did not even know new stuff for Digimon was airing.
4625880	4630840	It's set after Digimon Zero 2, so it's the original team.
4630840	4637560	I see. And then over on the 3DS this week, there's really not a lot of new games,
4637560	4642600	but Japan is getting that same... You know how we got a bunch of price reduced games here on
4642600	4645000	Nintendo platforms? What are they calling that, Shane? Do you remember?
4645000	4645720	Nintendo Selects.
4645720	4649800	That's it, Nintendo Selects. In Japan, they're calling it the Happy Price Selection.
4650600	4654600	So the Happy Price Selection is getting releases such as Luigi's Mansion 2,
4655400	4660680	Kuma Tomo, Nintendogs Plus Cats, and what might be of interest to some people,
4660680	4667000	Taiko no Tatsujin, Chibi Dragon 2, Fushijina Orb is also getting a price reduction.
4667000	4669240	So check out some of those releases in Japan if you want.
4670200	4671320	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4672840	4675400	Well, I'm trying to still act deaf something, but fine.
4676520	4677240	He can wait.
4677240	4685080	Yeah. For the UK, we have, on the 16th, Dungeon of the Endless on Xbox One,
4685080	4691160	the 17th Mutant Mud Super Challenge, Need for Speed, and Obscura Test for PC.
4691880	4694840	And on the 18th, we have Pokken Tournament, and that's it.
4696040	4700200	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4700200	4701240	But first, Shane.
4702040	4704680	Oh, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. What?
4704680	4706280	Wake up, next story.
4706360	4710520	Okay, and I don't know why I'm getting all the things being cancelled stories.
4710520	4713000	So, also cancelled.
4713000	4714840	You're a downer. Let's be real.
4714840	4719000	Also cancelled is EverQuest Next. Sorry.
4720360	4727480	And so, that's it. It's cancelled. I didn't read the story. I was watching dog video.
4729480	4730360	Um, um, um, um.
4730360	4730920	This is something-
4730920	4731720	Hold on!
4732680	4733180	Okay.
4733960	4735160	You want more wine, Shane?
4735160	4735720	What?
4735720	4736840	You want more wine?
4736840	4738600	I already poured me more wine. Thank you.
4739400	4745480	Um, so, President of Daybreak Games Russell Shanks said,
4745480	4749880	uh, when we decided to create the next chapter in the EverQuest journey, we didn't aim low.
4749880	4752600	We set out to make something revolutionary.
4752600	4756200	Unfortunately, as we put together the pieces, we found that it wasn't fun.
4756200	4758680	That is the best reason to cancel games.
4758680	4762680	Did he really just say, sorry guys, we didn't set the bar low enough?
4763480	4764520	Is that what I'm hearing?
4765240	4767720	No, no. You have- because you're drunk. No.
4767720	4774440	He's saying that they were trying to make the best game they could, but what they made wasn't fun.
4774440	4780280	I wish more developers would realize this, like, before they get too far into the process,
4780280	4785400	because I have a story from Konami that is just hilarious that I probably shouldn't talk about.
4785400	4786680	Um, anyway.
4787640	4794120	So, while EverQuest Next is not going forward, Landmark, um, is.
4794120	4796280	And it's going to launch this spring for 10 bucks.
4796920	4802920	So, Landmark, I think, was the, uh, like, the build whatever you want sort of thing in EverQuest.
4802920	4806120	Yeah, and some of the, like, all-star stuff from that game was supposed to make its way
4806120	4810440	to EverQuest Next. Like, the two were supposed to kind of, uh, be in the same universe anyway,
4810440	4814600	so maybe they can just fold whatever they had into Landmark, which would make sense.
4814600	4819720	Maybe. Um, but hopefully they don't fold the un-fun things that he was talking about into it.
4820520	4822840	Hopefully it's a pretty safe bet that those are not coming over.
4824920	4830680	Mmm. All right, uh, well, let's get into this next story, and, uh, this is a tricky situation,
4830680	4836520	and, um, it involves people we've had on this show before, and people that, um, may actually
4836520	4841400	still listen to this show. Um, so I have to kind of be careful how I, how I, uh, approach this,
4841400	4846280	because I'm going to admit, I don't really know a lot of what is going on here. I'm just seeing a
4846280	4850920	lot of the fallout on what's happening on Twitter and so forth, and, uh, it's very interesting.
4850920	4854600	And then, unfortunately, I think just shows the difficulty and what goes with
4854600	4860520	releasing a new console and putting out, um, new ideas out there. So, here's the deal. About a
4860520	4866120	month ago, the Coleco Chameleon, do you remember what the Coleco Chameleon was? This was that retro
4866120	4871720	video game console that was born of that retro magazine community, uh, ended up, I guess,
4871720	4875800	teaming up and getting the rights with Coleco to put their name on it, and, uh, so it was going to
4875800	4879800	end up being the Coleco Chameleon. I know we've talked about this on the show previously. So,
4879800	4886680	the Coleco Chameleon actually showed up at a toy fair and people were able to, uh, check it out.
4886680	4889720	That same toy fair that had all the Power Rangers toys. I was going crazy.
4889720	4896440	Yes. And you didn't go to, and so you didn't get to do this. Um, Coleco ended up as a result of
4896440	4901320	what happened at toy fair and showing the device at toy fair is that Coleco actually basically
4901320	4907080	terminated the association they had with retro VGS and the whole Chameleon project in a statement
4907080	4912040	saying, retro has decided that the work they have created is not sufficient to demonstrate at this
4912040	4916760	time. Consequently, we can no longer proceed with the project and the Chameleon project will be
4916760	4922760	terminated. This separation is amicable. We wish retro luck in the future. The thing is, this was
4922760	4928840	a bit of a one, two punch because the managing editor of retro magazine actually announced on
4928840	4934280	LinkedIn that he was going to be leaving the company and cited, in fact, the ongoing issues
4934280	4941080	with Chameleon as part of the reason why they were leaving. I have to separate myself from
4941080	4948120	everything associated with it. Retro VGS, the Facebook page, I guess suddenly disappeared.
4948120	4951240	I haven't checked the Twitter today, but when I checked the Twitter the other day, it hadn't
4951240	4956680	updated in a little bit. I will have to look into that. Um, and then, uh, yeah, so unfortunately
4956680	4962280	it's, it's not looking too good over there. I will say this, since I do know that there are
4962280	4967320	people involved with the project who may still be listening to OLR, uh, open fair forum. If you
4967320	4973240	want to come on here and just, just tell us like it is what's going on, uh, happy to have that,
4973240	4981960	uh, open invite. Um, and with that, I kind of feel like, and again, this is perception. What did I
4981960	4986840	say during a few stories ago? So I'm just going off perception. I don't know the inner workings
4986840	4992600	of what, you know, happened with this, but my perception is that when you are creating a big,
4992600	4997000	big project, and this can even be a video game and even tying into what we said about, you know,
4997000	5000040	Microsoft and Lionhead Studios and all that earlier is that when you're making a big video
5000040	5004120	game, there are certain steps along the way, certain hurdles you have to clear, certain
5004120	5008280	deadlines you have to meet to be able to convince people that the project should continue to be
5008280	5014840	funded. And the perception I'm getting is that maybe they had to cut some corners. We'll put it
5014840	5021560	that way to get a device out at Toy Fair that would, uh, be able to get this out in the public
5021560	5026360	and meet some of those goals. But unfortunately, when it kind of turned out that what they were
5026360	5030520	showing at Toy Fair was not really the same thing that they were saying this device was going to be,
5031240	5036520	that's when essentially the landmark was considered failed and Coleco had to pull out that
5036520	5042120	that seems to be my perception of what's going on here. Um, anyway, I know people are looking
5042120	5045800	forward to the device. I hope they're able to find a path forward and continue this,
5045800	5050280	but I can certainly imagine that this one, two punch may be a little tricky to recover from,
5050280	5056520	but maybe they can find another investor. Uh, who knows, uh, some comments from chat over at live.vog
5056520	5062120	and network.com. Dark Tetsuya in chat says word was the proto was just a Super Nintendo and or
5062120	5067960	a video capture card in the Coleco shell. Yeah, I was hearing that too. Um, I wasn't there, so I
5068040	5072440	can't say. Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, I really don't know what to make of everything that happened. I
5072440	5077320	heard a lot of things. Everything just seemed to go downhill since the Toy Fair fiasco. Um,
5077320	5084120	well, I mean, if, if it was coming that Coleco was going to pull out, some people see that as,
5084120	5088760	oh shit, I might be on a sinking ship. And that might be the cause of what's starting to snowball
5088760	5095480	from this. But, um, I don't know. Again, this is, this is tricky. So I'm going to try and end this
5095480	5102760	on a positive note with something that I think is kind of neat. The Coleco folks are coming out of
5102760	5107320	this and pretty quickly getting around to asking on their Facebook. And they did this on Friday.
5107320	5113800	They actually went to social media to ask the public, would they be interested in a mini arcade
5113800	5119560	revival? Now I love these things when I was a kid and surely Dark Sakura has to know these little
5119560	5124520	devices. They were the very tiny little tabletop devices that actually looked like arcade machines.
5124520	5130120	There was Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Frogger, Donkey Kong. Yeah, I always wanted one too. And I never
5130120	5136680	got one, but apparently Coleco is considering bringing those back. Um, and they use this thing
5136680	5142040	called a VFD, a vacuum fluorescent display, which sort of, you know, they're able to do color with
5142040	5145960	it, although it's still kind of limited, like an old LCD game, like a Mr. Game and Watch type of
5145960	5152120	thing, but it actually looked kind of cool. So, uh, anyway, they're actually having a discussion
5152120	5156120	on their Facebook page. Uh, and you can check that out over on the Coleco Facebook page. That
5156120	5159560	might be an interesting thing that might come out of this. Uh, I would like to see those games. I
5159560	5165400	don't know about you. Anyhow, uh, let's move on. We're going to get to the classic game of the
5165400	5171480	week. Every week, uh, Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5171480	5177240	hey, you brats ought to check this game out this week. Uh, sadly not a Coleco game this week,
5177240	5182040	but a very good game nevertheless. So Dark Sakura, what did you decide that the kids need to play
5182040	5187000	this week? The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening. No need to break out the brick for this.
5190760	5198760	It's just sound familiar. Um, in Japan, it was called, um, Zelda no Densetsu Yume no- Yumeo
5198760	5208120	Mirishima, which was, uh, Legend of Zelda Dream Island. Um, it came out in 1993, um, developed by
5208120	5214360	Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, and it was published for the Game Boy. It was the,
5214360	5221320	uh, fourth installment in the Legend of Zelda series. Um, it was also the first portable
5221320	5229800	version. Um, so it actually began as a port of Link to the Past, uh, developed just after hours
5229880	5236680	by Nintendo. Um, and the project then, uh, grew into an original one. Um,
5239400	5245400	and, uh, basically it did a few more firsts. It was the first one not set in Hyrule.
5246280	5253000	Didn't include Zelda or the Triforce. So it starts off with Link stranded on, um, an island,
5253800	5261720	uh, guarded by, uh, the Wind Fish. And so basically you fight through puzzles and
5262440	5268440	search for these different musical instruments so that you can wake the Wind Fish and escape from
5268440	5277560	the island. Um, it did, uh, so well. It was so, uh, so loved that there was a remake for the Game Boy
5277560	5285160	Color in 1998, um, called The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening DX, and it had full color graphics,
5285160	5292760	and you could use the Game Boy Printer with it, and had an exclusive color-based dungeon. Um,
5292760	5299160	the two together, the two versions have sold more than six million units around the world, and it's,
5299160	5308280	uh, a classic. I mean, really it is. Um, as far as, uh, you know, more of the story, you do have,
5308280	5315480	like, a mention of Zelda but not too much else. Um, the game also, interesting, has, uh,
5316520	5322840	advice given to you by other NPCs, um, that, like, there's actually a character who communicates with
5322840	5330680	Link by the telephone. Um, there also are cameos from other Nintendo titles. There's Wart, Yoshi,
5330680	5341320	Kirby, um, Dr. Wright from SimCity, who's called Mr. Wright, and, um, uh, another, uh,
5342680	5349960	character from a, uh, looks like a Japanese-only game. Um, his name is, uh, Richard, and he's from,
5349960	5357720	uh, Karunotame ni Kanewanaru, so, which, yeah, that looks like old school Game Boy.
5357720	5364680	It's called For Frog the Bell Tolls, to translate it. Um, you also have Chomp. You remember Chomp
5365480	5373800	from the various Mario games. He's so cute. Um, there's also a glitch involving the,
5373800	5379960	the Chain Chomp, from what I understand. You also see Goombas and all kinds of other things, so
5380760	5388760	it's basically just kind of out there for a Legend of Zelda game. In fact, the director, um,
5389320	5396360	uh, Tezuka Takashi said that it's supposed to be, it makes it feel more like a parody of the
5396360	5402440	Zelda series. Um, including characters even breaking the fourth wall, um, like the little
5402440	5409160	children telling you how to save the game, but then they don't admit that they understand what
5409160	5416120	they're talking about. So, it's a pretty, pretty interesting one. It's, you know, it's again
5416120	5423880	another, uh, overhead perspective, a Zelda game, but there's also jumping mechanics and
5423880	5430680	side-scrolling sequences that are kind of like, um, Zelda 2, and, you know, special items and
5430680	5437880	different things like that. And, uh, you can also fish in it and play songs on an ocarina,
5438520	5445000	um, so different type of, you know, stuff like that. And it is a classic, but, you know, the
5445000	5451480	other thing too is it really did, the DX version did make advantage of that old Game Boy printer.
5451480	5457240	Who remembers that? You could print out, like, really bad pixelated pictures that you would take.
5458040	5466120	Um, so there you go. That's the game. I remember playing this on Game Boy Color,
5466120	5469560	because I think that's the only way you can do it is on Game Boy Color. I could not do it on the
5469560	5473160	black and white one. Did you know that this game also has, um, a Guinness World Record award?
5473800	5480200	No, I didn't. Um, it's 42nd place in the Guinness World Records 2009 list of top 50 most
5481400	5486600	influential and important video games of all times. Interesting. I wonder how many Zelda
5486600	5494840	games made that list. I'm sure a lot of them did. So there it is, your classic game of the week,
5494840	5501160	Link's Awakening, the classic one in the Zelda series. And of course, with the whole, uh,
5501160	5505800	Twilight Princess being re-released on Wii U, it's very timely as well. All right, we're going to
5505800	5509800	take a quick break, everybody. Uh, but when we come back, there is plenty more OLR to come.
5509800	5514600	We'll get to the Fugu question of the week. We'll get to, uh, an acquisition in the gaming industry
5514600	5519320	and, uh, Ooh, the latest in copyright infringement on YouTube. That should be fun.
5519320	5524280	We'll talk about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
5531080	5537320	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with the continuation of our 634th
5537320	5545000	episode for this March the 13th of 2016. Myself, Dark Sakura here in studio with Shane filling in
5545000	5549960	for Loki tonight, who is home with a sick kid and we hope they are feeling better soon. Uh,
5549960	5555800	this week, St. Patrick's day. Uh, do you guys do anything to celebrate St. Patrick's day? No. I
5555800	5559640	know some cities have big events and things like that. I was seeing some pictures from my friends
5559640	5563400	in Chicago that were having a good old time this weekend. Which is purely an American holiday
5563400	5570920	anyway. Well, it is. Let's be real. We've, we've ruined a lot of holidays here. I'm sure, uh,
5570920	5575960	Cinco de Mayo here is probably not like what it is other places. Let's be real.
5576920	5581800	Well, and I'll, I'll tell you this. Cinco de Mayo is not really celebrated anywhere else in the
5581800	5588440	country. No, I'm serious. I had never even known it was an actual holiday. Um, until I moved to
5588440	5594520	California. And then again, we had Mardi Gras first. People just use it for $5 margarita
5594520	5600440	specials. Mobile, Alabama had Mardi Gras first. Don't let anyone tell you differently because
5600440	5605160	they're lying. But was it the kind of Mardi Gras where you showed your boobies for beads?
5605160	5611800	No, because New Orleans took that and ruined the holiday. And for that, by the way, I guarantee
5611800	5616920	you anyone who does that for real in New Orleans will end up arrested within the next 10 minutes.
5616920	5622360	I kid you not. They have the entire force out in patrol.
5622360	5627320	All right. Uh, enough holidays. Let's, uh, let's get back into some gaming news with some rapid
5627320	5630200	fire news. We're going to get to the Fugu question of the week after this. And of course,
5630200	5635000	your phone calls coming up later in the show at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype,
5635000	5639320	orange lounge radio. Skype is probably the best way to do it. Since everybody has that on their
5639320	5643640	smartphones at this point, you can add us on Skype, orange lounge radio. That's all one word.
5644120	5646840	Meanwhile, let's get into some rapid fire news. Shane.
5646840	5651240	Okay. I'm just going to talk about them super quick because they're rapid fire. Uh, there is
5651240	5657320	a Xenoblade Chronicles X, a little model kit coming out for one of the scales. Uh, the formula
5657320	5664920	zero frame looks like it's going around for about $70. It's super cute. The scales are awesome in
5664920	5672520	that game and it can transform into the vehicle mode. So that's cool. Okay. Enough about that.
5672600	5680600	Next, uh, round one is expanding into other places, New York, Georgia, Colorado,
5680600	5685400	and Pennsylvania. Um, I still haven't been to a round one. We have one in San Jose.
5685400	5690360	Why haven't we gone? Anybody? This is up for like anybody can answer this.
5691880	5696520	It's got to have given me enough incentive to go. No, I'm just kidding. I don't have a good reason.
5696520	5702360	Is that what you want? I keep wanting to go there. Um, but in San Jose this weekend,
5702840	5705880	we could have made a trip of it because rockage was this weekend in San Jose.
5705880	5712360	And I really wanted to go, but a the weather be just, I've been like, nonstop, go, go, go. I was
5712360	5719000	like, I need a down weekend or I'm going to just crack. So anyway, we'll go eventually.
5719000	5729480	Sure. Um, lastly, harmonics has ditched, um, mad cats and is now working with PDP or performance
5729480	5736600	design products. Um, they are going to be, uh, working with them to make the instruments for
5736600	5744840	rock band. And, uh, this is apparently going to, um, come out alongside a major update coming this
5744840	5752200	fall for rock band four. So as much crap as everybody's given mad cats over the past,
5753400	5758760	I don't know, whenever they started putting stuff out, um, I felt for the most part,
5758760	5766840	their rock band stuff was pretty quality. So it's not surprising that they are moving on since
5766840	5773240	I think mad cats lost like so many like high up people recently because they had a bad, bad, uh,
5774280	5780600	financials, but, um, maybe PDP can make even better instruments. And I'm kind of curious
5780600	5785080	about what this major rock band four feature update this fall is going to be.
5785080	5789000	It almost sounds like they're going to relaunch the game in a way for this holiday season.
5789000	5792840	Like you had last holiday rock band four and there'll be like the real rock band for this
5792840	5798920	holiday. Well then what's next year, the real, real rock band for maybe rock band 4.5. Well,
5798920	5804360	maybe that'll be this year. Maybe. All right. Um, Hey, how about rocket league? Are you guys
5804360	5808840	enjoying rocket league? Cause that game's a lot of fun and there's a new mode that's being teased
5808840	5815640	for the game. Rocket league is going to get a basketball mode as if, uh, hitting the ball into
5815640	5821080	the goal was not enough to soccer base mode. Now there's going to be a basketball mode and yes,
5821080	5826760	uh, you are going to have a big wide net on the ground. It's not very tiny. It's actually a huge
5826760	5831000	wide net, but you do have to get the ball in the net, which means you're going to have to know the
5831000	5834920	skills with your car to be able to launch the ball into the air. So it's going to be even more
5834920	5840920	of a cluster fuck, honestly. Um, now we don't know when this is coming out, but considering
5840920	5845160	March madness starts March 15th, it's a pretty good guess that it's probably going to be time
5845160	5850520	for this month. We'll see. Um, we talked a lot about Twitch earlier in the show, but it's
5850520	5855240	important to note there are other places to stream games and YouTube gaming of course is one of them
5855240	5859880	that's been trying to gain more and more traction. Well, YouTube gaming is actually now in some more
5859880	5864360	countries. Uh, YouTube gaming earlier this week made its way to Canada, which I didn't realize
5864360	5869480	it wasn't in Canada. Like usually, usually they're pretty good about getting most stuff that we get
5869480	5873800	here in the U S but YouTube gaming finally expanded to Canada and three more countries,
5873800	5879160	Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Of course, that is the mobile app for iOS and Android devices.
5879160	5885000	Um, and YouTube is saying it will go into many more countries soon. Uh, there's also some updates
5885000	5889480	that went with that. The Android app now supports the 60 frames per second playback. So that's
5889480	5895000	pretty cool. Uh, and also an update on desktops. The homepage is simplified with no more sidebars.
5895000	5899240	There's a live tab on the homepage that will take you to a lineup of all the top streams and games
5899240	5903400	that are on the air. And then you can manage games and, excuse me, and channels that you are
5903400	5911400	subscribed to. Uh, and lastly, if you are looking for a place to buy Japanese video games, like let's
5911400	5915400	say maybe there used to be a retailer that you used to use, and then they kind of went cuckoo
5915400	5920280	bananas on social media. And so you've been looking for somebody else to use, uh, Amazon
5920280	5926440	may now be a resource for you guys. That's so cool. Uh, Amazon, Japan will now ship video game
5926440	5931240	hardware and software international. Wait, wait, wait. Hardware's go. I heard last I heard hardware
5931240	5937720	was not working. Uh, according to this story, it's hardware, but, uh, cause the, the NeoGaf
5937720	5943960	post I was reading, um, people were trying to get a PS4 consoles. Interesting. And those weren't
5943960	5949880	working, but anything software related. What about Amiibo? Why there's like plenty of places
5949880	5957320	that sell them for just as cheap. I was worth asking. Excuse me. I don't know. I, I would assume
5957320	5962840	yes, but anyhow, uh, shipping is less than $10 a game. It should be noted. It doesn't matter if
5962840	5968600	you're an Amazon prime member. Amazon, Japan is a little bit separate. So keep that in mind. It'll
5968600	5973080	be interesting to see how that shifts the dynamic, uh, around, uh, dark Sakura.
5974520	5982360	Well, we have some interesting, uh, news from, uh, about the BAFTA. Um, there are nominations,
5982360	5989880	uh, out for the, uh, Academy, British Academy games award in 2016. We have, um, everybody's
5989880	5996200	gone to the rapture. Yay. It should win her story and the Witcher three, not Witcher three.
5997160	6001800	Um, well, uh, actually let me do by, uh, the number of nominations. Everybody's gone to the
6001800	6008440	rapture has 10 it's the leader. Oh, um, her story and the Witcher three have seven Batman,
6008440	6015400	Arkham Knight, life is strange and rocket league. I'll have five. And, um, they also said that
6015400	6022920	Dara O'Brien is to return as the host for the award ceremony. So that's cool. And then, um,
6023640	6030520	Rhapsody, which is a music streaming service is going to be coming for the Wii U, um,
6031720	6039160	sneaking ahead of other services, such as Spotify. Um, you can also get a 30 day free
6039160	6046280	trial directly through the Wii U. Um, and if you live outside the U S Rhapsody operates as
6046360	6053960	Napster. I remember Napster over here. When it was really good and when you can get useful.
6053960	6059480	Yes. I got so much Eurobeat that way. That's how long ago that was. Yeah. I'm like,
6059480	6064600	I think I got a lot of dance mania albums out of hamster. I'd also like to ask if I'm like the
6064600	6071160	only one of us in the room that got the meat Omo invite. I didn't get an invite, but I signed up
6071160	6078200	for their little network. Yeah. Um, well, Nintendo, um, has announced that the app, uh,
6078200	6084920	me Tomo is going to be, um, launching in Japan on March 17th. We don't have the U S state,
6085480	6090680	but you can register for it. I got an email for that for the Japanese one. Um,
6090680	6094680	since I have a Japanese Nintendo account, but I didn't pay attention.
6094840	6103320	Oh, is that it? Uh, yeah. All right. That's what I said. That's it. Oh, I didn't hear,
6103320	6107400	I didn't hear that. I'm multitasking. Takes a lot to do a radio show over here. I'm here.
6107400	6114360	I thought I was the old one. Anyhow, let's get to the foogle question of the week. Every week,
6114360	6117960	uh, we ask you guys a question on our Facebook community and our Google plus community.
6117960	6120280	You slam those words together and you get foogle.
6128200	6131720	Uh, this week we decided to ask, how do you get your gaming news?
6132360	6136600	Uh, do you use a popular or indie website that you get your news from?
6136600	6140520	Does it come from social media? Cause I don't know about you guys. I get a lot from Twitter,
6140520	6144920	uh, podcasts or YouTube. I swear. I'm not like self promoting or what I'm generally
6144920	6149160	curious. Do you use podcasts or YouTube even or what have you? How do you stay informed on your
6149160	6152280	favorite games and development? So it's just kind of curious what sort of answers we'd get with
6152280	6157640	this. So, uh, Mike B starts us off saying I use YouTube. It's awesome. I used to watch G4 back
6157640	6162360	in the day. Now I don't think cable TV has a game show like X play, et cetera. Kind of sad since it's
6162360	6167800	a billion dollar industry. Uh, Bryce H says, I usually get my gaming news from my Nintendo news,
6167800	6171720	whenever someone posts to Twitter. And of course you guys. Oh, shucks. Uh,
6171720	6175320	Dark Tetsuya says, I also want to shout out my Nintendo news, especially in recent months. And
6175320	6180520	with the NX rumblings, they've been keeping us busy with news rumors. Uh, Winston H says,
6180520	6184920	I used to get most of it from joystick before it became a part of Engadget. Otherwise now pretty
6184920	6189960	much from OLR and the co-optional podcast, uh, other games websites just simply have been copying
6189960	6194360	and pasting articles from other websites, which has become a disturbing trend, not just in games
6194360	6199880	news outlets, but also mainstream. I could go on a tangent on that, but I'm going to try really hard
6199880	6204440	not to. Okay. I'll say a little bit. The part that gets me is that somebody will copy and
6204440	6208840	paste one of those articles and then they'll put it on Facebook with one of those stupid,
6208840	6214280	like, here's the top six reasons why Donald Trump is a fucking asshole. As if we didn't already
6214280	6220280	know you won't believe number five. And it's like kind of playing on that emotion where it's like,
6220280	6224280	Oh, I got to see this hideous accident or whatever, you know, what's going on. It's just,
6224280	6230520	it's crazy. Anyway, that's just a side tangent. Um, let's see. Renji221 says, well, if I don't
6230520	6235320	get my gaming news from you guys at OLR, I usually get it from Facebook. Critical Myths says
6235320	6240360	combination of podcasts and Facebook mostly. Andrew S says, my gaming news mostly comes from
6240360	6245640	OLR. Otherwise it's the little bit of advertising I see on Facebook and then look into on YouTube or
6245640	6251640	word of mouth. SSU100Matt says, I mostly follow a few indie people and a few of the major gaming
6251640	6256280	news sites on Twitter, but I leave it up to OLR and Bobby Black Wolf to give me the full detailed
6256280	6261000	rundown of everything I miss. Redertainment says, I like to get my news from a diverse number of
6261000	6266200	sources, not leaning towards one outlet over any others. I do avoid getting any news from Kotaku.
6266200	6271480	Kotaku is the only Gawker outlet I expressly avoid. Veronica Isabel says, I get my gaming
6271480	6277240	news from Go Nintendo, VOG Network and word of mouth. Andy R says, pretty much all social media
6277240	6281160	and podcasts and occasionally straight from company press releases thanks to the site I write
6281160	6285560	for. Well, you have a little bit of a different perspective if you're actually working in the
6285560	6291960	media. Raginator says, I tend to check epic bundle.com, a deals aggregate site to find out
6291960	6297240	about any freebie games that are being given away for free. That's an interesting response because
6297240	6302760	instead of following gaming news, Raginator is following gaming deals. And it's like,
6302760	6307720	that's the part I care about. Show me where it's cheap right now. And I imagine, you know, sites
6307720	6311880	like CheapAssGamer and a lot of the similar sites probably have a lot of fans that do that exact
6311880	6316280	same thing. That's what they're in it for is the deals. We do have a couple answers over on Google
6316280	6321000	Plus as well, where Act F says, I get my news from Reddit, Facebook and Twitter, news outlets
6321000	6326840	or blogs. And of course, podcasts. And lastly, Prince Peach Fuzz says, I like to watch Total
6326840	6331800	Biscuit or Angry Joe on YouTube. Podcasts are the easiest way to get it, especially for when you
6331800	6337000	have long drives and radio stations suck here in SAC. Well, except Jack FM. I had no idea that
6337000	6342360	Prince Peach Fuzz was a local. Go figure. All this time, I had no idea. So there you go. And
6342360	6345880	yeah, most of the radio stations do suck. I will say that. I'll say a shout out. I don't mind
6345880	6352200	saying, I like 94.7. They play a good mix of music there. So. That's like the only station I have
6352200	6358680	on my car. But, but usually. I listen to the USB stick station. Yeah. I just listen to my,
6358680	6364200	my iPhone. Honestly, most of the time it's Spotify or podcasts for me, but once in a while,
6364200	6369000	it's like, okay, I'll listen to the radio. And actually, what even surprises me is that sometimes
6369000	6374040	I listen to talk radio. And for some reason, even though the talk radio station here is a hugely
6374040	6378040	conservative slant, which is not my political leaning. So I usually don't have interest in it.
6379240	6382200	But I still can't help but listen to it because it's also where you get the,
6383320	6388600	it's also where you get the traffic and weather updates and all that stuff.
6388600	6395080	So, anyhow, that is it for the FUGL question of the week. Let's get to, actually, I'm curious
6395080	6401160	about you guys. What do you use for your news? For me, it is like all social media. I am so
6401160	6408520	informed thanks to Twitter. That is what I use is social media for news. What do you use, Dark Sakura?
6408520	6417880	I like, I don't really, I usually pick it up here and there. Believe it or not, I actually get
6417880	6424920	information from Forbes, from Fortune, because that's the financial side of it. I really like
6426360	6433320	Game Politics. I like the announcements from, there's actually a couple of
6434680	6439160	mailing lists I'm still on, press release mailing lists from some of the contacts I made at E3 years
6439160	6446680	ago. So I'll get some of that. But mostly, I'll also get a few of them from Rocket News,
6446680	6452520	actually, which is a more like a Japanese cultural news site, but I'll get like game
6452520	6458200	information and things like that. And then also just from my friends. So.
6459960	6461800	Shane, what about you? How do you get your gaming news?
6461800	6465800	Most of mine come from websites. I go to, am I allowed to list them?
6466760	6467800	I don't really care. Whatever.
6467800	6473960	So I go to Destructoid, Silicon Era, and Kotaku. And that's it. I don't go to
6474440	6477800	any other video game sites, really. And then Twitter, I get my stuff from.
6478600	6480200	And those are my four things.
6481320	6485480	You know, what's interesting is that I wasn't, I swear I was not fishing for people to say,
6485480	6489880	Oh, LR, I love Oh LR for my news. I'm very flattered that a lot of you mentioned Oh LR.
6489880	6496120	But the thing about that is that I actually don't consider this a new show. Yes, we do go over video
6496120	6499960	game news. And so I'm flattered that some of you kind of rely on us to get that. But I always
6500040	6507000	thought of us more as a discussion show. I sort of set the bar at that people who tune into this
6507000	6513240	show probably already have an idea of what's going on in the gaming world. So I like to sort
6513240	6517800	of give bullet points and then talk about it. And you know, and I've mentioned that before is that
6517800	6524520	this show was born of, we used to go to the arcade, play DDR and Soul Calibur 2 and whatever
6524520	6529240	else was out. And then we would go to the diner that was in the parking lot, eat those fucking
6529240	6533960	delicious mozzarella sticks and talk shit about video games. And when I say talk shit, I mean,
6533960	6538120	you know, the good and the bad. And so that was always what I wanted to bring onto the radio was
6538120	6542120	that, you know, we would kind of have that same atmosphere where we're just at this virtual table
6542120	6547480	that we're all sitting at just talking about video games, but we're all informed through whatever
6547480	6551880	means. Although, and again, I'm not saying like, Oh, you can't be here if you're not informed.
6551880	6555480	We still try to give the high level bullet points just in case you hadn't heard. I mean,
6555480	6559320	usually there's a couple stories here that, Oh, I didn't know that until OLR brought it up. Like
6559320	6562840	some of you probably don't follow Twitch stuff. So you probably had no idea about that divorce
6562840	6567160	thing we talked about in the beginning, but you know, some of you probably knew more about that
6567160	6572760	than we did. So anything you want to add to that DarkSucker? I was going to say though,
6572760	6582520	informed commentary is very welcome though. Yeah. Uninformed out of your ass comments. Right.
6582520	6588520	Not so much. Yeah. I mean, as far as our banter and response with other individuals, I should
6588520	6593720	say. Sure. And I'm always for, you know, there's going to be times when we disagree. We all
6593720	6599240	disagree here in studio. Except you're wrong. And we can have that respectful disagreement. And even
6599240	6603480	with the listeners, you know, like for example, Bobby and I disagree on a lot of stuff out there,
6603480	6608360	but we can have a respectful dialogue and even listeners will call in and, you know, might say,
6608360	6612120	Hey, I think you guys are wrong on such and such topic. And I'll kind of hear that out.
6612120	6615640	I might needle them a little bit and get them to express their viewpoint a little more,
6615640	6620760	but I'm all about hearing the different opinions. I just demand we keep it respectful when we get
6620760	6628200	into the whole, like, you know, F you and the, the just disrespectful name calling and all that
6628200	6632760	stuff. I can't, I can't really deal with that. Like it's just, I'm too old for that. I am actually
6632760	6638760	too old for that. I really am. So what am I older than that? No, you are also too old for that.
6640600	6645240	There's a certain bar around the age. I don't know that you just, you just get too old for this
6645240	6654520	shit. What? I think that was like 25. Uh, yeah, probably, probably. All right. Anyhow. Uh, let's,
6654520	6658520	let's see. I just leave you in chat over at live.vog network.com. Uh,
6658520	6663560	Kaijuto in chat says everyone has an agenda. So I pretty much stay away from video game news and
6663560	6670200	just check out release dates and try myself. Or if it's PC, I read steam reviews. Kaijuto in chat
6670200	6675560	says sometimes a good F you is all you need to say. There there's an appropriate way and an
6675560	6681160	inappropriate way to say, fuck you. Like there, there really is. There's, there's a way you can
6681160	6687560	say it respectfully, but it's an art. Um, you guys know I love and I take most of my cues in life
6687560	6693320	from RuPaul, right? And RuPaul has a great quote that I think is very appropriate. I don't care if
6693320	6697480	you're straight, gay, wherever on the sexuality spectrum you are, gender spectrum. I don't give
6697480	6705960	a fuck because I think this, this quote applies to everything. Throwing shade takes creativity.
6706600	6713000	Being a bitch takes none that, and I owe that one to RuPaul. Would you agree to our soccer?
6713000	6720040	Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. All right. I should just end the show with a RuPaul quote every week. No, I
6720040	6724600	don't know. All right. Uh, let's move on. Let's, uh, get to some more stories and then we'll get to,
6724600	6729800	uh, the, um, phone calls. So you can call in and disagree over at, uh, Oren Santerio.
6731240	6733480	We'll get to the mailbag too. Maybe we'll have some disagreements in the mailbag.
6733480	6737560	If I'm, if I can. Well, let's try to get there. Let's, uh, let's get back into some news. We'll
6737560	6746360	start off with Shane. So Diablo 2 got a patch. Um, now they're trying to make it so, uh, more
6746360	6756120	people can play it. So they patched it to work on modern platforms. Um, who cares? There's Diablo 3.
6756120	6761560	Go play that. You know, a game that's really supported. And don't even play that because
6761560	6768200	Blizzard fired Zarem. And what's the point? Just, I don't understand. You're very salty
6768200	6773320	about that. Aren't you? We don't know he was fired by the way. Yes, we do because he didn't get a
6773320	6784120	blue post saying goodbye. He just left and that's fired. So all that personal business aside,
6784120	6787880	you're not going to go back and visit Diablo 2. I've never played Diablo 2. I don't care about
6787880	6793240	Diablo 2. Also, I'm not playing video games, so that doesn't matter. But, um, no. Who cares about
6793240	6799880	Diablo 2? Diablo 3 is fine enough and that's it. Sometimes you have to know your roots in gaming.
6799880	6805160	Nope. I'm never going to go play like old games that I've never played before. Well, something
6805160	6809400	else you probably don't care about Warcraft 3. I don't. Is also supposed to be getting a patch.
6809400	6815320	Like Blizzard's patching all their old games. Who cares? Some people still play those games.
6815320	6821960	So they're patching the, um, crap. No, I forgot the name. The Three Vikings. Lost Vikings. That
6821960	6826600	would be rad if they did. They're patching the Lost Vikings to work instead of the Super Nintendo.
6826600	6832600	It'll work on, you know, El Capitan. I think they have to patch all these things so that they run
6832600	6837480	better in Windows 10 since it's becoming more and more obvious that Microsoft will place you on
6837480	6843080	Windows 10 one way or the other. That's not happening. They will physically remove you
6843080	6851480	from your workstation and put you on 10. Unless, Rob. Buy a Mac, right? No. What? Turn off your
6851480	6856040	updates. I heard that even if you turn off your updates, like somebody did that and then they
6856040	6859480	woke up the next day and it was like, welcome to Windows 10. And the person like was going to
6859480	6865640	throw their computer out a window. You know what? What? I still have Windows 7. Hang on. Well, I,
6865640	6871080	I don't hate Windows 10 though. I really don't, but it's, I, every, everybody's different. I,
6871080	6876440	I didn't care for Windows 8 and there's like one random laptop at work on Windows 8 and every time
6876440	6881800	I have to use it, I'm like, how do I computer? Like, it's just so different for me, but Windows
6881800	6887400	10 is fine. No, Windows 10 is garbage. Windows 8.1 was great. All right, whatever. We still use,
6887400	6890440	do you guys know we're still, I'm not, I guess I'm not supposed to advertise. Somebody told me
6890440	6896040	I shouldn't advertise this, but too late. I always run my big mouth. We still run Windows XP here on
6896040	6903160	the studio computer, but it works. I am scared to upgrade to even Windows 7 because this method,
6903160	6907960	you heard about the crazy ordeal when I updated fucking Skype and it shut down the Skype line for
6907960	6914760	like a month. I'm afraid to update to even Windows 7. But anyway, I probably will eventually. I just
6914760	6924040	need to stop being a, a jerk. All right, let's move on. Other stories. How about League of
6924040	6927720	Legends? Although this story isn't actually about League of Legends, but the parent company,
6927720	6932200	Riot Games, who's had a lot of success with League of Legends. Well, Riot Games this week
6932200	6937880	acquired Radiant Entertainment. Radiant Entertainment has fighting game technology.
6937880	6943480	It's staffed by folks that are high up in the fighting game community, including Seth Killian,
6943480	6947640	which was a former Capcom community manager and he used to do Street Fighter commentary.
6947640	6952840	The studio originally created by Tom and Tony Cannon. They had also founded the Evolution
6952920	6957800	Championship series. Radiant has the online fighting game Rising Thunder and the town
6957800	6962840	building simulator Stonehearth. So anyhow, Rising Thunder is going to be going offline on March
6962840	6967960	18th. So the team can start on a new game, but Stonehearth will continue development as planned,
6967960	6974920	but now it will be under Riot Games. Riot Games, by the way, is not the end all be all because
6974920	6981480	Riot Games in turn is owned by Tencent, which is a Chinese company. But it doesn't surprise me that
6981480	6986040	Riot Games is trying to expand its portfolio a little bit. After all, Blizzard is much more
6986040	6990680	than World of Warcraft and we've really seen them expand their portfolio in recent years with things
6990680	6994520	like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm. So it makes sense that Riot Games wants to get into
6994520	7001400	other places as well. And, you know, with League of Legends being such a huge esports game,
7001400	7005640	I'm not surprised at all that they want to acquire a fighting game because that's a universe that
7005640	7010920	Blizzard isn't in, for starters. And that's something that, you know, they could take all
7010920	7016120	this expertise and try to get a fighter out there that will be at these, you know, Evolution
7016120	7020920	Championship Series and these huge fighting game tournaments that will make Riot a bigger
7020920	7025240	competitor in that space. So I think that's very interesting, a very interesting turn of events
7025240	7033400	there. And I will check that out. DarkSagra. Well, and Bobby alluded to this in the chat room.
7033720	7044360	There, Nintendo had a claim open for a video. The video was called Captain Toad Head Butts Toad
7044360	7051640	Out in the Crotch. Yeah. I'm not going to say the video is the classiest thing or the most mature,
7052200	7060920	but it was posted under fair use and Nintendo basically put out a claim on it on copyright
7060920	7069000	grounds that it used footage from Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. So the claim was disputed.
7070600	7078040	And then four weeks after that, Nintendo rejected the dispute. So the person appealed,
7080200	7087640	which gives them 30 days to release the claim or issue a takedown. And so 31 days later,
7088440	7095960	they haven't said anything. They haven't done anything. So and even the thing about it is that
7095960	7104920	the person who did it wasn't really doing it for any money. But the fact that Nintendo hasn't
7104920	7110840	really pursued it might give an indication on just exactly how seriously they take these
7110840	7123160	kind of things. I don't even think that Nintendo even watches any of these videos or tests them.
7123160	7128680	They just look out for something that has a mention of it or has been reported as having
7128680	7132840	content and they just try to take down as many of them as they can. So.
7132840	7141400	And on top of that, too, it looks like they also didn't give much of an explanation as to
7141400	7144920	really why they did it or why they didn't even reply. So that's it.
7148200	7151560	They really need to do something about that whole copyright system on YouTube. It is so
7151560	7156920	jank right now. And I've gone off telling Blue in the face about it. So I'm going to really try to
7156920	7161960	not do that again this week. But I'm glad to hear that when appropriate, they are backing off.
7162840	7166200	Well, it's not a thing that they even backed off. I think they just didn't
7166200	7173640	care enough to put out a comment on it. But I like what the person that wrote the article
7173640	7178600	is the person that posted it. And I agree with this one line here. There should be some type
7178600	7184680	of penalty for filing bogus bad faith copyright claims. Thank you. Absolutely. I stand by that.
7184680	7192680	Absolutely. And he also suggests that claimants should be required, and I'm just quoting this,
7192680	7197080	to actually respond to disputes and appeals, not just rejecting them with no explanation.
7199160	7202360	So that's it. All right. Let's move on. Shane.
7203320	7210920	So remember when Sony got hacked several years ago and it sucked for everybody? Well,
7210920	7218120	they had a class action suit that was done in 2014 where you could actually
7218680	7224520	sign up to get some free stuff from them. Apparently, since March 2nd, Sony's actually
7224520	7229720	been compensating people for it. So if you filled out that really long form, which I'm pretty sure I
7229720	7237000	did, you could be eligible to get free copies of Infamous, Big Planet, and the God of War HD
7237000	7246760	collection on your PS3 or Vita. There was also account credits and PlayStation Network
7246760	7251560	subscriptions. I haven't seen anything come through, but I could have also sworn
7251560	7256680	that I already got compensated for this. I feel like this has happened already.
7256680	7262760	We were, and this was some type of follow-up. The Sony thing was more of in good faith and not
7262760	7267800	ordered by the court. But there was that class action anyway, which is why a lot of companies
7267800	7274280	have updated their terms of use so that you can't do a class action anymore, if there's any legal
7274280	7282600	standing to that. But I digress. All these claims essentially were filed with the class action,
7282600	7287320	and now this is the official court response. But I guess if you participated in the prior
7287320	7292840	reimbursement, you can't get as many games. I think you'd only get one game as opposed to two
7292840	7295720	or something like that. I don't even care. It's whatever.
7298040	7301800	NintendoManiac64 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7301800	7306840	When Sony got hacked, which time? The 2011 time.
7306840	7314360	No kidding. No kidding. All right. Let's move on to this story about
7314440	7319080	Zelda Wii U. I know a lot of people very excited about that. Who knows if Zelda Wii U will stay
7319080	7323800	on Wii U or if it's going to go to NX as well, although I'm sure it will at least be on Wii U,
7323800	7331880	if nothing else. There was a new interview that Anuma, the producer behind Zelda, did with
7331880	7336920	Famitsu this week. And he mentioned that the development is progressing well and that they
7336920	7341640	are very busy. He says that the game has taken shape and things have gotten easier. This means
7341640	7347000	things are progressing well. I think the base of our secret sauce has always been Ocarina of Time,
7347000	7353560	but this time the change in flavor will be like going from Japanese food to Western style food.
7353560	7358280	Perhaps players will be surprised. Look forward to it because I think we'll be able to make
7358280	7362440	something new like Ocarina of Time was. So it really sounds like they're going to shake up
7362440	7368360	the formula with Zelda, but this isn't completely out of line with, you know, what we are expecting
7368360	7373080	because they've mentioned previously that they're taking more of a Skyrim influence this time and
7373080	7377960	so things are going to be a little different. So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.
7378760	7385720	Nintendo of course has this on the schedule for late 2016 and of course the rumors are out there
7385720	7390920	that it could launch on Nintendo NX side by side, but I think they will have to release on Wii U
7390920	7394600	because they've promised that. But it could be a Twilight Princess type of situation where they
7394600	7401080	actually release on the GameCube and the Wii, so it'll be, you know, the Wii U and the NX.
7401080	7406760	So we'll see. All right, we should have enough time to get in the mailbag. Yes, so Dark Soccer
7406760	7411000	is going to dive into the mailbag and you guys can email us every week over at participate
7411720	7417000	at orangeloungeradio.com. Again, that's participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an
7417000	7423080	email. Dark Soccer is going to dive in head first and read the emails right now. Hi, this first one
7423080	7431400	comes from, well it's unsigned and has no nickname, so I'm just gonna say Sam. Um, it's about Rock Band 4.
7431400	7437240	I just, uh, just wanted to say back when music games were huge, I purchased Guitar Hero 3 for PC.
7437240	7443080	The game was a port done by Aspire and when they added in graphics, and they added in graphics
7443080	7448920	options. The game was a super, was super resource intense, but was gorgeous and ran so much better
7448920	7455240	than the console options. The only thing that sucked was using the Xbox guitars, as that is what
7455240	7461560	you had to do, wired ones at that. Just wanted to point out that sometimes the PC port can be badass,
7461560	7467400	just depending on the port company expertise and love for the platform. Thank you, Sam.
7469480	7477480	And then, hmm? No, that's it. You were lifting your mic. Oh, sorry. Okay. God, this is a long one. Okay.
7478280	7486280	Hello, LR. Hi, YYR. Um, I don't normally do this, but back when the Fig campaign for the PC version
7486280	7492600	of Rock Band 4 went up last week, I was, uh, browsing the site where many of us formally discussed
7492600	7497960	music games and found a post that basically sums up my argument against it. It was made by user
7497960	7504680	GTC and here it is. By the way, thinking, speaking of old music sites, you know what shirt I'm wearing
7504680	7513000	tonight? My DDR spot shirt. That is old school. On top of that, this fit me when I initially got
7513000	7518520	the shirt and now it's like a size too big, so. All right, a little reminder about their Amplitude
7518520	7523400	Kickstarter. No physical rewards are out yet. No updates when they will be sent. The only preview
7523400	7528760	we've had for physical rewards was a teaser clip of the vinyl test print a few days ago.
7528760	7532520	Never released the digital art book that was supposed to launch with the game late December.
7532520	7536440	They never even released the whole soundtrack digitally or even the full campaign soundtrack
7536440	7542440	minus licenses. PS3 version was supposed to launch alongside or damn near to the PS4 release. No word
7542440	7549000	on that still. Campaigns talked about the DLC. Now there are no plans for it. So, F-Harmonics,
7549000	7554760	they're still trying to rebuild Rock Band 4 into something that won't even match Rock Band 3.
7554760	7559640	They haven't fulfilled their previous campaign and now they're coming around again with their
7559640	7567400	handout. Fuck that. All right, moving back to this. Back to my personal opinion, my belief is that
7567400	7572360	it's just plain bad form to start asking for money again before fulfilling the commitments you made
7572360	7576760	to the last time you asked for money. The only positive thing I saw in their sales pitch was the
7576760	7582600	Sumo Digital is supposedly handling the port. They are fantastic, rest assured, and I'm certain that
7582600	7587560	they will do a great job. But the whole thing just feels so disrespectful toward their previous
7587560	7593560	supporters that I can't bring myself to get on board. On last week's show, you discussed
7593560	7599640	Microsoft's announcement of rolling Xbox One hardware upgrades. But expressed skepticism
7599640	7604600	regarding how consumers would receive them. I think there is an easy way to do this that is both
7605400	7610920	easy to understand and consumer friendly. It takes after the way Capcom handled the last two
7610920	7616280	Street Fighter IV upgrades, which were released as both a full retail disc and expensive DLC
7616280	7622440	for Super Street Fighter IV. Microsoft could call the first upgrade Xbox Two. They could sell it
7622440	7628360	both as a new console, which would replace Xbox One at retail, and an upgrade module that would
7628360	7634520	connect to the existing Xbox One, from which could sell for under $200. That makes me think of how
7635720	7645000	the Famicon disc worked or the 64DD for the Nintendo 64. If they have the strategy in mind
7645000	7649720	from the beginning, then they would already have designed the Xbox One to interface with such a
7649720	7656440	module. Games could then be sold as Xbox One games, which would run on both. Xbox Two games would
7656440	7661240	require the better hardware. Or games that would run on both with increased performance for Xbox
7661240	7666840	Two. I would be shocked if in the future, Microsoft encourages developers to create games in the
7666840	7675320	latter category. Right? Yeah. I think that that's an interesting concept. It still makes me think,
7675320	7688440	though, of the Nintendo 64DD or the Famicon disc. There's one paragraph. I didn't know if you were
7688440	7693800	going to make a comment. I figured their vision of the future is one where a guy can walk into
7693800	7699080	the store, buy a game that says Xbox, and run it on his console, regardless of which Xbox he has.
7699880	7704200	But the better his hardware level, the better it will look. Though perhaps we might start thinking
7704200	7708680	of labels like requires Xbox Two or better. What would you think of a future like this?
7708680	7715880	Happy World Championship Xboxing YYR. That's it.
7715880	7721240	All right. Sorry. I missed if there was a question. I got distracted with something
7721880	7724280	else. Is there a question in there?
7724280	7731320	I was talking about, first of all, that Harmonix has their handout asking for stuff
7732280	7739400	when they haven't even fulfilled their previous commitments. So it's very disrespectful to their
7739400	7747400	initial supporters. And then the second was that you have an Xbox One and then an Xbox Two that
7747400	7752840	has a port for an upgrade, like an expansion module or something like the 64DD was,
7753400	7755400	and that you market the games accordingly.
7758200	7762200	You know, and I kind of mentioned last week about the whole fact that Nintendo
7762200	7768360	isn't exactly completely different with the whole the Wii U is kind of an upgraded Wii
7768360	7772440	is kind of an upgraded GameCube. And I think if they went that way with marketing it,
7772440	7778120	it may be less confusing. But at the same time, a lot of people thought that the Wii U was just
7778120	7782440	a Wii upgrade when it was a completely different system. So I think there will still be some
7782440	7788120	confusion out there. But I think there's ways to do it. If Microsoft gives it a very traditional
7788120	7792440	sort of naming convention, there's ways to do it. I just don't know if that necessarily means
7792440	7800760	they should. So anyway. All right, that's that does it for emails tonight. Participate
7800760	7807240	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send an email to us in a future week. In the meantime,
7807240	7814760	let's get to the FUs of the week. Sometimes we get really angry on this show. Why? Because.
7822440	7837800	FU2 ongoing migraines and actually now adding sinus pain on top of it.
7838360	7844440	So now I have like I feel what's the double headache, the sinus headache with my normal
7844440	7850040	migraine. It's not good, but it's time for me to go home anyway. So I will bid everyone adieu.
7850040	7861080	Bye. Well, feel better and we'll see you next week here on the show. Shane, I have no FUs.
7863320	7871000	I don't really have a big FU, just FU2. FU2 really wasting my day yesterday and the rain
7871000	7875640	has been nonstop. And I know we need the rain. We're in a drought state and, you know, we need
7875640	7881480	it. So I shouldn't be complaining about it, but my God, it has been terrible this week. So yeah,
7881480	7888840	that's it. All right. Let's, uh, let's move on with, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys.
7888840	7894360	Then we're going to get to phone calls. So Shane. Um, okay. I guess we have to talk about Blizzard
7894360	7901880	again. There's an expansion coming out for Hearthstone. Uh, it starts, what's it tomorrow?
7902680	7911880	The 14th. Um, it's called Whispers of the Old Gods. You can pre-purchase a 50 pack bundle of
7911880	7924120	cards for $50. You're an idiot if you do that. That's ridiculous. Um, so yeah, go, go, go do
7924120	7931160	that. You'll play this crappy game. You're not a big fan of Hearthstone? It's fine. It's not a
7931160	7941880	bad game really, but I just hate Blizzard cause they fired Xero. It's a bad game for bad people
7941880	7946120	and you should feel bad. I think so. That's correct. You know, some people really enjoy
7946120	7950680	Hearthstone though. Oh, I know. I have a friend that really, really, I have a couple of friends
7950680	7956360	that really enjoy it. I know. I know. You can walk by practically anyone's desk and find them
7956440	7961880	on their lunch playing Hearthstone. And by the way, I forgot to mention next week,
7962600	7966600	um, I will be on my new schedule, so I will be able to stay for the whole show again.
7966600	7975160	Hooray. Hey, bye. All right. Have a good one. All right. Uh, let's get to a story on Final Fantasy
7975160	7982600	15. Yeah. Final Fantasy 15 is supposed to be an emotional experience that will make you cry
7982600	7986840	and hopefully not cry at how horrible it is. No, I'm just kidding. It should be great.
7986840	7992600	But, um, there was a, uh, interview in Game Informer, uh, where, uh, Hajime Tabata,
7992600	7997240	the director behind Final Fantasy 15 said that he wants to give a moving ending due to the time
7997240	8002040	that you will invest or that folks will invest playing the game saying, quote, I want to create
8002040	8007000	a very emotional ending to the game and want to make as many people cry as possible. You're
8007000	8011160	spending so many hours playing the game. So when I finish a game and it ends on a sour note and it
8011160	8017320	doesn't move me, it gets me disappointed. Um, uh, they're taking on the challenge of trying to
8017320	8023240	exceed that title saying Final Fantasy 7 once more, that Final Fantasy 7 is an inspiration,
8023240	8030280	uh, for the game. So there you go. Um, very curious to see, uh, uh, what turns out from this game.
8030280	8035080	Uh, but I would say, you know, 13 had a really good ending. It was short, but I thought...
8035080	8038520	Don't spoil it. I haven't seen it. I won't, I won't, but I'm just saying it's not,
8038600	8044120	it's not like 13 was a bad game by any means. I, I really think it was great actually. So,
8044120	8049880	um, you started talking about that and the whole opera scene from 6 went into my head. Yeah. And
8049880	8059800	that was a better story than, than 8. I love 8. It's the WB, but in video game form. Uh,
8059800	8064680	Nintendo maniac in chat says, how do we know that Final Fantasy 15 isn't just going to be an other
8064680	8071880	M? Don't buy into any hype for anything. No, I suppose anything's possible. So, uh, there you go.
8072600	8078200	Uh, also a rumor that Final Fantasy 15 is going to be releasing in September. And I would think
8078200	8084760	a release for this year makes a lot of sense. Uh, September 30th is the date that is being rumored,
8084760	8090760	uh, corroborated by three independent sources. Uh, there is an event by the way in Los Angeles
8090760	8094920	on March 30th, where I would expect we're going to hear this date and price information,
8094920	8100120	um, September 30th as a launch day makes a lot of sense. It's before the holiday period,
8100120	8104760	but far enough into it where it will still be on many, uh, Christmas and holiday lists. Um,
8104760	8110280	but not like so far out, you know, it will compete with the other holiday stuff. So
8110920	8114840	we'll see what happens. But everybody hopefully at that point will still be too engrossed in
8114840	8123160	Persona 5 to care. We shall see. All right. Uh, let's get to the Skype line. Orange Lounge Radio,
8123160	8128040	all one word on Skype is the place to call. Um, please give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio,
8128040	8134680	all one word on Skype, or you can give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Uh, if you want to do it the old
8134680	8144680	fashioned way, but the Skype line is open now. Um, so, oh, thank heavens the phone is already
8144680	8147720	ringing. Cause usually Loki does last minute stories, but I don't think Shane's prepared
8147720	8153640	for that. I would just play with my, my morpher and it'd be like this. All right. Uh, hi, you're
8153640	8158040	on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Rama. Hey Rama, how you doing? Pretty good,
8158040	8164440	but I have an interesting question for you before we begin. Okay, try me. You listen to
8164440	8173480	mainstream radio? Once in a while, not like all the time. Yeah. I mean, the only time I actually
8173480	8178600	listen to mainstream radio is when I'm hanging out with Mako-chan because there's only one decent
8178600	8183080	rock station in her area that we listen to. And then when we get out of the area for that,
8183080	8186200	we actually pull up the app and continue streaming from there.
8186200	8194680	I, I love that. Um, yeah. And you know, I, I don't get me wrong. Like I do listen mostly
8194680	8200200	to Spotify and podcasts and VOG, especially when there's like live stuff and premiere stuff, but,
8200200	8205560	you know, once in a while I have to stay on task on what's on the radios and so forth. So.
8206440	8212920	I guess, I mean, at work, since we do have like access to groove radio throughout the store,
8212920	8218520	everyone has like a different playlist and I'm not one for mainstream radio and I hear this
8218520	8224280	music. I'm just like, this is what's going for music. And then I just go into the break room,
8224280	8229160	put my headphones on. Am I listening to J-pop or I'm listening to something from the 80s
8229160	8239240	or the 90s, or I'm just like deep into my 3DS. Hmm. Well, I, I apologize that I, uh, I'm sticking
8239240	8246760	with the, uh, uh, terrestrial radio, but whatever. Well, Hey, somebody has to, like I said,
8246760	8251000	in a blue moon, I will do the same thing. Yeah. So what else is on your mind tonight?
8251000	8255640	I just also want to say in regards to the beginning of the show, if Shane is going to go
8255640	8261000	on his video game, uh, drought, he's going to switch over to ranger toys. You, you know, this.
8261000	8265240	What do you mean switch? Yeah. That's naughty. Like that's its own thing. That's never going to
8265320	8271640	go away. That already happened. I spent so much on Jojo already. Like I have all the
8271640	8276920	toys that have come out that are important. And we went to like four targets and two
8276920	8283320	toys or us is today. Yeah. He won't give that up. Okay, fine. He'll increase the budget for it.
8283320	8291480	Yeah, I can see that. Yeah. I'm fine with that. That's great. That just means I can get a cube
8291480	8299320	gorilla when it comes out and a cube rhinos. That works for me. Fair enough. Fair enough.
8300680	8306760	So is that you just called into a taunt chain? Uh, no, no, no. Well that, and it was my turn,
8306760	8311880	but one more thing and I'm going to just, I'm gonna get up on out of here. Now in regards to
8312440	8318280	Twitch, you mentioned earlier, I have noticed that within my circle, there are people who
8318920	8325000	Twitch stream, but they do more than just Twitch stream. They're on there doing commentary with
8326120	8330920	programming that they're watching or they're working on costumes, doing artwork and stuff
8330920	8336600	like that. It's getting to the point where if they stream five days a week, maybe three,
8336600	8341320	four of those days, they'll be Twitch game streaming. And the other day they'll be doing
8341320	8346440	other hobbies and stuff. And I'm like, that kind of sort of defeats the purpose of what
8347080	8353640	Twitch TV is for, but I get it, you know? Well, Twitch TV also kind of expanded not that
8353640	8357960	long ago into the more creative outlets, which is why the Bob Ross thing had happened in the
8357960	8366520	first place. So Twitch wants people to expand more into that and do that. But, you know,
8366520	8370360	it's kind of like one of those, where do you draw the line? Because I can definitely see where
8370360	8375960	costume making, video game talk shows, that's all part of the gaming community,
8375960	8381160	certainly doing the artwork and so forth, but is watching a movie and doing live commentary?
8381160	8388440	Probably not. So, no, I mean, if I really want to watch a movie, do commentary. I can just
8388440	8393720	round up people, my friends on Skype, turn my webcam towards my TV and put something on and
8393720	8401800	we can all have a field day doing it. Yeah. But, you know, that's up to Twitch, I guess,
8401800	8406600	to draw the line. But it's interesting because a lot of this stuff was on Justin TV before,
8406600	8410520	and then they ended up closing that down. But Justin TV also did a lot of life stuff,
8410520	8416200	which was just, hey, here's the webcam pointed at me doing actually nothing. So, I don't know.
8416920	8424760	Point taken. So, yeah, it'll be up to Twitch to draw the line on that stuff. But, you know,
8424760	8429160	if people are having fun and making content that people seem to enjoy, I think that personal stuff
8429160	8435480	makes it more interesting. I don't necessarily like to just watch a game with nothing on it.
8435480	8438920	Ironically, that's what I'll use YouTube for. I think YouTube's almost a little better just
8438920	8444440	getting the plain game streaming, game play stuff, like long play, I guess you would call it. But,
8444520	8448440	you know, if I'm going to watch Twitch and watch somebody doing it live with the chat room and all
8448440	8453000	that stuff, I kind of want to be able to interact with people and get some more of that personality.
8453000	8457000	You know what I mean? Yeah, I get what you're saying. I get what you're saying. Yeah. So,
8457640	8462600	all right. Interesting comment. Kaijuto in chat says Periscope kicks Twitch's ass.
8463240	8468520	You know, I know Periscope is definitely a growing thing for the live video and Facebook badly wants
8468520	8474760	a piece of that too. So, interesting. All right. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?
8475560	8481800	Major Nelson says hi. I saw that on Facebook. He had no idea who we were. Come on.
8482760	8487560	But still, I did say I would try and he did say hello. All right. Well, I appreciate that. He
8487560	8490280	always said that because he had to and he didn't want to look like a jerk, but no, I seriously
8490280	8495000	appreciate that. That's so funny that you did that. Are you kidding me? He was in the break room
8495000	8501240	chilling out with us, having a good time. Okay. Well, that's cool. He's a normal human being. He
8501240	8506200	will relax in the break room sometimes too. Yes. Yes. And next time I'll tell you a Major
8506200	8511880	Nelson story. All right. Sounds good. Awesome. All right. Take care, buddy. You too. Yep. Bye.
8511880	8519160	All right. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to do that the
8519160	8525080	old fashioned way. Um, I don't really have any last minute stories tonight, unfortunately, but
8525080	8530360	oh, good. The phone is going off. So let's get to it. Hello. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's
8530360	8537000	this? Hello. It's Embryon. Hey, what's up? I am calling to say hello. Hello. Good to hear you.
8537000	8545000	Like, what's up? Yeah. So I was thinking about you, uh, this weekend because I found an old book
8545000	8550440	of CDs in my, the trunk of my friend's car. I don't know how they got in there, but they were
8550440	8557400	my book of CDs from like a decade ago. And among those CDs, I had all of these Bimani mixes in
8557400	8563720	addition to these like unmarked MP3 CDs that were hundreds of tracks long. And, uh, I was listening
8563720	8571160	to, one of them had the Erotic Hour Megamix on it. Oh my God. It is everything to this day.
8571160	8579160	I cannot get enough of Erotic. That's, that type of music is why DDR was so fun. Is it brought
8579160	8583960	that stupid cheese ball pop music? I say that in the best possible way. It brought all that stupid
8583960	8588120	cheese ball pop music into my life. And for that, I'm always going to be thankful for DDR.
8588120	8592680	I know, me too. It's just like, it's funny because I remember when I was younger, um,
8592680	8596600	the question that kids like to ask you to suss out if you're cool or not, it's like,
8596600	8601240	what kind of music do you listen to? Or who do you like? And I don't always be like, oh, um,
8601240	8607880	you know, Erotic. Uh, I like, uh, Naoki Yoshida or not Naoki Yoshida. What's his name? Naoki.
8607880	8608360	Midea.
8609080	8611080	Midea. I'm thinking of the Final Fantasy producer.
8611080	8611580	You are.
8612680	8616280	I'm getting my Naoki's mixed up. I'd always come up with these, like these, uh,
8616840	8621240	DDR in-house artists and be like, yeah, that's who I like. And they'd be like,
8621240	8623640	oh, it sounds pretty underground. Cool.
8624600	8628200	Dr. Tsuya in chat says, I think they're still around. I think referring to Erotic.
8628200	8632680	Yeah. There was some video, uh, that they, they did a song called, I think, Murder Me.
8633880	8639080	It was on Facebook. I just saw some random thing. So I think they are back. But of course those,
8639080	8643640	those groups never had the same singers for more than like five years. So, you know,
8643640	8649320	Like, uh, that happened with Etro Anime. They did the opening theme song to Digital Devil Saga,
8649400	8653720	which is where my name is from. And, uh, they put out a second album years later with a different
8653720	8659720	singer and I was like, man, it's just not the same. So Erotic, I guess suffers a similar fate.
8659720	8662040	Suffers? I don't know. I haven't heard the new stuff. So maybe it's great.
8663000	8667080	It's, it's just as silly as the old stuff. At least what I heard.
8667080	8669640	Fritz really, really loves her tits.
8671640	8676280	Man, some of that old school DDR music was so, so good and so silly though.
8676280	8680440	I love how they're all like the same song with a different rap. Well, it's like this,
8680440	8683880	it's almost the same rhythm and everything, but it's just different words.
8685480	8685960	Anyway.
8685960	8691240	Indeed. Actually, I was just going to say, I, I could for, for just, I can play a little clip
8691240	8695320	just for listeners that have no idea what we're talking about, that missed the whole DDR thing.
8695320	8697560	Here, here's, here's a sample of what you're missing. You ready?
8706280	8717160	Like how stupid is that song? Seriously.
8717160	8718600	And they're all like that.
8718600	8719960	They are all like that.
8719960	8722600	But I was totally doing the like head bobbing.
8724040	8727960	I probably still remember the steps on DDR to that song.
8727960	8731160	Oh yeah. Oh my God. Good times.
8731160	8735080	Good times. I would definitely listen. You know what? If we ever go on a road trip someday,
8735080	8738280	we'll have to jam to those CDs.
8738280	8739640	Oh yeah. For sure.
8739640	8740520	For sure.
8740520	8743640	That's it. I just wanted to call in and reminisce a little bit about Erotic,
8743640	8745320	my long forgotten love.
8745320	8748520	No, I appreciate the walk down memory lane. And I think it's a good chance for all the
8748520	8753640	old school DDR fans to just revisit or go listen. If you, if you happen to have them or have access
8753640	8758120	to them, wink, wink, go listen to one of those old dance mania albums. It'll just take you back.
8758120	8759400	Oh, they're so good.
8759400	8761320	Good times. All right. Take care of my friend.
8761320	8761720	You too.
8761720	8762600	Good to hear from you. Bye-bye.
8763080	8763880	Bye.
8763880	8769560	All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8769560	8772920	Dark Tetsuya is hinting a road trip to round one. Hint, hint. You know,
8772920	8777560	I think if I were to bust up that as the soundtrack on a round one road trip,
8777560	8780920	I think Shane may have a problem with that.
8780920	8781400	Yep.
8781400	8782120	So yeah.
8782120	8783160	Definitely.
8783160	8787240	But I'll try. He makes me listen to a lot of weird stuff. Although we usually listen
8787240	8789480	to the FOMMC 14 soundtrack and that's something...
8789480	8790440	It just comes up a lot.
8790520	8794520	We can kind of agree on that one. There's a lot of good stuff on that. Like the Alexander
8794520	8798680	raid song and what was that you're playing today? The Separat song is great.
8798680	8798920	Yes.
8798920	8800760	Like industrial music. It's so good.
8801800	8802360	It is.
8802360	8805080	Like you don't even really need to play that game. The game is fine,
8805080	8810040	but the music is where it's at for Final Fantasy 14. Just get the soundtracks.
8810040	8811720	Sometimes that's actually better than the game.
8812680	8817640	That guy, Soken, does such a good job with the soundtrack. He really does.
8817640	8825640	Yes. I'm guessing that you're doing something, so I'm trying to fill time.
8825640	8829960	No, I was actually trying to find... Here it is. Just so you guys could hear a little bit of it.
8839720	8842200	This is actually battle music in 14.
8845080	8846120	The fight is really fun.
8847640	8865320	You like skip around a bit, don't you?
8865320	8869320	And I'll tell you what, hearing that music when you're actually trying to do a boss fight...
8869640	8870360	You did a good part.
8878440	8880040	Love it. It's so good.
8880040	8885080	It gets you going during one of these boss fights. Especially when you have no idea
8885080	8890360	like what the F is going on in the fight. It's insane. You're just like,
8890360	8891960	Oh my God. Oh my God. It's crazy.
8891960	8893480	I'm going to listen to that as I drive.
8893480	8898440	Let's see. Embryon is actually in our chat room saying,
8898440	8902200	The first time I heard that song, I screamed. Couldn't decide if it was hilarious or super
8902200	8906040	energizing. Why not both? It's not hilarious. It's amazing.
8906040	8910360	It is amazing. It's great. Let's see. Fifth Dream yells,
8910360	8913320	This is what it's like when worlds collide. Yeah, I think we talked about that some time
8913320	8917960	ago that Powerman 5000 took issue with that. Who knew that Powerman 5000 was still around?
8917960	8921320	Who knew? It sounded more like a Nine Inch Nails song to me, but different singer.
8922200	8925400	All right. Well, I guess nobody else is calling in, so that is going to do it for the Skype
8925400	8930120	line tonight. But if you think of something late and you want to chime in later, you can always
8930120	8933560	leave us an email. Participate at orangelandradio.com. You can also tweet at us,
8933560	8936760	twitter.com slash O-L-R. I do read all the tweets you guys send this week.
8937320	8940680	But I believe that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Land Radio.
8940680	8944600	If you like what you heard here at the show, please consider telling a friend or two about
8944600	8950120	the show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we don't
8950120	8956600	know the voice unless you guys actually use them. So send us your emails and so
8956600	8963720	forth. We would really appreciate it. I think that is it. Shane, do you have any
8963720	8966200	final thoughts for our listeners tonight? Thank you for being here and filling in.
8966200	8967560	No problem. I appreciate that.
8968440	8970840	No, I don't have any final thoughts.
8970840	8973800	All right. Well, we'll probably see you again in a few weeks.
8973800	8978120	No, because my schedule also changes at work, so this won't be a thing that will be happening.
8978120	8982280	Oh, no. So we won't see you for a while. Well, nope. Good luck with Ranger Pride.
8982280	8983640	Good riddance. Thank you.
8983640	8989960	What do you mean good riddance? Screw you. I never liked you anyway. All right. That's it.
8989960	8993640	We're done. We'll be back next week. Hopefully, Loki will be back and Dark Soccer will be here
8993640	9000840	as well. And we'll tackle the latest in news as we move on up to SAC Indie Game Arcade in April
9000840	9005400	and lots of other great events coming up. So stay tuned with us here at Orange Land Radio.
9005400	9007480	Thanks. We'll see you again in seven days. Goodbye.
