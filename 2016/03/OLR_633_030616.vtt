This week, Microsoft hints at the homogenization of Xbox and PC gaming. Beyond one operating system to rule them all, it's suggested players may eventually be able to upgrade Xbox hardware over time. This is just one of the stories we're covering tonight, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 633 for this March the 6th of 2016.

00:47.000 --> 00:59.000
My name is Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joined by my co-host here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California. Over there is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
How you doing, Jamie?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm alright.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
And Jamie stopped to get a little food before the show tonight, and you never-

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
A little?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, I know. I was gonna say, you should've-

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Do you want what's left?

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
No, maybe I'll have a bite, because that place is pretty good. She went to a little Chinese place. It's one of those, like, strip malls. It's a strip mall Chinese place.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Like Hong Kong Palace or something?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, like every- well, don't tell all the listeners where I live.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I don't know what that's called. I just made something up.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
That's okay.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
It's, like, got- it's either-

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
And let's be real, that could be any strip mall Chinese restaurant.

01:31.000 --> 01:40.000
There's also, like, always- you always find Golden Palace and, like, Pagoda Inn or all kinds of typically, you know-

01:40.000 --> 01:53.000
There's a place in town. It's not, like, Panda Express. It's, like, Panda- what do they call it? Panda Diner or something. It's, like, it tries to make you think it's Panda Express, but it's really not. It's just kind of funny.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
However, if you see Panda Inn, that is the real restaurant that led to Panda Express.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I remember-

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Because I read their cups.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
It's amazing what you can learn.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
When you're really bored.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Yes, I read an In-N-Out cup once and learned about the Bible.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
If you look to the bottom of the cup.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
But, yeah, I hope you've been having a good week, Dark Soccer. Happy to have you here as always.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Thank you. I'm gonna be having a better week when my schedule changes.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, I know you've been having to cut-

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Very soon.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
You've been having to cut out of the show early some nights just depending on how long we run because of your work schedule, so that'll be nice to have that all for you.

02:30.000 --> 02:39.000
It's, like, between 815 and 830 so that I can go to bed on time, but I took a minor staycation and to take care of-

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
I'll just go ahead and say it. I've been having a migraine that's lasted since the Thursday before this past week.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
That's no fun.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And even low level when they don't hurt so badly. It's still a migraine.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
So, it just comes and goes and waves, so I'm, like, doing blood tests and stupid stuff to figure out what's causing it.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
But I took a minor vacation to see if it was stress.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Uh-huh.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Nope. It's still there.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Ah, bummer.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
That's okay because I went to San Francisco yesterday and it was great.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, awesome.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
I have not taken a trip to San Francisco in far too long. I need to do a day trip.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
I've found that you avoid tolls if you leave by way of the 101.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, yeah, because you can, yeah, go in the freeway and go out the freeway.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Also, people in California don't know how to drive in the rain.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
That is- Oh, my gosh. The rain was crazy yesterday.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
No, it wasn't.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
For California, though.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It was crazy.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
It got a little gusty and I drive a Fiat.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
But, I mean, the only thing that really scared me all about the driving was when my headaches started to come back, like, on the way back.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
So, Becky took over. She went with me.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
But we also did the play with- I don't remember what street we were on. I'll have to look it up.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
But it's one of those super, super high hilly ones. And then it even gives you a warning.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Steep decline.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
And because you cannot see the rest of the road as you're approaching. It's like being on a roller coaster.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
And I was like, ah, we're in a Fiat.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Were you like that scene out of the movie Clueless when they drive on the freeway accidentally?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Alright.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I think I whined.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I gotta say hi to the chat room. I'm, of course, gonna get to Loki in just a minute here. But I have to address the chat room.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
VogueNetwork.com. That's the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
VogueNetwork.com. And our chatters are giving me a little shit for overreacting to the whole name of the Chinese restaurant.

04:35.000 --> 04:48.000
S2100Matt says, wow, Rob lives in every town in the US. Our awesome voice over dude VXJ6V says, hey guy, hey guys, Rob lives close to a subway in Sacramento, USA.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
That is true. I do live near a subway. I also live near a McDonald's. Go figure.

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm gonna say you probably live near like four subways because they're so close together. I personally live next to like probably three or four subways.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
There he is, everybody. Tech master Loki has to comment when we get to food.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Because they're so close together.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
I'm always blown away by how well subways do because there's so many of them.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
It's not. They're the cheapest franchise.

05:15.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah, and I know I've asked this on the show before. I don't understand how subways make money 24 hours a day. Because some subways are open 24 hours a day.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I will point out that you don't live near a Starbucks. Not that near one.

05:28.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't. That's kind of the crazy part. So, and then they're asking in chat, let's see, over at live.vongnover.com, SSG100Matt says, the real question is if he lives near any In-N-Out.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Not really. The Starbucks is probably closer.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah, In-N-Out really kind of spread about.

05:47.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if it's one of those things where it's like I want to have In-N-Out for dinner, like which once in a blue moon.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
I'm like, I want an Albert because I will say this. It is for fast food hamburger. It is really stinking good.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Like it is. We're spoiled being here in California, but you know, anyway, let's see.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
Going to chat. Alan Alchemy says we live near a park and a gas station. All right.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
All right. Enough. Enough talk about addresses and restaurants.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It's a house.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
That's right.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
On a street.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
In a town.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
In the middle of your street, actually.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Rob's house in the middle of the street.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
Anyhow, Techmaster Loki, there he is. And you bought a new toy today, Techmaster Loki.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah, I bought a Gear VR.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
So you've been talking about buying one for a while, but you literally just opened it here in studio.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
You must have went to Best Buy before you came to the show.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I did, and I haven't been there in like apparently a while.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
And I'm like, where the fuck is everything? Like they have all these different kiosks now.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
So many kiosks for different like sections, like differently. They have an Apple thing.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
They have Samsung. They have like Windows and all this stuff.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yet no one to help you.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Where did you go? The one by the mall?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I went by the Citrus Heights one.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
So, and I got the last one that they had because I guess they're doing preorders for the Galaxy S7,

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
which they're giving away free VR headsets for everybody that preorders those.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
Which would be cool if I didn't have a phone, but I do. So I'm not going to preorder a new phone for that.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah. So what do you plan to use it for? Just for fun?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh, no. I'm like, I'm kind of pissed off because I'm not on your Wi-Fi right now.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
And so it's eating up my data, downloading shit I probably don't need.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I would write down the password for you if you just need the password to the Wi-Fi.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, I will. I just got a thing from, you know, ping my phone saying,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
you've used two thirds of your data or three quarters of your data.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
How are you not already on? Oh, you're not in chat. I can't even send you a private message.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
Sorry. Yeah, I'm behind. I was busy trying to figure out how to put everything together.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
You're still arguing like what burger places are best.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And I just decided that it doesn't matter if it's fast food or not.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, honestly, there's not a lot of apps for it, I think.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
So I just want to try out because my Oculus Rift dev kit 2 does not run very well on my laptop.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And I want something that kind of, I would assume that this device is meant for my phone.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
So it should run how it's supposed to run.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
And so I kind of want to see what it's like and maybe develop an app for it or something like that.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
You know, that'd be kind of fun. But right now it's just kind of a toy.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
All right. So I guess, so there's no like must have game or experience on Gear VR.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
No, there isn't. And that's the thing.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
As I was even looking at before I came here, before I bought him, like, you know, looking at,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
so where are the best apps to use on this? And everyone's like, yeah, you can watch Netflix on it.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I'm like, cool, I guess.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says the Gear VR installation does download a lot of data.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So get on the Wi-Fi ASAP, Loki.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I will be there right now.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Set him up with that. Now, did the chat room come to a consensus on the best burger in the States?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
No.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
No.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm personally, I prefer the Red Robin cheeseburger.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I know it's not fast food, but I love their cheeseburgers because they can give it to you.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
The patty's good and you can ask for it. Like, you know, they ask you some pink or no pink.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm like as much pink as fucking possible. Thank you very much.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I voted for Flaming Grill.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't even know if I've been there.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
You'll have to go because Flaming Grill is where I've eaten llama and camel and kangaroo.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
But every time they run out of yak and I want to try yak.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
You know what I miss? Like, well, it's there's still one in Davis if I want to go there, but it used to be Murder Burger.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
And then they changed it to Red Rum Burger because you can't call a place murder even though that is what that's what they do to the cow.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
No, no, you can't. You can't call that because of too many fucking politically correct people.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
What I would have says, we don't like the name of your establishment. I would have said, fuck you. Get out of here.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
You would have murdered them.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I just said, fuck off. I don't need you at my establishment. Thank you very much.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
All right. Let's see. I don't like it still mooing. It needs to be ground up.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It can't move if it's ground up.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
If it's mooing, that's too fresh.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You guys are disgusting.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
All right. Clearly no vegetarians in the studio.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I would like to apologize to the cool guy that I ran into in Berkeley.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
If you're listening live, I'm sorry.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh, Berkeley? Totally a vegetarian then.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I don't know.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
You know, you never know.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
We were at a place that sells all kinds of stuff.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
I bought ginger, sea salt, dark chocolate.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Many, many years ago, this would actually be probably the year before O.L.R. started.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
So that's how long ago it was, right?

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
I used to date a vegan and we would have to go to Berkeley all the time.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I wasn't vegan, but I also didn't cook.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
So if he cooked, I mean, I was always eating really light.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
That was when I was at the height of my DDR stuff, too.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I was never skinnier in my life than those few years.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It's because you were starving.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, a little bit.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Well, no, I wasn't vegan.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
It's just if I would go to his house and he cooks dinner, then, yeah, I'm going to eat vegan that night.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
And I would try anything that he cooked because you're not going to be like, surprise, it's a chicken brain.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Like you knew, OK, it's probably some type of tofu.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Like there's really only so much you can use, right?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
There's actually all kinds of vegetarian meat options now.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Well, you remember when I was raw vegan?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Oh, that's no, too much, too much.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Two months of that.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Too extreme.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
I, the one thing I'll say is that I don't have any digestion problems.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Is that where you can't cook the vegetables? Is that raw vegan?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, or you can't cook them past a certain amount, like you could blanch them.

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
But it was really well, I got really good at making avocado chocolate pudding.

11:57.000 --> 12:06.000
It was actually really good. And I mean, I did really well for a while because I had all kinds of fun stuff that I would make and eat a lot of dehydrated things and nut milk.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
And I made like frozen nut bars and everything with coconut oil and all this. It was really good.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But man, I wanted pizza.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
In all seriousness, being a vegetarian is hard.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I tried it just for like health.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Being a vegetarian now is easy.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
I still think it takes a lot of discipline. I really do.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
But anyway, look, we're not here to talk about food. We're here to talk about video games.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
But we do eat a lot of food when we play video games, let's be real.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
But we want to get into gaming and we'll start off tonight with a kickoff topic.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
And of course, some of the big, big news this week was the Nintendo Direct.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
The Nintendo Direct happened this week, so I thought we'd take a minute to drill down some of the highlights from the Nintendo Direct here for our kickoff topic tonight.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
See what you guys thought about that.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
First off, Project Guard. Do you remember Project Guard, which was one of the Miyamoto projects that was shown?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Yes, I remember that.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
And I think you even said, what the hell happened to those? Are those even going to be a thing?

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Oh, I said, I just don't fucking care about it is what I said.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I said, I don't, it's, don't get me wrong. Miyamoto is fucking awesome.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
If he wants to do these whole projects, I guess I should be supportive in that.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
It's just not something that I was like, oh, I need to fucking buy it because Miyamoto made it. I just don't feel that way.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
And I'm all for Miyamoto or whoever in Nintendo exploring new ideas because Splatoon, amazing new IP.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And I'm so happy that Nintendo went with that. Right.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
So if they want to try new things, cool.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
But, well, I guess it's not really going to be a new IP because Project Guard is now Star Fox Guard.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
So they are going to inject the Star Fox universe into that. And now we're going to be getting that.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
There's also Star Fox Zero.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah, they really shoehorned that shit in there. I mean, it's just, it's so canon.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
It's just like, we just need to tie this to some fucking franchise. Okay, done.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I don't think it's a big deal. I'm okay with it.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
So, yeah. And of course, I mean, here, I'll tell you what, here's what here would have been a better implementation of that.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
And it's I mean, it is a rip off in a sense. Fucking tied into Luigi's mansion.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
You know, Luigi, he's a night guard, you know, at like a mansion.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
And you have to watch out for the ghosts, you know, all of fucking Five Nights at Freddy's.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
It would be a kidsy friendly, you know, Five Nights at Freddy's thing and people eat that shit up.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Why couldn't they do that?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I'll give you props, Loki. That's a cute idea. It really is.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
More Splatoon updates. After all, even though apparently they said they were done updating Splatoon,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
there are going to be some more Splatoon updates.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
But I don't get your hopes too much up because I don't think they're talking about maps or anything more like that.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
It's just more like quality of life improvements.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
There's a patch coming March 8th that's going to have some lesser used abilities improved to make them more desirable.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
There'll be matchmaking and team assignment changes for ranked battles and also new Splatfest elements.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
And then in April, there's going to be tweaks for existing weapons and what they call weapon set recommendations.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
So, I mean, they are making still some changes to Splatoon.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
And I don't think they were ever intending on cutting off Splatoon completely,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
but I think the major changes like maps were done with that.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
But it's nice to hear about changes with Splatoon.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
And then what I thought was really awesome is that Mario Maker getting some more big updates.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
I kind of felt like there was going to still be more to come with Mario Maker,

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
but then when you see this, you're like, OK, wow, this is cool.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
And they're not charging for it, which is, you know, again,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I think it's cool.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
We can give Nintendo shit sometimes, but this is supporting your game done right.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
So on March 9th, you're going to be able to do keys to unlock doors to gate progression in the game.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
So kind of like what you had in Mario 2, which is interesting because Mario 2 is not supported.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
But, yeah, we got that functionality.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
The keys can be hidden or you can put them on enemies.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
So now you have to fight the mandatory boss battles.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
You can't just get past, you know, Bowser on top of Bowser and all the crazy shit people come up with.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
So that's pretty cool.

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
Also, pink coins that you have to find before a level is complete.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
So kind of a little twist on the red coin thing from, what, Yoshi's Island.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I think it was the first time that showed up.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
So now with pink coins, you must find the coins before completing the level.

16:17.000 --> 16:26.000
So this is going to make hell levels even worse because you know some of those coins are going to be in the stupidest places.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
It's just like today where it's like you have a super hard level and you go into it and it's like,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
oh, there's a hidden trap door somewhere.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Hopefully they don't go too crazy with that stuff.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
But I love those ideas for level updates.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
And if they're done well, I think it will be a very exciting thing.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Shimagami Tensei Crossfire Emblem now has a name for the U.S.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And it will be coming out here in the U.S.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
But they're calling it Tokyo Mirage Sessions hashtag FE.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So, hey, at least we're...

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
The reaction I'm seeing for most people is, hey, at least we're getting it.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And that is true. So at least we are getting that.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Some new stuff that was announced.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
A new Paper Mario game is going to be coming out.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
That was part of an earlier rumor set, so it didn't really surprise people.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
But it's still nice to have that confirmed.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
Rhythm Heaven Megamix is going to be coming to the west, which has a lot of people excited as well.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
And I had to send the paramedics to Act Def's house because there was Kirby news.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Big Kirby news.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
There's a brand new Kirby game for the 3DS on June 10th.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Kirby Planet Robobot is coming out.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
And, of course, what better way to celebrate a new Kirby game than with Kirby Amiibo.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
That's right, new Kirby Amiibo on its way out.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
So there's a new Kirby and a new Dedede.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
But then there's also like Waddle Dee and some of the enemies are going to be there as well.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
So that's, you know, especially if you're a big Kirby fan, that's very exciting.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
So, yeah, and that's not it.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
I mean, there's more. I'm not even...

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
I didn't even get into the Bravely Second stuff and Catmancer and all the excitement about that.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
But there was even more stuff in the Nintendo Direct.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
So any thoughts on Nintendo Direct?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Was there anything in there that you thought, hmm, I want to get that?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Paper Mario game looks good.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
It was very RPG heavy, which was interesting.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Really RPG heavy.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
That is not a complaint, people.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I was surprised.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Well, that's how I think the original Paper Mario is.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Where I've never really played...

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
The only Paper Mario game I played was Super Paper Mario and I actually really liked that one.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
No, I mean the Direct in general.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Like the Direct in general was a ton of RPGs.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
Yeah, if you think about like, you know, the Shin Megami Tensei, the Bravely Default.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
There was some Dragon Quest news in there.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
I mean, if you like RPGs, Nintendo is really trying to...

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
I really loved how they're trying to assure the fans.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
Listen, this Metroid game is fucking canon.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Seriously, it is a legit Metroid game.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
We're just telling you it's legit.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
So definitely check it out.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
We totally didn't just shoehorn this shit onto this game.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It is completely legit.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
It seriously is legit as a fucking Star Fox guard game.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
I mean, absolutely 100% legit.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
But Samus is in it.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
So of course it's canon.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
No thanks.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Here's the way I put it.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
I don't have a problem with if they want to try something different.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
But to me, this game, to make like a Marvel comparison,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
they have the Marvel Avengers cartoons and stuff.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
They're pretty... I think it handles the properties well.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It's mature.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
It's something you can get behind that's respectable to the properties.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And then they also have Marvel Superhero Squad,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
which is like fucking retarded fart jokes,

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
goddamn stupid Saturday morning cartoon bullshit.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
That is this of the Metroid universe.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
It's the Marvel Superhero Squad of the Metroid universe.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm not going to go that far until I have a chance to actually get my hands on it.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
But I think the frustration for most people is that

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
when people want a new Metroid game,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
they want either, and I think people would take either one at this point,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
either a new Prime game or a new 2D Metroid,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I think a lot of people really want.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And that's not what we're getting.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And I think that's where a lot of the frustration comes in, honestly.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
I think if they'd announced this alongside a more traditional Metroid game,

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
kind of like we have Star Fox Zero and Star Fox Guard,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I don't think people would be complaining as much.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And I really think that's what it boils down to.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I really think that's why some people are reacting so heavily

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
to the Metroid Federation Force thing,

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
is because it's not the Metroid game people wanted.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a bad game, either.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
So, you know, kind of like you said earlier, Loki,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
you could put a different IP on some things.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
The whole Star Fox Guard could have been Luigi's Mansion.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
You never know what IP, you could have stamped on it.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Kaijuto in chat says, people want Retroid.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Although the indie scene does a pretty good job at giving us a ton of those.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Alex P Carson says, you know what we mean when we say we want a new Metroid game.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Ziba in chat says, the guy was like,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
I've been wanting to make this game for ten plus years.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's nice that he wants to do a side story game,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
but it's not what people want.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
So, you know, and I just, I hope it won't tick people off so much

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
that they won't even try it, because the game might be pretty rad.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
It might suck, it might, but it might also be really rad.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
So, I mean, don't, you know, don't get mad just because

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
it's not the Metroid game you want.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Maybe if this game does well, they'll think about revisiting the Metroid universe.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Who knows, but at the same time, if it doesn't do well,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
then I think people are going to resent it even more

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
that Nintendo went down this path.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
So, I think Nintendo's kind of in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
But we'll see what happens. We will.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Anyway, that's all I really have to say about the Direct.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Dark Saga, I don't know if you saw any of the Direct,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
but is there anything that you've been hearing about?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Like, especially, you know, you like your RPGs.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Is there anything you might check out?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Like the Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
No, I don't like Fire Emblem and I didn't play Shin Megami Tensei.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Bravely Second?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Maybe I haven't finished Bravely First.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm still stuck on Danganronpa. Don't make me think about other games.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Alright, fair enough.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Okay, let's get into it. Speaking of being stuck on certain games,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
that we have been playing this week,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
and then we'll get into the rest of the news from this week.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
What types of games have you been playing this week?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I played a lot of Danganronpa.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Which I just finally got through the first trial.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I haven't had like a whole bunch of time to play,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
even though I've been off of work for a little bit.

22:46.000 --> 22:56.000
But I've also been doing that and doing the PVP on Heroes of Dragon Age off and on.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
I've also been...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
What else did I play?

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, I guess...

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Oh yeah, I picked up Final Fantasy Type 0.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
It went on sale on Steam for a half price.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I haven't played it yet.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
I also deleted like maybe 30 games out of my Steam library

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
that were taking up space that I'm not playing.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
And then I also yelled at Super Hexagon.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
And then cried for a little bit.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Oh, and Neko Atsume.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Although it's not really a game.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
But Danganronpa is as good as everyone always told me it was.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
And I didn't have anything to play it on in the day.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
And now I'm glad I got it on Steam.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
It's totally, totally fun.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
And fucked up.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
And I might have ordered a Monokuma plushie.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
The fandom has begun.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
The fandom has begun.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
All right.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
So screwed up.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
You should see the shirt I ordered today.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
I have to send it to you.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
It's a mismatch.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Actually, I'll show you.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
One of my buddies sent me a picture on text message

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
and told me about this.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
It is a hybrid of Kermit meeting Bayonetta.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
What?

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
It's a shirt called Kerminetta.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
And it's amazing.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
What?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
No.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I'll show you the picture there.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Sorry for...

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
That is so weird.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I know this is horrible radio to be showing a visual in here.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
But just imagine.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
You can only imagine.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
My brain.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Kermit meets Bayonetta.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
And I had to have it.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
So much.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Had to have it.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
All right, Loki, how about your gaming week?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I didn't play a whole ton this week.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
I just played a lot more stuff for Lego Avengers.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
So I'm about 85% done now.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
It's just kind of monotonous.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
But I have most of the characters now.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yay.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
My son's happy.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
That's really all he's doing it for.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Actually, no, he's not happy.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
He's not...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
He's like, did you get more Iron Man suits?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I'm like, I think you have them all already.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I want more.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I'm like, they don't do anything differently.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I get the sense your son really likes Iron Man

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
because I saw the outfit that he was wearing.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, well, that's the only one.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah, he has that in...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, he likes Iron Man.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
That's cool.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Iron Man's cool.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
That's it?

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah, unfortunately, I mean...

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I think that's it.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Yeah, because I didn't play any Fallout

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
because I haven't wanted my game to update yet.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
Because I like cheating the way I was.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So I just haven't gotten around to playing that.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
And I downloaded Broforce and that other Glax Z,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
but I haven't played it yet.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
So, yeah, that's it, unfortunately.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I played those two games both briefly.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
I liked some of the effects in the Galax Z thing

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
with the whole, like, you know, when you pause it,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
it looks like you paused a VCR tape and that whole thing.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
But I didn't play a lot a lot of the games,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
so I can't really talk about it in depth.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
But it was interesting, and I liked some of the stylists.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Yeah.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Stylistic things they did with it.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
All right, so getting into my gaming week.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't talk a lot about this anymore

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
because I kind of was talking about it ad nauseam.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
But I will bring up quickly,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
because today was a big Ingress day,

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
so I just want to mention real quick,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
I was up at 4 in the morning today to go do a big thing

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
where we were going to throw a triangle over the entire city.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
You were going to say Citadel.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Over the Citadel.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
My favorite triangle on the Citadel.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Which, you know, it's funny because at first I was like,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
all right, I'm going to stop talking about Ingress

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
as much on the show because people, you know,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
either you're into it or you're not,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
and it's kind of different than a lot of other video games.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
But then Niantic announced they're going to make Pokemon Go,

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
so it's like, well, now Ingress, you know, what they do there,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
you might see kind of come over to Pokemon Go,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
so I think it's kind of relevant again.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
But anyway, with Ingress, you know,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
for such a simple kind of concept,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
which is the whole fact that you connect these portals together

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
to draw triangles essentially,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
and that is what gets you points for your team

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
depending on the population density inside the field.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So usually the bigger the better for the triangle,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
but the more people you cover,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
the more mind units you capture for your team.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
So to do an effort like this where we triangle the whole town

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
takes a lot of people.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
And so I was just, you know, for obvious reasons,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
because I don't know who's listening to this program,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I can't get into too many of the details,

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
but I can just say it's amazing how the coordination

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
and the dedication for all these people play into this thing.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
And it's so silly in a way because it's like

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
there's no tangible real-life reward for it.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
But I think the best kind of analogy I can make it to

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
is like remember back in the day when World of Warcraft

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
had a 40-man raid in it, Molten Core,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
and then the feeling you get when you beat the boss,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
like everything goes to strategy

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
and you take out a new boss for the first time,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
there's a lot of that exact same type of feeling,

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I feel like, in Ingress,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
when you have to get all those people together

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
to do something like that, and then, you know,

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
we got lucky and everything worked out just the way we wanted it to,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
and it's like, okay, when we made the triangle and covered the town,

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
it's like that is like that same feeling

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
that you conquered this new raid boss.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
So my point is I beat Ingress.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
At least that's what it felt like today.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I don't know. Anyhow.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
SSG100Matt says,

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Cytangent was Ingress a mess at MAGFest?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I wouldn't say it was really a mess,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
but to be honest, I wasn't checking it as much as you think.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
I actually kind of consciously told myself like,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
okay, don't just sit there and pew, pew, pew,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
laser beam all the portals while you're here.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
Hack once or twice a day, and then you're here for a convention.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Have fun with it.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
So that's what I really tried to do with it.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
But Bobby does point out,

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
I have a picture of Sky running around the National Mall to play Ingress.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Now that was different because when we left MAGFest,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
now I was like, I'm at this place.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Lord knows I'm going to be here again.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
I got to get all these uniques.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Hack this one, hack this one, hack this one, hack this one.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
That was me in San Francisco,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
and I actually now own the Conservatory of Flowers.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Congratulations.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Thanks.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Careful.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
The other team might be listening, and they'll know it's your guardian.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Like, I'm going to get back there anytime soon.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Geez.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
All right.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
That's okay.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
No one's touched my top secret home portal.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
All right.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Good, good.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
It's still mine.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
You need to come put some eights on.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
I was, you know, I forgot.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I was in your neighborhood like the other night,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
and I just didn't even think about it.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
We have maybe like, some of ours are like three away from being fully level eight.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Nice.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah, so come help.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
All right, well, Alan and I will take a road trip and do that.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Anyway, enough of that.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
I had to share that story because the feeling I had today was like conquering a raid boss

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
and wow, and I think that's the best way I can put it.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
If Pokemon Go has that type of stuff where you're going to have to coordinate people

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
and get people together to capture Mew or something really rare or something like that,

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
I think, like, you guys, shit's going to get real with Pokemon Go.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
My expectations get higher and higher for Pokemon Go, which probably isn't a good thing.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I need to temper them a little bit.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
Anyhow, other games I played this week that weren't on my phone.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
I played Final Fantasy XIV.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
There I go again with that, but to be fair, there is still that recent patch,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
and there's a lot more to explore.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
I still haven't finished the story, but I did the new.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Technically, it's not a primal fight, but it feels like one.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
It might as well be a primal fight, and the music is so good.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm telling you guys, Soken, who does the music for XIV, is so awesome,

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
and he does so many different styles of music,

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
and this one's industrial, so it's like the song that plays.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
In fact, actually, some of you guys might have seen her on the blogs.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
I guess Powerman 5000 took issue with the song

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
because it sounded a lot like their single from years ago,

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
but to me it sounded more like an old-school Nine Inch Nails song

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
was what the boss fight sounded like, so that was awesome.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
So yeah, I've been playing a lot more of that.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
And then otherwise, not a lot on console,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
although I did get my copy of Twilight Princess HD today.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
I haven't had a chance to play it yet, but I will say the amiibo is gorgeous.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I swear the amiibo get better and better.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
That amiibo is gorgeous. I love the wolf link.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So yeah, there's that amiibo.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
Also, I will say this randomly, I played Pinball FX 2 this week on Steam

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
because there is a Humble Bundle right now

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
where you can get a ton of tables in the Humble Bundle,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
and I was like, eh, why not?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I haven't played Pinball FX in a while,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
but I picked up a bunch of tables through the Humble Bundle

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
and played that on Steam, and that was fun.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
So there you go.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
That was my gaming week.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So moving into housekeeping real fast.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Twitter.com slash OLR.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
We are also on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
And Google Plus, Google.com slash Plus, Orange Lounge Radio.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
There will be no show here in studio April 3rd.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I know that's a very random day to be taking off,

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
but Alan and I are making a very random trip out of town,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
so we will not be here.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Unfortunately, I tried to get a flight

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
that would still have us able to do the show,

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
and it was like $300 more when you consider there's two of us.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
So I was like, all right, I love the show,

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
but do I love the show $300?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
So yeah, we're not going to be back in time outside.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Plus it gives me a little more time on our trip,

32:37.000 --> 32:43.000
so there will be no show on Sunday, April 3rd.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
What's really exciting, though, not long after that.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
See, here's the thing is that, okay, you don't get a show on the 3rd,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
but you will get a lot of us the next weekend

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
because we will have a show on Sunday the 10th,

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
and on Saturday the 9th, SAC Indie Arcade is back.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Remember we did that last year?

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
I'm hoping we can get the folks from SAC IGDA back on the show

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
before the end of the month to talk about it,

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
but SAC IGDA is happening again on April 9th.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
I do not know yet if we will have a live broadcast this year.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
You may remember last year we had some issues with the Wi-Fi,

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
and this year they're looking at doing some video live streaming,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
so we may unfortunately not be able to do that,

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
but we do want to figure out what we can do in some capacity,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
so stay tuned.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
We're still working out those details, and we'll have more for you.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Hopefully we can't.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Live stream is not off the table.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
We may have a way that we can still do it,

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
so if that works out where we feel relatively secure

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
that we're not going to have a ton of dropouts,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
we'll do a live stream on April 9th,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
so more information to come on that.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
So for what it's worth, okay, you lose a well on April 3rd,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
but you're going to have a lot more stuff that weekend,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
which will be very exciting, and more indie games,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
which is always cool, from local people.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And just think, on the 17th,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
we get to see if I really am still hangover resistant.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
April's a busy month.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
I know, because my birthday party, and then my birthday.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah, that's a busy month, April.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I'm just probably going to be drinking so much the night before

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
I'm going to walk in drunk.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Dan will have to drop me off.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
Well, that'll be a fun show guaranteed, so stay tuned for that.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
All right, let's see, over at live.vognetwork.com,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Bobby Blackwell says, new vog videos.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
Maybe if I can get my camera person to come visit and do that,

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
that would be fantastic.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
Let's see, s2100matt also points out April 3rd is wrestling mania.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Oh, well, shit.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
I wouldn't want to go up against that anyway, so what the hell.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
But I'm not going out of town for WrestleMania.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
Where are they even having WrestleMania this year?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
I don't even know.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I'm sure somebody in chat knows anyway.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
BobbyBlackWolf in chat wants also to point out that the vog videos

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
that we talked about briefly last week,

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
we saw some of the videos from MAGFest last week,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
but now they're all up.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
So if you did miss our video coverage of MAGFest,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
just go to vognetwork.com, and it's right there on the front page,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
a little splash.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I think you see a picture of me and YYR.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Just click on that, and you can actually see all the videos from MAGFest.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
So speaking of indie games, we talked to four indie games developers

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
and one charity.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
So check that out over at vognetwork.com

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
if you haven't seen those videos yet.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
All right, I think we're ready to get back into some gaming news.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Let's do it.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
Loki, start us off.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You had to get situated on the Wi-Fi.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
You all good?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Yes, I'm all good.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I was trying to sideload stuff now,

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
because all the cool stuff is sideloaded, of course.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Of course.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
That's how it works.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Anyways, speaking of cool stuff, No Man's Sky,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I've been looking forward to that for a while.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
They finally announced the date that's going to be released,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
which is on June 21st.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
The other thing they announced was the price, which was $60.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
It will be a full-price retail game,

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
and they also are going to have a collector's edition.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
They'll be coming to consoles, including a comic steelbook case

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
and other digital items and a theme for the PlayStation 4.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
And then an epic edition that's $150 limited from I Am 8-Bit,

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
which includes a statue of the ship and that kind of shit.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I don't know. $60 for the game.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
It looks like it could be worth it. I hope it is.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
So, I'm looking forward to it.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I know people are like,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Indie game? $60?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I don't care who makes the game.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
If the content justifies the price, that's really all it comes down to.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Who gives a shit who makes it?

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
I don't understand the argument against the price tag, either.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I mean, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
It's funny, because I sit here and say,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I don't understand the argument against the price tag,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
yet at the same time, just last week, I said,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I'm not paying $60 for Street Fighter V.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
I'm not dropping that money on Street Fighter V this week.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Maybe I'll wait for a little while.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I did the same thing with Mortal Kombat X, too.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
I said, you know there's going to be a best-of-the-year edition.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
It'll be either $60 but come with a lot more,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
or there'll be a cheaper price or something.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
And sure enough, what are we getting?

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
A new Mortal Kombat X is coming out pretty soon.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But as far as No Man's Sky goes,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
as much as I was kind of razzing that game

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
because I didn't understand what the hell the point was,

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
because I kind of felt like they were showing the same trailer for two years,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I understand there's reasons for that,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
that they didn't want to over-hype it

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
and promise things that they couldn't deliver on, which I can respect.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
And I also understand they had that flood that set them back.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
So I'm trying to cut them a little slack here.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
And now that we're starting to learn more about the game

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
and just how vast it's going to be,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I'm like, okay, it really sounds like they're aiming for a game

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
that's going to have hundreds of hours of gameplay

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and not charge you a monthly fee.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
$60 seems reasonable.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
When you look at an indie game like Journey,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
paying $60 for Journey,

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
I still kind of think that would have been worth it, honestly.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Journey is that effing good.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
But Journey is also a game that you can beat in two hours.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
So I don't think there's a lot of people crazy like me

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
that would sit here and say, yeah, $60 for Journey would have been totally...

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Because Journey, at MAGFest,

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
we watch them play it start to finish in about 100 minutes

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
with the live soundtrack, which is an amazing experience.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Look how long this game has been in development

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
and look how vast of a world it is.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
I look at Minecraft, how Minecraft is $30.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
This may be more than that, but I'm hoping to get more time out of it.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I just hope it's not fucking boring.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
I understand procedural generates sometimes can get kind of boring,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
but it looks interesting.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
My interest has peaked.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
There's been $60 games that have not been worth my time.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I don't know. I'm worth it.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Or I think it's worth it.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
ActDeft in chat says, it's all in the eye of the beholder.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
That's true.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
indie has become synonymous with retro-styled or nostalgia bait,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
which generally commands a lower price point.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
If an indie can make a sweeping 50-hour epic,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
then they should be able to charge for it.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Alex P. Carson in chat says,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I gave Journey so much shit at first,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
but then changed my tone real quick.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
I wonder if some of these skeptics may change their tone real quick too,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
if they actually kind of play the game and go,

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
okay, this feels like a game a AAA studio would have made.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
What does that even fucking mean?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I don't know.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
Because, admittedly, I have no idea what the hell I'm saying right now.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Because, you know, look at movies.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
Big budget, dumb, fun movies can be really great.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Like the Marvel universe, right?

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Those are all pretty much AAA budget movies,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
but I think most would agree,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
all the Marvel movies have been pretty effing good,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
and they're a lot of fun, and they're good popcorn flicks, right?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Maybe one or two aside.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
But for the most part,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
everybody's losing their shit over Deadpool,

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
which I still haven't seen.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Guardians of the Galaxy, everybody loved.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
But at the same time, there's also indie movies, right?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
That are made for a lot less money,

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
that also, you know, they still charge you the same price as the theater.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
It's, you know, I don't know.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
So it's like, who says an indie can't make the same game a AAA developer can?

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
It's just, I think what the real difference comes down to is,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
what's an indie game and what's a AAA game?

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
In part, it's just in the eyes of, you know, whoever's making the call.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
I think it depends on the studio that's putting it out, I think,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
which is kind of what it is in movies,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
is that, oh, well, if it's a Warner Brothers or a 20th Century Fox movie,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
then that's a big studio film.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
But if it's a small indie developer,

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
even though most of those indie studios are owned by the big ones,

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
like what, Miramax was just a Disney thing, right?

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Miramax was all those movies back in the day.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
So anyway, this is interesting.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
Let's see, Tiger Claw in chat says,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
No Man's Sky has said to love a lot of planets.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I think that's supposed to be have a lot of planets and such,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
but is it procedurally generated worlds?

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Will they be different enough that you won't start seeing some of the same creatures

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
and planetary environments being recycled?

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Oh, I'm sure that stuff will be recycled.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
But the question is, how much variety will there be?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
How many different combinations are there to make it feel, you know,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
a little different?

41:38.000 --> 41:44.000
And, you know, will there be certain planets that end up being generated

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
in just the right way that they become must-see planets?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Like, doesn't that happen in Minecraft where, like,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
there's probably certain seeds out there where people are like,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
oh, you got to try this seed because it does something really funny?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
But I don't know if you're going to be able to jump to planets like that.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
I think it's just you get randomly dumped into the universe and good luck.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I'm really interested to see how this works out.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
So anyhow, let's move on and talk about Rock Band 4.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
Rock Band 4 going to be potentially launching on the PC,

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
targeting a release in fall of 2016 on Steam.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
The PC version of Rock Band 4 is being, I keep wanting to say Kickstarted,

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
but it's not Kickstarter. It's another website called Fig.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Crowdfunded.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Crowdfunded, thank you.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
It's starting to be that thing where I say Kickstarter,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
like we say we're going to make a Xerox instead of we're going to make a copy, right?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
So got to be careful.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
Anyway, so it's going to be crowdfunded on a site called Fig,

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
although isn't Fig's big thing the whole fact that you're actually an investor?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
So it's not really crowdfunded here.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Yeah, you are an investor.

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
And it also happens to be founded by one of the people at Harmonix, ironically enough.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
But this is also double-finded a game there recently, right?

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
And the Jay and Silent Bob game that we brought up last week was on there too.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
So Fig's got a few of these games.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
But anyway, Rock Band 4, it is being launched on Fig,

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
and they are going to have World Tour campaign mode, freestyle guitar solos,

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
65 songs out of the box, 33 additional songs for backers on Fig,

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
1700 additional playable songs through DLC.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
They're talking about that it's going to support a lot of the different instruments

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
that are already out there through adapters and so forth.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
$1.5 million they have to raise in 35 days.

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
And so far towards their $1.5 million goal in the first five days,

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
they've hit $350,000 about.

43:43.000 --> 43:49.000
So they're 23% of their goal when they're about a seventh of the way through the campaign.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
So, you know, it's pretty good.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
But you tend to make the most of the money at the beginning and at the end.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
So we'll see what happens for them.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Here's the thing.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
I'm going to say it, and I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking it,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
but I got to say it.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
Rock Band 4 doesn't feel finished on consoles.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
And so for me, this is a little early to be asking for this.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
And sorry, I know a lot of you love harmonics dearly.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
I do too.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
But I have to be honest and you all know how I feel about Rock Band 4

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
because the same way a lot of you guys feel is that Rock Band 4 was kind of a step down from Rock Band 3.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
Now I understand and part of the whole like justification they've been talking about this or whatever

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
is that it's not really harmonics doing this port.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Like they're going to be using somebody else to do the port.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Well that's always worked out well.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
That's not really encouraging me, I'm sorry to say.

44:46.000 --> 44:52.000
And that's to get people to realize that harmonics is not shifting resources to work on PC

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
when console is not still done or whatever.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
It's just that these new guys are going to work on it while they continue to work on the console versions.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
And I'm still kind of like, I'm sorry, I'm not convinced.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
I feel like such an asshole, but it's just the reality.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
I feel let down by amplitude and I feel let down by Rock Band 4.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
I don't want to compare them to Konami, but it's like...

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
Don't go to that extreme!

45:22.000 --> 45:32.000
Let's just say harmonics of now is not the harmonics of Rock Band 1 or 2 when that came out.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
It's not the same, it's just not...

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
I don't know, the quality isn't quite there.

45:38.000 --> 45:45.000
They thought that by name alone they would be able to be a success again and it just wasn't happening.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah, and bonds006 in chat says, Rob is like, sorry, not sorry.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
My honest feeling, I'm allowed to have feelings.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, hey at least Rock Band 4 is better than Rock Revolution, come on now.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
Yeah, that's a good point. The Konami thing was way harsh, Loki. Very, very harsh.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
No, Rock Revolution was shit. That was absolute shit.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
Especially coming from a company that did develop their own music games. Come on.

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
Again, just blows my mind. You could have just, I don't know, given us Guitar Freaks.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
Exactly, they could have just put out Guitar Freaks and put some US songs in there as well and done.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
We're beating a horse that's been dead for like ten years.

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
We need to stop, but it's just the struggle of the music gaming fan for years and years and years.

46:34.000 --> 46:46.000
But anyway, with this harmonic saying, look, I have a problem saying, sure I'm going to give you money to sit on for a long time while you make Rock Band 4 PC.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
I just have a problem doing that when I don't believe Rock Band 4 was the game we were promised.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
And so, no, I'm not going to give you money to continue it on PC.

46:56.000 --> 47:02.000
And you can talk about this whole thing where it's like, but the developers are going to be different people and so forth all you want.

47:02.000 --> 47:08.000
I'm sorry, I'm not investing more money in this game until we were given the game we were promised.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
And that would be a game that was better than Rock Band 3, which it's not. Sorry. Not sorry.

47:15.000 --> 47:22.000
Anyhow, all right, we need to change the topic, Dark Sakura. We need we need puppies and sunshine and rainbows. Can you deliver?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Nope.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Damn it.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
I can deliver some ass hattery.

47:28.000 --> 47:35.000
So basically, and we had even talked about this before about developers paying for reviews, right?

47:35.000 --> 47:50.000
Well, a group called PC Games N did a big investigation on some people who are using Fiverr.com to sell Steam reviews to developers.

47:50.000 --> 48:00.000
And they said they found they basically were looking for anything that had more than two positive reviews from Fiverr.com reviewers.

48:00.000 --> 48:09.000
And the two that they've discounted because they're already really popular were Super Hexagon and Counter Strike Global Offensive.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
But more, there's actually a list of games that fall into those.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
So if you look at the reviews, consider the source.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
But you ready for this list?

48:19.000 --> 48:28.000
We have Advert City, Apocalypse Hotel, A ReWorld, Blood of Magic, Cat Simulator, which now I just want to look for that by name alone.

48:28.000 --> 48:38.000
Sentari Sector, D3D Gear, Egyptian Senate, Epic Character Generator, Epic Showdown, Garfield Kart.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
That just sounds not good.

48:40.000 --> 48:51.000
Gods vs. Humans, Home Design 3D, Hospital Manager, Moto Racer Collection, Nostradamus The Last Prophecy, Prehistoric with a K, and Ship Lord.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
So I'm going to be honest, most of these are games I've never heard of.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
I've heard of Cat Simulator. It's garbage.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
So, I'm sorry, I think I missed a portion.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
So they were able to prove that these games had two or more reviews that came from the Fiverr source?

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
Yeah, and basically they even went and contacted the reviewers. Like, yeah, we were paid to do it.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
Well, I kind of think legally they have to say that, don't they?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Wasn't there a whole, didn't, like...

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
But they didn't say it in the reviews.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Of course they did.

49:23.000 --> 49:28.000
They were contracted, sorry, contacted by the PC Games N.

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
It's not so much official, it's just a Steam review. It's not like, it's supposed to be like a personal review.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
But the better numbers you can look by rating.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah, yeah, and I kind of see that end of it, especially when I just confessed.

49:41.000 --> 49:48.000
I don't know any of these games, except the Cat Simulator, because inevitably the gaming blogs were like, LOL cats.

49:48.000 --> 49:58.000
But for these games, I've not heard of them, so this whole thing was to bust up the rating so that, you know, you would see it there.

49:58.000 --> 50:04.000
And it's, I don't know, like, that would be, I guess, similar to if I went on Fiverr and said,

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
if you rate OLR five stars on iTunes, I'll give you five bucks.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
Which, I don't have that kind of money for the types of reviews we would need to be up there.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
Those are the companies, but I don't know, I just feel weird about it.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
A five star review means so much more when it's genuine. Does that make sense?

50:20.000 --> 50:27.000
Like, when somebody wrote one because they wanted to, it's like, I don't know, I just, I wouldn't do that.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
Okay, so here's what it was, is that basically the person did a quote, undercover thing.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Because I'm checking out their article more in depth.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.000
The person says, hi, hope you're well, I'm interested in having you review a Steam game for me.

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
Could you fire over a few previous examples of your work? I have a Steam code, blah, blah, blah.

50:44.000 --> 50:50.000
So, the person sends back 20 different games that they've reviewed for previous work.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
And then all of them were for pay.

50:56.000 --> 51:03.000
There's probably sites out there that will offer to write positive reviews on Steam for a set amount of money.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
For five bucks a pop.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Yeah, well, Amazon had a huge issue with this.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
I thought I heard something recently that Amazon actually, like, sued some of these companies.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
I don't know if it was the reviewers or the companies that would pay the reviewers.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
I apologize, I didn't read up on it beforehand, but I just remember hearing something about that with Amazon.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
Here's the other thing, thanks for sending over the samples, would a review be possible?

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
The reply was, it's unspoken, but yes.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Huh. Interesting.

51:30.000 --> 51:37.000
Well, I mean, that just goes to show, you gotta question some of those reviews, unfortunately, on Steam.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
And one person said that he would do an honest review of the 13 that he contacted.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
All right. Well, let's move on. More news. Loki.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
All right, cool.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah, and like I said, that cat singularium, terrible.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
And I'm sure a lot of the, I can't speak with the rest of them, but I'm sure the rest are not very good.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
Anyways, Microsoft, I don't know what they're doing, to be honest.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
I mean, their new stance is that they may be introducing modular hardware and different add-ons,

52:08.000 --> 52:17.000
basically saying that they're gonna come out with new hardware capabilities during a generation,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
allowing the same games to run backwards and forwards compatible,

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
and they're gonna have the Universal Windows applications running on top of the Universal Windows platform.

52:26.000 --> 52:34.000
And I'm not really sure what exactly that means, and to be honest, I don't know.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
It just seems like fragmentation's gonna happen with that.

52:37.000 --> 52:47.000
I don't know how you can do that on a console platform where you have hardware that runs better than the current hardware you have.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
Is it just not gonna run with as many bells and whistles as the other stuff?

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
It just seems kind of weird that they would do that.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
Although Microsoft is one to include a lot of add-ons for their systems,

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
hence the HD DVD player and all the other crap that they add to it.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
So I just don't know.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
I like the idea of adding, if you want to upgrade my hard drive,

53:13.000 --> 53:19.000
Microsoft haven't really allowed us to do that, except for your proprietary shit.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Sure, yeah, that makes sense.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
That's kind of cool.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
I wouldn't even be cool with upgrading RAM and stuff like that,

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
but then again, once again, you have the fragmentation problem with that.

53:29.000 --> 53:37.000
It's gonna get complicated now as a consumer because you have an Xbox One or whatever it may be,

53:37.000 --> 53:45.000
and now you should never be at a point in a retail location where you go,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
well, is this gonna run on my game system?

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
Yeah, that's the whole reason we get consoles is so that we don't have to ask that question.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
So that is very strange.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
And I guess if you think about it, we have been kind of in that position a few times already,

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
like with Nintendo 64 having the RAM cart in there.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
It's like, oh, this doesn't run without that.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Or the whole, I didn't even get into this in the kickoff topic,

54:09.000 --> 54:14.000
but the whole Super Nintendo games are only playable on the new 3DS that came out of Nintendo's Direct,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
which kind of...

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I think that that's stupid.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
I think that they should just open it up and have some games,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
sorry, these games are too processor intensive.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
They can only run on the new 3DS.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
The rest of these, we'll offer them to you.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
If it runs fine on the system, I don't see why they locked it out.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
I know why they're locking out because they can sell some more fucking systems.

54:33.000 --> 54:38.000
Well, I got into some Twitter discussions about this because it blew my mind.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
I was like, wait a minute, I have the Game Boy Advance Ambassador games.

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
So you're telling me Mario Kart on GBA is more intensive than Mario Kart on Super Nintendo?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
That just blew my mind.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
But some people were trying to tell me the technical lens of things,

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
so I'm like, okay, whatever.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
I guess there's just more to it that my feeble mind doesn't understand or whatever.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
But I just wasn't understanding why can it do Game Boy Advance games but not Super Nintendo games.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
But it sounds like a lot of those Game Boy Advance games,

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
they really had to tailor it one at a time to make them work.

55:09.000 --> 55:16.000
But then I'm like, okay, if they're not doing that now for virtual console games that they release,

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
where they're tailoring them one at a time, then they're coming out too fucking slow.

55:21.000 --> 55:28.000
Virtual console, I'm starting to hit my over it point with it.

55:28.000 --> 55:35.000
I only really get excited about virtual console now when it's big things we've never seen, like Earthbound.

55:35.000 --> 55:43.000
Or if they were to say, we're going to put out Second Detsetsu 3, an English version, on virtual console,

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
I'd be like, fuck yes, I'm rubbing my wallet on the screen right now, where's my game?

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
Some of those types of things where it's like, okay, these long lost things we're finally going to bring out,

55:51.000 --> 55:59.000
I am so about that. But do I need pilot wings on my DS when I already had it on the Wii and the Wii U?

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
Nah. What are they doing? What's going to make it worth it?

56:05.000 --> 56:12.000
I'm going to need a little something more at a virtual console to justify to buy that thing again.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Does that make sense?

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
No, that makes sense.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
I need online play. I need leaderboards. I need something.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
Now, to be fair, maybe we're going to see that in NX.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
And you might see a little clue about that.

56:25.000 --> 56:33.000
And again, the last virtual console thing that I think was kind of exciting was the fact that Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow,

56:33.000 --> 56:41.000
in its virtual console release, will use the Pokemon Bank to let you move those Pokemon to Sun and Moon.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
There you go. That is exciting virtual console news.

56:45.000 --> 56:52.000
To me, that news? More exciting than the Super Nintendo games on 3DS.

56:52.000 --> 56:59.000
I realize some of you that have the big commutes and rely more on portable gaming are totally going to disagree with me, and that's cool.

56:59.000 --> 57:05.000
Here's my thing. I was just confirming this because I thought I could do this before.

57:05.000 --> 57:14.000
Mario Kart emulated perfectly on a PSP. Are you saying that the 3DS is not more powerful than a PSP?

57:14.000 --> 57:22.000
I mean, that's what I'm saying. Isn't that hardware much newer and should be running much more smoothly, I would think.

57:22.000 --> 57:29.000
And you can't run that? Hell, I just don't get it. I don't get how that's possible.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
Looking at some comments through chat over at live.vognoteboard.com, AlphaKnanogram says,

57:33.000 --> 57:40.000
The Game Boy Advance Ambassador games turned off all the 3DS features like StreetPass. I'm okay with that.

57:40.000 --> 57:51.000
And here's the other thing, too. I understand. Let's say, hypothetically, Nintendo's tried and they can't get an emulator to run the game just fine.

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
I bet you, you can get one of these people that make the fucking homebrew emulators if you gave them full access to the fucking...

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
Because they're doing this in emulation mode with the Nintendo DS and that type of shit.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
If you give them full access to the 3DS hardware as far as being able to use the full processor power and everything,

58:08.000 --> 58:13.000
I bet you can get a fucking emulator running that would run all those games. You just don't want to do that.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
You don't want to spend the time and effort to do that because you're just not going to make up enough money in the end.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
I guess you would make up quite a bit of money since you're fucking selling the games every fucking platform that you put it out on.

58:24.000 --> 58:30.000
Here's the thing, and I'm going to end it with it because we got way apart from the original story about Microsoft,

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
but I guess these stories aren't as far apart as they might seem.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
But my whole thing with the Nintendo games is that...

58:40.000 --> 58:48.000
Am I getting mad about it just to get mad? Because would I really be buying these games again on the 3DS? No.

58:48.000 --> 58:57.000
So it really just boils down to this thing of, eh, I don't care. I don't get it, but okay, they can't do it, whatever. Am I going to get mad about it? No.

58:57.000 --> 59:04.000
Because I was not going to buy Pilotwings or even Earthbound yet again on the 3DS. I wasn't going to do it.

59:04.000 --> 59:12.000
Here's my thing. I think it's not necessarily because it's locked to that one system or that I have to rebuy them.

59:12.000 --> 59:20.000
It's just that, come on, we're in 2016 and you still have to figure out a way to have cross-platform buys on your fucking platform?

59:20.000 --> 59:27.000
I mean, you haven't figured that out yet? Something that has been available on the PlayStation 3 for years now?

59:27.000 --> 59:38.000
I mean, on the Xbox? I mean, come on Nintendo, shit, man. This is fucking standard shit you should have on your platform.

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
Let me take this back to the Xbox story for a minute here, because we were talking about the whole modular Xbox and all this.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
And we were talking about this a little bit with Bobby on his show at the end of the show.

59:48.000 --> 59:56.000
And I mentioned, well, doesn't Nintendo kind of do the modular thing too? They're just way better about how they do it?

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
No, they're not.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I disagree, but how often do we sit here and go, haha, the Wii is just two Gamecubes stuck together.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I mean, in a way, it was a modular upgrade, but it brought the whole motion control thing.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
That was a little different, the fact that the motion control in Wii Sports was revolutionary and all that.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000
And then the Wii U is kind of like, oh, and you've even heard this expression before, it's a souped up Wii.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It's a Wii with a little more infinite, and now it's the tablet thing.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So I kind of would argue that Nintendo does the modular thing already, and they do it very well.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I wouldn't say no. I wouldn't even compare the Wii. Let's look at the DS, the 3DS, the DSi.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
That is the fucking modular bullshit, because those were updates that were necessary.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I mean, the 3DS, I understand the gimmick was, hey, it's 3D graphics and stuff, and that was pretty cool.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And then they're like, ah, fuck it, we're just, eh, 3D, no one wants to see that, you know, whatever, we're just not going to support it very well.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But the DSi was not fucking necessary, but they did it anyways because there's certain games that only run on the DSi and that kind of stuff, which is stupid.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And trying to explain that the consumers was dumb.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And the 3DS, yeah, the same thing now with the new 3DS, which that stupid little thumb-nub thing, which is fucking terrible, but whatever, they put it out.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And it runs games slightly better, I guess. I don't really see a justification to it, especially when they're like, oh yeah, we have a new platform coming out.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It's like, well, you can't just announce something or put something out and announce, oh, we've got something else coming out too.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I understand they kind of do that in the mobile space and stuff like that with phones, and is that what Microsoft's trying to do?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Are they trying to fucking new Xbox One? I mean, that's going to be stupid.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Damn, you stole the point I was just about to make because I was going to say, you know, at the same time, to be fair to Microsoft, aren't we all used to this in the mobile space?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And it doesn't matter if you're Apple or Android or whatever, but generally, I'll use Apple because their naming conventions are very easy.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000
You know, there's iPhone 4, and then there was the iPhone 4s? 4 with a letter after it.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
4s.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
4s, thank you. And then there was a 5, and then there was the 5s.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And so, you know, for me, I'm like, okay, I don't need the new one every year.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I'll get the, you know, my cell phone's on a two-year, so I'll get the 4 and then skip it, get the 5, which I think is what most people do.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And even if you're on Android, you do something similar over there, right?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
So I'm kind of like, you know, in a way, we're kind of used to that.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Whereas some techie people, you know what, they will get the 4 and the 4s and the 5 and shell out that, you know, extra money to offset the subsidy and so forth,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
or sell it on the third market or whatever they do, to get the newest one every year.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And some people will do that. I don't.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That makes sense, I guess, if they're making a, you know, making profit off of each one of those devices that they're selling.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Although Microsoft, and I think this goes the same for most consoles, they're selling those at a loss.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
So to do that doesn't make any goddamn sense.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But, I mean, what would be the point of that?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I mean, because you're, are we really utilizing the hardware fully to the, I mean, can we not do, is there something that we're not able to do because of that?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I mean, what exactly is the point of upgrading the hardware right now?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Oh, have we hit the cap of what you can do on the Xbox One?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Is this because, like, they were fucking lagging behind, like, multi-platform stuff?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Like, games on the PlayStation 4 run better than they do on the Xbox One, is that the problem?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Is that why we're doing this now?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I just don't understand, what is the point?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Show me why we're doing this.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Because that's the other thing, is you're going to have to sell people on, you need this upgrade because of this.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Because HoloLens won't work without it.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Just kidding, I'm kidding.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Alright.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I mean, that's the reasoning.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Justify your reasoning, that's all I'm saying.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I have a feeling this conversation will continue, perhaps after E3, or perhaps the email we're going to get this week, but we'll see.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
We're going to move on, though, for time. I've got to move on to the next story.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Oh, I was going to also say that they're continuing on backwards compatibility as well.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That's going to be a focus for them.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Good.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Which I think is great.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I enjoy opening up my Xbox One, then I go into my library, and then, like, oh, a random-ass arcade game I bought ten years ago is coming up in my library.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Yeah, I think that's fucking amazing.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's cool.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Sony, hello?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Fucking dude, I've got a ton of fucking games on PlayStation 3.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I would love to be able to do this without fucking PlayStation Now.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Loki had kicked every other gaming company and then realized he left Sony out.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I mean, seriously, it's...

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I got some for you too, asshole.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It is so fucking stupid.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Like, I'm, like, seriously, like, I got an email today because of that stupid class action lawsuit thing.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Because before I was like, I don't really want any more games because I've already gotten these from the last time they settled, but I'll take some more free games, whatever.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Like, sorry, you can't have any more PlayStation Plus time, but you can purchase one of these games.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I'm like, but then that means I have to hook up my PlayStation 3 to play this. I don't want to do that.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Loki, you've, in the scope of one news story, you have managed to hate on everybody. You've managed to do it.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And fuck Konami.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I have a feeling Dark Soccer is just sitting over there going, I can't. I'm just...

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I'm taking a Neko Atsume quiz. I just stopped paying attention.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So, yeah, so I'm right. You can't. You can't. You're like, ah, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, how about cat butts?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Cat butts. Cat butts are the best butts.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I just kind of was like, the kitties.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Loki is all like, and Sega, don't think because you don't have a console, I don't have words for you too.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Seriously, what are you doing with Sonic? I mean, come on. That's just stupid.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Hey, Loki, you gonna check out Mario and Sonic Go to Rio? 2016 games?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Alright, no, no, no, no, seriously, stop, stop. No, I'm not saying... I think, honestly, they should do something.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
The team up with Mario and Sonic is not a bad thing. I just think they should do something more than just...

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
If you want your Sonic franchise to do well, I think that's what you can do.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Team up with Mario in like a fucking RPG or something like that. That would be more, you know, beneficial, I think.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Or fuck, have Sonic and Mario Kart or something like that.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I got four words that can piss anyone off at Sega instantly. You ready? Four words.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Fantasy Star Online 2. Thank you. Done.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Alright, moving on. Let's get to a story about Nintendo.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But this one, Loki, I don't think can hate on this. It is a rumor, so we don't even know if this is true.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And it has to do with the game Beyond Good and Evil 2. Like, where did Beyond Good and Evil 2 go?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It was shown one year and then it disappeared and then the rumor was, eh, they're still kind of working on it.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Ubisoft does say the project has not been canned. But a rumor has just piped up that Nintendo may have pulled a Bayonetta 2

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
and gotten Beyond Good and Evil 2 as an NX exclusive in 2017.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Now, the source, because, you know, I could just, you know, literally write words down on a piece of paper and go,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
look at this rumor that just arrived on my desk.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.000
So, where they're trying to put a little stock in this rumor is that this comes from a dual pixels writer

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.000
who had recently published the NX hardware rumors that also, from the same guy that leaked Pokemon forms

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and the Illumeroom project and all this stuff. So, it comes from that same library is that this is what's happened to this.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
So, get your salt lick and your tinfoil hats and, you know, take that with this.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But this could be a very interesting turn of events, especially when, do we know how well Bayonetta 2 ended up doing?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I get the sense it didn't do that great, which is a tragedy because that game is outstanding.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But I think there were just so many people that were like, hmm, Bayonetta's not on Sony or Microsoft, Nintendo can suck it.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I don't know. Or maybe it just wasn't enough to pull that sort of audience over to Nintendo's platform

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
for those that still see Nintendo as a kiddie console or whatever.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But maybe Bayonetta 2 did better than I think.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
No, I'm checking.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I have this weird feeling it didn't.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Let's see. Damn you. I have to wait five seconds.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But the NX is going to be another story, hopefully.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
You know, I think the Wii U made its biggest mistake with the launch lineup.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Apparently, globally, they said it sold just under one million units.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
So, and that's as of February 20th, or not February, yeah, February 20th.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And then North America, looks like 550,000.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Okay, that's not a bomb, but it's not like...

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
It's not great.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Run and make number three, yeah.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Which is kind of sad that half a million is okay.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Well, to give you a comparison of what 5.5 million, or not 5.5, 0.55 million, what that means.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.000
For example, Disney Infinity sold 0.57 million, the original Disney Infinity.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Let's see here, and how about for Nintendo.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Let's see, a Nintendo first party game.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Wonderful 101 was 390,000.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Huh. Yeah, but Wonderful 101, I don't think they were, like, really didn't...

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Yeah, I'm not surprised that Bayonetta sold better than 101.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
It sold slightly better than Lego Jurassic World.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Wow. Okay.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I think it's just the platform. It's just very limited, like, with who has it.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Well, but NX is a way to kind of hit the reset button, lol.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It's kind of a way to do that, so, I mean, we'll see what happens.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Especially considering, you know, if this is an Ubisoft title coming over, it's kind of a big deal.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And I know we had joked about that, you know, they say Nintendo is in bed with one of the companies out there for NX,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and we kind of just assumed it was Square Enix through deduction, but maybe it's Ubisoft.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Hmm.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Zynga. It's totally Zynga.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I don't know, did you hear Zynga is selling that infamous Sega building?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
They're leaving that building.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Yeah. Anyway, speaking of Sega.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Alright, anyhow, I will be very interested to see if that happens.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I would like to see Nintendo be able to really prove these solid third party partnerships,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
and this seems to be a really good way to do it, but we'll see. We'll see what develops.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Moving on, Dark Sakura, please tell me you have some good news.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
We need some good news that we can all celebrate.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Yes.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Yay! What are you going to talk about?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Well, MAME was always free and always available, but now it's actually available under an OSI compliance, an FSF approved license.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So, meaning that they, before they had a choice of three that people could code with, and now it's fully open.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So, yay, MAME.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
MAME, of course, being the very popular-

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Multi-arcade machine emulator.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Thank you very much. Which, you know, questionable legalities, shifty eyes, for some stuff.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
But for other stuff, I mean, some of the classic 80s games, I've heard some of those developers say,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I like MAME because it allows these games to live on when the cabinets are long since dead.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And some of those original authors have released their programs into the public domain, essentially, to kind of live on.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
So, I think MAME has done a lot of great stuff for gaming in that regard.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So, that's cool that, you know, it's a little more open now and everybody can kind of jump in there and use it.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Is the source still open? I know it used to be.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
The source is open.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I was surprised that they had a little footnote on there that, I'm sorry, the name is trademarked, though.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
So, you gotta, you know, get permission to use the name.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Which, I'm surprised that they were able to trademark that.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Sure, well, anything can have a trademark on it, really.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Yeah, I understand that, but I thought that was one of the things, like, there was in there a big, like, thing, you know,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
if everyone was in a big huff about, oh my god, someone's trying to trademark MAME, you know?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And then, here it's been done. I guess they just kind of slipped it under the radar there.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Is it only for certain things, though?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I don't know.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Because sometimes they do trademarks, but it's only for certain things, anyway.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Moving on. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are coming to a living room near you soon.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Loki, starting in the US.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000
So, this week we've got The Division coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And also the Hitman, the new Hitman game.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
They've got, you know, a few different ways you can purchase the first intro pack or whatever.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Because, remember, it's episodic now. Thank you, Square Enix.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
That's gonna be coming out if you want the first episode for $14.99.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Otherwise, the full experience would be $60.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And, of course, the full experience, meaning that they'll eventually release those experiences later on.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Let's see.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And then, also this week...

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Actually, I think that was it.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Nope, that is it.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
So, that's those two games. Pretty light week.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Pretty light week.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Japan, I think it's a pretty light week over there as well.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Batman Arkham Knight Special Edition releases on PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Also, Summon Knight 6 Lost Borders comes out from Bandai Namco this week in Japan.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And Tom Clancy's The Division gets its Japanese release on March the 10th.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
So, those are all out this week on PlayStation 4.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I believe the Wii U...

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Yeah, the Zelda Twilight Princess HD thing we just got here will also be in Japan this week on March the 10th.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So, that's pretty cool.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And then going to the Vita, because we still have a lot of Vita stuff in Japan.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
We also have Summon Knight 6 Lost Borders is out over there as well.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Kinero no Korda 4 is out in Japan in a regular Platinum and Treasure box,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
because, you know, we love those collector's editions over in Japan.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Those are all out on March the 10th.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Also, Luminous Arc Infinity Complete Pack comes out as well on the Vita this week.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And then on the 3DS this week,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Metarot Girls, I don't know if that's Metarot or Metaro Girls,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Mission, Kabuto version, and Kuwagata version come out this week.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
On the 3DS, there's your Japanese releases.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Wow, a few things, actually.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
On the 8th, we have the Culling, the PC...

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Wait, the PC.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I meant the Culling on PC.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
The Division on everything else.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
On the 6th, we have Tesla Grad on Xbox One on the 9th.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
On the 10th, Death Smiles for PC, which I have the Xbox 360 version of.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
That's pretty fun.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
The Guest.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And then on the 11th, we have Hitman.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
We have Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Samurai Warriors 4 Empires.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Revolution, the 25th Anniversary Collection.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And WWE 2K16.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
So there you go.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And then the classic game of the week.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
But first, Loki.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000
So E3's got two more publishers that are not going to be there.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
So Disney is not going to be there.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And I think the main reason for that is that they don't have another game coming out this year.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
They were not going to release Disney Infinity 4.0.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
They've just got more 3.0 content.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So they're going to be doing other shows or events throughout the year in other locations.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And then of course, also, I was going to say, Wargaming is not going to be there as well.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:20.000
So both of those companies are not at E3.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I don't think they're normally there in a large presence anyways.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Because Disney, they've kind of narrowed it down to putting out one game a year.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
But they do have other things coming out for Disney Infinity 3.0.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
There's three more character packs.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And I want to say a Marvel Battlegrounds thing that's going to be coming out pretty soon.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I think in the next couple months.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
So that'll be something to look forward to.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
My son keeps bugging me to get him the Hulkbuster armor.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I'm like, you hardly play Disney Infinity.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I'm not going to buy you anymore figures.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
But the Ant-Man one looks pretty cool, so I may have to get that.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Very interesting, all these companies that are just deciding to skip E3 this year.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I mean, that's now four, three big companies in one kind of big one.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Yeah, well Activision, they're going to be at E3, but they're not going to have a booth.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
So they're going to be there for meetings.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And they're doing their thing, I think, wasn't it across the street or something like that?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
That's EA.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
That's EA, I'm sorry.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I can't keep track of all these different companies, not at E3, but slightly at E3.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
So EA is doing the thing across the street.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Activision is something.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
They're like, hey, we got Call of Duty.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And to be honest, even though they're not going to be E3, I'm sure they'll have Call of Duty.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It'll be a part of either Microsoft or Sony's presentation.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
It always fucking is.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I'm really interested to see what E3 looks like this year.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I mean, I'm not going to be going to see firsthand, but I'm very curious to see how the dynamic of this E3 might be different.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I have a really interesting feeling it's going to be a different show this year.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.000
But, I mean, as much as you can say, oh, doom, gloom for E3 and all that stuff,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Nintendo is inevitably going to be putting out a new console.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And that's going to be a huge draw at E3 this year.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
You know the NX, whatever it is, that's going to be the huge line generator must-see thing at E3 this year.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And to be fair, probably one of the only things to line up for because nobody else will have a booth.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I don't know. I'm assuming Microsoft will bring HoloLens again for more people to try.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And who knows what Sony might have under their hat because VR will be out before E3, right?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Or no, we don't know. We'll find out much if we will or not.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Hopefully?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Yeah, we'll find out soon.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Yeah, I want PlayStation VR. I'm kind of holding some funds aside for that.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
So, you know, hopefully that they have good games for it.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Alright, well, you know, since some of us are going to be saving money not going to E3 this year,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
maybe we can start to plan a trip to Japan, especially by the year 2020.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Start saving now.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Why would you want to go to Japan in the year 2020?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Well, I mean, why not, you guys?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I want to go there eventually myself.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:16.000
But here's the deal. Universal Studios Japan has said that they will be spending 40 billion yen on Nintendo attractions.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Remember the deal between Universal and Nintendo?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
This is kind of the next step in that.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
So Universal Studios Japan is going to be spending that money on Nintendo attractions.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
They will be on the left side of the park's main gate.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:35.000
So I'm assuming kind of like how Universal Studios Hollywood just got the Harry Potter Wizarding World thing,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
which Florida's had for a couple years.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Then they just got that at Hollywood.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I'm assuming instead of Harry Potter World in Japan, this is what they're going to get instead of some type of Nintendo thing.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Which, fine by me.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Don't get me wrong, I like Harry Potter, but I really like Nintendo.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So this will be exciting.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:01.000
The plan is to have the work done by 2020 in time for the Summer Olympics, which are also in Japan in the year 2020.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
And they are saying it is about the same scale as the Harry Potter themed area.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Oh, I guess Japan. Does Japan have one?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
The story indicates that it might already have one in Japan.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I don't know. I have not been to Universal Studios Japan.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But perhaps they have the Harry Potter World there too.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
But this is going to be similar to that.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And Universal does have an agreement with Nintendo in a cooperative effort to expand business.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
That's going to be pretty awesome.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Oh man, I'd love to go.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Oh, of course. Then I think about how old I am going to be when this opens up, but whatever.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
You know, some things are timeless.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
So, what do you say Dark Sakura? You want to go to Japan in the year 2020?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I actually am already saving up. So, for real.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Yeah?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Looking into all kinds of things because I actually have a big trip that I'd like to take around 2020.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Nice. Let's go. Let's go to Universal Studios Japan.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I want to go to Universal Studios now.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Akuma JP, we're crashing at your place, alright?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Actually, I may have crashed space already.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Oh, nice.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But...

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
No, we know a few people over there too. Even if not.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I have a list of things I want to do.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I want to go to a fighter's baseball game.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I want to go to Tokyo DisneySea.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Yes, I'd love to go to DisneySea.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
And I want to go to Kyoto.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
That's my list. That's it. That's my list.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Alright.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I just want to go, like, hang out in Kyoto for, like, a month.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Alright, well, instead of flashing the clock forward, I think it's time we go backward a little bit in a segment called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Every week, here at Orange Nana's Radio Dark, Sakura steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:55.000
hey, listen, you kids and your holographic lenses and your cell phone VR and your technology, F that.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
The classroom actually inspired me.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Oh, yeah?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Because of the discussion last week about it.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
When I saw what you picked this week, I was like, didn't we talk about that recently?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
We talked about it, but I've never picked it before.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Yeah, no, no. I, then I was like...

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And every time I look at this game, it makes me think of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Because they were playing this in the warehouse. Do you remember?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Yes. Yes, I do. I do.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And so because you finally listened to the chat room, this means that you finally picked Halo as your Classic Game of the Week, right?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
No.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Alright. Then what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
NARC.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So, yeah, NARC is the Classic Game of the Week. It came out in 1988.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And it was designed by Eugene Jarvis for Williams Electronics, programmed by George Petro.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And it is one of the first ultra-violent video games.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And it was also one of the first games that really got the parental backlash.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Basically, the point of the game was to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, defeat Mr. Big.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And it was the newly reborn Williams Electronics coin-op division after they were acquired by Midway.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So, NARC also did see a few ports.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:30.000
The NES port was done by Rare in 1990. And then it was relaunched in 2005.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:44.000
So, basically, you play as two characters, one of two characters, Hitman or Max Force, who got a memo from the Narcotics Opposition Chairman,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000
who sends them off on Project NARC so they can capture Mr. Big.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Big underground drug trafficking and terrorist.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So, basically, you go around and you shoot or arrest junkies, drug dealers, crime leaders, that type of thing.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
They have an automatic weapon and a missile launcher.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Because, I mean, maybe it's prophetic, you know, now having a very militarized police force, you know.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
NARC solved the future, apparently.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:32.000
So, some enemies will surrender and then they will float away into the air with the word busted over them.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And you get a tally of how much you've confiscated in drugs and money every time an enemy is killed.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And when an enemy is killed, well, at least with the missile launcher, they explode into, like, bloody arms and legs and fire and stuff.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:07.000
The game has a medium resolution monitor, which was higher than TVs and normal arcade monitors at the time, but in a smaller size.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And it also is the first arcade game that used the TMS-34010, which is a 32-bit processor for graphics.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:40.000
As far as the many, many other versions of this, there was the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, there was, what else was on this?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:48.000
In 1990, there was a NES version of NARC published by Acclaim and developed by Rare.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And it was, quote, the first video game with a strong anti-drug message.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
It was also crap. Sorry.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
But Nintendo actually forced all the drug references to be removed.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So, yeah.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
This game is so anti-drug, we removed all the drugs.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Exactly.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.000
It did retain most of the gore and the violent aspects of it.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And it also was really handicapped by the NES controller because the arcade version had four buttons.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
You could still jump and shoot missiles.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Acclaim also did a NARC LCD game.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Like, why bother?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:42.000
In the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2 had an emulated version of the arcade games.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.000
But, like, the sound would drift out and there were some glitches in the game.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And it would cause a stage to end suddenly and go to the tally screen just because of how bad the emulation was.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:05.000
And then in 2005, there was a relaunch of the game.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And that was an updated version for Xbox, PC, and PS2.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.000
And there was a GameCube version that had been announced but was cancelled.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
It had voice acting in this particular one.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
It had Michael Madsen, Bill Bellamy, Ron Parleman.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:34.000
A pretty nice soundtrack. It included Curtis Mayfield, Cypress Hill, Grandmaster Flash, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
A few indie artists as well.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Sorry, I forgot about the car sequences in this game. It was hilarious.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Just running over people with a car, backing over them.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Well, here's the other thing too. And this was kind of a controversy in the newer versions.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Is that after you confiscated the stock from the drug dealers, you could either take it to the evidence room or keep it for future use.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Like, do you have better weapons accuracy by using the drugs?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
So, it was just bad.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000
It was no longer teaching people that drugs are bad. It was teaching, oh, there could be positive effects too, though.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Yeah, take this thief. Take this cocaine and you won't care.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So, yeah, no. That was it. That was NARC.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Which, I don't know. I kind of always thought it was kind of crap.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
But, NARC. But, I also understand this was kind of like a big game of childhood.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Sometimes these picks are not necessarily just about, oh, these are all good games, but they're important games.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
NARC was pretty fun.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.000
For me, I was always like, but it was also, I thought it was dumb, but it was that type of game because it was so over the top.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
If a pizza parlor had it, you still ended up putting a quarter in it.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:10.000
You want to know what, though? The person behind the whole Say No to Drugs campaign is dead.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
No, Nancy Reagan.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I know. I'm just like, wow, she didn't waste any time.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Is that why you picked NARC today?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Not really, but it was sort of ironic that I picked NARC.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I know.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Even though, you know.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It is ironic.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
The First Lady of Taxpayer Dollar Wasting is dead, so.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Bond's 006 in chat says, wow, dark.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I was like, this show just took a dark turn.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Maybe it was dark because there's a capital D on that.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
It's maybe referring to dark sacra.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Could be, could be.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
All right, we're going to take a break.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
We're going to, I don't know, we're going to read the Bible and pet some kitties and.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
You can read the Bible.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Go look at a rainbow during the break.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I'm going to look at this part and go, nope, that's wrong, nope, that's wrong, nope, that's wrong, nope, that's wrong.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:06.000
We're going to take a break, and when we come back, we'll get into some rapid fire news, as well as the Fookle Question of the Week.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And some more news stories and, of course, your emails and FUs of the Week.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And Skype Line 1877 GameOLR, her username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, Rama in chat says, dark sacras, dank memes.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Coming up after the break.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I don't see what I said was so bad.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I was just tying things into what's going on in the real world.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Seriously.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It's fine.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
All right.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And I didn't know that she had died when she, when I picked the game.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I picked it like last night when I came back from San Francisco eating my strawberry cheesecake Kit Kats that I got in Japan town.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Did you bring me Kit Kats?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
No.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I might have eaten them all.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
When we come back, dark sacra may or may not be here.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
All right.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
We'll be back.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
We'll be back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio live with our 633rd episode in progress, March the 6th of 2016.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Fun show so far tonight.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
We've had Loki hating on literally everything.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
My name is Thad earlier in the show.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
But we're going to get to some more news as we move on throughout the night.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And, of course, your call is coming up in a little bit.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
At Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Add us if you haven't already so that you can get through tonight.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Let's go to some rapid fire news, some quick news tonight.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Loki.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
All right.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
So this is kind of cool.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I haven't actually seen a new update for Minecraft recently.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But they're adding some big changes to the combat in the game.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:01.000
So now with each weapon that you have, instead of just being able to slash like crazy, you actually do have different techniques you can do.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So swords now you can do sweep attacks.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Axes have a crushing attack.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Also there's some cool down between swings as well.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
They've got, they added shields to the game.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Also a new type of like chest plate that you can have that you can actually glide from higher places, which is kind of cool.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And a new mob, which is the Shulker.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And some new blocks and additional enchantments and stuff.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Guys, you know in chat says they fuck Minecraft up with that shit.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Is that everywhere or is it only PC?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Yeah, this is the PC one right now.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And eventually it's going to be up to you with everything else.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Interesting.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
I don't know. I'm willing to check it out.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I mean, we'll see.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I mean, if you don't like it, I'm sure there's mods to change it back to the way it was.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
So, I don't know.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Also, Melior Solid, they had a fan remake that was being worked on called Project Shadow Moses.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
It has been cancelled.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
And apparently, you know, this is coming from the Shadow Moses Project Facebook page.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Basically saying, hey guys, we have an important announcement to make today.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
We have cancelled the Shadow Moses Project for reasons beyond our control.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Sounds like a cease and desist.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:19.000
We would like to thank everyone for the tremendous support we have received from the Shadow Moses team.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So, yeah, that sounds like a cease and desist to me.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I'm going to assume that was Konami.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Fuck Konami.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
That sounds like Konami.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Yeah.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And last but not least, there is not going to be VR for the Xbox One.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Which makes sense because which platform would actually be on it?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
You know, they're not going to support probably Oculus.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And they've got their own, you know, shit that they're doing with HoloLens, so I'm not surprised.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000
But, you know, we're not really focusing on adding a VR device to the Xbox One right now.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Now, of course, they may change their mind if VR really takes off, you know, kind of a me too thing like they did with the Kinect.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
But we'll see.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
The Kinect was integral to the Xbox.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Totally integral.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I believe that one.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
It was integral to their sales plan.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Whatever happened to being able to scan the thing and then actually move it into the world?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:26.000
That never happened, but you were supposed to be able to do it with Kinect 2.0 or whatever it was for the Xbox One and then that still didn't happen.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
So, you know, fuck it.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
All right. Let's move on to some other news.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
How about Super Meat Boy coming to the Wii U?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Which, you know, God, this game is still going all these years later showing up on new platforms.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
But if you've never played it, it is a fun yet frustrating little platformer.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
So Super Meat Boy is coming to the Wii U.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
This is from Team Meat.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000
They retweeted a tweet by Tommy Refens who is one of the developers of the game.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
So the Wii U port of the game is being handled by Blitworks and it'll be available in the coming months.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:11.000
My assumption is that it's going to have the new soundtrack like the PlayStation 4 version did because of the issues they had had with the former composer and of the 360 version.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Which, in my personal opinion, the old soundtrack was way better.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Sorry. And I know there's some talented people on the new one.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I just, the old one, it changed too much for me.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Hey, if you're like really good at Rocket League, like really, really good at Rocket League, then maybe you should consider joining up with the Rocket League Championship Series which is going to have a $75,000 prize pool.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
You want to get paid $75,000 for playing Rocket League?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Well, you have to be good at it.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:50.000
But competitors can register in March in groups of three to enter the qualifiers for the inaugural season.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.000
You must play these matches on PC or PlayStation 4 although they are looking at opening up more platforms in the future.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
So yeah, those qualifiers will be available.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And it's a partnership with Twitch so you know a lot of this is going to be streamed live for everybody to watch.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
You can look at twitch.tv slash rocket league for more details.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000
And if you happen to be the one that wins the $75,000, don't forget about your friends here at OLR.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Super Mario Maker, we talked a little bit about some of the changes coming to the game.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.000
But you know what? Those changes are not going to affect you if you are a dirty stinking cheater because you will be blocked.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
We'll ban you.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000
That's right. There was some information that was posted on Miiverse saying,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Hey, here's an update for the Mario Maker team.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Users may be restricted from connecting to Course World in the following cases.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
The user requested stars from other users.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
So don't be begging for stars.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
And I'm assuming you can't go on Fiverr and get the stars that way either.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Do you like how I tied that together?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:02.000
The user took advantage of bugs that were unintended by either the course creator or the developers to obtain new world records.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
That sounds like a really big gray area to me, though.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I'm assuming this is about that bug we talked about a couple weeks ago that Nintendo had to squash eventually.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Because I'm like, OK, well, if you exploit some bad course design, you shouldn't be punished for that.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:25.000
But if you inject items that aren't supposed to be in the level into the level like that bug a couple weeks ago, well, then, yeah, that's cheating.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I think that that kind of actually would be detrimental to people who eventually speed run these games.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
That's a good point.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And then the other behavior is in violation of the Nintendo Network code of conduct.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So I'm assuming if you just make a level and the level just has a bunch of bricks that spell out cunt, you're going to get banned from the Nintendo Network.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000
But hilariously, maybe not.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
So, yeah, don't do stupid things online or you might get banned.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, can you beg for stars on your podcast?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I don't know. Can you? I don't know the way it says you can't beg other users.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
So maybe Bobby, you might get banned. I don't know what to tell you.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Can you beg for stars?

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Can I can I just say for your consideration? I would I would love some stars, please.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Maybe that would be different. I don't know. All right.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And Act F says, I think one of my levels does ask for stars in its title.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Well, you better be talking about invincibility power ups or you might be in trouble.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Go change it. All right. Let's move on to our Sakura.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.000
There is a new partnership. It's between Feminist Frequency and Crash Override Network.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:53.000
They are now partners. Feminist Frequency is the nonprofit that's run by tropes versus women in video games.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Producer Anita Sarkeesian and now saying that the group is a fiscal sponsor of Zoe Quinn's Crash Override Network.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:12.000
So, yeah, he's in the pot. Well, I'd say.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Strength in numbers. Also, there's actually hope for any dark suckers.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Capcom wasn't too happy with their experience with the attempted revival,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:35.000
but Yoshinori Ono is saying that he is working hard or striving hard to make that happen.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So not a confirmation, but not a denial.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:49.000
And then last but not least, Mass Effect Andromeda has been moved away from late 2016 to early 2017.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I would rather that they make it later than sooner and have it be complete without having to patch the ending and stuff like that.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I know it's one of those things where it's like, yes, that's what they have to do to make it better.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I support it, but I don't like it. I'm smiling. Really, I am.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000
That's how I feel about it. It's like, well, I mean, the Lord is testing me.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Does Rob really mean it when he says delay the game if it'll make it better? I know a way to test him.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Think of how great F-Zero is gonna be. Fuck off.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:42.000
That was below the belt. Alright, I'm hoping the game will be plenty fine and if they have to take the extra time.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Like Dark Sakura said, if that's the time they have to take to make sure it doesn't have bugs and the ending's all good, then whatever.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Alright, speaking of Dark Sakura, I know you have to go with the whole work arrangements and all that stuff, so you are bowing out.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I am.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.000
So would you like to give any final thoughts to our listeners tonight?

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Not that I want to go political on things.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Oh, Lord.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:17.000
But if you want a particular candidate to win and you don't show up to vote, you're part of the problem.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
You should vote. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
So everyone should vote.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Yep.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
I think voting should be compulsory, but...

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I don't know if I go that far, but I think you should vote or you don't get to complain about it.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Yeah.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
No. Alright.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Voting unless you're underage.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
That should be the compulsory thing. There are no complaints allowed if you didn't vote.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Yeah. And by the way, YYR, I did peek through the mailbag a little bit, but real life.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Yep.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
It must intrude.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
That's okay. I'll do emails.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Rob, you need to do them in Mr. Spanky's voice.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
No.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Which is why I'm glad I won't be here.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I value my voice and I can't talk like that.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So what would Betty sound like, by the way?

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
What would what?

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Betty sound like.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Betty?

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Betty.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Mr. Spanky.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Oh, yeah.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Oh, was that her?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
God, it's been so long.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Wasn't her name Betty?

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Was her name Betty?

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Is Mr. Spanky and...

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And Betty.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I thought she was Betty.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Was it Betty?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
That seems so plain.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I know, but it's also...

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
For his little Dom friend.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Somebody in chat has to know.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Well, Dark Tatsuya says it was probably that.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I'm going to look it up before I leave.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Alright, we're going to move on with the foogle question of the week.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Let's get to it.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Every week you guys answer a question we put up on Facebook and Google and you throw those

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
words together and you get foogle.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Yes, it was Spanky.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I mean, Betty.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It was Betty.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Betty.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Okay.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
DDRPC for those who have no idea what we're talking about right now.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Characters that run DDRPC.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
This is literally a 15 year old joke.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
As you know, our show isn't 15 yet, but it's close.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
It's close.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
You know, I have to admit, I couldn't really find anything topical tonight I really want

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
to ask about.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
So I thought, let's just dip into like a general question.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Something I've been wanting to ask the listeners just because I want to just talk about games

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
randomly with you guys.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
So this week we asked, what do you think about racing games?

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I love racing games.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Dark Soccer's husband really loves racing games.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I know that.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Uh, Loki likes racing games.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
They're pretty good.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Pretty good.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Uh, so we want to know, do you enjoy racing games?

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Do you have a favorite game or series?

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Do you find there are certain types of racing games you prefer more than others and why?

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000
And by the way, I had no idea that Loki was going to be a dick about the F-Zero thing

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000
before I asked this question, but I'm glad he did because it kind of tied it together.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Kind of tied it together.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
All right, let's get to it.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Some of the answers over on Facebook, starting with Andy R saying, I'm not huge on racing

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
games.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Uh, especially sim ones.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Arcade ones I enjoy time to time.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Kart racers are probably my favorite of the kinds of racing games.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Uh, Fabrice A says, I've always been into racing games.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
The Outrun series being my absolute favorite.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I still consider Outrun the best game ever.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Metropolis Street Racing is a decent second.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Perfect blend between arcade and simulation.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Sega Rally coming in a nice third place for excellent playability.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Crazy Taxi is just plain fun.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Tiger Claw says, I enjoy racing games, but never been particularly good at them.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
As for my favorite racing game series, I would have to go with the Mario Kart series.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
It's the kind of racing games casual players will enjoy for hours.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
It's not too complex like those other racing games that are more like racing simulators.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
You can just pick up and play.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
There's hardly any learning curve.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Retertainment says, there are few things better than just being on the edge of being,

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000
or excuse me, than being just on the edge of being in control while taking a curve at 175 miles an hour.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Even if you only experience that in digital reality.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
While I do adore games like Forza and Gran Turismo, I wish the games had a different career structure.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Something like NASCAR or IRL, but for top flight sports cars.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Perhaps I'm just angling to see a Heineken sponsored Bugatti, but still that would be so cool.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Guillermo R says, I'm a sucker for a good arcade style racer, especially if it's futuristic.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:17.000
The Wipeout series is the long standing favorite by which I judge all others, and I'll always have a soft spot for the original F-Zero.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I do love me some racing games, including Wangan Midnight.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
It's all about Yuzo Koshiro's epic soundtrack.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Truth, I agree.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Sega, basically anything from Daytona to Outrun, two is awesome.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Super GT or Initial D, you can't go wrong.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Need for Speed, I think Carbon is my favorite of that series, because in addition to racing your cars, you can customize them with different parts, decals, and paint jobs.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
It's a lot of fun.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Winston H says, I don't really play too many racing games, but if you have the racing wheel, I found the Gran Turismo series to be enjoyable.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000
That's only if you have the wheel.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Jordan T says, I was 15 when Fast and Furious the movie came out, which was cashing in on the huge modding underground culture.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Because of this, I've really enjoyed the games with a heavy emphasis on car modification and upgrades, while still keeping a bit of the arcade feel to them.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Midnight Club was my favorite, with Need for Speed Underground coming in close second.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Games with a heavy simulator focus seemed to translate poorly for me without a high-end wheel setup, and cart novelty racers never really hit home.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.000
As a biker, I'm also still searching for decent motorcycle game.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Suggestions?

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Find a Suzuka 8-hour.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Road Rash?

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Just kidding.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I did want to add my two cents on that before I leave.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Nothing beats R4.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
R4 is the best of the Ridge Racer series, without a doubt.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I don't believe it at that.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I'm surprised nobody's brought up Ridge Racer yet, but we'll see. I've still got some more answers to go.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
YYR in chat says, Super Hang On is the suggestion there for motorcycle games.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
YYR saying R4 is the worst.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Uh oh, uh oh.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
You better be glad she's on her way out.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
It's for horses.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Bite my butt.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And s2100man on Facebook says, Maybe it's the simplicity of this, but I've always been a fan of the arcade-style racing games.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Realistic car games like Gran Turismo or Forza have never really held my interest.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000
In the arcade, I would pour quarters into Initial D and even earlier.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Daytona, USA.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Early on with consoles, I fell in love with the Kart Racers, Mario Kart and Sonic All-Stars, and Burnout games.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And Rageinator says, Yeah, I enjoy racing games.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I flip-flop between Sims and arcade-style racing depending on what kind of mood I'm in.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
One series that I tend to like is the FlatOut series.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I also enjoy Burnout Paradise still, as well as the Need for Speed series.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:43.000
And then over on Google+, we have ActDeaf saying, I love racing games a lot.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
I don't have a particular taste in racing games. I like to play them all.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
From Mario Kart to Gran Turismo.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Though if I have a particular series as a favorite, it would probably be a tie between Forza and the Dirt or Colin McRae Rally series.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
And lastly, Prince Peach Fuzz says, I do enjoy racing games.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Burnout 3 is one of my favorites. I prefer arcade-style to simulation.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Nothing like boosting around corners, taking out opponents.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Favorite racing game for you, Loki? You a big racing game fan?

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
I'm trying to think.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I liked R4, but I'm trying to think what my favorite game would be.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Well, mine is easy and only like one person even half-referred to it.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000
F-Zero G-X-A-X. Thank you very much.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Man, that was so...

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Especially for Nintendo at the time, to have to take your memory card to the arcade to get those extra tracks.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Ah, yes. Burnout Paradise would be pretty good, too.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Burnout Paradise was pretty good.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Man, they really need to do a new one. Forza Horizon, I think, is pretty good.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Forza Horizon is a great series. I like the arcade racer as well.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I always thought Blur was a little bit underrated.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I'm really sad that that didn't work out.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Anyway, thank you guys for the answers. Appreciate it.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.000
And I thought we had it on the show roll, but now that I'm looking at it again, I don't see it.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
But part of the reason I thought about it this week was because...

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
The Forza 6.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
The Forza 6. Or the Forza that's going to be free on Windows 10.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Yeah.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Alright, anyhow. Moving on.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Loki, how about some more news?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Yeah, I would never be able to run Forza 6 on my system.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.000
So we talked a little bit about PlayStation TV and how it was being discontinued in Japan.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Well...

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Well, it's also being discontinued in North America and Europe.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
So...

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Not even it is being discontinued. It was discontinued at the end of 2015.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
So, yeah.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
They're not supporting that anymore, unfortunately.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.000
On top of that, another system that they're not supporting, which is also able to emulate games better than the 3DS...

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.000
The PlayStation Portable is having its PlayStation Store shut down as well.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000
So you won't be able to download past purchases.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Or, no, you will still be able to download past purchases.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Good. I was going to say, that sucks.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Yeah, you just won't be able to use the sort of pay for new games.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000
I'm wondering if you can still do that through...

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Oh, you can still purchase games through the PlayStation 3 to transfer them over or through the web.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Oh, interesting.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000
So you can do it that way as well.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:31.000
That's kind of weird that they have to shut down the PSP Store, even though they're really still going to kind of be allowing you to buy stuff for it. That's weird.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I'm kind of cool with it and stuff, but...

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:41.000
I guess that's one way to do it, though, is that if they have to shut the store down, at least you can still get your purchases through a console.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Might be a way to do it.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Yeah, it's able to play PlayStation 1 games, which are probably more processor and graphically intensive than Super Nintendo games.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Alright, here we go. Here we go. Let it go.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
It's just so impossible for, you know...

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Can we talk about the PlayStation TV discontinuation, though? I mean, I guess it's not that surprising.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I'm kind of disappointed with that. I thought they could have done a lot more with it, but they didn't.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:14.000
It's kind of like, I don't know, they put it out there and it's like, okay, well, that's it. There was no marketing behind it. There was no nothing.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:20.000
It was just kind of like, you know, they've been trying to tell, oh, the Vita, it's kind of a good accessory for the PlayStation 4.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
It just never happened. It didn't work out.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I feel like maybe they just don't want to saturate the market. They just want people to own a PlayStation 4.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Like, why would they be pushing the cheaper TV that does some of the stuff the PlayStation 4 does? Why not just get people to buy the PlayStation 4?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
I feel like that's what it really is.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Because they were, you know, to sell more Vita titles, I think.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000
I mean, because they were putting out, you know, no one was buying the Vita, and they're not making anything really off the hardware.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:58.000
So if it gets you onto the platform for $30, you know, you might make some money off the software.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:05.000
And again, they're not supporting the Vita as far as first-party Vita titles either. So, I don't know.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat is reading you a little bit, Loki, saying, the PSP and the Super Nintendo have completely different chipsets.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
You would think Tech Master would understand that.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Yes, I completely understand it, as does the 3DS have a completely different chipset as well.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:30.000
You know, my old fucking 2.0 Android phone could probably emulate the Super Nintendo, yet this complicated piece of hardware, the 3DS, just can't fucking do it.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Stop. Stop it. Can't handle it.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:42.000
What I'm saying is, my point is that they could do it if they put the effort into it, but they don't want to do it because it's not going to be much of a return on it. That's the issue.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Moving on. Stop, stop, stop. Moving on. Hey, PlayStation 4 update. I'm excited for a new update to the PlayStation 4 because it sounds like a kind of neat feature.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I want this so bad.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:06.000
It is in beta right now, but not this feature. So the 3.5 update is in beta, but not this feature. What is that feature? It is remote play.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Basically, the fact that you can stream PlayStation 4 to your PC or your Mac. So this is an interesting... I kind of assumed this would never happen from Sony, and this would always be something that was kind of exclusive to Xbox One, but this is an interesting little...

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
I'm going to totally use the crap out of this. I mean, because now I...

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Oh yeah, because now the life...

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Because my wife watches the TV and like the Do It Now...

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
You watch Grey's Anatomy and you can play whatever.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Well, she doesn't know.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Whatever.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Whatever she's watching.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Whatever Shonda wrote this week.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:42.000
But she watches TV and like I'm stuck. If I want to do it, I have to try doing it through the PlayStation TV and through my USB.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Oh, I have a USB second monitor, which actually doesn't work with that. So I'd have to set up a second monitor to do it and it's a pain in the ass.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.000
So this would be perfect because I have my laptop anyways in the living room.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Hey, want to play SM Fallout? She wants to play Netflix? Cool. I'm just going to stream Fallout 4.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I'm down with that. I'm totally down with that.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Some other features besides this, which is obviously the big highlight, but you can also appear offline.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:21.000
So you can kind of do that whole fake offline thing, which I actually think will be useful because sometimes I get game invites when I'm trying to marathon Fuller House on Netflix.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:32.000
So, you know, I don't necessarily want to, I don't want to be disturbed from my touching family moment scenes in Fuller House.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
So, which by the way, I'm like through episode seven now. Did you finish the series yet?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Yeah, we're done.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I missed the last episode. She watched it without me, but meh.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Yeah, we can watch it with everyone on Netflix. Are you happy that it's coming back for season two?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
It was all right. I mean, I don't know.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:56.000
She's trying to figure out something else to watch now. What I kind of want more of is Black Mirror because that was a fucking amazing series. Have you watched that yet?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
I haven't.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:05.000
You need to watch it. It's pretty amazing. They're like little short stories. Think of it like Twilight Zone for like tech Twilight Zone, if you will.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000
How long is it? Because one thing I like about Fuller House is that it's like 30 minutes.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:25.000
They're like 45 minute long movies. It's not very long. It's pretty good, but like each one has like a twist in it that's really fucked. I thought they were pretty fucked up, but it's awesome. It's like you don't really see it coming and you're just like, that's pretty cool.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:35.000
You can also schedule playtime with friends. So, you can actually arrange like, oh, we're going to play Rocket League or whatever at this particular time. That's pretty cool.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And then lastly, now Dailymotion is another site you can stream to, including Twitch and YouTube. And I think Ustream is still an option as well, but Dailymotion is joining the group. So, those are all new features coming to PlayStation.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:56:03.000
All right, moving on. We just have a few more stories for you guys than the mailbag. I guess Dark Soccer was going to do this one, but do you want me to do this? I guess I'll take it. Why not?

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Which one? This one?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
The Sega survey?

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Sega survey to help out to make better games? Let's see, it's the first question. Should Sonic have more friends? That should be no. Please answer that no.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:24.000
All right, look. Sega put out a survey to give them feedback to enable them to make games that you want to see. So, you can actually access this survey.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
I'm doing it right now. What is my age?

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Okay, what is my age? 69.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
69, yes.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:37.000
We'd like to learn more about our players. Oh my god, which of the following devices have you ever owned? Do you see how huge this list is?

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I've only owned a PlayStation 4.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:48.000
You can mark off a Commodore 64, and that's the only one I'm going to mark off. I only ever owned a Commodore 64 because I'm 69 years old.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:55.000
I've only owned a, whatever the SG-1000 is, is what I've owned.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:05.000
All right, it's too much. The next question I got to was, what are the top three games you're playing? And I was about to put in Not Fantasy Star Online 2.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I'm going to put Not Fantasy Star Online 2.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000
I'm bitter.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000
No.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:17.000
All right, let's move on to another story, Loki.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
All right, anyways.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:31.000
So, apparently the head of Epic is not too happy with Microsoft's new stance with the Universal Windows Platform Initiative.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Basically saying that this is like a closed platform on PC, like they're basically trying to lock down PC like they are kind of with consoles, I guess.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:57.000
So, what they're doing with this, basically saying that, they're not questioning the idea of having a Windows store, but it's the fact that in order to be able to put stuff on, they have, I guess, giving control to Microsoft.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:07.000
There's no way to have an app that's a Universal Windows Platform app, but being able to, say, download that other places, you can't offer that.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000
You're thinking how you have games on Steam and stuff, and there's multiple different platforms you can purchase those on.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
You can't offer those anywhere else.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.000
It has to only be on these platforms or the certain version of the game in order to gain support for it.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Plus, it seems like they're locking it down a little bit, but one of the things that they brought up also that because of this, you can't obviously have those other marketplaces.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Also, there's not a lot of third-party support already on the Windows Store.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I mean, you're not seeing a lot of major games that are on there.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:53.000
It's just, I think the idea of the platform is an interesting idea, and I get where they're trying to do with it because they're basically saying, hey, you purchased this game on, say, Windows 10.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
You're going to get it on your Xbox.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.000
You're going to get it on your Windows Phone or whatever other platforms.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Granted that those are completely fucking different hardware platforms that are going to have different capabilities as far as running these apps, but you can have it tied in with everything.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
It's a neat idea, but I don't know how it's going to be implemented.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:20.000
And if that means that they're going to lock it down for developers being able to only put out things on this certain platform, that kind of sucks.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Hasn't Microsoft kind of gotten in trouble for antitrust things in the past?

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Yeah, they did with their whole internet browser and stuff.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:36.000
With the whole Internet Explorer, wasn't that a big deal not that long ago?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I don't know why, but this just feels like we're going down a similar path, doesn't it?

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Sort of. And the other thing, too, they're saying that one thing with this platform is it's not open source.

01:59:48.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Games might not run as well on their operating system that are not a part of this platform.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:08.000
They could lock out, say, hypothetically, DirectX 12 support or whatever it could be.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Or 13, and let's say in the future could be only games that are part of this platform or have this sort of API can use fully utilize this hardware, whatever the case may be.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000
I mean, that might be a fear, but I don't know.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Personally, I'm just not interested in purchasing stuff from the Windows Store.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:36.000
So, plus since I don't really have any other Microsoft devices, it's kind of a non-issue for me right now.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000
But, I mean, when I do purchase an Xbox, eventually, I guess I might be interested in that kind of stuff.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:49.000
But they haven't really shown what's going to be kind of, what am I going to be using these universal apps for?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000
I mean, it's kind of neat that you have, I guess, Skype on all of them.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
But, I mean, that's just like sharing an account.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I don't understand really how this is going to kind of work with each other.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
How's it going to work with the Windows phones?

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Who the fuck's going to have a Windows phone for one?

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I mean, no one really owns a Windows phone, nor do they have interest in doing that.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I just don't see that happening, but I don't know how it's going to play with PC and my console.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
How are they going to talk together?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
How are these apps?

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Why do I need this platform?

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Why do I need these tied together?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
What is this going to do for me as a consumer?

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Yeah.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I'm reading some of the comments in chat, because obviously this is lighting chat up a little bit here.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Bobby Blackwolf has a lot to say on this over at live.vognetwork.com, saying,

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
The UWP is a great idea. The problem is limiting features only to the Windows 10 store,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
which is the path they seem to want to go down.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
But they changed their mind with the Xbox One feature set,

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
so maybe they will change their mind on this too if people like Tim Sweeney yell out enough.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:46.000
That's true. We've seen Microsoft do a little dance around stuff before.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Kaijuto in chat says, Microsoft needs to just get out of the video game biz.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Enough with their shit.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
That might be a little strong for me.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Well, here's the other thing too.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Let's just say, hypothetically, because I haven't really downloaded that much stuff on the Windows store,

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000
aside from the Twitter app and fucking Minecraft, because it's free.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:12.000
If they do their updates, like they do with Windows 10, where basically,

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000
hey, we're going to fucking update your shit, whether you want us to or not.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000
You're going to bend over. It's happening.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000
If that's the way they're going to do it, especially with some PC titles,

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000
not saying that everything on the store is going to be perfect,

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
some PC updates can really fuck shit up.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:37.000
It doesn't seem to be a way to roll that shit back, like they do at least with Steam sometimes.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
In other platforms, they can patch that.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
If you're locking everything down in this marketplace,

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000
what's that going to do as far as modding support and that kind of thing?

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I don't know. I just don't like it.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I mean, Windows Store didn't work for the...

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.000
The whole Windows Store... Not even Windows Store. What was the fucking web...

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Not Xbox Live. It was the...

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
What was their fucking... Yeah, maybe it was the Windows Store that I was thinking of.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.000
The original Windows Store. That did not fuck and work very well to begin with.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Windows Live, I think that's what it was.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Games for Windows Live?

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Games for Windows Live. Thank you. That's what I was thinking.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
You're welcome.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Yes, Games for Windows Live did not fucking work out very well. It was just a piece of shit.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And this is kind of... It's a little bit better, but it's kind of going down that path of shittiness.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Well, let's wait and see what happens.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000
But I can't go the whole thing where Microsoft should just stop.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Because, yes, they've made some bad choices sometimes,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
like the Xbox One initial reveal, which we've talked about before.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
But, I mean, Microsoft also transformed gaming with Xbox Live.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
That was Microsoft. Microsoft did that.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:52.000
So you can't say that they don't do anything good.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
But I just... Let's see what develops with this.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I think Bobby is on to that.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000
If enough people kind of speak up and say,

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.000
you're going to have a problem, then Microsoft will probably shift course before it becomes too much of a problem.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
But we'll see what happens. We'll see.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
I hope so.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Alright. Let's move on.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000
This is interesting. I did not even know that something like this was coming.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000
That there is a spiritual successor to Myst in the making.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
And that game is called Abduction.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Not like being kidnapped, but it's OBduction. Abduction.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
It's the spiritual successor to Myst.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
This is after a Kickstarter that happened a few years ago.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
But this is about to come out.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
And there's a trailer out there if you want to take a look at what this looks like.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
It is set for a June 2016 release on PC and Mac.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
So if you guys are excited about this, I might have to check this out.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Because I remember the old school Myst game.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:59.000
But you can also, in this game, choose to have full gamer control or simplify with a simple click of the mouse.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000
So in other words, it sounds like you're going to be able to go between classic Myst,

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
where you clicked forward and it would jump a screen,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
or real Myst, where you could freely move around.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So this would be very interesting.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
And VXJ6V says, OLR has covered Abduction before.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Yeah, well, you know, when we've been around for 14 years,

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
I imagine we talked about this Kickstarter when it first launched.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000
But it is nice to see that it is actually coming out.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Because unfortunately, we've had some bad news Kickstarter.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So there was the Ant Simulator thing a couple weeks ago, right?

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So it's nice to be able to say, hey, some of them work out too,

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
and this game looks like it might be kind of rad.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Well, speaking of simulator games, Bear Simulator was another one that we were talking about the other day,

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
that was on Steam's page.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:49.000
They had a Kickstarter as well, and the game did come out in early access.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
But the guy's going to put out one patch and then he's done.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000
He's like, I can't make this any better, and I'm done working on this.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000
So they're not going to fill some of the stretch goals that they did either.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
At least you got a game, I guess.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Something.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
All right.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Let's get to, I guess we're going to do the mailbag now.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
It's about that time.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Let's open it up.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
And we choose some of our favorite emails and read them here on the show.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000
And sorry, I'm opening up the mail.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Usually, Dar Sakura does this, but since she left, I'm opening it up right now.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
And I will say, we got a ton of email this week,

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
so I am going to have to abbreviate some of this this week for time.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
So I'm going to kind of touch on just a few of these.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Some of these I'll read in full, but some of these I'm going to abbreviate a little bit here.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:51.000
So I want to get to one email here from DDR Mike, who still listens to this show.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Go figure.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
What's up, DDR Mike?

02:06:53.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Well, DDR Mike sent a very long email about the whole Digimon and Pokemon thing,

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000
because remember that came up last week, like what came out first?

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Yeah.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
So basically kind of went into, and again, just for time's sake,

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I'm not going to get into the whole detailed bullet list here,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:16.000
but it has to do with that for most people, Digimon's introduction was the anime Digimon Adventure,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000
which aired in the States in August 1999.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.000
But he's saying that the Digimon virtual pet was June 26.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:29.000
That's my birthday, 1997 in Japan, so that technically it was a little bit before.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
But anyway, and then it gets into all this other stuff.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
But with all due respect, DDR Mike, I let Jamie read it,

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
and unfortunately she's not here to tell you what she thought.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:48.000
But I think it's kind of one of those things where it's probably something like what happened

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
where there's DDR and then there's Pump It Up,

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
and they were kind of both made around the same time,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
probably because the same designer sold his idea to two different companies in two different places.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.000
But, you know, we got what we got.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Anyway, let's get to another email here.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:09.000
We're going to get to an email from EA Skizie, who we haven't heard from in a while,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
saying, what's up, Orange Launch? I haven't written to you guys in a while, and I feel bad about it.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.000
It's okay. Sometimes you can't email us every week, and we understand.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Anyways, I hope things are going well for you guys.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000
How is Loki's game coming?

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Well, okay. No, I did sort of work on it.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Basically, I have stopped working on It's Time to Car for now.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.000
I went back to my original project that I actually was working on prior to that,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:44.000
and one of the things I'm doing now is researching because it's basically like it has a voxel element to it.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's not like a Minecraft game or anything like that, but there is a voxel element to it.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.000
And so I am researching right now the ways to optimize like a voxel engine

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000
because I've rewritten it a couple times already, and so now I'm just trying to figure out how I can optimize it further

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
and how to make it work a little bit better, and also it may run better in Unity 5.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I've got to update everything because my code's from Unity 4.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:13.000
So that's what I've been working on right now is going back to that old project because it was one...

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:18.000
I was even thinking of starting up a completely separate project whatsoever and starting new.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I had a gimmick that would be kind of interesting, but I just didn't want to...

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.000
I didn't know how to go with it beyond that, and so this one I have more developed on it.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I have more of a story developed for it and ideas, and so I'm just going to kind of go back to it

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
because that's the one I really started with and one I've been kind of going back to.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
The It's Time to Car thing will come at some point.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I wanted to do so much with it, and I just don't have the time, and I don't want to put out something that's half-finished.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000
It's just not... The gameplay wasn't where I wanted it to be, and that's kind of the main point.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I needed to kind of focus on gameplay first other than... I don't know.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I just kind of got it lost, what I wanted to do with it.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
He's a perfectionist.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I'm not a perfectionist, but it just wasn't... The controls are all kind of weird, and it just didn't feel right.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:14.000
It didn't play like I wanted it to, so I'm going to start over or do something different with that.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Skeezy also wants to know if we threw a party for just the Orange Sounds Radio crew and me, what kinds of...

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Because we're not inviting anybody else. It's just going to be the four of us.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:30.000
What kind of drinks would we make all night? I'm very curious what you'd mess me up with.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000
This question might be going to a very weird place, but we'll entertain it anyway.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
What drinks would we be having at the OLR party?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I'm going to guess that Loki would make screwdrivers, but that's just my guess.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
That's pretty much what I drink, yeah.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
There it is.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Here's the thing. I could go to two different extremes, Skeezy.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
You know we love the wine here at Orange Sounds Radio, so I have a feeling it would be wine.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Especially if Shane's coming over, it's definitely going to be wine.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:04.000
But if we just want to get, like, fucked up, then we'll go downtown to one of the places I know down there,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:11.000
and we'll get a drink called an adios motherfucker, which is kind of like a Long Island iced tea, but it's blue.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000
So that's, you know, it just depends. Which extreme are we going for here?

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Are we just sipping, or are we going to just say goodbye?

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Dar Tetsuya in chat says, how about a warp core breach?

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I could go for that. I miss the Star Trek experience. Very sad.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:39.000
And Brad from Pod Culture says, fuck that, fireball.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Hey, fireball's pretty good.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Hey, you know what, though? Skeezy, if you do want to just watch some of VOG drink, it's not really OLR,

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
because sadly Loki and Dark Sock are yet to go to this con,

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000
but if you want to come and drink with myself and Bobby Blackwolf and Jon from Critical Myth,

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000
and hopefully Brad from Pod Culture again this year, and some of those, just come to Dragon Con,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
because that's actually what will happen there.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000
And I don't bring the wine to Dragon Con. Fireball, that'll be Dragon Con.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000
All right. Let's get to some more emails here.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I want to go to this one. We had a lot of emails about Street Fighter V,

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.000
and so I want to read this one from AZHP, who said,

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
I just want to weigh in on the debate that happened on last week's episode,

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
where people were debating whether or not it's okay to release an incomplete game

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000
with the promise of additional content at no charge on a timeline.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.000
There were three points that were not brought up by either side that I feel should be factored in

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
when considering whether or not this course of action should be considered acceptable.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
The first point is that while this move may be fine for enthusiasts,

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
who only want the base game and don't care about the frills or need to train for EVO,

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:50.000
or the well-informed consumer who understands that there is a timeline for additional content,

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000
what about the average consumer or newcomer to fighting games who purchases the game at Walmart on launch day,

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
is confused as to why they spent 60 bucks on the game and brings it back to the store saying,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
this game was terrible, I want my money back, and never touches the series again.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
You only get one chance to make a first impression, and it seems short-sighted of Capcom

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.000
to push out a game that is completely inaccessible with no challenge mode to learn combos,

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.000
a bare-bones tutorial, and a terrible story mode just for the sake of its hardcore fans.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
The second point is how do you review a game like that?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Game review outlets that need to put out a review of the game when it launches

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
have no choice but to review the game they're given,

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
but do they give the game a pass on content that doesn't exist yet?

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Do they dock the game points for not having any substance?

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.000
If you review the game highly based on promise of content and the content doesn't make it out,

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.000
or comes out and is poorly implemented, do you change the review?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:42.000
If you dock the game points out the gate and it becomes a masterpiece through additional content,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
do you change the review?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Most sites have a policy of not altering their review score after the game is out,

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
meaning that people who seek out reviews for the game a year after release

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
will see a litany of mediocre reviews based on the outdated version of the game.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
And just a quick side note, I kind of agree that if you write a review,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:04.000
you can't factor in what's supposed to come or what they're promising is coming,

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
you can't factor that into the review.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
You have to evaluate the game as is.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I understand this is why some sites go back and will re-score the game,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:17.000
but I think what's really appropriate to do in a situation like, let's say, Diablo III

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
is to maybe re-review the game a year later.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:26.000
If it's really that big, that necessitates a whole other review.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
But I also know sometimes this is done with the expansion,

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
because not that I think Street Fighter V will get an expansion,

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000
but I think Diablo III, most people re-approached it because,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
oh, they're asking for your money again with Reaper of Souls,

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
and hey, you know what, they did fix a lot of problems.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Or with Final Fantasy XIV, God, the first one was terrible,

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
but then people re-approached it when the expansion came out

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
that really fixed everything, made it one of the better MMOs out there.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Anyway, back to ACHP's email.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Finally, what does one do with an offline console?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
In Street Fighter V's case, when you get the game for $60,

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000
you can only enter training mode or fight someone locally.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Even when the game eventually receives updates to address the content issues,

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
are players without internet connections just screwed?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
They will never receive those updates.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
There should be some sort of warning when you purchase the game

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
that you need to have an internet connection to receive the entire game.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Do we just go with what Don Mattrick said during the release of the Xbox One?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
We have a system for people without internet connections.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
It's called the Xbox 360. That's crazy to me.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Sorry for the long email, but I need to get these points off my chest

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
since I felt last week's discussion lacked some key points

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
that would add to the discussion.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Well, that is what email is for, so I am fine with that,

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
except we got a lot of emails on it,

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000
so I'm going to try to do at least a couple more here with time.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Andrew R. saying, not to be that guy, but I do want to point out something.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
DarkSoccer made a comment that you have to win 2,000 matches

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
to unlock a character in Street Fighter V.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
While this is true, if you only play online matches,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
it's not the only way to get the currency.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
As it is right now, you can get more than enough

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
to buy the first character when he's out

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.000
simply by playing the single-player modes that are already in the game.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
And by the time the other characters come out,

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:04.000
it seems like there will be more ways to earn in-game currency

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
like the daily weekly challenges and probably arcade mode story mode.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
It'll be a bit of a grind, but not nearly on the level

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
of having to make it through 2,000 online winch,

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.000
which is currently impossible thanks to all the rage quitters.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
See, I have to jump in here, though, real quick and say,

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000
that's all fine and good, and that sounds like a real nice plan,

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.000
but here we are talking about things that are supposed to be there

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
but aren't there now, so we can only talk about what's there now.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I know they're promising other stuff, but until it's there, things change.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Anyway, Andrew continues and says,

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.000
I'm sure this sounds like I'm defending the game, and I guess I am,

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
but I did want to address it.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Mechanically, I think Street Fighter V is very solid, and I like it,

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000
but it's definitely annoying how much of the game outside the mechanics

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
is still waiting on updates.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I certainly don't fault people like Sky who want to wait

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.000
until more of the updates are out and the game is cheaper,

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
but I guess I was just too impatient myself.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
And who knows, maybe Capcom will see the outrage

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000
and reward their early adopters.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Ha ha ha, never mind, it's Capcom.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Thank you for the email.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.000
And, you know, these are all fair points to consider,

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000
but just for me, it's one of those things where I can't,

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000
you know, I give Rock Band 4 a hard time for the same thing.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
It's like there's all these things that are supposed to be there,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:24.000
but until they're there, I don't consider it a part of the game.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Let's see, we've got more emails here.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I'm going to get to this one, another Street Fighter V email

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.000
from our pal YYR saying,

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
the Street Fighter V situation is interesting.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
I've been saying for years that story modes and fighting games don't matter.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000
They're like chess or checkers or a backgammon,

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
games designed to be played by two human players.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
You can play those games against a computer,

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
but that's just not the way they're meant to be played.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
For anyone who agrees with this philosophy,

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Street Fighter V was absolutely 100% ready to be released and played.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
For Capcom to say, we're adding the story mode later

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
feels similar to an RPG maker saying,

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
we're adding the side quests later.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
I grossly underestimated the number of folks that would be upset

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
by the lack of single player content.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
On one hand, I feel like that's not what the game is for,

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
but on the other, I fully realize that the features people are asking for,

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
arcade mode versus CPU, better training, tutorial,

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:16.000
are all things that are present in almost every other fighting game released

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
over the last decade.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Whether they're essential to the game or not, the precedent was set.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
It's unfortunate that the game was released in this state.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
The fact of the matter, though, is Capcom wasn't as interested

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
in the sales numbers as everyone else.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000
The reason they rushed this to market was the Capcom Pro Tour.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Capcom isn't looking for the revenue from early Street Fighter V buyers

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.000
as much as they are the long-term revenue from an increased focus on esports.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Capcom badly wants a chunk of the esports pie,

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
and Street Fighter V is the game they want that chunk with,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
in large part because the competitive scene is tired of Street Fighter IV.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Capcom has set their priorities.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
The casual Street Fighter fans are not their priorities anymore.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
We can look at the sales numbers and shake our heads,

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000
but in truth, we're not going to know whether this was the success

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Capcom wanted until a few years from now.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000
What worries me more than the initial reception

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000
is actually the steep cost increase of the game over the long run.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Currently, there have been six DLC characters announced.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
They can be obtained with a $30 season pass.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.000
They can announce six more characters next year and six more after that.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.000
And for all we know, each set could come with a $30 price tag.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.000
And while they will all be purchasable with in-game currency,

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
that doesn't help someone who wants to get into the game a few years from now

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
and is starting from square one.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Rather than being able to buy all DLC included re-release on a disc for $20 to $40,

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000
this new player will be 18 characters behind unless they want to drop $90 right out the gate.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I really feel like, even though Capcom says one thing,

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I really feel like you're going to have bundles that are deep discounted on Black Friday.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:44.000
I think they are going to have a catch-up way,

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
even though, of course, they don't want to tell you that

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
because they want people to pay full price up front.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I'll end this with a reply to what Jamie said last week

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000
about Street Fighter V feeling different than previous titles.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
This is absolutely by design.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Street Fighter II, III, and IV all felt very different from their predecessors

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:02.000
and used different rules. V is no exception.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000
We're all starting from scratch.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:07.000
And by the way, V is pretty fantastic gameplay-wise, at least in my opinion.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Thanks once again for supporting my efforts. I really appreciate it.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Have a great week.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Well, thank you very much for that email.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
And yeah, I will say this.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:18.000
I mean, you know, for at least what little of Street Fighter V I did play during the beta,

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.000
it did seem like there was a solid fighter in there.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
It's just the whole...

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:26.000
It's kind of like, I don't know, it's like having a cake without any frosting.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I guess it's still kind of good.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
But it's not the same. I want the frosting.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.000
No.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
If you're going to charge me all that money for a cake, I want the frosting.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.000
All right, anyway.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
YYR chat says, but it's so moist.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
All right, that's going to do it for emails tonight.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I'm sorry to the emails I didn't get to tonight, but we actually got a lot this week.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000
But we do always read them all, so please send your emails.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Every week on this show we get a little angsty.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Why? Because...

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I guess FU2 just how busy things have been at work.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I don't know.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I haven't been able to mentally focus a lot in game programming.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:31.000
You know, normally I get a few minutes in between things, but not so much.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
But it wasn't so bad on Friday.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Hopefully it just stays the way.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.000
My FU of the week goes to getting up at four in the morning today.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Although, to be fair, I volunteered for that.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.000
So I'm not actually, I'm not like mad that I got up at four because I knew that's what I said I'd do.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:50.000
I'm mad because I didn't sleep a wink last night at all.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:55.000
And I don't know if that was the rain or what that was, but like, yeah, I tried to go to bed at 10 o'clock

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
because I was going to have six hours sleep. That'll be enough.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:02.000
I remember seeing the clock at 11, seeing it at midnight, seeing it at 1, seeing it at 2.30.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.000
I didn't sleep last night at all.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:11.000
So, thankfully, I took a nap before OLR so I'd be able to function on today's show.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
But I'm probably going to sleep pretty hard tonight.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
So, looking forward to that.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000
So FU2 is super insomnia, I suppose.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Alright, let's get to a couple more stories and then we are going to open up that Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.000
All one word on Skype, the old fashioned way at 877-GAME-OLR.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Loki.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:35.000
So, even though I did get the Gear VR today, there are other VR things coming out.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Including, of course, we have some information now on the HTC Vive.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.000
And they're going to be releasing that for $800.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.000
And you can actually preorder that now as well.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.000
And it's going to be starting to ship in April.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:58.000
And, of course, that $800 gets you the Vive with all the two controllers.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.000
So that looks pretty awesome.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.000
The thing is, I watched some videos on the Vive, actually, this week.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:09.000
One of those being the portal robot repair demo thing that they had, which looks fucking awesome.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:16.000
And I was like, man, if I'm going to get one for PC, the Vive does look pretty good, even though it is so expensive.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:22.000
But if it was giving me an option like, okay, you can pick one or the other and we'll give it to you,

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:25.000
I'd probably choose the Vive because it looks pretty fantastic.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.000
So, nice.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
And you do also get some free apps as well.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Tilt Brush Paint app, the fantastic contraption, and Job Simulator.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
So those will be coming with that.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Well, cutting edge toys are usually pretty expensive.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
It looks pretty cutting edge.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Plus, it does have the actual control wands as well.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:51.000
So, I mean, we haven't really seen too much as far as what, I don't know if they had a cost yet for the controllers for the Oculus Rift.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000
So maybe with all that added in there, it might end up being about $800.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.000
So we'll see.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I'm dying to see how PlayStation VR is going to change this dynamic.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
I mean, again, I realize it's very different.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
It's not PC, it's console.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
But we're all curious to see what that's going to look like.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
We'll know in what, two more weeks?

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I hope so.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Excited to see how that's going to change the game.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I am very curious.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:20.000
And then if you want to drop even more money for tech that's really not done yet, HoloLens, the developers edition, will be available for $3,000.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:23.000
But hey, with that $3,000, you get two games.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000
So it comes with Young Conquer and a couple other mini games.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Yes, it's really for developers only.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:35.000
And of course, you know, if you like that narrow field of view, then you're going to love it.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I really want a HoloLens, but not for $3,000 and not at its current state.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat, and he said this several times throughout the evening, is pretty adamant that HoloLens is not a gaming device.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:58.000
And although I'm not necessarily going to disagree because some of the Kinect's biggest capabilities had nothing to do with gaming, I will say, but yet they are including games with it.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.000
So, I mean, you can't say games are banned from it.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:09.000
And you can't say it's a non-gaming device when that's all I've seen on it so far as far as demonstrations go.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000
But with the dev kits out there, we'll hopefully see some new stuff.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Yeah, exactly. And I'm not saying that they can't implement, you know, like real life, you know, like medical practice, you know, applications, stuff like that.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:30.000
But fucking hell, I mean, they've been showing Minecraft, they've been touting Minecraft a lot, and they've been showing like shooter games and shit that they have with it.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
And plus, you know, showing that you can watch all these things on your walls.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I'm down with, you know, the whole application things and like, you know, popping my apps onto the wall in the room around me.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
And so I think that's pretty cool.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Games would be, you know, a small portion of that, but still it doesn't function with that sense either.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I mean, it's fucking narrow as shit.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I mean, so I can't support that in its current state.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Well, I feel like we got a long way to go.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Like, you know, I kind of think, OK, well, what kinds of things besides games could be used for?

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000
And I go like, well, maybe like architecture type of stuff.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Well, yeah, I can see where maybe in that in the modeling would be kind of cool.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I mean, I'm down with that, but it's still very, you know, we need to see some better hardware.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Maybe a type of application since, you know, it's AR instead of VR, maybe something where like it actually makes all the people around you naked.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I hope so.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000
That's not a game, but it sure would be fun.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Ugly significant other fixer.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Rageinator chat over at life.vog network dot com says HoloLens porn anyone?

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
That's what. Oh, is that why Bobby keeps saying it's not a gaming device?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Because it's for porn, obviously, if it is.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Can you imagine like you could surround yourself with porn.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Bobby, can I say it's for porn?

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
It's for porn, right?

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Everything is for porn.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Seriously, it's it's just unbelievable.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000
You could have you could have porn all around you.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
You could be surrounded 360 degrees by porn and you can do.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Yeah, it's for porn.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Act Defton chat says anything is the gateway for porn.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000
It's not a fucking gateway. It's a fucking holodeck of porn minus, you know, the interaction.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Bobby Blackwell says the low field of vision will kill porn.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
That's true.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
I'm going to need a really big field of vision.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Maybe second gen.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:35.000
You are me because seriously, that's like, you know, experiencing porn porn through a spyglass or something like that.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.000
It's like, listen, if you're doing like a peeping Tom app or something like that, that's OK.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
But like just anything else, it just really takes you out of it.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
All right.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Oh, God. All right.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.000
All right. Let's move on one more story for you guys.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
And it has to do with Steam and buying games on Steam and all this stuff.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:02.000
But hey, you know, this is even though we talk a lot about this one marketplace here on the store, it is the way a lot of people are buying games.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:09.000
And this is a pretty exciting change is that the way that bundle prices work is going to be changing on Steam,

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:17.000
allowing for a more dynamic pricing model that takes into account whether or not you own the games already featured in the bundle.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Now, apparently Valve has not actually officially announced this, but there's, I don't know, official documentation out there or what have you.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Long story short, you'll get a discount if you already own one of the included games.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.000
This scales up depending on how many of those games you own.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:41.000
In the documents, it says with Steam bundles, if a customer already owns some items in the bundle, they will pay for and receive only the items not already in their account.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:48.000
This allows the best fans of your series or franchise to complete the set and get the deal on the remaining items in the bundles.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:57.000
So, uh, yeah, I, you know, you always see like these huge developer bundles and then you go, but I already own like a quarter of them, so...

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Yeah, unfortunately all those bundles are on, you know, fucking Humblebuddles, so that's not really gonna apply.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Yeah. YYR in chat says, Valve Complete Pack is now $12 for most people because you own most of it already.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Yeah, seriously, between like Portal and Portal 2 and, you know, Left 4 Dead and all those games.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:21.000
It's like, okay, next time a Valve Complete Pack goes up, it won't cost me nearly as much.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Alright, I think it is time to open up the Skype line, so let's get to it.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:32.000
We are gonna open it up over at, uh, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:38.000
1877 Game O.L.R. the old-fashioned way. Wow, it's already lighting up, it's, oh my gosh, you guys are dying to get in tonight.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Hey, guys, it's Jason.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Hey, Jason, how you doing?

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Doing, uh, pretty well. Been a pretty fun little weekend.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Good to hear from you and good to see you.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Uh, you guys, anyways.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Yes.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Not so much the radio listeners, but that's okay.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.000
But I can see the progress on the beard. It looks very fluffy.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:02.000
It, uh, yeah. No change, just letting it do its thing and doing that wonderfully.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Love it. What's on your mind tonight?

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Um, when you were reading that email about Street Fighter V and reviews and that kind of stuff, it kinda...

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Which one, Jason? Cause there was like three of them.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Uh, talking, talking, uh, the very first one talking about the eventual content additions to Street Fighter V

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:25.000
and in context of reviewing on release day or prior to release day release, uh, review copies

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
and, you know, games in the future if they significantly change.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Uh, and it just kind of brought back and I, it brought, it reminded myself of something that I said back

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:39.000
God, I think it was in like 2013 or 2014 or something like that.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Um, and it was, it was on that show. It was one of the, one of the, uh, shows at, uh, uh, the former studio

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.000
whose name I have completely forgotten, but prior to N7, naturally.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Um, it...

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Uh, that was the tiny little broom closet space. Cause that was literally like our dining room was the studio.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Yes, especially given where the setup was. Absolutely. It was a nice apartment, but anyways.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Um, it's like, do we, is this, is this a foresight of needing to start dramatically doing reviews differently?

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Uh, the point that I had made back then is that gaming, I used it in context mostly of first person shooters

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:23.000
and MMOs is that not only are MMOs sprawling worlds in both size and continuing updates,

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:28.000
but, uh, Titanfall attempted to do that in first person shooter.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:35.000
I would call Destiny more of a first person shooter than an MMO because of the limited squad size, uh, limited party size.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Um, but there are more and more games that are adapting this long term, uh, this long term commitment,

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.000
pricing model irrelevant, you know, like, uh, no, there's no one specific definition of it,

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:55.000
but so many games are on this track to be able to actually live so long over time.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Um, Rocket League, I would step out on a limb and say Rocket League is the first sports class of game

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:09.000
that is doing that with the season rankings and the continuing content.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:16.000
We'll see if it's anything more than just, uh, cute licenses, but there are plenty of games

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:23.000
because of the capabilities of PCs and consoles today that are opting for a life cycle of a game,

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:33.000
a life of a game, if not, and not just, you know, the EA, the NHL, the NFL, the NBA formula of one game every year.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:39.000
You know, I think there's no easy answer to this, which of course you know is what I'm going to say,

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:43.000
but I kind of think, I kind of compare it to what do we see in other industries,

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:47.000
and I think what do reviews usually do in these types of artistic industries?

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:52.000
What is a review for a movie? What is a review for a concert? What is a review for a play?

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:58.000
It is for the money I spent and for the time I spent, how did I feel after the fact?

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Like, how did the time and money I invested make me feel?

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Because that's what a lot of this is.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:10.000
And so I kind of think with games, that's kind of the way you have to approach it as well,

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:14.000
is that for the time and for the money I spent, or the money they're asking people to spend,

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
because we know in this case this is comped, but to be fair in the movie industry,

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
comped, plays, comped, a lot of that stuff is comped too.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000
It's kind of one of those, well then, what was your impression based off of your time with the product?

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:31.000
And that's why I'm kind of back with, if it's not there, it's not there.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.000
And so I can't really say it in my review because I'm reviewing how was my time with it.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:43.000
And you kind of also see this with a lot of games where the online mode isn't even on

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.000
because they haven't turned it on yet when the reviewers are trying to review it.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:53.000
And so they say, well, we can't really review online mode, so this review is based on our experiences with this only.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Maybe this is why you have more and more places that are just, they're turning away from scores,

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000
because, and I think this is part of why they turn away from scores,

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:08.000
because of what you're saying about how games are more dynamic, and I think Destiny is a great example.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I think, again, the way most people approach Destiny is that game was re-reviewed due to the expansion,

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:21.000
and the impression of most outlets was, hey, did you know? Destiny is a lot different now, and here's this expansion.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:32.000
But I think the reason why a lot of places are getting rid of scores is because a lot of these games are living, breathing experiences

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.000
that can't necessarily be targeted on a scale of one to ten.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:39.000
And we all know what a freaking emphasis the industry is placing on Metacritic,

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.000
and maybe we have to start getting away from that because of where the games are going.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Yeah, absolutely. It's a little strange to compare it to other mediums.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:59.000
There are some comparisons that can be drawn, but in the list that you made, movies don't change except when, call them expansions, special editions.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Movies don't generally change, Clue being the most famous exception back in the day, the different movies, the different endings for different theaters.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Plays can change based off cast, and certainly there's the human factor of the performance and the energy, that word that God knows what it is

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:26.000
that actually makes you connect with it and enjoy it, like the same situation, location, cast, time of day, day of the week.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Everything can be identical, and it can be less enthusiastic and thrilling than otherwise.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000
It could also be the own fucking reviewer's fault as well.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:43.000
It's a little strange to compare it to other media, but maybe that is my software bias of computing,

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.000
and the fact that I've known almost my whole life to know things evolve.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:56.000
My freaking Mortal Kombat for the PC, I had to send whoever did the PC port,

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:02.000
I had to send Disc 1 back to them for newer hardware compatibility enhancements.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Floppy Disc 1 of 3, Mortal Kombat 1 for the PC back in 93, 94, 92, somewhere in the early 90s.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Like when I was in high school, yeah, probably like 93, 94.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.000
I won't say how old I actually was then, if you're gonna play that game.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Let's not.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:28.000
And gamers and technologists are the right crew to actually,

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.000
are the right group to actually make this change of getting away from review scores.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:40.000
It's unfortunate, it's gonna tilt Metacritic down to certain review sites that grasp onto it to dear life,

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
but this is the group of people that I would put the most faith in,

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.000
being able to actually come up with a more compelling, more accessible,

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000
more detailed in the things that you need to know of a system

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:59.000
for the changes that a larger and larger chunk of gaming is coming up with.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Let me end on this thought, kind of talking about the whole comparisons to the other media,

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000
and I guess part of the reason why my brain always goes to the movies, the plays, the CDs and what have you,

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:13.000
is because it's all art, and I do believe, I firmly believe video games are art.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.000
All of those different mediums are about expression, and video games are another form of expression.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.000
And the thing about art, art is interpretation.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:26.000
And that's why reviews are never, this issue can never really be solved easily,

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.000
because the way you interpret something and the way I interpret something are always going to be different.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.000
And that's...

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:34.000
One of the only pieces of art on a fully dynamic canvas though.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
That is art.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Absolutely.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Okay, my friend, I gotta let you go so we can squeeze in some more calls, but always good to hear from you.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Have a good night.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Take care, you too.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000
See you.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Our buddy Jason, you hear his voice at the beginning and at the end of every show here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000
1877 game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Over at chatoveratlive.vognetwork.com, Kaijuto says,

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.000
video games are fart.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Hi, this is Rachie Nader.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Long time, welcome back.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I know, really.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.000
You sound better, too.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
I can tell you've had some upgrades over there.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:10.000
You sound better.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:18.000
It's probably the building mic in this external webcam that I got with my computer.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Well, it's a much better quality than before.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.000
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Not a whole lot.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000
It's kind of related to what you were just saying.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:34.000
I'm kind of bragging about not bragging about my computer,

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:40.000
because this is honestly the nicest thing that I've had in a very long time.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Well, I know the listeners can't see the video feed on my Skype call.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.000
It's better.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Yeah, well, I was going to move my webcam real quick.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I just got out.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Be careful where I'm pointing, because I'm not wearing pants right now.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Not wearing pants right now.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:03.000
But, yeah, that's the computer right there.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:08.000
It's a Cybertron PC right there.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Plus, you see that little box sitting on top of my PC there?

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.000
That's an external Blu-ray drive right there.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Nice little drive.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Now, keep in mind, the listeners can't really see what I'm seeing,

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:24.000
so I'm going to kind of try to summarize as best I can.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
But, yeah, I can definitely see all the parts of the computer there.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:30.000
And I think, is that your bank account open on your desktop?

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Can you point the camera back over that way?

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Can you zoom in on your account number?

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000
I'm kidding.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.000
It's iTunes.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
It's nothing.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000
All right.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Well, congrats on the new computer.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I know that's been a long investment and a big thing for you.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:49.000
And I can just tell you're just excited to have it and be using it again

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000
and be back in action.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.000
So, let me ask this.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:54.000
You got everything up and running.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000
You got your new computer and all this stuff.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
What was the first game you had to go get?

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
The first game where you were like, we're going to play this.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Excuse me.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Coffee and spell.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Well, before I had my internet turned back on,

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.000
I was basically, for lack of a better term,

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:20.000
stuck playing my good old games that I had stored locally on some external hard drives.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.000
And I'd been playing a lot of those.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:30.000
I was playing like the original Flat Out, Oddworld, Abe's Odyssey,

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.000
and the Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3, stuff like that.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Now that I've had my internet on for a week now and had access to Steam and all that,

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.000
I've been playing Magic the Gallery in 2014, obviously.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Of course.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Yeah, and of course, I also tried some of the games that I previously had trouble with

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:03.000
with my last PC, such as Portal 2 and Brutal Legends, so on and so forth.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:08.000
All the stuff that they tried to deny me before, I will now...

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:13.000
And I can honestly say that none of my games are giving me trouble now.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Good.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000
None.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Good.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Yeah, the only downside to this new PC, if you want to call it such,

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:28.000
is that earlier today I did have a little bit of difficulty with putting in the new RAM, though,

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:35.000
because the machine did come with 4GB of RAM already pre-installed.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:42.000
I ordered some extra RAM, 8GB worth, and I kid you not,

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:48.000
it got to a point where I seriously thought I fucked up my brand new machine

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000
and I was ready to shit and piss myself right there.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000
I'm like, oh my God, I screwed up my machine!

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Anybody doing that kind of stuff always has that moment.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:03.000
You know, Alan built the computer I use now, and there was plenty of those moments where it was like,

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:08.000
did you just fuck up all this equipment that I just dropped an extraordinary amount of money on?

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.000
But we worked through it. It worked out.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
There's always that moment, though.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Yeah, well, luckily, between Tiger Claw's advice and the little trial and error on my end,

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.000
I managed to figure out what the problem was, so on and so forth,

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:34.000
and obviously, by virtue of fact, I have a PC ad right now talking to you via Skype.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Obviously, it managed to get fixed, so.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000
But so far, I'm loving everything.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Eventually, sooner or later, I'm going to have to upgrade my video card,

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:53.000
but I'm not in a big rush for that right now, and, you know, not only that,

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:59.000
but another thing I want to do is get a gaming mouse and keyboard,

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000
but those two items are kind of like low priority.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.000
I'm more interested in upgrading my graphics or video card more than anything, so.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Sure. I'm even looking into doing that, so.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000
All right. Well, Ray Jr., my friend, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls,

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.000
but I'm so happy to hear you're up and running, and I'm sure we'll hear from you again.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Sure, sounds good. I'll talk to you soon.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Yep, take care, buddy.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.000
All right, bye, Ray.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Bye.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
All right, wow, lots of calls coming in tonight.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Orange On Radio, I want a word on Skype, but we got another call right now.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Hi, you're on Orange On Radio. Who's this?

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Hey, what's going on, brother?

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Hey, not much. I'm good. I'm running on fumes at this point.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
I'm so tired, but I'm good.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:43.000
The show does give me a little second wind, so it's not like I'm dragging,

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
but it's like after this show is done and it's edited and posted, I'll be going to bed.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Bro, I know exactly what you mean.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:54.000
When I podcast, thankfully, right by my computer is my coffee maker,

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.000
so I put a pot on so I can make it through the show.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.000
You know, and there was a time when I would just kind of put the show up

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:05.000
whenever I felt like it, basically, and I would fall so far behind

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:09.000
that people really started to call me out on it when shows were posting a week late and stuff,

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000
and it was like, all right, I really have to force myself.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:17.000
If I don't post the night the show is recording, unless I have a really big circumstance,

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.000
because sometimes there's a tech problem or something, there's nothing you can do about that,

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:25.000
then it's like, I have to do it right away, or I know myself, it's not going to get done.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Now, now, sir, you are no Travis Donovan.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Now, now, don't pick on him just because he's not here to defend himself.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Hopefully he's doing well in retirement, yelling at kids to get off his lawn.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:43.000
True, true, true. I know if it wasn't for him, Anime Jam Station probably wouldn't be where it is,

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
but I'm allowed one.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:50.000
That's right. There's always time to take a shot at Travis. What's on your mind tonight?

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Okay, um, so, well, you mentioned Adios Motherfucker earlier in the show tonight.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Yes, I did.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:04.000
My mind flipped back to Fandame when I roomed with Dark Soccer, Andrew and crew,

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:11.000
and I think we actually went looking for a bar that knew, and a bartender who knew how to make that drink.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.000
I'm almost positive it's almost the exact same thing as the Long Island, except instead of the soda,

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:22.000
it's like that blue, I don't remember what they call it, but it's that blue stuff.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Blue Caraco.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000
That's it, Blue Caraco. I'm almost positive that's it.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.000
It's just the Long Island, but they put the Blue Caraco in it instead.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000
And for some reason, the blue makes it taste better.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Act DEFT in Chat says Windex. That's what it looks like.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:39.000
That's what it looks like, you're just drinking Windex.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:45.000
And honestly, it probably fucks you up even worse than Windex, but, you know.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Something like that.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.000
SSG100Matt actually found, it's amazing the things you can find on Google,

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:56.000
but he actually found a little link to one of those drink mix sites and what is in it.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:02.000
So it says, according to this site, it's one ounce vodka, one ounce gin, one ounce white rum,

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:08.000
one ounce Blue Caraco liquor, six ounce sweet and sour mix, and six ounce 7Up soda.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Oh, they do put a little soda in it.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Okay, my bar doesn't even bother with the soda.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:18.000
That sounds almost like my bar as well.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
What a waste.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.000
You have the sweet and sour mix in there, that's your non-alcoholic part.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
There you go.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Is that all you called in about was drinks?

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:33.000
No! No, but since we're on that topic, I'm not gonna get up and pour a shot.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
No, I'm not gonna do that. Not tonight.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
I also want to talk about NARC real quick.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Now, I may have brought this up in a previous episode, or someone else might have,

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:53.000
but the character Max Force was part of a cartoon series called The Power Team.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:58.000
This came on during, I believe, the mid to late 90s.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:02.000
It was part of a show called Video Power.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Oh, yeah.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
So, you remember that show, too?

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Vaguely. I remember of it, but I'm trying to Google it right now to get the images back in my mind,

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.000
but I remember Video Power, like, vaguely.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
With Johnny Arcade.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Well, you mentioned that, when Darkstalker mentioned that, I was like, Power Team video.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.000
It all came back to me, because I used to get up at 6.30 in the morning to watch this show.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:37.000
He would come in and do the intro, they would do the cartoon, and then right afterwards,

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:42.000
there would be a quick review of the game, and then there would be a tip or a clue.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:50.000
And mind you, most of the games and tips were acclaimed video games, thus the sponsor and thus the team.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Okay, yes, this was the show where they would run around with the Velcro and, like, try to get as much stuff

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
and stick it to the Velcro as they could, right?

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Oh, yeah, I remember you used to stick, like, Nintendo Entertainment System boxes to themselves.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Like, on their head.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Really ginormous.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Yes.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:12.000
And Genesis and Neo Geo, yes, that was the second season of Video Power when they retooled it into a game show.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Okay, that's the Video Power I remember.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Yep.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.000
But yes, I'm looking a little bit on Wikipedia and I see that the season one was different.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Okay, I only remember the second part of that, I don't remember the first season.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
That's weird that they would change it so radically.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:35.000
I don't know, I guess for ratings, I suppose, you know, because I remember the second season,

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000
they moved it from 6.30am to 8.30am.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:48.000
YYR chat says, I totally forgot about Video Power, OMG, WTF, Tigerclaw found a YouTube of it.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Of course it's on YouTube!

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Mm-hmm.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Of course.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Alright, well, thank you for the walk down memory lane, Rama.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Anything else you want to share with us tonight?

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Quick thing, Microsoft Store, Fifth Avenue, we're having a division release launch party with Major Nelson.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Oh, nice.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Tell him I said hi.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Will do, I'm working the release party that night, so.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000
He has no idea who the fuck I am, but tell him I said hi anyway.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:18.000
And if he actually remembers you, you best believe I will call you and tell you this.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Sounds good, no, he will not know who the hell I am, but that's fine, I can pretend.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Alright, take care my friend.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Yeah, one more thing, Loki, have a Snickers.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.000
You turn into a real bad cranky pants when you don't eat.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
He did eat though.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.000
I did, I cooked actual, I don't know what exactly it was.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.000
It was my wife's design, apparently she likes taking recipes and fucking them up, so.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:51.000
It was supposed, no seriously, because it was supposed to be like a cheesesteak soup,

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:58.000
but she's like, I don't want it with the cheese, I do want it with barley though, and mushrooms.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:03.000
And so I made it, it was pretty good, it just, it would have been better with cheese in it because it was intended to have cheese in it.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:11.000
It was more like a French onion soup without, French onion soup with steak and mushrooms and barley in it.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:14.000
If dinner didn't come in a bag, it's just not gonna work.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:20.000
No, it's really, it's really filling, it's just, I'm gonna melt cheese on it next time and it'll be even better, so.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Rob, if you can see my facial expression now, it's like a mind full of fuck, because I'm trying to wrap my head around the concept of cheesesteak soup.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:35.000
Well it has cheese in it, you melt the cheese in the soup and it's actually like mixed in there.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Like I've made, I've made like a, there was one I made that was like a cheesy leek soup or something like that and it was really good.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:47.000
But there was one that had like cream and like broth and it was just good.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000
Alright.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Uh oh, because if I mention this to my friends from Philly, they'd probably kick my ass.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Alright, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you for the call.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
No problem dude, y'all take care.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Alright, bye bye.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Bye.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Alright, I am gonna wrap up for now. I'm very sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Uh, we, I just, it's after nine o'clock, I gotta wrap things up, because uh, yeah, I'm ready to edit the show and hit the hay.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:21.000
But thank you guys so much, uh, you can always send an email, participate at orangelaundry.com to appreciate all you guys that participate with the show every week.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:26.000
You can tweet us at well at olr, I know I'm not always good about responding to the tweets on air, but I do read them all.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:33.000
And once in a while I will reply, especially if you ask something that needs a reply, I will reply from the account, uh, once in a while.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000
But that is about gonna do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Checking in with Loki real quick though for last minute stories, I don't know if we missed anything you wanna go over real quick?

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:41.000
No.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:42.000
No?

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Alright, well shoot, that's gonna do it then for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:56.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please tell a friend or 17 about the program, help spread the word.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Uh, a nice five star review goes a long way as well on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
Uh, really appreciate that.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Uh, word of mouth is all we got here, we're not a multi-million dollar website or anything like that.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:13.000
It's just us, yo, in my spare room.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:17.000
About time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but then we will see you again in seven days.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:28.000
We will be back here next week in the, uh, lead up to GDC, which is, uh, you know, not usually a media event, but with the whole PlayStation VR thing looming, it should be an exciting year.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
But meanwhile, getting everybody's final thoughts tonight.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Loki, what's it gonna be, your final thoughts on that?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:41.000
My final thought is I'm gonna work on my game this week, hopefully a little bit more, and I may try to come up with something for the Gear VR to mess around with.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:46.000
I already have an idea of something that'd be kind of fun, so we will try that.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Alright, and my final thought is goodnight. We'll see you in seven days, everybody. Goodnight!

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:26.000
See you next week!

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:56.000
See you next week!
