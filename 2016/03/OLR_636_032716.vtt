Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 636 of our show for March the 27th of 2016.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
My name is Rob Roberts here to talk with you about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Live in studio with my co-hosts say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Sup

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hey how you doing?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm full

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Full of BS that she's going to spew all over the show tonight

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Girl please

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm just teasing you

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
After I bring you cookies

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
She didn't just bring me cookies, she brought me like my favorite cookies

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Macaroons

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Coconut and chocolate and I've already eaten four

01:16.000 --> 01:29.000
That's okay I've had about as many today. We had Belgian waffles and muffins and like all of the carby things in the world. Like looking at it would just give you diabetes by association

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
Well it's a holiday we earned it I guess. My mom called today and we were talking a little bit and she said you're still doing a show on Easter?

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
And I'm like yeah? And she's like how are you? I said it's me and my Jewish girlfriend. She doesn't care about Easter

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
I think most people that do Easter stuff kind of get it over with in the morning so I think usually by the evening everybody's kind of pretty free

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Except for unfortunately Techmaster Loki. He would be the exception of somebody that is doing something with Easter evening

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
Actually I think it's the fact I think he went to the Bay Area today for family stuff so sadly not joining us in the studio Techmaster Loki

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
But we do have filling in tonight we are happy to have somebody who doesn't have to work today due to the holiday

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Say hello everybody to Alan

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Hello

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
How are you doing?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Good

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Good to have you back on the show

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Thank you

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
You're going to be helping out with some of the news tonight and we'll talk to you a little later about your latest gaming addiction

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Yes

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
Because I can tell you first hand there is a game that he stays up until 3am playing every night and I'm always asking

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
How have you not finished this game yet? You are still playing it

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
I'll get into that there's a very specific reason I haven't finished the main story and I'll get into it

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Alright fair enough I'll leave you guys guessing over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
vognetwork.com

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
And if you are listening live head on over to our chat room live.vognetwork.com

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
But we do have some other very special guests in the studio tonight I want to introduce here at the top of the show tonight before we get into our gaming weeks

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
I've been promoting this for a couple weeks so this shouldn't surprise anybody but maybe they're new to the show or what have you

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
Welcome back to the studio from the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA, International Game Developers Association

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Say hello to Gabe

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Good evening

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
And Brianna

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Hi

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Hi how's it going you guys?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Fantastic

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Thank you for coming back

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Thank you for letting us come back

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm glad we didn't scare you off last time

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Never you'll take a lot more than that

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
God they just left a mess at the Colonial and no I'm just kidding we always do our best to clean our stuff up

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
But welcome back to the show

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Thank you so much it's an honor

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
I know you guys are here to talk about your big event here locally the Sacramento Indie Game Festival

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Did I get that right or is it the Indie Game Expo?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I always mess that up

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
It's a bunch of different things but it is the Sacramento Indie Arcade Expo

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
You know what people need to know it's Indie Games and it's fun and just be there like it doesn't matter what it's called

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
They can call it like Rainbows and Kittens Fest and you should just still go

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We should probably do that next year

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Those are actually two wonderful things I think you might even you know

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
There's something we can roll with that I smell unicorns versus bunny rabbits we can do something

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Well it is Easter so you know

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
That's true we totally could

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
But the SAC Indie Arcade is going to be in two weeks right now we won't be here next Sunday

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
I've told the listeners that I'm actually on a personal out of town trip so we won't be here next Sunday

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
But the Saturday after next which is April 9th is the event here in West Sacramento right?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Yup yup too big for Sacramento we gotta go West

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Go West

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes that's what I did

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
That's right

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah I came from New Jersey

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
That's right you came here from New Jersey settled a new life here in Sacramento and now it just keeps moving West

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
What do people have to look forward to at SAC Indie Arcade 2016?

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
I think the two words that and I've been trying to wrap my head around this

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Professionally fun

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
I think that's going to be the main thing for this event because you're going to have you're going to see an incredible amount of indie game developers

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
But you're also going to learn how to be one of them or work with one of them you know if you want to

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
It's you know it's that's essentially what this event is all about it's going to be fun a huge amount of fun

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
You know good good music gaming tournaments you know a lot of nerd banter and then but you're also going to learn

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
You're going to hear from a lot of experts and leaders in the industry within Sacramento and the Bay Area and beyond

05:45.000 --> 05:53.000
I learned honestly and this is not just a line I learned so much last year from attending just because you know

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Look we do we do talk about games we've been talking about them a very long time here at Orange Mountains Radio

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
But I don't know a lot when it comes to how to actually sit down and make one

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
You know granted I've done levels in ZZT which I'm very proud of on the PC

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
A little big planet or some of those get Mario maker love that one you know things that enable you know with those easy

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
Creation tools, but it I and I have found because we tried to do this thing earlier in the year the vogjam

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
And I I really tried to sit down and learn unity for me in my time

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
It was just a beast like it's so much work that goes into it

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
And I think you kind of have to you know know a little bit about you got to know a little bit of logic to understand programming too

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And yeah, you know that's like learning math some people are good at it some people need help

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
I think one of the you makes you makes it you made an interesting point

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I don't it's it's not just the because for me

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I thought it was all the animation the 3D graphics because that's what got my attention in the first place

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
But it's for but for me it's like what makes a fun game

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
You know like any you know the level design the level design aspect of it

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
And just knowing what game it starts with looking at a game that you that you adore with your heart

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
And then asking yourself how could I do better than that and then then coming to a lot of

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Forced realities where you know on one end

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
Damn, I'm gonna make this more fun than this you know because this inspired me and then on the other end

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
It's gonna be well. I don't have the budget to make something this big

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
How do I do better with less

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Well, but at the SAC indie arcade you know you can network with other people

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
And I know this is also through IGDA is that you know you don't necessarily have to be a unity beast

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
To be interested in IGDA because maybe you're somebody who wants to be a voice actor or a level designer

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Or a musician I know is a big one too

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
Yes, there are so many other elements that go into games that you don't necessarily have to be a game

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Like the actual game maker to get stuff out of IGDA

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah, and I'm living proof of that. I'm the idea person. That's me. I'm an idea man

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I just I you know for me I came to

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Accept and understand my limitations some years ago. You know I can't code. I can't do art

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I can't do animation as much as I love those things. I can't do it

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
So what good am I if I want to make if I want to start a game studio make a game at all

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So I said I can write and I can do a little bit of music

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Write my ideas down and then find someone who can hopefully believe in what I'm doing and that's that

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah, I remember one really awesome speaker you guys had I mean you guys had Kate the president of IGDA

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
Last year it was wonderful to hear her speak and to you know we were talking with her too

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
And that was right at all the height of some of the like Twitter drama last year

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah, and so you know having a very frank conversation about that

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
You know it was great, and she was very eloquent in the way. She was speaking about that so she was very great

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
I remember one of my favorite speakers you guys had last year very dynamic was this lady that you had from

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
I think she was like a business association downtown. I want to say it was like a women's business

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
But like she made it very clear like you don't necessarily have to be a woman to be in this association

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
And she it made me think about like oh my gosh

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
If I'm a game designer and I make my product and I want to you know

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
You know put it on unity

09:12.000 --> 09:15.640
And then it's like okay now I want to go on Steam Greenlight, and then all of a sudden. It's oh shit

09:15.640 --> 09:21.000
I'm a business owner mmm-hmm. I didn't even think about this end of thing we don't we know we don't we never do

09:21.000 --> 09:24.920
Yeah, never never we're so focused on the game. We're not thinking about the legalities

09:24.920 --> 09:27.720
We're not thinking about anything else. You know like oh my god

09:27.720 --> 09:33.000
I have to trademark my title because someone else is doing it in another country or in another state and whatever the case may be

09:33.000 --> 09:38.280
So and it's happened so even some of our own people here in Sacramento people had to change names last minute

09:38.280 --> 09:40.320
Oh, and and they would spend a good year

09:41.280 --> 09:45.760
Talking to their game about you know talking to their you about their game and sharing it and everything like that and all of a

09:45.760 --> 09:49.320
Sudden we see them again a couple months later, and it's a total different game title

09:49.320 --> 09:54.960
They were like what just happened, and then they're like remember that session. We've had some time ago. Oh

09:55.520 --> 10:00.040
Oh, I'm sorry so yeah, but but that's important like if we don't do that now

10:01.040 --> 10:07.540
When so yeah um and I just remember and I didn't get the sense that she was a big gamer

10:07.940 --> 10:14.020
But she was but she you know how I knew she was smart because she was really good at adapting and I swear she read

10:14.020 --> 10:18.060
It off some dude's t-shirt in the front row. She did she started going cuz she even delivered the line

10:18.060 --> 10:25.220
She goes it's dangerous to go alone and everybody in the audience cheers is like oh, yeah, this chick plays Zelda. She's hardcore, right?

10:25.940 --> 10:28.180
She read it off the dude's t-shirt in the front row

10:28.340 --> 10:33.740
She and she made it she made a point with it because she was right right and when you go into business

10:33.740 --> 10:36.460
That is a scary thing to take on when you are

10:36.460 --> 10:42.260
I just I love that she like made that up on the fly up. It was probably connected with the audience

10:42.260 --> 10:46.180
Yeah, it was by far the greatest part of the entire event the entire event was fantastic

10:46.180 --> 10:51.820
But when she said that I said we're not even an hour an hour and a half into this event and I'm done

10:51.820 --> 10:57.500
I could leave that's right. We could leave because I was crying Brianna was crying. We were we were dying

10:58.140 --> 11:01.740
We're done. Yeah, that's it ship at home all right awesome awesome

11:02.300 --> 11:06.320
Brianna I know you guys have been busy booking guests and events for this year

11:06.320 --> 11:11.480
Tell us a little bit about some of the things that people have to look forward to it sack indie arcade festival

11:11.480 --> 11:15.860
So in addition to the professional aspect where you'll get to hear from a speaker

11:16.540 --> 11:23.020
panel of speakers with from diverse areas of the game industry everything from education to

11:24.240 --> 11:26.240
What is it motion capture?

11:27.240 --> 11:32.160
Virtual reality even to some of the ethical portions you'll have a chance so if you just love playing games

11:32.160 --> 11:36.200
That's also what the Sacramento indie arcade is about we want you to come out have fun

11:36.840 --> 11:44.860
Bring your friends family cousins whoever you'll get to play some old retro console games by consolecade and cafe colonial

11:45.200 --> 11:51.600
They're hosting a little exhibit, and then we also have our friend Bill Kendrick with Atari party at a Dave love Atari party

11:51.600 --> 11:53.120
I went for the first time

11:53.160 --> 11:55.640
Between the last time you guys were here and this year

11:55.640 --> 11:58.160
I went for the first time what a great event that was Dan

11:58.160 --> 12:03.920
And I always participate every year with bringing our 5200 yeah, so awesome. Love it. I love that Atari's gonna be there

12:03.920 --> 12:11.500
Yes, Bill has been fantastic in helping us with them promotion for the event so he's gonna have a bigger setup this year

12:12.080 --> 12:14.080
And he's bringing his own volunteers

12:16.200 --> 12:22.980
So for people listening who may not have ever touched an Atari and you're local to Sacramento come on out and see what that's about

12:23.640 --> 12:25.000
You know it always gets me

12:25.000 --> 12:29.360
You know it always gets me in the fields as this like late 30-something jaded old gamer is

12:29.800 --> 12:33.980
When I go to these events where the Atari's are around and like seven-year-old kids are

12:34.680 --> 12:37.840
And I'm like oh my god. It's me, but like

12:38.560 --> 12:43.640
That was us, but this kid is like seeing kind of like what we went through like type of thing

12:43.640 --> 12:49.200
It's it's got to be the way like my parents feel when I watch like the Grapes of Wrath or something some old ass

12:50.200 --> 12:53.360
I mean, he's gotta be John Wayne like similar, right?

12:53.360 --> 12:53.840
I don't know

12:53.840 --> 12:57.360
But it's like it gets me in the fields and I see the kids playing it and they're actually having fun

12:57.360 --> 13:00.640
And they're not like going like it's all there

13:00.640 --> 13:06.880
It's why is it all green you know and I think what you brought up now really hit me in the heart last year when?

13:06.880 --> 13:13.160
I was just kind of observing our guests that came through is we have parents who have a you know background in Atari

13:13.160 --> 13:17.960
And that's what they used to play and now they're bringing their kids. I didn't expect as many families to come out as they did

13:18.640 --> 13:24.840
So that really you know melted my heart to see that and then we've also introduced board and card games this year

13:24.840 --> 13:30.640
So you'll get a chance to play new games by local board and card game developers as well, so we've got any developers

13:30.640 --> 13:32.640
We're gonna have capital fight district

13:33.640 --> 13:36.240
Taking care of our game tournaments. We have Street Fighter

13:37.160 --> 13:43.160
Super Smash Brothers, so it's gonna be an all-around are we having poking because I know how to button mash and poking

13:44.160 --> 13:46.160
Gabriel

13:47.320 --> 13:54.760
Well I don't think we might we might okay, yes can't confirm or deny okay cool come and find out

13:57.680 --> 13:59.920
That's okay, that's okay, if nothing else

13:59.920 --> 14:03.280
I'll bring my Wii U and you can find the poking over by vogue that works, too

14:03.600 --> 14:05.040
And we will be there

14:05.040 --> 14:07.160
We're gonna we're gonna be set up in the theater

14:07.640 --> 14:10.980
Helping to run all the panels and thank you for asking us to do that

14:10.980 --> 14:12.460
I'm so excited to be a part of that

14:12.460 --> 14:17.580
I'm so glad to have found you guys and you found us and it's a beautiful thing that that came together

14:17.580 --> 14:18.100
Yes

14:18.100 --> 14:23.460
anything like I said anything we can do to help and I do want to because I know we have an international we're very fortunate that

14:23.460 --> 14:28.020
We have an international audience that listens to Orange, Montreal. You know we do have a few listeners in Sacramento, and I'm always surprised

14:28.020 --> 14:29.260
I'm like oh you're local

14:29.260 --> 14:35.380
I never do that, but we have listeners that are in New York City or you know that are in Florida or you know Europe

14:35.380 --> 14:38.460
You know possibly even so they might be wondering like okay well

14:39.060 --> 14:43.300
Am I just am I gonna fast-forward through this cuz I don't live in Sacramento, so I can't go to this event

14:43.300 --> 14:45.140
I would say no for to read

14:45.140 --> 14:49.300
There's there's two very important reasons we still talk about this even though it might not be local for you

14:49.300 --> 14:51.300
and you can't realistically attend a

14:51.900 --> 14:55.840
You know I'm gonna pimp some sort of live stream. We're gonna be broadcasting this

14:56.660 --> 15:02.580
Didn't I hear this year? We're gonna be doing our best to do the vlog stream again on Saturday fingers crossed

15:03.020 --> 15:09.260
Our wife our Wi-Fi isn't it because it's a new location our Wi-Fi will not be having to go through a concrete wall this year

15:09.700 --> 15:15.020
So we're a lot more you know and I was even like just tell me where the damn box is

15:15.020 --> 15:16.660
I've got a 50-foot cord. We'll make it work

15:16.660 --> 15:19.700
We'll put a nice rug so people don't trip, but anyway all that stuff aside

15:19.700 --> 15:22.420
We're gonna do our best to do that, but I heard I don't know if this got worked out

15:22.420 --> 15:26.660
We're gonna do some well not us, but you guys are gonna be doing some twitch stuff too, right?

15:26.660 --> 15:32.100
Yes, our friend Jay with capital fight district is hopefully going to be streaming

15:32.580 --> 15:37.300
His tournaments and the event on twitch this year nice. That'd be great

15:37.740 --> 15:41.380
And then of course the second reason why I still think this is important is that okay?

15:41.380 --> 15:46.280
So we're talking about this here in Sacramento, and you might be thinking. Oh, I can't really go to that event well chances

15:46.280 --> 15:49.660
Are folks there's an IGDA chapter in your neck of the woods?

15:50.300 --> 15:52.540
They're probably doing an event like this

15:52.540 --> 15:54.540
Maybe not same time, but at some point

15:54.620 --> 16:00.760
So you know if you have any type of interest in games you seek it out if you're I imagine any major city in America

16:00.760 --> 16:06.300
There's probably an IGDA chapter there in addition to the IGDA chapters around the world if you are listening to

16:06.820 --> 16:12.960
Olr anywhere in the world and you hear about a certain game that we might talk about tonight or that Rob

16:13.560 --> 16:18.000
Mentions during the show you know our game developers sell their games internationally, too

16:18.000 --> 16:23.260
You can download them from the App Store you can go on steam, so we're really just kind of promoting

16:23.260 --> 16:25.900
What's here in Sacramento, but if you love Rob in the show?

16:27.040 --> 16:29.720
You might love some of the games that they're gonna talk about too

16:30.380 --> 16:34.460
Awesome yeah, I think I think that was the first place that Loki had done

16:34.460 --> 16:39.880
VR ever was that Sakai GDA last year, so you know we all get to try things for the first time

16:39.880 --> 16:45.760
And there were some really great games that were at the festival last year, so I'm looking forward to seeing how they've evolved

16:46.360 --> 16:50.040
Or what new stuff I'm gonna see this year. Do we get some new stuff this year?

16:50.040 --> 16:54.100
We do get some new stuff. We have some developers coming up from Southern, California also

16:54.920 --> 16:59.580
Nice yeah, we have one from yeah red the game is called red cobra

16:59.940 --> 17:03.360
And they're coming all the way from San Diego, so yeah

17:03.360 --> 17:07.460
I had connected with them a few times when they did some indie events down there

17:08.340 --> 17:13.900
And pretty crazy move from you to just like you know oh going to San Diego to meet a bunch of strange people

17:13.900 --> 17:16.760
I ain't never met before, but that's how determined I was to

17:17.340 --> 17:24.020
Try to somehow create some sort of inner inner connectivity within the indie scene even if it meant me only going a couple of times

17:24.020 --> 17:27.260
But they remember me we all stay in touch

17:27.260 --> 17:30.060
And and now anytime they try to do something

17:30.060 --> 17:34.180
They're like can you help us or are you coming down and you know the last couple times?

17:34.180 --> 17:39.980
I wasn't able to but it's fine because now they're coming here, and that still says something that made my

17:40.580 --> 17:46.460
Little investment in that trip worth it because now I've given them the opportunity where they would have not

17:46.620 --> 17:52.220
Had an opportunity otherwise and now they're gonna be able to tell their people down there like well

17:52.380 --> 17:55.940
It's not happening in San Diego. Why don't we go up here road trip?

17:56.260 --> 18:03.940
So yeah, so we've got you know we definitely our arms have been stretched out a bit further this time, and it's it's wonderful well

18:03.940 --> 18:05.720
Congratulations, that's awesome

18:05.720 --> 18:09.560
And I know even there was some stuff that I remember going to an event up in Reno

18:09.700 --> 18:14.240
Yes, I know you're in touch with them mm-hmm, so yeah, you kind of get get all over yep

18:14.240 --> 18:17.180
You're making a name for Sacramento. Yeah, we're the cat. We're the capital

18:17.700 --> 18:19.460
We have to

18:19.460 --> 18:23.100
Going to our chat room over at live dot vog network calm

18:23.540 --> 18:26.580
Why why are one of our favorite indie developers is in the chat room

18:26.580 --> 18:30.820
We like why we are because he's actually made games based on inside jokes on orange on radio. I

18:31.740 --> 18:38.700
I literally shit you not. It's he made a game called pixel shits. That was based off a joke here on olr

18:38.700 --> 18:41.260
That's like an Atari remember how I came up with the name

18:41.260 --> 18:44.760
I don't I don't either, but it was an attorney like he literally like it's this Atari

18:45.020 --> 18:49.300
2600 style game where you actually like little dudes are running through a park

18:49.340 --> 18:54.580
And you actually leave little shit piles for them to get stuck in and then they don't make it across the park

18:54.660 --> 19:02.060
But the this is the this is the part that like like every game needs that twist that just makes it like oh my god

19:02.060 --> 19:09.080
This is amazing the twist in this game is when you when your poo meter runs out you go to the Taco Bell in the corner

19:15.060 --> 19:17.860
Yes, well wasn't that our White Castle I mean absolutely

19:19.300 --> 19:20.620
That's wonderful

19:20.620 --> 19:25.860
But also why we are he was actually showing at magfest and we just talked about last week his game

19:26.060 --> 19:31.180
Multitasking got greenlit and a big part of that was because the word-of-mouth he got at magfest

19:31.180 --> 19:35.460
Yeah, so getting your game out to these festivals. Yeah, you have to yeah, you have to yeah

19:35.980 --> 19:41.640
there is a there is a challenge of course being you know I mean and I know this because I

19:42.420 --> 19:48.560
co-run the department for magfest at the indie showcase, but you know because we had I think we had

19:49.300 --> 19:51.300
for the latest round

19:51.620 --> 19:56.500
Yeah for this latest event. We I think had hundred fifty two hundred submissions

19:56.500 --> 20:01.400
Oh my god, and we only accepted like it probably a third of them. If that how do you say? No

20:01.940 --> 20:06.780
There you know and and and I mean this for any and I apologize

20:06.780 --> 20:11.460
Well, I sort of apologize to any developers out there who really work hard but may have missed things

20:11.460 --> 20:15.140
But I don't apologize to those developers who really never bothered to make the effort

20:15.500 --> 20:22.100
Because for some it was very easy to say no because they just never bothered sure and I mean that in the nicest most adult

20:22.100 --> 20:24.500
Mature way possible. You have to have a little bit of enthusiasm

20:24.940 --> 20:26.300
Yeah, yeah

20:26.300 --> 20:26.820
Yeah

20:26.820 --> 20:34.020
and you know when when someone's doing it for the actual reason and when whether it's is if

20:34.020 --> 20:36.100
Are they just trying to make a quick buck?

20:36.100 --> 20:43.460
You're gonna you can tell you can absolutely tell but when there's heart in it you you definitely see that that's when it gets difficult

20:43.460 --> 20:47.700
Because then when you see others that have maybe one game was made with heart

20:47.700 --> 20:52.540
But then there was another one made with heart but more fully fleshed out then. Yeah it that's where it becomes a little difficult

20:52.540 --> 20:58.180
So yeah, very very challenging and and you know, fortunately for us at the indie arcade

20:58.620 --> 21:02.000
For for our event we haven't I haven't gone there yet

21:02.000 --> 21:06.140
I've essentially put blind faith in my people because a lot of them I already know what they're doing

21:06.420 --> 21:08.380
So it's not it's not a challenge

21:08.380 --> 21:12.900
So it's to see who's doing what and I just I have to make this clear in chat because why we are is like is

21:12.900 --> 21:14.900
This why I got wait-listed at magfest

21:15.580 --> 21:20.620
Gabe did not do magfest this year. I didn't do that. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, he did not do magfest

21:22.060 --> 21:28.340
No, where is why anyway he is out in New York. Yeah, my neighbor my old neighbor cool

21:28.340 --> 21:32.420
Well, have you ever come to Sacramento dude? Yeah, I'll let you you're accepted right right then and there

21:33.020 --> 21:35.620
We will talk off air because my understanding is that could be happening

21:36.780 --> 21:39.620
At least for a visit at least. Okay, so all right

21:40.380 --> 21:44.280
Let's see also comments in chat actually why we're had said something else to that

21:44.280 --> 21:48.180
I thought was worth repeating here over from our chat room live dog network calm

21:48.460 --> 21:54.260
Why are say gameplay design level design art design story design if applicable game creation?

21:54.420 --> 21:57.820
Involves all of those and then talking about the business

21:57.820 --> 22:03.080
Why we are says it helps to have a business mindset or think about it in the back of your mind

22:03.960 --> 22:09.200
SSJ 100 Matt says I just looked it up and I see a few IG DA New York City chapters

22:09.200 --> 22:11.200
Yes, there's probably one in each borough

22:12.720 --> 22:17.920
Yeah, I think there yeah, I think there might be I think there's one IG DA Brooklyn or something like that

22:17.920 --> 22:22.400
Yeah, but even IG DA New Jersey they have they have their own and you know and Boston, you know

22:22.400 --> 22:26.280
Not that far away everything so close up there. So yeah, just a couple hours away

22:26.280 --> 22:28.680
So yeah, they have a whole ton of options out that way

22:28.680 --> 22:32.240
So and I like the point that he made though about all those other aspects

22:32.240 --> 22:36.680
You know story level sound, you know, they're all all that adds up to

22:37.480 --> 22:41.260
Cohesion cohesiveness and consistency. So yeah, beautiful good

22:41.360 --> 22:45.960
You kind of have to have a good you also have to be a bit of a people person

22:45.960 --> 22:47.960
I think to learn some of those skills

22:50.480 --> 22:57.160
Even if you don't necessarily get a long hundred percent of the time like to be business professional in working with people like that

22:57.320 --> 23:01.200
That that doesn't come naturally for everybody. No and you know something

23:01.200 --> 23:04.400
I'm super relieved you said this because

23:05.080 --> 23:12.000
Just yesterday we had our game jam and one at one of the one of the teammates on the progressive game

23:12.000 --> 23:18.600
Jam team made a made a very striking remark and it's something that I've said for a very long time and I would typically get

23:18.600 --> 23:24.920
The you know tilted face response like what are you talking about? But he said I'm an introvert. I

23:25.760 --> 23:27.760
Under no circumstances

23:27.800 --> 23:33.120
Want to deal with a bunch of people I just want to make my game and sell it and that's it

23:33.120 --> 23:39.360
And he was like, I'm a programmer. I don't like having to deal with others like that. But that is

23:40.520 --> 23:47.480
Absolutely, like I get that because I've said the same thing for a very very long time. We are all very nervous

23:48.040 --> 23:50.040
To just get it out there

23:50.200 --> 23:56.700
Because and that's why we forget so often about the legalities and the business aspect because we're so dead focused on hoping that

23:57.200 --> 23:59.520
someone is gonna like what we've made and

24:00.640 --> 24:04.640
And and I'm telling you and you know, we think when we hear about all these

24:05.080 --> 24:08.080
I don't know if you know when we hear about these, you know

24:08.080 --> 24:14.040
These sensitive comments and the sensitive reactions and and the people the person outside looking in says damn

24:14.040 --> 24:18.960
They're really kind of overdramatic a little over theatrical about it all but not necessarily

24:19.520 --> 24:25.820
Because we are so consumed by the fear of being accepted just once

24:26.440 --> 24:30.760
Not consistently just once and even for me

24:30.760 --> 24:38.720
That was a huge thing for me that I had to overcome as outgoing as I had been in other aspects of my life

24:38.720 --> 24:41.540
But when it but when it comes to believing in your dream

24:41.800 --> 24:47.120
It's you you're so focused on you believing in it because it took you so long to believe in it yourself

24:47.600 --> 24:52.360
That you have to hope to God that someone else is gonna believe in it, too

24:52.360 --> 24:56.120
That's a great point because I'm an extrovert by nature. All right, so

24:57.000 --> 24:59.400
What a shot I have my moments

24:59.400 --> 25:03.360
Well, you know, I'm an extrovert by nature and sometimes like I I even get the mindset where it's like

25:03.360 --> 25:05.440
Why can't you just why you just get up there and talk about her?

25:05.440 --> 25:08.480
Why can't you just make that call, you know those types of things and you know

25:08.480 --> 25:13.320
So an Allen is usually the one that actually kind of grounds me a little bit and will you know?

25:13.320 --> 25:16.800
because he's the introvert and we'll kind of remind me that like, you know, I

25:17.280 --> 25:19.600
Doesn't come that way. It's not it's not like that all the time

25:19.600 --> 25:20.200
Yeah

25:20.200 --> 25:25.700
We want it to be if we want it because we're so excited and that and you'll see us because when an introvert gets super

25:25.700 --> 25:31.520
Excited you can't stop us because it happens it happens to us because we just start we're on it and on it and on it

25:31.560 --> 25:37.760
So yeah, I mean so when he so when when our colleagues said that yesterday, I was like, yeah

25:38.720 --> 25:44.380
Absolutely, absolutely resounding. So yeah, you know, but that's why we that's why this our chapter is

25:45.220 --> 25:46.580
To help

25:46.580 --> 25:50.980
Relieve those issues, you know relieve those issues or at least give some balance to that

25:50.980 --> 25:55.940
that's why the indie arcade is a celebration of those things because it's like we're giving you the

25:56.140 --> 25:57.060
opportunity to

25:57.060 --> 26:03.100
kind of break from your shell even just a little bit even if you just crack the shell just a little bit and then

26:03.340 --> 26:06.380
give yourself we're gonna help you give you that courage to

26:06.940 --> 26:12.140
Be able to show your game to the general public and and and feel have that bit of confidence

26:12.660 --> 26:15.260
That holy crap, they actually do like it

26:15.660 --> 26:16.700
We're at this

26:16.700 --> 26:20.020
Conversation is getting a huge response in our chat over at live fog network calm

26:20.180 --> 26:24.180
Dungeon buster saying there are quite a few devs that are amazingly savvy creators

26:24.180 --> 26:29.060
But terrible a business part of a good Kickstarter pitch is to make everyone excited about your game

26:29.060 --> 26:32.320
If you can't do that, then why should I fund you? Yep

26:32.820 --> 26:35.820
Yyr says everything's being spoken is 100% true

26:36.220 --> 26:40.460
It helps 200% if you love your game enough that even if nobody else loves it

26:40.460 --> 26:43.740
You will still be satisfied with it. That way you have nothing to lose

26:44.740 --> 26:48.140
Act F just says this applies on so many aspects

26:48.500 --> 26:54.260
Very true. Same thing same thing even from my side where it's like I'm not really making a game, but I have like this podcast

26:54.260 --> 26:58.060
But if I can't speak positively about the podcast if I'm like, yeah

26:58.060 --> 27:01.140
I have this show and it's kind of it's kind of it's really nerdy

27:01.180 --> 27:05.180
You know, it's no biggie, you know, if I if I sell it like that people gonna be okay, then I won't bother

27:05.500 --> 27:09.980
But you know if I'm excited about like yeah, you know, we've been going a long time and we love games

27:09.980 --> 27:15.580
You know, then people get more enthusiastic about it. So that's just that's just goes on anything. Sure. Absolutely. Absolutely

27:16.580 --> 27:20.580
Brianna tell us a little bit about and I don't know if you know this off the top of your head

27:20.580 --> 27:26.340
But I'm hoping you you know some of them tell us about some of the speakers that we're gonna hear from this year at IGDA

27:26.340 --> 27:28.340
Cuz I know you have a new lineup this year. Yes

27:28.900 --> 27:31.720
So our keynote speaker is going to be Kat went

27:32.320 --> 27:36.940
She was the 2015 MVP as voted by the IGDA

27:37.740 --> 27:43.340
She's one of the founders of the women in gaming for the International Game Developers Association

27:44.340 --> 27:46.300
she's very

27:46.300 --> 27:54.160
Proactive about diversity in games making sure that both genders are well represented. She's about community. So she's gonna be speaking on that

27:55.340 --> 28:01.180
Next up. We'll have Ian Pollock. He is the director of the graduate program at CSU East Bay

28:02.100 --> 28:04.900
he takes game designing and

28:05.380 --> 28:09.220
Jant game jams to a whole different level. He's very big on

28:10.100 --> 28:13.900
Well in the East Bay is like where a lot of your games come from. Yes

28:13.900 --> 28:16.700
So it makes a lot of sense East Bay South Bay. It's like

28:17.220 --> 28:21.260
Funny enough though the IGDA chapters out there haven't been too involved

28:21.260 --> 28:25.500
But we've been mentoring at their game jams Gabriel and I have interesting

28:25.500 --> 28:30.300
So Sacramento has been pouring into the East Bay and we invited Ian to come up

28:30.940 --> 28:37.580
He is big on incorporating multiple disciplines whether you're a science major or you have an art background

28:39.000 --> 28:42.280
We want he wants to create games based around things like that

28:42.700 --> 28:49.300
We also have our local developer from rocktastic games. William Tan will be speaking to give a perspective on

28:49.940 --> 28:56.580
What indie developers go through he's been in the industry for a while now and he's had a lot of success in the mobile side

28:56.580 --> 29:00.620
So now he's developing for console and he's gonna share his perspective on things like that

29:01.940 --> 29:03.500
Michelle Hill

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
she is

29:05.620 --> 29:12.500
We have Michelle Hill who is a Sacramento native who found out that Sacramento has an IGDA chapter

29:12.500 --> 29:18.620
She was an IGDA scholar in years past had the opportunity to learn from triple-a studios in the Bay Area now

29:18.620 --> 29:24.700
She works in the bay, but is returning back home to give back to her local community. She'll be giving a speech

29:25.540 --> 29:32.700
I'm sorry. It's very I got super excited about her because she's our first person from a triple-a studio

29:33.100 --> 29:38.300
She's from 2k games. She's a technical animator for 2k games. She's actually working on

29:38.860 --> 29:40.620
Oh my god

29:40.620 --> 29:48.220
She's she's working on Mafia 3 and she which I can't wait for and she's working on the the XCOM sequel as well

29:48.380 --> 29:53.940
So she kind of knows her stuff and we had the pleasure of meeting her at the most recent GDC

29:54.020 --> 29:59.940
so the fact that we have her speaking on both the benefit the pros and cons of working on indie and

30:00.460 --> 30:01.460
triple-a

30:01.460 --> 30:07.500
So yeah, we have someone for 2k games coming through for that which means we hope more from 2k game shows up down the road

30:07.500 --> 30:09.500
But anyway, I'm sorry. Yeah

30:10.260 --> 30:18.140
Yeah, she was previously with an indie studio and in 2015 they were nominated for a game award out of GDC

30:18.940 --> 30:26.060
So she'll be coming back and then we also have ninja pandas who have been helping and teaching game development courses over the last year

30:26.060 --> 30:30.080
So husband and wife team JT and Claire, they're wonderful

30:30.460 --> 30:35.020
They're relocated here to Sacramento to help grow the scene as well and their

30:35.620 --> 30:39.480
Prior experience their professors. They were professors out of CSU East Bay, too

30:40.180 --> 30:41.420
and

30:41.420 --> 30:43.580
Who am I missing? Am I missing anyone?

30:43.580 --> 30:50.060
We have seven speakers, so the keynote starts at 1030 on the spot she is

30:52.020 --> 30:56.440
The keynote starts at 1030 and we go until 3 so it's gonna be a full day

30:57.020 --> 31:02.940
Lots of learning lots of Q&A will be available and like Gabriel was saying earlier in terms of the scene

31:02.940 --> 31:07.020
like it's just two people kind of coordinating this whole event right now and

31:07.540 --> 31:09.060
You guys have been working your tissues

31:10.060 --> 31:13.380
Gotten to know the developers and the community and

31:14.020 --> 31:20.740
It just makes me so proud to be able to host something like this and to incorporate our local indie media also in our

31:21.020 --> 31:26.940
Podcasters and our twitch streamers. It's really a wonderful labor of love and to see that you guys are excited about it, too

31:27.140 --> 31:31.540
Makes all of this work and my sleepless nights and my dreams

31:31.540 --> 31:33.540
Thanks

31:34.020 --> 31:40.340
Everything worth it, you know, I'm a casual gamer so to speak I do more of I am the businessperson. I'm the numbers

31:40.340 --> 31:45.020
I'm the legalities kind of girl, you know, I'm not a creator. I'm not a developer

31:45.020 --> 31:49.900
I have a love for music but to hear and experience what all of these devs are going through

31:49.900 --> 31:51.900
I don't have the patience for any of that

31:51.940 --> 31:59.420
But if I can create a platform for everyone to show off what they are passionate about that makes me so happy

32:02.380 --> 32:04.380
Oh

32:04.420 --> 32:11.300
Yeah, I was like wait I have notes so black shell media so we'll have black shell media coming they'll be they're coming from Southern, California

32:12.260 --> 32:18.940

32:19.580 --> 32:25.900
Indie game development and then video game bang will also be there as well, which I love that name. Yeah, just saying

32:43.420 --> 32:45.420
Little too busty to be a granddad

32:50.380 --> 32:53.140
Yeah, well, yes, so we have video game bang

And if you want to follow the chapter, you can go to at I GDA underscore Sacramento

33:35.460 --> 33:39.500
Awesome. I want to ask you guys real quickly before we get into like, you know

33:39.500 --> 33:43.620
The rest of the show and the news and all that stuff real quick because you brought up GDC and that reminded me

33:43.620 --> 33:43.980
Oh, yeah

33:43.980 --> 33:46.540
We have people that went to GDC in the room because you know

33:46.540 --> 33:49.660
We don't that's a little bit out of our scope for what we're able to do

33:49.700 --> 33:55.260
But you guys actually both went and you got to take in everything at GDC just some quick impressions on this year's

33:55.860 --> 33:59.380
GDC is something that really caught your attention that you really enjoyed or what have you

33:59.660 --> 34:04.380
So I spent a lot of time in the GDC play area. They had some alternate

34:05.060 --> 34:11.800
Alternative controllers they had a controller this year where you lick it and that's what moves I kid you not

34:12.580 --> 34:16.880
The eyes and in the studio just their eyes got so big right now

34:17.200 --> 34:20.240
Especially since I have a macaroon in my mouth, okay

34:21.120 --> 34:26.600
Like when people use the oculus rift you have the sanitary wipes so you can wipe it down

34:26.600 --> 34:29.100
So, you know, you don't give somebody Zika virus or whatever

34:29.640 --> 34:35.680
But I don't want to lick something that some complete stranger especially at a gaming conference has licked

34:35.920 --> 34:40.680
Do you want ants cuz that's how you get ants? Yeah, if you see a demo kiosk for that at Best Buy now

34:40.680 --> 34:42.480
I'm not using that

34:42.520 --> 34:46.240
So if you're near a PC or your mobile phone look up planet liquor

34:46.240 --> 34:50.320
I think that's the name of it planet liquor and and the arms in this right now

34:50.320 --> 34:57.440
They were switching out the pieces obviously, you know each new player gets a new one. I know they're on Instagram if you look up Instagram

34:57.440 --> 35:01.580
Oh, oh joy you it there were three different things to lick

35:04.820 --> 35:06.820
You gotta lick it

35:12.720 --> 35:16.520
Yeah, you put you bring my god you bring the controller to your mouth

35:20.840 --> 35:23.880
That was at the game developers conference my friends

35:25.280 --> 35:31.300
Now put that with the virtual reality stuff and you're good to go and I can't wait for what porn hubs gonna make

35:32.760 --> 35:37.340
Coming but a bump you could just nickname this girlfriend pleaser the game

35:38.300 --> 35:45.000
It's a strength it's a strengthener for that particular oral muscle Wow, wowie Wow Wow Wow Wow

35:47.580 --> 35:49.580
All right anyway

35:51.260 --> 35:55.760
So you got to lick things that strangers had like before you

35:59.380 --> 36:03.760
How was your experience did you lick anything nope, just my pride

36:03.760 --> 36:05.760
So

36:06.560 --> 36:13.460
Yep, nope, not at all. Not at all. So not at all. So I can't even follow up on that one at all. I

36:14.240 --> 36:15.480
I

36:15.480 --> 36:21.000
Had the pleasure of experience of I shouldn't even say pleasure Jesus worries. Everything's gonna sound suggestive

36:21.000 --> 36:25.160
I'm so sorry everybody, but so part of my experience with GDC

36:25.160 --> 36:31.880
I had I got a got accepted into a new boot camp that they introduced called

36:32.160 --> 36:34.640
amplifying voices and I and I

36:35.120 --> 36:42.480
submitted for it for this boot camp and the idea behind it was it was about growing leaders within different communities and you know that

36:42.480 --> 36:47.640
Were helped contributing to the industry somehow and so I submitted and I got accepted

36:47.640 --> 36:54.200
So I would so we saw I was part of the very first class to you know of 30 to you know

36:54.200 --> 36:56.080
actually beach be like

36:56.080 --> 36:58.080
mentored and coached on how to

36:58.400 --> 37:03.720
You know, you know speak better than you already do now be a better leader, you know

37:03.720 --> 37:06.080
Continue to be a great leader in your community so on and so forth

37:06.520 --> 37:09.480
My coach happened to be the marketing director for Oculus Rift

37:09.520 --> 37:13.560
So so yes, I actually got to meet her and she was she was really cool

37:13.560 --> 37:19.240
And you know, we got I got to meet Robin Robin Haniki from that game company who now runs her own

37:19.880 --> 37:27.040
Fun phenomena so indie game studio you got to go to like the equivalent of like when a seven-year-old wants to go to space camp

37:28.440 --> 37:32.640
Just got to do. Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was

37:33.360 --> 37:39.400
It was extremely uplifting. It was extremely uplifting that day. And so and so with that, you know, yeah

37:39.440 --> 37:44.560
So then I got to see you know when I was able to go, you know other other facets of the event

37:44.720 --> 37:46.320
You know a couple different sessions

37:46.320 --> 37:46.480
Oh

37:46.480 --> 37:52.880
I a lot I actually invested a was a I was fortunate enough to have my my 3d art director of my NASA game studio

37:52.880 --> 37:56.680
Team to attend the different animation boot camps that were that were there

37:56.680 --> 37:59.700
And he said they were absolutely incredible. He got to meet some of like his biggest

38:00.440 --> 38:05.520
Inspirations, you know for different game studios. I liked and this is me

38:06.040 --> 38:11.720
With the whole pathless traveled mentality is you know where if I see something trendy?

38:12.360 --> 38:18.300
Buzzwordy I get irritated real quick and I'm like, okay. I'm already tired of it

38:18.960 --> 38:21.800
But yet we talked that you know, there's VR

38:22.360 --> 38:23.800
alternate AR

38:23.800 --> 38:29.080
Very that was the thing and it it was exciting but it got me super nervous

38:29.200 --> 38:30.520
It's like okay

38:30.520 --> 38:32.960
Are we really that ready yet?

38:32.960 --> 38:38.880
I'm like because they kind of did the same thing with like the big with like the big TVs back in the day

38:38.880 --> 38:43.460
It's like oh you got to watch this and you know, you gotta you gotta get this TV now and you know

38:43.800 --> 38:47.800
Look what they're trying to do with 4k now. It's like not gonna happen for a while. So and

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
But anyway, you know all that all that aside

38:51.320 --> 38:53.320
it was

38:53.440 --> 39:01.280
Very incredible event and probably the best that that you know minus some funny antics that happened throughout the event

39:02.280 --> 39:06.280
Thanks, Microsoft and things like that. And I think Bree wants to contribute on that. Oh, yeah

39:06.280 --> 39:08.720
Well, it was their 30-year celebration, too

39:09.160 --> 39:14.620
So they had a whole 80s section like a throwback to how GDC first started

39:15.200 --> 39:20.200
You know the humble beginnings at someone's home. I think it was so they did a little throwback section

39:20.200 --> 39:27.720
But yeah, Gabe was saying a lot more virtual reality. They did a combination GDC VR D VR DC

39:27.720 --> 39:34.240
Yeah this year. So instead of just having one expo hall with you know, oculus and you know, the major game players

39:34.240 --> 39:35.800
It was throughout the whole thing

39:35.800 --> 39:42.960
So there was not a section that you could go without having a headset on someone lingering through the halls. I

39:45.040 --> 39:47.620
Heard there was just a ton of VR GDC this year

39:47.620 --> 39:52.460
So it's gonna be interesting to see how that plays out in the living room a year or two from now be very interesting

39:52.460 --> 39:54.720
Well, your friend is all about it. That's right

39:57.300 --> 40:03.900
Looking at chat over at live dog network comm sg 100 Matt says space camp and he didn't even have to play double dare

40:04.260 --> 40:09.000
No, he didn't he didn't and I don't think there was a physical challenge at GDC

40:09.660 --> 40:14.420
Actually, Bree might have done the physical challenge at the licking station that might have been yeah

40:14.420 --> 40:16.760
It's kind of like they they were a team there anyway

40:17.940 --> 40:19.940
No comment. Oh

40:20.300 --> 40:21.900
My gosh. All right

40:21.900 --> 40:24.500
This has been too much fun. So anyway, uh, sac I GDA

40:25.100 --> 40:30.420
The indie game Expo is gonna be next or excuse me two weeks from yesterday

40:30.940 --> 40:34.540
Yes on April 9th in West Sacramento at the West Sacramento Convention Center

40:34.740 --> 40:40.500
But worldwide via streaming and all the all this tweets and things you're gonna see come out of it

40:40.500 --> 40:42.500
Yes, so very excited for the event

40:43.500 --> 40:44.220

40:51.580 --> 40:55.060
We're gonna move on with some of the news and things we were gonna get into on the show

40:55.060 --> 40:57.500
But you guys will hopefully stay for a little while and chat with us about

40:57.780 --> 41:01.180
This week in gaming news and some of the latest and greatest what's going on

41:01.180 --> 41:08.660
We do always like to start off the show here talking about start off ha ha talking about our gaming weeks. So dark Sakura

41:08.660 --> 41:11.660
Let's start over with you tonight. What kinds of video games have you been playing this week?

41:12.580 --> 41:17.300
Dan and I finally started the remaster of Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and

41:18.460 --> 41:21.100
it's funny because I named my cat Midna and

41:22.500 --> 41:23.780
she

41:23.780 --> 41:28.120
hopped up on the TV while we played her introduction scene and

41:29.260 --> 41:33.420
Just started looking at the TV and she hardly ever does that when we're home watching stuff

41:33.620 --> 41:40.740
So she was up on the TV in front of the TV and behind our center speaker and she's like I'm in a video game

41:41.620 --> 41:43.620
Yeah cat get down

41:45.140 --> 41:46.500
So

41:46.500 --> 41:52.460
And then I played a little bit more Dungan Rumpa. I had to take a little bit of a break

41:52.460 --> 41:54.460
Just because I've had a really busy week

41:54.660 --> 41:59.760
And I should change schedules at work. So like now I'm you know able to stay for the entire show

42:00.420 --> 42:05.600
And I got my my new amiibo. I got my Timmy and Tommy nook

42:06.420 --> 42:09.780
for Animal Crossing because the ones I'm collecting are on the Animal Crossing ones and

42:09.780 --> 42:16.940
So I I haven't played them in happy home designer yet, but I did do Roper's house

42:17.540 --> 42:19.060
so

42:19.060 --> 42:25.980
The happy home designer is like stupidly fun. I'm also still playing Heroes of Dragon Age. Mm-hmm, and

42:26.660 --> 42:28.100
I'm

42:28.100 --> 42:36.300
Level seven in ingress now. Congrats. Thank you. And I have I think I might have pissed off that Smurf who?

42:36.300 --> 42:42.700
Tried to take my home thing because in retaliation I took out eight of his

42:44.620 --> 42:48.620
That's what the game is all about getting back at people sorry not sorry

42:49.340 --> 42:55.260
And that's it. Awesome. All right, let's go over to Alan. Let's talk about let's talk about your gaming week

42:55.260 --> 42:57.480
I'm low or year. How you doing?

42:58.020 --> 43:00.740
Good good. What kind of games you've been playing this week fallout?

43:01.700 --> 43:05.380
Fallout one. Yeah, I played and beat that did you yeah, that's right

43:05.380 --> 43:11.020
You went back and actually played follow one and two because I have the discs from when I bought them from the early 90s

43:11.020 --> 43:15.380
So no actually late 90s early 2000s. They still work, of course, and I was like

43:15.980 --> 43:21.340
Apparently the first one if you have fought if you cheat and follow a walkthrough and I'm like, I'm I'm a grown adult

43:21.340 --> 43:23.620
I don't have time. Just tell me tell me where to go

43:24.140 --> 43:26.140
It's actually a fairly short game

43:26.460 --> 43:29.600
The first fallout so I played that but I mostly been playing fallout 4

43:29.640 --> 43:35.960
And all of the mods that have come out for it in spite of the fact that the creation kit isn't officially out yet

43:35.960 --> 43:37.480
from Bethesda

43:37.480 --> 43:43.560
So that's cool. So you will play this game till like 3 in the morning. Yeah, how have you not beat a game yet?

43:44.440 --> 43:47.800

43:49.440 --> 43:50.760
There are

43:50.760 --> 43:58.200
four factions and the main story only goes so far and then you complete the main story by siding with one of these

43:58.600 --> 44:02.040
Factions and then from that point on the how the main story

44:02.040 --> 44:07.800
I mean ultimately it all goes to the same ending but it's just who's alive and who isn't there's the neutral faction

44:08.760 --> 44:13.920
There's like faction a versus B that if you side with one you have to kill the other and then there's like the quote-unquote

44:13.960 --> 44:19.800
evil faction all four my point is all four are lame and I don't know who I don't want I don't know who I want to

44:19.980 --> 44:21.600
stake my claim with because I'm like

44:21.600 --> 44:28.180
Who's the least guys are all boring or you always all have like really glaring moral problems that my character doesn't agree with

44:28.200 --> 44:30.200
Where's the party faction?

44:32.120 --> 44:37.120
Because there's the cool Marines in the iron armor suits

44:37.120 --> 44:45.180
But they're like kill everybody that aren't that that isn't human including androids and then there's the the pro Android faction

44:45.180 --> 44:46.680
but they like

44:46.680 --> 44:50.440
Will like erase their memories and give them a new life and I'm like wolf the Android

44:51.360 --> 44:57.020
Freed themselves because they have autonomy. Why would you want to delete who they are in the name of saving them?

44:57.020 --> 45:00.460
So like everyone's it's so everyone's lame. So I love this

45:00.460 --> 45:07.000
So, uh, so our chat room in response to you being like everybody's lame SG 100 Matt says so it's like the presidential race

45:10.340 --> 45:16.540
Are we talking about the Republican side because that's like there is yeah, there isn't a single horse in that race. No politics

45:16.540 --> 45:18.540
No politics now. All right

45:19.420 --> 45:25.340
Yeah, so that's all so I'm I'm trying to get my affinity with all of the companions up

45:25.340 --> 45:27.940
Oh you trying to romance everybody

45:28.460 --> 45:33.220
well, not what you get a perk if you get someone to like really really like you and I have

45:33.580 --> 45:39.700
Strong who's like the super mutant giant who just who basically likes it when you like if you take the cannibalism perk which no thanks

45:39.700 --> 45:41.700
I'm not doing that if you eat

45:41.700 --> 45:46.180
Like he likes that that that's the kind of stuff you have to do to get him to like you and you're trying to romance

45:46.180 --> 45:50.840
Him no, he's not romanceable, but he's still a companion. Okay, but one thing about fallout

45:51.880 --> 45:54.580
You can romance as many characters

45:55.340 --> 46:01.180
There are 14 companions and I think like seven or eight of them are romanceable so you can be like sister wives

46:01.540 --> 46:07.540
Yeah, you yeah, I'm I've I've maxed out McCready and Hancock and I'm in a relationship with both of them

46:08.980 --> 46:14.420
Cuz modern cuz normally in Dragon Age, there's the there's the jealous bitch conversation

46:15.340 --> 46:21.860
And with Mass Effect 1 with either Ashley and Liara or Liara and Caden. There's the jealous bitch conversation line

46:22.380 --> 46:25.780
So we compared notes and we need to have a conversation with you

46:26.660 --> 46:32.940
About what's going on and you need to pick and it's like okay $60 for this. Can I just you a ho?

46:34.140 --> 46:36.140
Yeah

46:37.580 --> 46:40.660
Yeah, exactly but with follow forks like do what you want

46:42.180 --> 46:47.260
Do who you want whenever you want good times one of these days off to sit down and play that game

46:47.260 --> 46:50.980
But I just I don't with all you know, you know, you're the best Allen

46:50.980 --> 46:56.620
But I just don't want to become you when it comes to fall out and I'm worried that I might go down

46:56.620 --> 46:57.980
You're totally not wired that way

46:57.980 --> 47:03.340
I have that very I have very introverted an addictive personality that once I find a game that's doing it for me

47:03.340 --> 47:10.180
That is all I play and then all of a sudden I get burned out. I'm like I've 500 hours of Skyrim is enough

47:10.180 --> 47:12.180
I'm not gonna play Skyrim ever again

47:12.580 --> 47:17.140
Then like with and then you'll be like, why aren't you playing this game? Oh that game. I'm not playing that anymore

47:18.020 --> 47:21.060
What happened you've been playing that game non-stop for three months and I moved on

47:21.780 --> 47:26.260
Yes, it's like something like he just dumps one and give another that's called binge gaming

47:28.900 --> 47:31.540
Let's see why we are says the main quest is pretty long on

47:33.420 --> 47:38.220
I had known this about any of those games that were just mentioned

47:38.220 --> 47:41.460
I may have been more inclined to try playing them

47:41.460 --> 47:43.460
Oh

47:44.620 --> 47:50.460
Well, you're on the business side of things so, you know you get right down these marketing things following remark is not responsible of IGDA

47:50.460 --> 47:52.460
Sacramento wives

47:53.220 --> 47:55.220
Cannibalism. All right

47:56.020 --> 47:58.540
Well, I was talking about what why oh, sorry

47:58.540 --> 48:03.300
I thought there's a comment about fallout, but I guess why where has been playing guacamole, which you know, that's always that's a great

48:03.820 --> 48:05.300
Great one

48:05.300 --> 48:08.660
Raginator saying watched Alan play fallout for a little bit last night

48:08.660 --> 48:15.540
Oh, yeah, you you don't really live stream, but you do he just will he'll be held on the steam notify

48:16.060 --> 48:20.940
Raginator wants to watch your stream via this steam thing and I'm like, okay, so then steam takes care of it

48:20.940 --> 48:25.100
It's all seamless. I don't even know what it's doing. You keep that steam thing open basically all the time. Yeah

48:25.100 --> 48:32.420
Yeah, I I kind of do that like sometimes but as far as like routing it through twitch or whatever the play TV

48:32.420 --> 48:37.500
I think is the new one that comes with the Raptor app. It's like a twitch competitor. Oh, I have that. Mm-hmm

48:37.500 --> 48:39.500
I just never run it. Yeah

48:39.900 --> 48:44.340
Cuz then I always feel like if I'm gonna stream a game then like I don't want to just stream gameplay

48:44.340 --> 48:49.180
I have to be entertaining and like and I explain this to people when somebody asked me like why aren't you streaming your game?

48:49.180 --> 48:53.860
Did it cuz I'm like sometimes I don't want to be on like talking about that whole like extrovert introvert thing, right?

48:53.940 --> 48:58.280
like sometimes I just want to play the game and I don't necessarily want to be on because I do feel a

48:58.560 --> 49:03.760
Responsibility when I'm live streaming a game to not just stream the gameplay but to be like

49:04.280 --> 49:09.140
Commenting to talk about memories to talk about make jokes be funny. And so I was like, I don't want to be funny

49:09.140 --> 49:11.680
I just want to vegetate in front of the game, but that's me

49:11.680 --> 49:16.760
I'm not I'm not knocking other people because some people do stream just broad gameplay and that's totally fine

49:16.760 --> 49:20.840
That's just not like like I want to kind of be consistent with my channel

49:20.840 --> 49:27.320
And so that consistency would be me being on when I feel like it when reginator watches me stream

49:27.360 --> 49:30.480
I don't even open up my headset mic so that I could talk to him through it

49:30.480 --> 49:35.120
I mean he can hear the game obviously, but otherwise, there's no feedback from me. He's just watching me

49:35.120 --> 49:38.640
It's just a real way to just like watch somebody play a game with no

49:38.820 --> 49:43.320
BS and some people like that more in stream like everything I said about live stream

49:43.320 --> 49:46.100
So people hate that some people want to just see the damn game

49:46.100 --> 49:51.940
And so, you know, that's well like if you look if you look at the do's and don'ts of how to do stream like that

49:51.940 --> 49:57.600
It'll be like the first rule do not read the dialogue on the screen people hate that

49:57.600 --> 50:01.640
But then you'll see people that do it and they'll use silly voices and then it's suddenly it's funny

50:01.640 --> 50:04.740
Okay. Well, this guy has a million subscribers and he reads the talk on the screen

50:04.740 --> 50:08.620
So that's my that's my pet peeve is reading the dialogue on the screen

50:09.280 --> 50:14.500
Well that and I'd say over-the-top acting. Yeah, that's why I do not like markiplier

50:14.780 --> 50:21.000
Hmm at all. Mm-hmm and everyone will worship the ground he walks on and kiss the office chair

50:21.000 --> 50:23.820
He sits in and no, I don't think he's funny

50:23.820 --> 50:28.540
But over the years we've done this there have been people that are like I don't like olr cuz you guys do blank and I'm

50:28.540 --> 50:31.080
Like, alright. Well, hope you found the show

50:31.080 --> 50:36.860
You do like markiplier is sort of this safe respite that people ran to screaming from pewdiepie. So

50:38.520 --> 50:42.360
Yeah, he's very when he takes a shirt off it's very nice I don't need to listen to him

50:43.540 --> 50:46.260
Can we not? All right. Anyway, let's

50:46.260 --> 50:52.400
How about how about our guests Gabe you get the mic what kind of games you've been playing this week? Oh goodness

50:52.400 --> 50:56.400
I didn't let you pimp your game either. Oh, yeah. No, it's okay

50:58.400 --> 51:01.900
Okay, so the games that I've been working on are my

51:02.880 --> 51:04.880
crumple episode 1 and

51:05.000 --> 51:10.420
Kinship now I will and this is how I will pimp it nice and ninja like youtube.com

51:11.460 --> 51:14.000
slash nascent games and a s

51:14.500 --> 51:16.500
C E N T

51:16.700 --> 51:22.420
g-a-m-e-s I just uploaded two new gameplay videos for both games last week and

51:23.380 --> 51:29.600
And for the first time you're actually able to see some early gameplay of kinship and updated gameplay for crumple

51:29.600 --> 51:35.120
So yeah, we're doing really well with that. We recently announced that crumple will soon

51:35.420 --> 51:41.340
Well at some point this year will be also available on an additional platform the Amazon fire

51:41.940 --> 51:43.020
So

51:43.020 --> 51:46.200
So yeah, so that so we've started implementing early touch controls

51:47.080 --> 51:50.720
Yeah, so it's it's it's really really exciting unexpected stuff

51:51.480 --> 51:57.240
Anyway, so yeah youtube.com slash nascent games check us out and we're on Twitter too at nascent games

51:58.080 --> 52:03.060
Now the games that I've been playing. Um, I've normally I mean for a very long time

52:03.060 --> 52:09.680
it's normally Xbox one always has my soul and I rarely touch my PlayStation 4 but

52:10.220 --> 52:12.220
Earth Defense Force 4.1

52:12.920 --> 52:17.420
The game I was yelling and screaming about that needed to be out because it because you know

52:17.420 --> 52:21.220
There was the shadows of new despair only in Japan, but they brought it here

52:21.740 --> 52:23.740
Finally, although it was delayed

52:24.100 --> 52:27.600
Finally, it finally came out. So I'd been all over that game

52:28.460 --> 52:33.420
Just earning whatever weapons I possibly can because that game is crazy crazy fun

52:33.980 --> 52:35.140
and

52:35.140 --> 52:38.900
Been playing that I had I started playing

52:39.820 --> 52:40.820
Oh

52:40.820 --> 52:45.180
goodness, what else I finally started messing around with Killzone Shadowfall because I'm just like

52:45.320 --> 52:50.860
You know because I finally beat last of us remaster because I never played last of us only until the remake for the ps4

52:50.860 --> 52:56.440
And my god, what an astounding game, but most of you probably peed it already. So I still haven't played it

52:57.720 --> 52:59.720
Astounding game absolutely astounding game

53:00.140 --> 53:05.160
But the game I'm you know, so I've been messing with those and of course force of six force of horizon two sometimes

53:05.160 --> 53:11.140
But then I will but I'm waiting for quantum break quantum break comes out next just pre-ordered it today. Yeah

53:11.140 --> 53:17.620
Yeah, I pre-ordered that months ago cuz anything from Alan Wake developer. I'm ready for that. Yes

53:17.620 --> 53:19.980
So yeah, so that's what I've been messing around with

53:19.980 --> 53:24.500
Yeah, Alan Wake is actually on my list to go revisit because Xbox one the backwards

53:25.340 --> 53:30.860
Compatibility thing has been like this really awesome like rediscover games you played like literally it's been a godsend

53:30.860 --> 53:34.480
And I'm gonna talk about that in just a minute because actually the game I've been playing almost

53:34.760 --> 53:37.600
Exclusively this week has been one of those games. Thanks. We'll talk about that a minute

53:37.600 --> 53:39.100
I want to check in with Bri too

53:39.100 --> 53:43.940
But first I want to go to a chat room over at live dot vog network calm because why we are points out

53:44.080 --> 53:48.880
That is ironic a game about a scrap of paper on a device called fire

53:51.000 --> 53:53.080
But if you actually play the little demo

53:53.680 --> 54:00.360
There's there's like actually fire is kind of a big deal in this game spot-on spot-on remark. Actually, I love it

54:01.280 --> 54:06.760
In the chat room. There are people fussing at me because markiplier does all this great work for other people

54:06.760 --> 54:10.480
That's not what I was talking about at all. Mm-hmm. I was just saying he's not funny, right?

54:10.640 --> 54:15.840
So you can still appreciate like oh this person does good charity work, but I don't really like well

54:15.840 --> 54:17.920
I don't watch their TV show, you know that type of exactly

54:18.800 --> 54:22.280
Exactly. It's kind of like I feel like there's like actors and actresses like that

54:22.280 --> 54:28.480
I would say Angelina Jolie, but actually I really do love her and I will watch anything she's in so I can't that's not the best

54:28.500 --> 54:34.100
It's like everyone on the cast of Big Bang Theory may be great brilliant wonderful people, but I don't watch the show

54:34.100 --> 54:37.260
There's a great exam because it's fake nerd. Yes

54:37.860 --> 54:39.220
Perfect. I love that

54:39.220 --> 54:46.580
It's it's nerd humor for people who aren't you can love Mayim bialik and think that show is she I love her so much

54:46.580 --> 54:52.620
You can love will we and not like I have learned so much from her about neuroscience and being Jewish

54:53.580 --> 54:54.700
fantastic

54:54.720 --> 54:58.900
Bree your gaming week how what kind of video get I I know I know you're no more the business

54:59.320 --> 55:01.760
Surely you take a break with a game once in a while. Yes

55:01.760 --> 55:05.640
I am reminded that I need to play the games and just promote the games

55:06.840 --> 55:08.560
so I

55:08.560 --> 55:13.560
Participated in my first marathon last year and that did not end. Well, so what did I do to console myself?

55:13.560 --> 55:17.520
I bought a game and that was Yoshi's wooly world. I

55:18.760 --> 55:24.420
Love Yoshi's wooly world. Why are we why are we like confessing this like we're at an alcohol rehabilitation clinic

55:24.420 --> 55:26.420
It's so cute

55:29.200 --> 55:35.200
You know what it doesn't it does not matter gamers are gamers and I have to show Bree what I got hold on keep talking

55:35.340 --> 55:39.280
So I I've been playing Yoshi's wooly world and I'm actually progressing through it

55:39.280 --> 55:45.640
And I'm really proud because my gameplay lasts all of 20 minutes and then I get frustrated and then I stop

55:45.640 --> 55:50.000
it doesn't matter if it's a mobile game or if I'm playing on my Xbox one and

55:55.280 --> 56:00.620
Make a yarn Yoshi and it's the first time I see it and I want to just cuddle with it

56:02.520 --> 56:04.120
How cool

56:04.120 --> 56:07.220
See, so I was gifted a Wii U for my birthday

56:07.220 --> 56:11.360
But I don't have any fun amiibo or anything. Like I don't even know what to do with that. I

56:14.160 --> 56:16.700
Here's a tiny one you can cuddle with that's out of the box

56:17.540 --> 56:24.780
And I also started playing never alone on my Xbox one and I really admire that game because of the

56:25.240 --> 56:31.600
Story behind it and the purpose behind its creation. So I would love if I were to get into game development

56:31.600 --> 56:36.740
I would love to do something that represents my Hawaiian culture because there is a whole story there

56:36.740 --> 56:40.280
That's not told hula is not like a sexual dance at all

56:40.920 --> 56:44.620
But you know not a lot of people know about those things. So that's what I'm playing now

56:45.600 --> 56:51.400
That is an awesome like I never alone was was really cool in that regard like that it kind of blended the whole like

56:51.760 --> 56:55.860
Education, I don't want to say you're not education in the way like Carmen Sandiego did education

56:55.860 --> 56:58.820
But you know like just like you kind of like oh, I'm learning something about

56:59.540 --> 57:05.720
You know, maybe something I would have experienced otherwise, which is why diversity is. Yes. It is important in games. Yes. So anyway

57:06.300 --> 57:08.560
Great. Thank you for sharing about your week. All right

57:09.100 --> 57:14.540
My gaming week, so I mentioned there's been a game that I've been playing a lot on Xbox packers compatibility

57:14.540 --> 57:19.360
So here it is. Here's the funny thing. It was on the Xbox 360, but it actually didn't start there

57:19.360 --> 57:23.760
This game is like 20 years old and it's I really believe this is like

57:24.160 --> 57:28.060
One of the best video games ever made and we talked about it a lot on the show

57:28.060 --> 57:31.020
But I haven't really revisited this game in a long time

57:31.440 --> 57:35.560
But I have fallen in love in love again with Castlevania Symphony of the night

57:37.560 --> 57:42.560
That is a game that I'm sure most of the people listening have bought at least one

57:42.560 --> 57:49.180
I'm sure I'm sure and I've like three copies. It's not the first time I've played it people. Oh, yes star Sakura

57:50.920 --> 57:52.560
For copies of it

57:52.560 --> 57:54.320
No, and I actually you know what?

57:54.320 --> 57:58.480
I was actually thinking today as I was playing through the game again because you know again

57:58.480 --> 58:03.240
It's been when was the last time you went for two hundred point six percent in the game or more?

58:03.400 --> 58:05.320
It's probably been a long time for most of you

58:05.320 --> 58:10.700
So I think I really love that this backwards compatibility has made me revisit some things and what was funny is that I got a new

58:10.880 --> 58:14.740
Achievement in the game today, right and I looked at my history

58:14.780 --> 58:20.880
Okay, here's the here's the hilarious thing. My other achievements in the game were unlocked on

58:21.580 --> 58:22.860
March

58:22.860 --> 58:24.860
27th tomorrow, right

58:25.400 --> 58:31.780
2007 oh wow. Oh my god, if if leap year. Mm-hmm

58:32.500 --> 58:35.620
Existed. Mm-hmm. It would have been two days before I know

58:36.060 --> 58:39.040
But anyway, I was thinking as I was playing today

58:39.120 --> 58:43.080
I was like I really need to harass dark Sakura to figure out how to get a

58:43.160 --> 58:47.040
Saturn from her for a little bit and a copy of the other I could just give Alan back his

58:47.560 --> 58:49.560
Perfect so I can

58:50.280 --> 58:56.560
Okay, so yeah so I can experience this because I've never played the Saturn version and I like I must play Maria's story

58:56.560 --> 59:02.840
It's all Maria is like the most overpowered character in the history of anything. That's okay

59:02.840 --> 59:08.760
All you have to do is stand in a corner and do the Santa you attack over and over and it's this big

59:09.080 --> 59:14.680
Blue dragon that just flies all over the screen and you can control it too. So it's like hi

59:14.680 --> 59:18.520
I'm completely overpowered and she has I don't did you did you play?

59:19.540 --> 59:25.720
Dracula X any at all. Uh, I played a little bit. I played the the Super Nintendo port, which wasn't

59:26.640 --> 59:31.480
Maria as playable in that one. I played a little bit you brought it to an episode of all our ones I did but

59:32.040 --> 59:38.180
She's like kind of hard. She's easy and hard at the same time because her attacks are really useful and she has her animal friends

59:38.660 --> 59:39.780
but

59:39.780 --> 59:46.780
She's way overpowered in in not turn in the moonlight. Mm-hmm. I have that on the turbo graphic 16 actually

59:48.660 --> 59:51.700
So, yeah a person owed us a hundred bucks and paid us back with that

59:53.260 --> 59:55.780
So that that's just like rediscovering

59:56.500 --> 01:00:02.160
Castlevania Symphony Night because I don't I find that you know, it's been what like nine years since the last time I played I don't

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.980
Remember where I like it. I remember. Oh, yeah, I have to get missed for this

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.420
I have to get the bat which came first we get the miss first the bat first

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.100
I don't remember it's been so long. So I had to you know, and actually at one point I was like Alan

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:20.740
Do you remember where the miss thing is? Cuz I can't find it. What we still have a strategy guide for it

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:25.780
Oh, yeah heat. Well, he just went to game facts or something. Yeah, so I cheated for you so that you had plausible

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.780
Yeah ability exactly. So I'm I have I haven't looked at a single guide

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.340
there's only two things only two

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.020
A

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:39.300
Armor only two things you ever need in that game. One of them is the walk armor

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.180
The second one is the Yota tuna

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:48.500
Which you can only get from one creature and it has a 1% drop rate. Oh, yeah, I've heard about that

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:54.680
But when you have the Yota tuna, it may not be the strongest weapon, but it's the fastest and it hits multiple

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.900
Yeah, that's awesome. I spent three hours getting one

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.300
It's when you were revisiting that game we noticed that

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.740
One of the things that's so fun about it is that the eat the monsters they're all so melodramatic

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:15.060
Like when you kill them, they're like bones everywhere in flames and whining and crying. It's like this is a little plant creature

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.760
There's 20 of them on the screen and they're all gonna go through this

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:23.580
Oscar performance because just because they die like a thousand bones very very little stem

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:30.060
Yeah, or you killed the little the little sword lady ladies, yeah, yeah, they'll go and then when you kill

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.460
Noises and then like they they fall over in these big explosion anybody this place

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.700
Are you like your best fight?

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.780
Anybody this place to be tonight recently knows exactly what the hell I'm talking about the blood zombies

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.220
I hate them that noise they make when the blood fountains out, but I'm like, that's so gross

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.740
And they all do it every time

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.140
What is a man so?

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:59.020
Miserable pile of secrets the horrific voice acting of the PlayStation 1 era just I'm interested in this

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:04.060
I'm interested in this. I'm interested in this. It's like can I just buy potions without having to hear you?

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.780
Alucard, I'm interested in this shut up

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:14.820
Little fairy flying around with you. There is something funny about this wall and you want to know what's funny

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.980
It's actually just as annoying in Japanese

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.780
it literally is just

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:25.380
Alucard still has this gorgeous rich voice and it's really annoying either way

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.980
It's just like they talk too much

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:35.060
Stopped so yeah, I just you know, I know we've talked about this game on other episodes and it's a classic

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.180
But just I'm just reminded this week. There's a damn good reason for that

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.300
you know, you can go back to this game and just fall in love with it all over again and

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.700
You know the 50,000

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.420
Games like it that have come since you know what?

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:53.660
Even close which you know which but I see my other the castle thing is probably honestly in like my top three games of all

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.540
time but like the number one is going to be Super Metroid and it's like

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.780
You might as well have just named like two of the same thing for your name

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:07.420
It's because they have so much in common, but yet they don't you know, so I just so so good

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:13.580
Nothing had the ending of Super Metroid. No, nothing especially the first time I saw that I I almost cry

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.980
Yeah, the end of that like save the animals. Yep save the Metroids

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.820
So there was that and that is honestly taking up a big chunk of my gaming week

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:26.940
But there's been some other stuff too actually on Steam, you know, I'm a retro guy. I love my retro stuff

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.940
So on Steam this week, I actually did pick up

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:33.860
Atari vault came out this we heard about steam how much is that it is

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:40.140
I think they have a discount this week only where it's 1699 as opposed to 1999 for all of the Atari for all of it

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:44.420
So here it's like a hundred it's a hundred different Atari games arcade and 2600

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:50.280
So here's the thing. They took that iPad app and iPhone app they have and they ported it to the PC

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:56.500
It's that so at first glance I was like, oh they just ported the app and they got rid of all the mini

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.380
Transactions you just pay for the whole damn thing in one swoop

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.460
But the good thing is as opposed to my iPad or iPhone

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:05.940
I actually have tangible controls like the way this thing is meant to be played

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:11.220
I have to use my thumb or anything ridiculous like that, right? So that part's cool. Um, but

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:18.300
Yeah, I feel like they actually have added to it as well because the cool thing is on Steam

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.540
You can actually do multiplayer through Steam and that in itself is like, okay shoot. This is cool

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.820
This is different and there's leaderboards, you know achievements things like that

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:32.420
so and the achievements are not easy like the only one I've gotten so far because

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.860
I have played a shitload of yards revenge one of the greatest

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.240
600 games ever made right? Yes, one of the achievements is you have to be able to shoot the flying spiral

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:45.700
Not just kill the base, but shoot the flying spiral and that I get that I can do

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.700
Oh my goodness

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:52.660
That's how you unlock Howard Scott workshop initials you have to shoot the flying spiral then you fly into the pixel the dead pixel

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.660
That's like on the right hand side of the screen

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.580
muscle memory from when I was like seven this is

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:03.460
It's that's been the cool part about Atari vault is almost called that Atari party

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:09.940
But you might as well it might as well as well. It was sorry party is kind of getting to revisit all that

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:13.580
So yeah, so I'll try vaults on Steam if you are a retro whore like me

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:16.680
You're probably gonna love it if you're not then

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.340
Don't but I think I think there's a lot of good stuff in it

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.760
Or I would say if you did buy the whole thing on iPad or iPhone or I'm sure it's on Android, too

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.600
Maybe you don't need it twice depends on what you want if you want it on Steam

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.720
I think it's I think it's still a good deal. So check that out

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:36.400
But that's really made up the bulk of my gimme week. I guess I've had a very retro week screw new games

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:43.800
Not really. Hey, if it's any consolation I played I played Little Nemo Dream Master on my NES sweet

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.040
I just got picked it up last week. So yeah

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.720
What's funny is that Castlevania Symphony of the Night has also made me go I

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.520
Really want to play Simon's Quest again?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.720
Only on the Wii U because you could save it whenever you want that is because otherwise

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.360
God forbid you didn't find the red jewel now, you got to go back

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.080
Alan do you wanna say something real quick? No. No, I thought you were

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.520
Know that you mentioned Little Nemo the Dream Master. Now. The first level music is in my head. I

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.220
Love the music in that Capcom. Why can't you be that awesome anymore? Oh

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.800
Because Street Fighter 5

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:28.500
Which is a disappointment. Oh, thank you for reminding me the other game. I played this week Pokken tournament. Ah

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.280
nice

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.240
You thought I was gonna say Street Fighter 5

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:38.600
No, I've been playing the game that everybody quit Street Fighter 5 to play which is which is Pokken boss

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.880
Which I fight I beat the Green League. Whoo

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.520
I'm better than beginner. Yeah, I'm not so beginner, but it's still kind of bad

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:52.960
There you go, and then Alan for some reason doesn't like Alan thinks I'm very cheap when I play Pokken

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.980
Right. It's just the character that you play

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:04.400
Braxian Brax, there's lots of projectiles and you just sort of spit fire at them and the enemy just kind of maybe it's the difficulty

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.240
You're playing on but they really just kind of get the shit kicked out of them. I'm like they can't even move Alan

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.240
I'm just that good. Yeah that guy

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.440
I

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.320
Just like Braxian because she's funny. So there you go

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:21.440
I do like her super where it's all like hearts and rainbows and pretty princess magic and then why I had the player and then

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.620
It's like okay. Well that just blew up and killed that person. So great job. Thanks rainbows

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.480
Thanks killer rainbows

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:33.920
Anyhow, some quick housekeeping then we're gonna get into news tonight. So we will not be here next week

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:39.200
There will be no show next Sunday because Alan and I will be out of town and we're like getting back at six o'clock

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.240
So we'll be back too late for orange lounge radio

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.920
But you know, we'll we'll see you guys in two weeks

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:51.440
And actually it's gonna be a double weekend because sack IG sack IG DA in the arcade is going to be that

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.580
Saturday and then that Sunday there will be a new OLR. So that's gonna be a very busy weekend

01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:00.480
So you get no OLR next week, but you get like twice the broadcasting the week after to make up for it

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.000
Oh, yeah, so some of those things let you deposit an episode of the bank and you get much more

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.120
Alright, so that's that's really uh, that's really all we have for housekeeping

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:15.000
Otherwise, follow us on twitter twitter.com slash OLR. We're all we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.640
We are overdue for some news. We're only an hour and eight minutes. We haven't touched a single news story yet

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.220
So let's get to it Alan starting us off tonight within the last week

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:30.560
The internet was all a flit a buzz about yet another leak of the Nintendo NX

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:36.620
Controller and allegedly what it what it looked like like whether it was a proof of concept or developers kit or whatever

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.700
So all of these sites, you know when a leak like that is released

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.980
If it's hard to verify

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.060
They're like, okay

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.860
Well, our competitor sites are getting clicks on this so we need to run this story too so that we're not

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.860
behind

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.500
but the whole thing was fake and that was confirmed by the two people that um

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:06.120
Did the mock-up of it? It's just all fake. It was all fake. It was an incredibly elaborate fake, too

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.440
Yeah, like it was very well done

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.520
I mean you could have fooled me and we did we talked about it last week on this show and we entertained it and I'm

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.680
Sure, there's some people that want to be like haha you fell for it, especially like because you know

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:22.580
there are some things about that leak device that lends reason to be critical of Nintendo and even I

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.160
Was not a fan of the fact that there were no buttons

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.120
But I still think you know

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.240
There's a lot of people in the community that are talking about this right now and we don't necessarily break news on this show

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.920
We discuss what's being talked about in the gaming community

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.480
So, you know, I kind of kind of don't apologize in that regard for talking about it last week

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.720
But I think we've all learned, you know

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.640
We've got to be a little more cautious with some of these leaks is that Wow

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.160
Photographs are getting more and more and more convincing because I mean if you think about it

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:55.000
Even though like the reddit team and I'm not singling them out on purpose, but it's just who comes to mind

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.480
You know, they were trying to figure out

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.560
Oh, it was this particular developer office in Sweden based on the tree

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.040
That's for a reflected in this and the fact of the keyboard all this shit. Okay, it's like Mulder calm down

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:09.120
Yeah, there's all this no but my point is there's all this detective work going into it and still couldn't tell it was a fake

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.400
so

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.640
You know, and I'm sure there's some people out there. They're like, I knew it was a fake the whole time

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:22.080
Yeah, well, you know, we didn't have the receipts really so, you know now that they've come out and said that it was fake

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.520
It is what it is, but I hope if nothing else

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.120
maybe Nintendo because they're

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.840
The reason why a lot of people were so ready to believe what was seen is because it matched

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.920
The patent that had been filed previously, right?

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.200
So that's why there were so many people that were ready to believe what they were seeing because it was in line with the patent

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.000
That Nintendo had filed

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.640
So I hope if nothing else

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.560
Maybe Nintendo at least did hear some of that feedback and so that they do make sure whatever it is

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.440
They're doing does have

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.400
Buttons or you know some of the other, you know things that people were complaining about last week me for me

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.320
It's really the buttons. I don't it's cool

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.000
If they want to do the whole thing a touchscreen or whatever and they want to change the shape

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.880
I don't really care about any of that. I just I need tangible buttons. That's what separates my console from my iPhone, honestly, so

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.000
but I

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.200
I really wish I really wish Loki was here to give us a follow-up

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.560
But we'll have to check in with him in a couple weeks when we're all back

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.520
Let's see going to our chat room over at live dot vog network comm yyr said this dude on neo gaff made a mock-up with

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.200
a 3d printer s class troll lol lol lol

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.680
Dark Tetsuya says I just don't get the motive for going that far out of their way to deceive people

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:41.560
But that's just me. Well that dark Tetsuya. The answer is because the internet

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.880
For three whole days or however long you got one over on all of the internet

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:52.280
Yeah, and you got to see all these sites running your bullshit. I literally that dude was masturbating to those Kotaku articles

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.320
I'm sorry to be so vile

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:58.360
but that's why people do it because they're just like oh man Kotaku just ran or

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.920
Some people like boobs

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.600
Like attention

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:11.840
Other people that's right for stealing my joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry other people like buttonless controllers

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.680
some people like fakes

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.920
Some people like fake boobs

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.440
All right, I just hurt my eyes rolling them

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.640
Anyhow

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:31.720
Let's see s 200 Matt says buttons are not just preferable for some people. It's necessary for disabled gamers

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.740
I hope Nintendo considers this. Hmm. That is an interesting

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.920
Conversation that came out of it came out of it. Kai judo says I don't mind it

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.360
They fool us for a few days than say it was a joke. No harm done

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.980
That is a good point. At least they did come out and say okay before y'all get too crazy. We're done

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.720
You know, we got what we needed out of it. We've had a good laugh. It was fake

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.880
Fooled you April Fool's. Yeah, I was gonna say stay the hell off the internet day

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.400
aka April Fool's is

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.080
Next week this whole but I'm glad we're not having a show

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:08.560
Are we gonna be in the air in the plane on the first cuz I can't view the internet when I'm 30,000 feet in

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.700
The air so that's fine with me. Yes, you can now. Well, we'll be we'll be hanging out with our buddies in Tucson

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:19.280
This is the day before our nerd thing on Saturday. So we'll be hanging out with our buddies in Tucson all day

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.360
Eating copious amount of Mexican food. Yeah, however

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.560
Please go to mass affecting dot tumblr.com

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.200
And look at the glorious joke. I made making a mockery of

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.040
April 1st, I

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.780
Always always one to self-promote here on the show. All right, because my blog is amazing

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.480
so let's talk about some other rumors and things that have a lot of

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.120
Attraction on the internet this week

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.000
the Nikkei

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.600
Japanese news publication was reporting that Nintendo is going to cease

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:59.220
Wii U production at the end of the year to make way for their next platform the Nintendo NX

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:05.840
The publication saying that poorly selling software and lack of interest in the hardware is the reason why production is ceasing

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.240
Nintendo of course pretty swiftly denied this

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:16.220
In a statement here, I'm trying to see where the actual quote is here on the statement

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.720
The news did not come from Nintendo

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:26.080
Of course and the company is still going to produce more hardware units during the next fiscal term and beyond

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:34.140
So they said Nintendo said the Wii U is seen hit titles recently such as Splatoon and Super Mario maker and Nintendo is going to continue

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.680
with shipments so yeah, and I

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.520
When I saw that thing I was like there's got to be a mistranslation here or something like why a

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.800
Why would Nintendo possible? Well, I don't think it was something it was meant to be announced. It was a leak or whatever

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.680
But Nintendo is still planning to release games through holiday

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.880
We know that Zelda is going to be a holiday release now granted

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.780
I know there's the whole thing like well, it could be an NX game as well as a Wii U game

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.040
Well, okay, then if it's a Wii U game

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.200
It's still going to necessitate more Wii U units because the Wii U is going to become the budget system

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.680
That's what always happens at the end of the life cycle of the games is that you know

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.280
They didn't just you know

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:22.080
Kill off the PlayStation 3 the minute the PlayStation 4 came out the PlayStation 3 simply became the budget system

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.580
It was the one that was significantly cheaper so you could buy one for your kids bedroom to babysit them all day

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.460
That's what's gonna happen with the Wii U

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:34.220
So I had a really hard time believing they would just kill production this year

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:39.740
You would at least have another year or two. That would really be unheard of to just end production the same year

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:46.860
I mean, I would they be trying to force more people to buy the new and I it just seems ridiculous to me

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:51.940
Unless there's something about the NX that makes the Wii U

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:56.140
Redundant, but I I can't really figure that out

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.860
I just it would be out of character for Nintendo

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:03.860
There has to be a backwards compatibility thing perhaps on that thing because I mean they did it so well with the Wii and the GameCube

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.660
You know, I mean, we're the Wii U and the Wii. Yeah. Yeah precisely

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:14.700
They didn't just murder the Wii now what it could be and I'll give this maybe there's going to be a new

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.420
Skew at the end of yeah

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:22.240
They're gonna kill off the existing bundles and they'll have like a and they did this with the Wii

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.560
They had a Wii that didn't have what DVD playback or something. Yeah, it didn't have backwards compatibility either just yeah

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:32.800
Something there's something like to like drive down the price even for it's super tiny, too

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:39.280
Yeah, so that I would believe and I think that's where the mistranslation is is that maybe it's not going to be the same Wii U

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.120
But there's gonna still be a Wii U and it might just be a different color or a different, you know

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.320
It'll just be something a little different. So that's all

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:55.380
Let's see over in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com YYR says the Wii Mini actually had no internet. Oh, that's right internet

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.380
That's what it was. Didn't it still have the Wii shop?

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.440
Like you have to have the Wii shop. Come on. Well, they stopped the Wii shop

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.920
Well, you still access it, but they didn't put anything new on there. Yeah, it's

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.160
They'll still happily take your money if you'll give it to them

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.580
Oh, yeah, and there's still virtual console things on the Wii shop that aren't on Wii U. Yeah

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:18.140
Um, wow YYR says yeah, no Wii, no Wii shop, no anything. Well, that's crazy

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.500
Dungeon Buster says I wasn't sure the Wii U news either

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:27.680
Nintendo had usually ended production of the previous hardware gen after the introduction of a new one. Yeah, so

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.360
Anyway, we really don't know anything until E3 happens. That's for sure

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:35.140
Anyhow, Dark Sakura on a different note

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.660
Well, there are some interesting things going on

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:43.380
Especially since we've been talking about the whole let's play controversy and the

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:51.320
Copywriting and everything, but there's actually been a copyright filed for that dragon cancer

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:57.220
let's plays in particular and the big reason is that because the game itself is

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.140
short and

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:04.760
Rather linear. It's not something that you're going to play again and again and so

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.660
Having a let's play of it out

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.620
Sort of eliminates the need to have to someone buy it themselves

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:18.540
Especially since they had a small development team and you know need to actually pay their developers

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:24.220
You know for games that have it was actually quoted on here for games that have

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:31.260
More expansive and replayable gameplay having let's plays can directly benefit their developers

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.540
And then here's where the actual quote is

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.300
However, for a short relatively linear experience like us for millions of users viewers

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:44.860
Let's play recordings of our content satisfy their interest and they never go on to interact with the game in the personal way

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.860
We intend it for it to be experienced

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:53.020
They go on to say later on is that people have been posting the entire

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.420
soundtrack online

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:58.020
without even linking back to where to buy it from or

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.740
even to the game a lot of the let's plays don't link to where they they can get the game or

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:10.380
Soundtracks for themselves. So this actually in a case like this. It does take money from an indie developers pocket

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.220
This is money that likely is

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:16.240
What they're trying to live on, you know

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:20.860
so in that way that the let's play ends up being a

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:26.220
Detriment and I will go ahead and read this quote because I really do like it

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.220
We

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:33.340
Are asking that you return the favor by creating let's play videos that don't

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:37.500
Just rebroadcast the entirety of our content with minimal commentary

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:44.900
But instead use portions of our content as a context to share your own stories and start conversations with your viewers

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:50.500
Isn't that interesting because I literally had just talked about I believe let's play streams should be this

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:57.780
Versus just flat gameplay that people want to see and here's a game developer kind of saying that is that we want to hear the

01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:03.500
Commentary and the talk and the discussion about what this game makes you feel don't just do a straight rip of our game

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:11.140
Well, that's a little different though from a game that talks about the experience of people dealing with cancer in their lives

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.780
versus

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:15.780
Mario maker, you know

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:21.680
I was gonna say Borderlands, you know going around shooting people in zero gravity, you know or

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:28.000
Low gravity, you know, it's it's a different story. I don't think that Borderlands really has a

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.400
Very or Mario maker has a very deep story

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.580
To tell that relates to human experience. Those are escapism

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:42.820
this is trying to get a story across to share an experience and to get a dialogue started and

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.060
Doing

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.060
The let's plays with no commentary or minimal commentary

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:54.380
Does defeat the purpose the point is to talk about it and start a conversation and I also do agree

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.180
You know when you're dealing with

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.860
with independent development for games

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.620
The let's plays can be good

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:08.740
Advertising to an extent but you have to make it a vehicle for for that, you know

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:14.260
In their quote they really just said can you just link back to where people can buy the game and I was like that is

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:20.260
Really not too much to ask people. Well, see that's that's one another one that they asked is, you know

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:25.720
If you're gonna do something like this donate a dollar or two to the studio if you believe and I'm gonna say that what we

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:29.100
Did has value the small act will allow us to continue to work

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.260
So I would actually encourage everyone right now

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.980
That's listening to this

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:39.500
You've got a dollar I'm sure you have a dollar if you can pay for your internet access you have a dollar

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:46.220
Go to that dragons cancer calm that dragon cancer calm and give them a dollar

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:51.380
Right now do it. I want to see your receipt. Wow. I think this is the first time in

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:57.100
13 years that Jamie hasn't said give me a dollar. She's saying give somebody else a dollar

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.040
You know, it's because I'm actually employed now

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.960
And I have been for two years fair enough, you know, you can get me a taco

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:12.000
But I want you I will I will donate all of my I want everyone to donate the taco money

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.680
To that dragon cancer calm, um, you know

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:21.940
I'm gonna ask the indie dev in the house your thoughts on this whole situation with the let's plays and everything

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.480
Has crumple had let's plays because I know you have a demo out there

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.560
There's um, I know a couple of and a couple of folks had had done some twitch streams

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.480
The beauty is that my you know, my demo is what I have out there. So that's that

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:41.160
So what they've played in the demo is essentially maybe a quarter of the entire episode

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:45.600
And I think that's where I'm really happy. I I went that I went that route

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:52.160
But you know because what they're playing now, I mean what was in that demo compared to what's in it now

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.320
It's not even there's so much more so I'm not even sad about it

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.040
But I do I do think it it it's a huge problem

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:05.600
I think it's a huge problem because I mean, let's look I mean, let's look at yeah

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.320
Let's look at the steam the steam refund policy, you know, they're trying they're trying to

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.740
Extend the the length of time again, you know one can play, you know

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.320
Two hours is enough because what if I beat the game in under two hours and I didn't like it

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.560
Even though I beat the game. I want my money back

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.760
You know what I'm saying?

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:28.020
And it's it's really it's it's so so it's so so tough right now to be able to do that

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.880
I thought you have to I mean, I don't want to spend too much time trying to figure out

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:39.120
Suggest other ways that they're like, you know, make you know make up cut those losses. But yeah, it's

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:45.700
We in the chapter we you know, even with myself. We just try to say how else can we can we get?

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.240
You know, how else can we market our product how you know, what else can we do apparel?

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.560
And things like, you know, you know apparel art things like that, you know other little things that are tangible

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.600
This has been my thing with digital versus physical

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:07.080
You know, what's funny what you're saying there that used to be the line that people used to use to justify stealing music

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:13.800
Mm-hmm was the whole well, I bought the poster about the t-shirts with the concert. So I'm gonna take the album

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.040
Right, you know or I only want these two songs from this album because the sorry because the rest of the album

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:25.600
Is just awful. So that's why I only style. I downloaded these two songs. These are the only two songs I wanted

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.200
I didn't want to pay $15 for it

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.520
and and yeah, and you know, but but it's so funny because now we seem to be going back to

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:41.240
That old way of things because you know, it's like how do I prevent you know, my digital product being?

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:49.720
pirated and copied and I had mentioned I affect I sent Brianna a big article about that there was a particular game studio that

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:53.040
can't remember the name of the game off the top of my head, but

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.160
They had hit a milestone where they sold 300,000 copies

01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:03.280
but they had they had a but there was a pirated amount of 1.6 million and

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:09.600
Most of them were from Russia Brazil Wow, and that that's that's insanity

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:15.480
That's utter insane. So you so they're like, yeah, we've sold we've met, you know, we've sold over 300 grand

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.920
In our game, but 1.6 million have sexually stolen it. So it's like what do you put on the box?

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.080
Sold 300,000 copies or played by two million, right?

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.280
By played by two million pirates. What do you do about that? Yeah. Yeah

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.040
Going to our chat over at live dog network calm our pal

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.800
Bobby black wolf says there was even that one guy who liked the game, but it was less than two hours

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.560
So they wanted their money back. Anyway, I think with firewatch

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.520
Yeah firewatch game but like I view it see I view the short games

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.040
Especially the ones that tell a story like that like firewatch. I enjoyed firewatch

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:58.200
I didn't like firewatch as much as like gone home or I think everybody's gone to the rapture was my favorite of those

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.200
Walking simulators. Yeah

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:03.000
But I still view them as movies

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.600
Right movies are only gonna be like two hours and you my god

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.840
Do you know how much you fucking pay to go to a movie these days?

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.360
But that's the expert but I think that's the thing, you know, it's that perception and that expectation

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:21.040
What we have we sold us have we as indie game developers sold ourselves so desperately short

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.520
Because it's like we have to make it free

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.840
Otherwise, no one's gonna give a crap about our game and because even my game

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.040
I know my crumple game is gonna be short

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.820
Hope probably depending on how it's played, but I'm gonna sell it for a dollar this so

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.640
This is what blows my fucking mind. You ready? Okay, so

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:45.240
What what was said right there the guy who sold back firewatch because it was too damn short or whatever it I bet

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.360
that son of a bitch went this weekend and

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:56.320
Went and saw Batman vs Superman. Mm-hmm, even when they probably read all over the internet. Oh god

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.060
I'm gonna fucking hate this movie. It's gonna be garbage and sad Ben Affleck and oh god

01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:04.040
It's gonna be look at the Metacritic rating. It's gonna be so fucking terrible

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.020
And yeah, give me a $5 soda and popcorn with that, right? Yeah

01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:12.020
Yeah, but then went to Starbucks before that and it's like look and I'm not saying I didn't see Batman vs Superman

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.500
I don't know if it's good or bad

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:19.140
My whole thing is that like dude probably talk shit about the movie on the internet went and paid the money to see it

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:24.260
Anyway, but yet wants a refund on firewatch. Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah, apparently it's so bad. It's hilarious

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:28.300
I don't I've heard some people like it. Some people think whatever I haven't seen it yet

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:34.620
I have no I know I'm just saying based based on Twitter, which I judge a lot of things based on what I see on Twitter

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.620
It's my perception of the entire world

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.300
It was about Batman vs Superman, but we don't need to go down

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:48.220
And and funny enough this happened to um, there was a guy in the news about someone someone had pirated. I think it was

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.660
Diablo 2 or something like that Diablo 2 and finally actually like paid for it like 19 years later or something like that

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:59.360
I don't know if it was Diablo 2, but they did that. Okay, since you brought that up

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.220
Do you know what's fucking crazy about that story Jamie? Did you did you hear about that story? Huh?

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.500
So apparently

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:14.340
Someone I think it was Diablo 2 someone had pirated a copy of Diablo 2 like 19 years ago

01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:19.180
And they and they just put in the news like a dick couple days ago that that person who pirated it

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.860
Finally bought the game. Okay, you know, yeah, here's the punchline. It was shivam

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:30.460
Why really? Yes, our old pal that we used to play DDR with what that was him. Oh

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:36.860
My god, yes, cuz I saw I read about it on his Twitter feed on his that was not

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.860
That was not what I was expecting you to say

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:43.260
These years later and I'm like, oh my god, like he yeah, he's been all over the

01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:48.740
Tacos and all that stuff like dude pays Diablo developer 40 bucks. Yeah, it's our old pal show him

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.540
We just play DDR with oh my good. Oh, I just outed him as a DDR player, too

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:55.060
Sorry

01:28:55.060 --> 01:29:01.420
Now looking up his name no, I was okay with people knowing that I was a thief but a DER person

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:06.900
Yeah, I have I have limits don't put my business in the street wrong

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:11.200
You're just in Sacramento. Stop doing that

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:17.300
But that scares me though, like that scared that scares me as a developer that scares the hell out of me

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:22.660
It's like how much super impressed after years of actually not talking to him that I remember his last name. Yeah

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.580
Right, and it's it's one of those things were like if you know the guy like, you know

01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.480
We just played either are with him like when I read that this didn't surprise me whatsoever. Like this is just

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.180
Like when I when I heard he did this I was like, oh, yeah

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:39.380
Even though I probably last like saw him in person probably like ten years ago. This is still doesn't surprise me whatsoever

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:46.040
Anyway, it's funny. Yeah. Well, I mean again it you know, I think just as a

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:52.640
As a you know as a chair for the chapter, you know, you know and Brianna and I we just we just

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:57.100
Try to give all the suggestions that we possibly can to just market your stuff

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:02.740
I mean, I have to remind myself Brianna has to tell me sometimes Gabriel, by the way, don't forget this

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:08.140
Don't forget that because it's the only way you know, that's gonna help you get that word out there

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:14.660
So, I mean, it's yeah, it's a meant that digital meant to help us, but it's biting us in the ass

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:21.240
All right. Well, let's let's move on. I this let's play thing really doesn't have an easy solution

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:28.440
I'm really curious to see what's gonna happen legally with this stuff as something like twitch gains more and more and more traction

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.520
But honestly and like I I do a little bit of streaming myself. I don't do a lot of it

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.240
I really need to do more admittedly as a media personality or whatever the hell you want to call it

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:43.140
I need to do more of it, but I have no problem like linking back to buy the game

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:47.640
Duh, like why not? Yeah, that's give me good reasons

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:52.180
Why not because I can't think of any so anyway, let's move on with some more news Alan

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:59.120
So it has been rumored that they a Sony is making a PlayStation 4.5

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.920
Console, which is that sort of the pet name that the rumor Mills given it

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:11.040
Digital Foundry released a report that says that the existence of this thing has been corroborated

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:17.320
From independent sources and it's been independent which sort of sounds like my friend who I can't tell you who he is

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.200
But he's like super serious and he works there like it sounds like one of those

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:27.040
But apparently a prototype exists and Sony devs do have it and are messing with it

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:35.420
The speculation now is what would a PlayStation 4.5 be in relation to the current one?

01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:41.120
Would it be a replacement like it would be the PlayStation slim where they're just like if you buy a PlayStation 4 it will be

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.660
this version

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:48.980
Will it be something that is only advertised to those that have the technology like a 4k TV that can use it

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:54.760
Like you absolutely do not need this unless you're goddamn loaded and you have the TV then we've made this for you

01:31:55.100 --> 01:32:00.020
To cater to the the bleeding-edge people or will it be a weird sort of?

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.860
3ds versus new 3ds type console where it's like a side grade

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:12.260
But then I guess from the Digital Foundry report the see the GPU that they would put in it is so powerful

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:18.360
It really is something that could wait for like a next generation release

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:23.960
So why would they spend the money? It wouldn't be very affordable to put that in for something that would just be a side grade

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.860
It's better than 4.5

01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.260
And Gabe can probably attest to this a little bit

01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:49.260
Even programming for HD and doing graphics for HD is a bitch

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.260
Can you imagine 4k?

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:58.340
Well, that's just it because you know and again you you touched upon this earlier when you were talking about

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:04.580
The the NX controller without the buttons all we know when someone said in the in the in the room about you know

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:10.020
What about those who need the buttons because you know of disabled players and such it would be the same thing here

01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:13.420
you know like people can barely see you know, like

01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:17.900
Okay, watch out watch the my and by the way most like my I am funny

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:22.340
I shouldn't be complaining my my thumb had hit the switch and my mic was off and I was talking a minute ago

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:33.000
Thank you, so because yeah, it takes so much and what and the problem is is that you know for for reading

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:39.780
It's really difficult for the just the the average person just really like what is that saying in there? Oh my god

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:44.000
I need I need a tube TV. So yeah. Yeah 4k. No, thank you. We're not ready yet

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:50.180
Why why are in chat did say that the rumor is that it's going to be capable of 4k media playback

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:54.800
But it's not gonna do anything for the games that makes a little more sense since yeah

01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:01.100
You know the devices in your living room aren't just for games anymore and that makes a lot more sense. Mm-hmm

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:06.540
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about some more rumors

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.540
It's like an all rumor edition of

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:14.300
Orange lounge radio, but apparently actually I think Microsoft is actually

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.940
Clarified this one here. So

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:23.020
Microsoft recently did a customer survey talking about digital trade-in which started this whole thing that all

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:27.260
Microsoft's looking at doing digital trade-ins. Well Xbox games marketing

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.220
Aaron Greenberg actually mentioned on Twitter

01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:35.740
We are not actively planning such a thing always asking questions to understand the needs of our fans

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:43.620
No need to worry and in a reply to games analyst Michael patcher. I'm sorry. I always say it wrong games analyst

01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:48.640
Michael patcher said we are not actively planning such a thing surprised

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:55.460
It was even asked in a survey not fire being played with so if you were excited about the digital trade-ins just wait longer

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.460
Isn't that what they got?

01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:01.060
Obliterated over the that's sort of the theme. Oh, no, no

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:04.260
No, nobody would have cared if you could actually trade in your digital games

01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:09.660
But it was the whole fact that it was going to be that the disk things would still be tied to your console

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:13.260
That was the whole it was like a license that was bound. Yeah, exactly exactly

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:18.400
That was the thing that was getting rubbing people the wrong way. But what do you three was that?

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.780
2013 12. Yeah, I think 13. Yeah

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:31.580
Because then there was the one where like well that was in the whole pre build-up and that nothing was out yet. Yeah, and then

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.620
Sony came out on the stage and

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:41.140
Literally punched them in the face with the whole video that said they literally did it like you came out with a big

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:47.780
Honestly, that's what it felt like did you all did you all not see Microsoft getting punched in the face of that e3?

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:50.540
That's gonna be awesome. We look back at the decade in gaming

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:55.540
That's gonna be one of the top ten moments easy for the record. Hmm the misuse of the world literal

01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:58.060
Figurally makes my head explode. I

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.460
Literally am not sorry

01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:02.900
I

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:05.800
Agree with you. I agree with you Jamie

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.580
Well, then why don't why don't you tell us a literal news story over there at our soccer

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.820
Well

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:21.500
You know, it would actually help if it had pulled up and not frozen on me. There we go. Okay, so minecraft stuff

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.940
We like minecraft only

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:29.020
Yes, I used to like my I've never played it and I'm not I'm not trolling sort of goodness

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:34.940
Never played minecraft and I thought I was living under a rock not playing the last of us

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.540
Minecraft for me is just oh

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:44.980
Happy quiet music dig holes dig holes. It's a Zen game. It's a very Zen game to play is

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:46.820
so

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:50.740
Minecraft is getting another real-world crossover

01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.740
There

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:59.540
Is a tech conference in Norway called the gathering and they're hosting a live concert in

01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:08.180
Real life actually know they already did this according to this. Sorry. They hosted a concert in real life and in Minecraft

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.060
so

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:12.060
They have volunteers

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.060
Um

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.940
Mimicking the artists in Minecraft that you know, the ones that were parading on the stage

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:22.340
They're having it do it in Minecraft with people playing it

01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:26.380
So and it was a pretty big deal from what I can tell

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:28.440
so

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.840
Yeah, there apparently was only room for like 3,000 people on the server for that

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.920
I'd love to know if anyone actually watched this thing and what they thought of it. So

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.560
That sounds awesome, yeah, I think so kind of like Second Life and almost sounds like what's second

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.460
Flying dicks

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.460
Show up in Second Life

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.920
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.040

So it looks like a shit ton of oculus drift games are coming out this week

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.900
Oh, could that be because the oculus rift retail release is happening. I think so

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:14.620

Ashes of the singularity

Hyperlight drifter for Windows and Mac Oh out sleeping dogs definitive edition for Mac

01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:59.160
Which is worth noticing just because it's a it's a game not made by Blizzard for the Mac. That's you know

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.420
triple-a title

01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.140
star ocean integrity and faithlessness

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:10.800
For ps4 and then taking it to the first which is I think the end of next week Adam's venture

origins for a Windows ps4 and Xbox one and then stick bold

01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:20.940
Exclamation point a dodgeball adventure for Windows. Is that related to Dax exclamation point? I

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:25.820
Don't think so, I think that game knows the lyrics to I will survive

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:31.660
Anyway, not everybody's gonna understand that that's okay. Is that it? Yeah, I finally get that

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.800
Moving on let's go to Japan. Let's all go in a plane right now

01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:39.820
Okay, since we can't let's look at their release calendar

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:43.020
So March 31st on the PlayStation 4 sees star ocean 5

01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:48.780
Integrity and faithlessness which Alan just mentioned is also coming out in Japan this week as well as winning post 8

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:54.560
2016 please note. This is not actually a game about post horses. That's right

01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:01.900
It's a horsey game and they love horsey games in Japan in chat ikuma son says, oh, yay. Welcome to Japan

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:03.840
That's right. We're all staying at your place

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:08.740
Yeah, I think you missed the episode of Kuma where we actually talked about we're coming to Japan and crashing at your place

01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.740
So hope there's room. All right anyway

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:16.460
On the Vita Kona Ozora needs to bust out. Whoa, he'll get a cruise sign

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:22.820
Comes out in regular and limited edition. I'm assuming this is based off an anime called cruise sign

01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:25.160
I am NOT up to up on my anime

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.780
But that's what this kind of looks like here

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:29.900
dating sim

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.300
visual novel

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:36.760
What you know, you love those so why not and then on the 3ds this week nothing

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:41.020
Nothing in Japan this week on the 3ds actually wait April 2nd

01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:45.020
Yokai-san go kushi not to be confused with

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:50.580
Yokai watch this is oh, no, it is it is the characters from yokai. Well, I take that back

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:53.620
it is the characters in yokai watch in a

01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:58.540
Different type of game this looks a little bit more like some type of

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:03.380
Tactical type of the romance of the three kingdoms. It actually means

01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:09.880
Records of the three empires. So it's yokai watch three romances. Well, that's an interesting little crossover there

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:14.640
So yeah, I'm assuming that's gonna be the big release in Japan this week then because yokai. Yep

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:21.920
So coming out in the UK just a few things on the 28th. We have a drift for PC and

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.600
we have gun jack and

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:32.520
pinball FX to VR and then on the 29th, we have Resident Evil 6 for ps4 and

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.640
Xbone

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.640
Sorry Xbox one

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.640
The Xbone, you know

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:42.080
I'm innocent and no one saw that except us

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.960
That's it

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.960
La la la. All right, just a couple more stories for you guys

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:52.440
And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week Rob's real favorite game

01:42:52.440 --> 01:43:00.080
I I'm so excited about this week's classic game. You guys don't I can't even I literally cannot even but first Alan

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.720
Game stop for their shareholders having a rough time

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:13.440
A game shop share game stop shares are collapsing after the company said it expects sales to fall this quarter

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:17.720
So they put out, you know a release saying hey, we know what our numbers are looking like

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:25.080
So we're you know, it's not gonna be a surprise. This is what's happening. And of course

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:31.360
Shares fell as much as 7% I don't really actually to see if this has

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.360
This

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.920
Story caught me by surprise so close after the release dates, so

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.080
So game stops in trouble, basically

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:49.440
yeah, they're losing money which I don't want to say yay cuz like people work there and a lot of people who love video games

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.160
get their foot in the door by working at GameStop until they

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:58.540
Become jaded and miserable and leave because they're apparently not really a good place to work for really

01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.460
I'm not gonna shit on the employees really because do you know what I was gonna say about GameStop?

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:17.220
Regardless of what they represent like people who absolutely have to buy their groceries at Walmart because that's what they can afford

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.100
Don't hate on them hate the fact that just Walmart's a big gross company. All right. All right

01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:26.160
Yeah, I think as of March 24th they were

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:33.800
They they were 30 bucks a share which doesn't really seem all that bad to me but

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:41.760
Well, if the company used to be like $60 a share now, they're $30 a sure it actually would be so it's not even like

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:44.720
They're there in their death throes, you know

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:49.280
Get get ready to put them on a boat and set them on fire and kick them out to see it's not to that point

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.280
Yet they're just they're not doing well

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:53.080
But

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:59.240
But but they're gonna they're gonna make all that money through nerd licensing and they're gonna they're basically gonna become hot topic

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:03.320
But instead of like shirts for your favorite topic is the video game hot topic

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:09.200
You know, it's like half kirby t-shirt Zelda t-shirts. That's true. It's like instead of the metal band t-shirts

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.760
It'll be like oh and here's our used. It's all Kingdom Hearts and Adventure Time, which I'm all for that's true

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.140
I'm like, I'm fucking 37 years old still shop a hot topic cuz that's where I get some really funny shirts

01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:24.660
So, what can you do and they got think geek now too, I think yeah, they're thinking with merchandise soon

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:30.340
Well, I know GameStop's also been getting into that whole like use tablet and like, you know devices

01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.600
so, you know that I will give them at least that as much as you know,

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.860
I have to razz on in a little bit cuz you know GameStop at least they are trying like they can kind of see the

01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:40.980
end coming so they're really trying to

01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:43.220
like

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:45.220
Think fast and not have that happen

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.700
So, all right

01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:52.180
Well, anyhow, let's move on one more story here and then we'll get to the classic game of the week

01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:56.420
And this has to do with making your own steam controller. That's right

01:45:56.420 --> 01:46:02.140
You can just if you have the technical know-how, why don't just build your own damn controller. You think it's so easy

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:08.140
You think you think we charge too much of this controller here go build your own damn controller because valve

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:13.980
Actually released the CAD files the computer-aided design CAD files for the steam controller

01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:20.900
They actually post it on Steam. Here's a zip file. And if you have the technical know-how, you can actually use a 3d printer and

01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:23.540
Be on your way like you know

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:26.420
You're gonna have to know the technical know-how to like wire it together and shit

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:31.000
But if you are that person go ye forth and build your own steam controller

01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:39.100
That is kind of crazy for a company that is first getting into hardware like valve to be doing that but I found that

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:40.580
fascinating

01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:47.360
But valve does say as far as commercial use goes valve will have to approve designs and give permission

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:52.960
Before users are allowed to sell their work because you know right now somebody is like, okay

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:58.780
Well now these CAD design is out here. How do I place these two directional pads right on top of tits?

01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:04.540
Somebody is thinking that right now

01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:06.620
So if they want to be able to sell that commercially

01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:11.100
They're gonna have to get valves permission and I can think I think Lord gave him in his temple Michael

01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:20.460
No, so, you know, I I don't think I don't think the tit controller will actually be available or balls whatever you're into

01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:26.060
You know, there's some somebody's trying to figure. I will allow a half-life episode 3 before I let those things

01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:29.420
We all know how that's gonna go down

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:35.100
Akuma JP in our chat over at live dot vog network comm says darn there goes my idea. Well, I'm sorry. Sorry

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:40.580
Sometimes we break the difficult news here on this show. I'm sorry to say. All right

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:45.580
Let's get to the classic game of the week every week dark soccer steps into the gaming vault

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:53.600
And she finds a game that she thinks hey you insufferable little brats of the world. I mean you adorable children

01:47:54.020 --> 01:48:01.960
Why don't you take a take a look back on a classic game at least 10 years old that you need to respect?

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.280
Respect

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.300
Because all future games have this game to thank for where they come from

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.320
And I think that's especially true about this week's game

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:16.560
Which I'm so glad you decided when we have such esteemed guests here from the Sacramento IGDA

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:22.200
I'm so glad you picked this dark soccer this we had to pick it out the classic game

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.160
I had to pick it out from a bin under the bed that was covered in dust bunnies

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:32.320
And then I like how to make sure the cat didn't pee on it so so what is it what is this week's classic game?

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.780
Of the week shy swirled. I mean spice world

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:47.500
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah, it's appropriate because we had the the news of the 20th anniversary tour this week

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.240
So this is this is by the way

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.120
Hello, by the way. Hi there. How are you doing?

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.800
By the way

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.500
This game. I'm sorry. The Spice Girls are celebrating their 20th anniversary this year

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.560
How old are you?

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:11.400
All right quiet. We're trying to do a segment here. He's my segment. I was only three years old when wannabe came out. Yeah, right

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.240
This game well, I believe that this was what 1998 yeah

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:25.520
Yeah, well the Spice Girls were really only around for about four years so yeah, I had to be he was hilarious

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:27.920
I love the movie. It's so bad. It's

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:35.960
Meatloaf and back before like he was like fucking crazy meatloaf and Richard O'Brien and ab fab girls

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:41.800
Like it's oh my god. You showed me that movie when we started dating and he didn't dump me on the spot

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.440
I was really I was super on board with it until the aliens showed up and I was like, okay

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:51.160
Is this for real? Is this really happening in this movie when the flying saucer came?

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:54.960
I was hook line and sinker and that that was what broke it for me

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600
So

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:03.000
To move on

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.540
Basically in this game you have to prepare the Spice Girls for a live

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:12.120
Television concert and you have to teach them their dance steps because they don't know this by heart

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:19.160
You have to choose what song to perform and the sequence in which the songs lyrics will be sung because without

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.040
Teleprompters, how are they ever gonna remember their lyrics?

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.720
you know, so

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:28.280
So then you play once you get all of that put together

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:34.320
You play as the camera person and you pick what shots will go and the angle and everything

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.320
So you were basically their manager designer?

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:38.840
camera person and PR

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.640
and then

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:46.700
You also get instructed by it says a disco King

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:52.080
let's do so anyway, the Spice Girls all it's all their voices in here and

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.760
Who cares about the game because the Easter eggs are hilarious

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.360
so first of all

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:06.120
In the menu, you have the mixing room dance practice dance record television studio spice network and options the songs in the game

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.800
Are wannabes say you'll be there

01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:15.920
Who do you think you are spice up your life move over and if you can't dance is in the intro to become one is

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:21.120
Only in the spice Network and naked is only in the spice Network. So this game

01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.760
got a

01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:26.120
Two out of ten from IGN

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.940
3 because you can't spell ignorant without IGN

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:37.620
It got a 2.3 from EGM electronic game monthly gaming monthly

01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:42.140
There's a reason why they're out of this game. We know why they're gone

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:48.020
I'll blow low gave them 2.3 out of 10 now a gamer which I don't think I've ever heard of

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:51.900
Was 2.5 out of 10 and the New York Times said it was unfavorable

01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:56.020
New York to reach that rag

01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:58.940
And

01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:02.860
Out of the game rankings site they got

01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:11.900
40% out of four whole reviews. So what about all the good things spice world did it's still better than et apparently

01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:18.260
It kept meatloaf relevant for a while. I have had some of the biggest laughs

01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:24.080
I have never liked some of my best gaming memories are actually with this game because I laughed so hard that I

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:29.600
Actually peed my pants like it is just this game. Is that funny? I'm sorry

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.520
Not so I have to give you the codes for this the cheat codes because they're hilarious

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:37.560
There's one called spiffy you dance moves

01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:45.800
So you get new moves by holding start and then square triangle circle triangle and you get dance studio and just dance a lot

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:50.520
And then of course, this is PlayStation 1. Okay, then you get naked spice

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.120
Ooh

01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:56.200
so if you do the hidden messages code and then you do

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.200
L1 l2 r1 r2 select and start

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:07.580
Simultaneously to reset the game and you get an alternate title screen that has them all naked except for sitting in chairs covering their bits

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.880
Get out. That was a thing. That was a thing. I

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:14.080
shit you not I

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.880
Somebody just put that on Wikipedia. Oh

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:21.200
Oh my god, I never knew that was the thing that you could actually do

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:28.640
Rob has to see this. That's okay. You just I'll see you during break. Well, I'm gonna put it in the chat room

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:34.520
Oh, will you now? Oh boy. All right, check that out over at live dog network calm. Here comes some naked spice girls

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:42.480
Naked spice so the premise is that you have to help them with their dance moves and they're remembering the lyrics

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.520
Oh my god, cuz it sounds like

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:48.280
it sounds like the game starts off as

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.480
The Spice Girls aren't very bright

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:56.780
You need to you need to help them like with their with what they do for a living the part that's killing me

01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.660
I am like I'm like laughing crying over here. Look at the

01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:05.680
expressions on like Jerry's face and like scary space like

01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:09.520
fucking scary spice is like spread-eagle in that chair going

01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.160
No, that's posh in the middle oh

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:20.760
My god, I'm scary is the one on the left looking like a rabbit, honey. I know my Spice Girls

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:27.440
Scarier anyhow, go ahead. Sorry. Sorry, go ahead and finish

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:35.280
Anyway other codes you can get a new title screen

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:38.640
With codes you can get giant spice

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.440
So

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:46.440
At the main menu when your characters walking across the globe if you hold start and press circle square circle square

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.200
Then they'll grow up to giant size

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.660
You also can get the hidden messages. This was the thing that takes you to the naked spice

01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:03.080
Where when your characters walking across the globe you hold start button circle triangle triangle circle

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.040
And then you'll get a code to confirm and you enter in more shit

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.160
You can look this up for yourselves and then the handbag code. This is great

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.260
Set the globe you press the start square triangle circle triangle

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:19.240
After that when you go to the television studio when your act is ready

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.880
Instead of everyone standing in a line all the Spice Girls will be crowded around a pile of handbags on the floor

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
That's it

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.040
Ah

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.040
Game of the year game of the millennia. Really? I mean, is there is there a more important?

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:40.560
I mean, I know I just said that whole thing about Symphony of the Night, but then I'm like, oh, yeah Spice World shit

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:48.160
Like Castlevania doesn't even fucking matter anymore. No, no, what is a man a miserable pile of naked spice girl codes?

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.960
Alan I feel like you're dying to say something over there about Spice World. No. No, did you play?

01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:58.000
Did you play this game when it was first out? No, you will you know, it's hilarious

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:02.800
Is that our buddy Brad from pod culture celebrated 500 episodes last week in here?

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:10.000
They Brad actually sent me a copy of Spice World for PlayStation 1 and I have yet to do a live stream of it

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.560
Cuz I didn't get my PlayStation 3 cuz you have to do like some bypass protection on PlayStation 3 so long story short

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:17.360
I haven't done it yet, but I really think Alan

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:22.040
I think we should sit down and take some serious time to actually play through the game. What do you think? Sure sound like

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:25.120
You're so easy to please

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.480
Hello what what I have another game that is

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:35.160
Not oh, yeah, it's it's kind of I guess the same theory

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.080
But I'll tell you what at the time I couldn't make my way through the game

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:45.720
but it's on Dreamcast called super producers and it's basically you're controlling a pop idols career and

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:49.960
It kind of makes me think cuz these came out like around the same time

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.800
That I wonder if one or the other wasn't the inspiration or something

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.720
All

01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.720
Right. Well, we're gonna take a quick break guys. We're running a maybe a little bit long tonight

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:02.920
But when we come back, I think our guests are still gonna be here you guys do you stay?

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.040
Okay, so they're gonna stay a little longer

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:09.400
We'll talk to them a little more and we'll get your calls at one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:14.360

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.640
2016

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:38.620
Joined tonight with our special guests here in studio Gabe and Brianna from the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:40.080
Thanks for having fun with us tonight

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:44.460
I know I know you guys must have loved the spice world pick their classic game of the week. That was

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.320
hilarious

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.840
Yes

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:52.200
Educational too. Yeah, it was it was educational. It was better than chubby cherub

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:56.480
how how is spice world inspired you as a game designer, um, I

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.800
Yes that answer

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:09.640
That's all I've got. Yes. I'm still convinced to this day that the Jerry at that time

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.120
Would have probably qualified as a bioqueen

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:18.320
You you have been like all like like drag-queening your life this past week

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.860
Not that I'm gonna complain, but I feel like you like just now finally suddenly figured out. Oh, yeah

01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:27.440
I should be watching RuPaul's Drag Race. No, it's not just that it's that I appreciate art

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:29.200
and

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.200
I have discovered this is an art

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:34.200
And so I have absolutely fall in love with it because you know

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:38.160
I pick an obsession like that lasts me for six months and then I'd move on to something else

01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:40.160
It's like Alan playing games

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:43.780
But am I wrong no, I would recommend

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:46.320
It's 25 minutes long

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:50.380
Which is actually sped up from the normal to our process of just watching

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:55.280
Trixie talk through putting on her makeup. Oh, I have and it's a couple times

01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:01.760
It's incredible and doing makeup on that other guy the bald guy st. James. Yeah, who is one of the club kids

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:06.400
So I knew him from that. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Okay, so if

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.400
Drag queens are art

01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:12.680
And if video games are art

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:17.440
Where is my RuPaul's Drag Race video game?

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:21.600
This is not like I feel like this is an SAT equation

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:26.760
That has not been accurately based channel 5 came out for the second recast in 1999

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:34.440
What's that from here out? I am going to combine dragon cosplay. Oh

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.640
Okay, interesting starting with my cosplay this year for gamer X are you are you going as ooh la la

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:47.320
This is a bad list. Okay. All right. I am going I've already decided to do my moto kuma outfit

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:49.840
It's gonna be

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:55.560
I'm actually going to invest in a good wig. I'm going to buy makeup specifically for this

01:59:56.040 --> 02:00:01.200
Just remember if you're not wearing nails, you're not doing drag. I'm having bear gloves. All right

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:08.160
Anyway, I'll paint the nails on them fifth dream in chat says drag in age get it

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:12.600
Over here dying over here

02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.640
maybe

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:16.640
Well, I was not in the first game before

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:24.520
Corrects me with an email. I do know there was an iPhone game that like I think was calling dragopolis or something

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:29.200
Yeah, because I know they were advertising going gamer X but I know it was a runner, right?

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:37.400
Dorian's contour work, but but here's my thing. I need my full like immersive we you

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:42.520
Tablet actually know now I want to aim for PlayStation VR now

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:45.320
I think we should be able to actually walk the main stage

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:51.280
No, just have it on ps4 with an option for VR

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.640
No, right for those of us who get completely motion sick and would throw up on the heels. All right, fine fine

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:02.160
Maybe ps4 K. This is this is a use. This is a justifiable use of 4k

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.680
I need to see all of the colors and Kim she'll you murder face says it perfectly a drag race MMO. I

02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:15.800
Love it. I love it. Why not? But see I I think the cosplay in and of itself is related

02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:21.120
I think any dude that's playing a female tune in an MMO is kind of doing a drag race

02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:23.480
To begin with

02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:27.640
That's just the way I approach things I

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.920
Have been considering that cosplay really isn't that far of a step off. It's not

02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:40.200
Especially for cross players. Mm-hmm, you know, it's art dress-up is fun period dress-up is fun. That's it

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:42.200
Yeah, and putting on a lot of makeup

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:47.400
That takes an hour. Mm-hmm is very satisfying when you're done with it and even more to wash it off

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.400
Why don't you cross play for a sack indie arcade? I bet they'd love that

02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:56.480
I don't have a costume for that right now. Just have my I just have my Grey Warden

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:01.800
And I ain't wearing that it then when it's hot. I was gonna say Grey Warden. Yes

02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:09.120
I do have my Joker outfit from Mass Effect 3, but if I'm gonna be working all day, I probably it's so it's such a

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:13.160
Like actually it makes me not like night. Hey bitch, I'm hot

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:17.060
Like I know like I'm physically hot and sweaty and fucking nasty

02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.680
Well, the thing is that as warm as your outfit is I've got more layers on mine

02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:28.440
Yeah, yeah, and I was hot in the middle of December at the beginning of December in that thing. So

02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:36.200
All right. I I am I am really pleased at how the chat room is really engaging in this whole conversation

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.340
I love our listeners fifth dream in chat says I want a rocky horror picture show game

02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:47.060
They made two based off the play believe it or not. There was one in on like the Apple to eat all those years ago

02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:53.420
Yeah, well it had graphics but it was like derpy graphics. Yeah, it was like the original King's Quest type of graph. Yeah

02:02:54.780 --> 02:03:01.260
And then they made one for the revival on CD-ROM in like the late 90s

02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:07.220
But it was what you would expect on early CD-ROM games. First double six says drag racing star

02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:12.340
A drag racing star. That's actually it's called sing star Abba. I don't know if any of you have it

02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:17.540
I do I own that and sing star Queen. So it's kind of I'm kind of already there. I'm one step ahead of you, buddy

02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:22.120
Tiger conscious is the drag race game should be Mario Kart style

02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:24.900
Sold. I

02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:26.900
Agree, I oh man. I

02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:32.100
Take a road to a whole new level as I say rainbow road blue shells. Oh

02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:35.820
Yes, seriously, like when you blue shell somebody it could be bitch

02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:38.940
a

02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:42.180
Kuma son says that they wish that they had drag race over there

02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:46.220
Yeah, there are ways of obtaining that's right

02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:52.060
You gotta you gotta use especially even when we whitelist the logo site and it still won't let us pass the commercials

02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:57.360
All right, that was five minutes of drag queen talk here on the show. So there we've met our quota for tonight

02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:03.700
Let's go around the gaming industry and do some rapid-fire gaming news help coming late to it. It's fine. It's fine

02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:06.780
I'm fashionably late to nobody's perfect. Except me. I understand

02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:09.220
All right

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:11.820
Let's do some news real quick very quickly

02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:19.020
I believe Ubisoft has Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell movies coming out historically video game movies

02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:23.820
Don't do as well because they're generally not good

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:30.020
a lot of hype is riding on the World of Warcraft movie, but Ubisoft has made it clear that

02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:35.260
once Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell once they come out if really if there's

02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:38.700
If it looks like they're gonna make their money back and there's any positive buzz

02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:45.000
They're just gonna bankroll the sequels almost immediately. Like they're very interested in making both of those franchises or both of those

02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:53.340
IPs franchises, so there's gonna be an Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell 2 movie unless of course it bombs

02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:55.860
Spectacularly and maybe they'll probably make them anyway

02:04:56.460 --> 02:05:01.860
As an aside there have been like three or four hitman movies and I've they've had a different dude play

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:06.140
Because I was at Target and I saw the hitman blu-ray and I was like

02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:11.540
I thought the drug dealer from go or whatever that guy's name is was the hitman but it's like no they've they made another one

02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:13.540
With a different dude in it. Yeah, that's very true. Yep

02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:21.240
Again quickly the founder and creator of the oculus rift Palmer lucky

02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:28.460
Has worked, you know blood sweat and tears and getting this thing developed and working and to make it a viable

02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:35.660
Consumer product that it was just available via retail and wasn't some weird exclusive dev kit and he said damn it

02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:37.660
This has been you know, my life's work

02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.420
I'm not gonna let some scrub at UPS

02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:43.160
delivery guy give the first customer

02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:50.940
This this baby of mine, so he flew to Alaska to give a pre-order to a dude like two days before everyone else

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:57.220
Making great use of Facebook's billions. Just no I it's cool. I think that's cool

02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:00.500
So yeah, everyone else I guess gets theirs tomorrow, but he made a point to fly out

02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:03.340
To give this random

02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:05.340
Alaska dude his rift

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:08.820
Rock band for say I didn't even know about this rock band for

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:13.700
PC which I believe it's not a Kickstarter. It's a fig. I think it said

02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:21.020
Crowd crowdfunding thing harmonics is trying to get a rock band for released unlike previous

02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:23.660
licenses on let's say the

02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:26.460
PlayStation or Xbox

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:28.580
none of the DLC or

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:34.280
a la carte songs that you would buy for it would carry over even if you own one of those previous licenses because all the

02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:36.060
PC is a different

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:37.380
method of

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:41.780
Delivery every iteration of how you could play a piece of IP has to be licensed

02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:45.740
Well, if you are willing to give twenty five hundred dollars

02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:54.260
To this fig campaign for rock band for to come out on PC. You will get every single a la carte song

02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:57.620
That has been that is available on the rock band store

02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:00.940
every single song and I imagine that's possible because

02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:04.500
What medium or what platform is?

02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:10.300
Dot saw song on dogs songs digitally licensed for first

02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:15.660
iTunes Amazon Google which are all PC

02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:18.460
Methods of

02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:20.420
Purchase or Mac or whatever

02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:24.660
So I imagine that's how they're able to do that so you can scroll through the entire list and go

02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:26.020
I don't know what I want to play

02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:31.860
Yes, so for if you have $2,500 you and this game is made as a super hella donor

02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:37.660
Whatever you will get every single DLC a la carte song for rock band. All right, I'll get right on that

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:44.620
How's that sound take some of our savings and buy every DLC song ever. Is that sound good? Yes. Yay. I don't need a car. I

02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:46.300
I

02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:48.300
Need a rock band. I don't need a car

02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:55.100
Let's talk about game trailers. I remember it was about a month or two ago game trailers kind of shut their doors suddenly

02:07:55.100 --> 02:08:00.040
Well, guess what happened? Some of the team has actually reassembled and now they are called easy allies

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.460
You can find that on you know

02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:05.340
Twitch and Twitter and all that good stuff and of course

02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:09.900
They're on patreon because that's the way a lot of these companies are doing business these days

02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:15.300
So, there you go, if you want to check out the personalities from game trailers, they're probably over easy allies now

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:22.720
So check that out killer instinct season 3 is on the way and season 3 can be purchased either through a combo breaker

02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:25.100
ultra-edition and supreme edition

02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:30.860
Apparently the windows 10 players are gonna get the supreme edition for $10 less than the Xbox one

02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:37.500
This is because there is no killer instinct classic or killer instinct 2 classic in the PC version of the bundle

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:42.380
So anyhow, the combo breaker will have eight new fighters including rash arbiter

02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:49.340
Kim Wu and tusk that will be available on Xbox one for $20 and then the ultra edition has a VIP

02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:52.680
double XP booster retro costumes accessory sets

02:08:53.140 --> 02:09:00.160
And a bunch of other crap for 40 bucks and then the supreme edition is crap upon crap in the game for $60 for a lot

02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:01.380
of crap

02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:03.620
Anyhow, you might be interested

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:09.500
We've talked a lot about Castlevania tonight. And if you are a fan of old-school Castlevania, I'm talking to 8-bit Castlevania

02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.660
You might want to check out brave earth

02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:16.700
prologue brave earth prologue was first announced in 2011 and

02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:20.720
This is from the same developer as I want to be the guy

02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:27.740
And he's actually went over to steam greenlight to kind of pitch this game and get the game greenlit

02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.840
So you can check that out over on steam greenlight

02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:37.760
Inspired by Castlevania Ninja Gaiden these old games a 2016 release is almost assured

02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.840
For difficulty settings in the game from I'm assuming easy to dear God make it stop

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:47.080
Let's move on dark soccer

02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:50.440
Well, there is gonna be a new gaming show in the UK

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:58.180
Well, it will be on UK TV later this year called Dara O'Brien's go 8-bit and it could suck

02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:04.700
It could be good. But basically it's combining retro gaming with the latest technology and

02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:10.300
Viewers of all ages so should come out autumn 2016. So

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.520
okay, and then

02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:19.500
David hater has words to say about Kojima

02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:24.660
Basically

02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:30.360
He was asked if he was going to play the phantom pain his response was yeah

02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:36.700
That'll be 60 hours of humiliation that I can't get to I haven't played the latest two iterations because it's just too painful

02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:43.440
And he asked if you would work with Kojima again, and he says I've got no particular love for Kojima

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:45.440
I don't feel any need to go back and work with him again

02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:47.220
and

02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:49.220
Then last but not least

02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:51.620
There we were really quick on the Kojima thing

02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:55.980
I think especially because now you actually know the backstory behind this dark Sakura

02:10:55.980 --> 02:11:01.700
I think after you talk about like what David hater said about Hideo Kojima you need this

02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:12.020
It's the shade button people it's the shade button when you throw when you throw shade, you know

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:16.220
You got to use the little button there. So if I you know say a little zinger like, you know

02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:18.820
well, you know we we

02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:21.060
Breakups are very hard to get over anyway

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:23.900
so

02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:28.780
Also, it could be possible that we may have Tekken 7 on

02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:33.140
Home computers on PC

02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:36.900
So there were there was a poll out

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:42.200
This one was a very extensive poll asking for impressions of fighters

02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:46.500
but also there was a mention about seeing if

02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:52.740
There would be any interest in having it on PC, I think this was

02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:57.220
Japan only so far

02:11:58.420 --> 02:11:59.540
but

02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:03.640
Who knows I wouldn't mind it and then we'd all get to mod it and I could have you know

02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:07.900
All kinds of pretty things happen on the screen then

02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:13.420
All right, we're gonna get to our frugal question of the week

02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:19.860
But first I want to point out a kaijuto and chat talking about the shade button says if you have to explain the sound effect

02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:21.860
It's not a good sound effect

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:28.180
Thank you for that kaijuto appreciate that you're just feeling left out by the way

02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:30.660
I want to apologize some folks in the chat room are complaining

02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:35.300
I guess some mic is making some weird noises and unfortunately, one of the things about live radio is that

02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:38.740
No, I think it might it's either mine or it's Alan's

02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:41.200
I don't know because I know Alan's mic has been having some issues. But anyway

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:42.600
Sorry about that

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:44.520
If you are hearing like crackling or something

02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:50.680
It sounds like one of these wires might be dying and to be fair these mics which were graciously donated by our buddy Brad from

02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:52.680
Podculture they are reaching

02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:56.160
Several years old at this point. I mean they were in the last studio

02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:58.720
Yeah, it might be time for a shopping spree

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.400
Time to buy ourselves something fancy

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:06.920
Can't wait. So sorry for sorry that you guys are putting up with that. So we'll we'll work on that

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:11.720
Meanwhile, let's get to the frugal question of the week every week

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:17.520
You guys go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and google.com

02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:21.280
Slash plus orange lounge radio and we ask a question and you answer it

02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:39.920
Over on Facebook and Google Plus we asked we have our special guests tonight from the Sacramento IGDA to talk to us about the indie arcade gaming expo

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.920
So we thought we'd ask about indie games

02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:47.220
What is your favorite indie or underground game that you've played that you don't think many people have heard about?

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:50.800
So we did a little thing for indie games. So, let's see

02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:56.640
Andy are actually replied over on Facebook and said I think a lot of people have heard about it

02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:01.760
But guacamelee is probably one of my favorite indie games hand of fate might be a little more obscure

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:04.520
It is one I'd recommend to anyone who is intrigued by a roguelike

02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:09.400
where you build a deck of cards that determines the pieces that the roguelike builds on as

02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:13.080
G100 Matt says for a long time. I was playing the forest on Steam

02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:16.920
The game is a survival horror game with plenty of crafting and jump scares

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:19.400
The game has been in early access for the past 20 months

02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:24.720
But excuse me, the creators and dev team updated at least one to two times a month and chat with fans frequently

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.880
The game has gone through a lot of changes, but it's a lot of fun

02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:33.360
Even though there's no real ending to it yet. I would definitely recommend it to people but keep in mind that it's still in early access

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:42.240
Retertainment says I just got into her story on iOS her stories narrative and presentation hooked me in a way that no other iOS game

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.640
Has I don't know how well-known her story is considering the awards at one last year

02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.520
But her story is a game that should be more well-known than it is

02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:55.880
Ragenator says the closest thing that fits the bill for me would be super stardust HD a PSN game on PlayStation 3

02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:57.580
When I was a console gamer

02:14:57.580 --> 02:15:01.000
This is an early PSN purchase for me and ended up being one of my favorites

02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:06.660
Being played regularly up until my system was stolen very addicting. That's a shitty ending though. Sorry to hear about that

02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:10.620
Degenerate I remember hearing about that when it happened, but it sucks hearing about it now

02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:18.020
Jenner Johnny says I think everyone shouldn't be surprised with my choice. Although many have heard of its controversies and a successful Kickstarter

02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:22.900
It's apparent that very few have actually experienced the MMO card game hex shards of fate

02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:26.700
It's well thought-out RPG elements strategically structured campaign

02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:31.420
Beautiful artwork on its vast library of cards and it's extremely flexible tournament schedules

02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:37.780
Hex trading card game has been placed as my favorite indie underground game as well as favorite card game of all time

02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:41.700
Fifth dream says I love a game called chroma squad

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:47.340
It's a strategy RPG that simulates running a TV studio shooting a super sentai series

02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:54.020
You are the director and customize your team manage their costumes weapons sponsors insurance, even their giant robot

02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:55.300
You have to keep awesome

02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:59.040
You have to keep your ratings up and fulfill fan requests during TV episodes

02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:04.980
One of the fans in the game is me since I pledged to a kickstarter way back when it's a really funny and fun game

02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:09.580
And dar Tetsuya on Facebook says I actually completed labulana on Steam a few weeks ago

02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:13.940
I can't recommend it enough though. You may want to walk through or some guide to help you if you get stuck

02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:19.460
It's very much like Simon's quest as far as hints go my last completion clocked in at 60 hours

02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:26.620
So you'll be getting a lot of playtime for the asking price and lastly over on Google+. Josh why said our lux

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:32.300
This is the very essence of an RTS and I think it's the AI that makes it

02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:36.460
It doesn't give any quarter and it's always in the balance if you can make it through

02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:44.300
So it's available there on Windows and Android and iOS. So you left some little links there over on our Google+. page

02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:50.440
So there it is our frugal question of the week any guy anything you guys want to plug here a great indie game

02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.440
You think more people need to know about?

02:16:53.380 --> 02:17:00.660
Without your own game. Sorry Gabe. Yeah, you have to plug that Alan anything that I can think of like for example hotline

02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:03.020
Miami incredible soundtrack very violent

02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:07.460
There's tons of hype for that game. So everything indie that I can think of

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:10.420
Already has you know?

02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:14.540
Momenta behind it like there are no real sleeper hits that no one knows about that. I've played

02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:18.820
Hot duffel boyfriend

02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:23.040
Because it's great and pigeons

02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:28.740
And I know this one is is huge and it's gaining a lot of steam lately

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:34.780
But I still think there are some people maybe in this room dark soccer that very badly need to play stardew Valley

02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:38.820
So I'm just saying well and don't forget though about off

02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.460
mm-hmm and

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:47.580
Great now, I just forgot the name of it and I know the game and I gave it to you Undertale Undertale. Yes

02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:49.580
Oh, yeah Undertale

02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:55.140
Yeah, everybody knows Undertale. Yeah, but off was really good. It was kind of big on tumblr for a while

02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:59.060
Yeah, but I still like my bird dating game. Mm-hmm

02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:04.260
Jamie mentioned how to full boyfriend there is a game

02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:07.580
that

02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:10.740
I'm kind of hesitant to recommend because it is

02:18:12.420 --> 02:18:16.300
It's an adult game and the fact that it has sexual elements and it really does hurt

02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:21.020
What the game otherwise would be it's called Super Health Club. You've seen me play this game Rob

02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:26.980
It's a gay visual novel slash romance simulator where you're at a gym and there are four different guys at the gym

02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:29.980
and there is

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:33.300
Explicit there are porny moments. Yes

02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:38.300
And it's like if there was a game like that when I was 15

02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:44.260
Minus the porn it would have been incredibly important to me to play a game where I could like be a boy flirting with other

02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:46.260
boys

02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:49.180
Yeah, that's Philip that's the guy who I romance first

02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:52.980
So that I think is definitely a game

02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:56.140
An indie game that doesn't have really a lot of hype to it

02:18:56.140 --> 02:19:00.340
But it would help to be gay and it would be it would help to be okay with that type of content

02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:02.540
What was that a Super Health Club Super Health Club? Okay

02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:06.820
Indie game Gabe, I mean you've obviously played a lot of them

02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:10.780
Yeah, there's so many

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:15.180
I'm gonna I'm gonna totally name something like not recent at all

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:20.260
It's it's actual physical this game on the 360. It's called the El Shaddai

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.540
Yeah

02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:25.340
Awesome. Yeah

02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:27.340
Yeah, that that is um

02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:30.140
That was a game. I did not expect whatsoever

02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:38.220
Wow, what a game what a game it touches upon a lot of historical religious references, which is something I'd you know, it's

02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:44.700
Never it where it's rarely ever executed really well, but El Shaddai on the 360. Oh my goodness

02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:46.180
I think it may be on the ps3 also

02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:51.660
but but yeah, that was I think it was sort of a sleeper hit because it plays just like

02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:55.620
Devil may cry with like the gameplay

02:19:55.700 --> 02:20:02.520
But it's a whole different whole different other ball of wax of what's involved and stuff. Nice. Yeah

02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:04.520
All right. Yeah, cool. All right

02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:06.140
Well, let's move on

02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:11.320
We're gonna get back into some other news and then we're gonna open up the skype line here before too long over at

02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:19.000
1877 game olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio, but first Alan with another news story. I

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:22.960
Was talking in chat and I got distracted

02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:27.840
How about now you good yes, I'm good now, right

02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:32.480
Nintendo has applied for a trademark on

02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:36.240
Actually, Rob, you may be able to help me with this story and pull it up on YouTube

02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:39.560
I'm not putting you on the spot Nintendo apply totally are

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:43.480
Nintendo applies for trademark on the iconic

02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:47.560
Mario coin sound which has been a

02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:55.200
Notification on people's cell phones for when they get an email. It's a very very easily easily found on the internet

02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.200
Just a little wave clip of that

02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:03.100
Ding or I can't even which actually there isn't one on this story, but everybody knows the Nintendo coin noise. Everybody knows it

02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:08.000
I love though that it's actually they have the musical notes written here. Yes, that's

02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:11.280
Fantastic, so they're trying to get that trademark

02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:15.680
They registered it in Japan first obviously on the J

02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:22.720
Platt Pat website and the part of the trademark like you just said is the sheet music of the tone

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:27.460
It's because a lot of ROM hacks or like super super indie

02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:31.720
Bike will use that sound effect because it's so recognizable and they kind of want to put

02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:37.200
A pin in that and make it to where they can't just be used willy-nilly

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:40.120
Well, obviously the Mario coin sound is iconic

02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:45.360
But you know what else to me is iconic is the sound that you get when you get a ring in Sonic the Hedgehog

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:51.600
Yeah, and if you go to a gas station, I swear to God the cast registers some gas station with the same damn noise

02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:55.440
I throws me every time I'm like, no no, I'm giving you money

02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:00.840
Yeah, it's their UPC scanner. So when they are doing your vitamin water and pack of gum

02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.440
It's like the sonic ring noise

02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:07.600
Yes me out now always throws me is that around the nation or is that just here that like I think chevron?

02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:11.600
I feel like has that I don't know but it always throws me

02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:17.680
Okay, some other folks in chatter like yes. Yes, they do it is around the nation. Thank you. Okay, it's not just here

02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:20.200
Throws me every time

02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:26.400
So, there you go, I guess they have to trademark it because the cell phones and people that want that type of stuff so

02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:27.840
And

02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:30.560
Probably for knockoff things to like, you know

02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:36.400
When flappy bird had like pipes that like looked a lot like the pipes and Mario Brothers

02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:38.060
Yeah, you know that whole type of thing

02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:43.120
So they probably don't want the sound effects in other games because people may confuse it is

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:50.000
A Mario game when it is in fact not well, no Mario games will be available on the Xbox one

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.680
But if you do have an Xbox one

02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:56.480
There were a bunch of new updates to the firmware that were released this past week

02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:03.280
The Xbox a new firmware update went out and it improved Xbox elite wireless controller thumbstick precision

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:05.280
It launched the new Xbox

02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:12.200
Accessories app where there's now a page that will show you the firmware version as well as battery status and other details about the controller

02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:17.000
And now party chat can be included in twitch broadcasts

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.800
So if you're gonna broadcast your game on twitch

02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:24.280
You want other people to be able to comment along with that you can now do that through the party chat on twitch

02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:30.360
So that's pretty cool. If you're playing like a group game so you can all swear at each other across the entirety of the internet

02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:33.880
You know what? I still miss the Netflix party chat

02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:39.760
That was all that was probably next to that between that and one versus 100 on the Xbox 360

02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:45.440
Don't get me started gay. Forget it. Forget it. Those are my two favorite things. I miss that

02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:46.700
You had it yeah

02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:50.200
couldn't for those who don't have no idea what I'm talking about Netflix had a

02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:56.440
Had a feature where you and like what was it eight people up to eight people up to eight people can all sit in this

02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:00.760
Little makeshift theater that Netflix created and you can all watch this movie together

02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:04.680
Do you know how bad I know that for watching Pee Wee's big holiday?

02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:07.080
Do you know how bad I needed something like that?

02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:10.580
Cuz like I needed to be able to talk with Shane or something during that movie

02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:14.560
Which by the way, I did watch a couple days. Did you finish it? Oh, yeah

02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:20.560
It was it was corny but like there were parts where I like laughed till I cried like it was like really like it's like

02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:25.920
Stupid funny. My only issue with it is that it's like pretty much the exact same formula as the first movie

02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.080
Yeah, no, it's it's it's better than big top Pee Wee that's for sure

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:38.560
But it's probably not as good as Pee Wee's big adventure, but will anything ever be I forgot that the Italian lady in that one

02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:40.600
Mm-hmm was also in

02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:42.760
Escape from LA

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:46.240
Really no kidding. Yeah. Yeah, she got killed really quick

02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:53.580
Well, and what's great is that the you know the waitress that Pee Wee falls in love with and goes to the big dinosaur

02:24:53.580 --> 02:24:56.680
And Pee Wee's big adventure. Yeah, she's in this new one. Oh cool

02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:00.120
Yeah, so it was really cool to like see but in a different role, obviously

02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:03.880
So it was just really cool to see that but the part that killed me

02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:06.440
Absolutely killed me for those that have seen the movie

02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:11.360
I'm not gonna totally ruin it but it's the part where he goes to the Snake Ranch and they put him in the room and

02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:16.920
With the with the the scary snake and that's all I'm gonna say is his reaction to the scary snake

02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:22.640
I just I wasn't expecting that so I just cried like I was laughing so hard it was and it's so stupid

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:28.600
Anyway, that's all I'm gonna say those that have seen the movie know what I'm talking about those they haven't will we'll see it soon

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:34.640
Alright, uh, anyhow moving on also about hey Xbox one, not just my Netflix device

02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:39.280
you can also do backwards compatibility, which I've been doing a lot of this past week because

02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:44.880
Up next on my list after I beat Symphony of the Night is to go back and play Alan Wake before Quantum Break comes out

02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:48.640
So anyhow, but other games you can check out right now, you know

02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:50.740
Some folks want to go back and play Dark Souls

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:56.200
Before Dark Souls 3 comes out and you can do that now Dark Souls now on backwards compatibility

02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:02.200
Yeah, that's good. Also released this past week Tekken tag tournament 2 was a part of the backwards compatibility update

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:07.280
So I got I gotta say a Microsoft's been doing a great job kind of doing the slow trickle on

02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:14.640
It's almost like virtual console releases that I don't have to repay for I love it. Thank you Microsoft. Good guy Microsoft

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:19.840
All right. Let's move on Dark Soccer. I think you have another story for us. I

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Do indeed?

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:26.560
So there is a study that went out from Ohio State University

02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:29.100
basically

02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:31.400
293 female gamers who play online games

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:40.040
Were surveyed on this and they were asked if they received abuse in online games and what they and if they thought about it

02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:42.040
Or how much they thought about it offline?

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:49.840
And how the companies that produce these games are dealing with the harassment and then their own coping mechanisms

02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:56.260
So as it turned out that basically they didn't like, you know, swearing and name-calling or skill based insults

02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:00.600
But they they dealt with it. They put it aside. It wasn't a big deal

02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:03.600
Sexual harassment on the other hand

02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:07.180
Definitely sexist comments rape jokes rape threats

02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:10.640
did cause a lot of trauma and

02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.480
Almost made sure that they didn't want to go back and play the game again. It ruined the experience

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:24.000
You know and it was that they they get trash talking for what it is, but when you make it personal

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:31.460
That it lingers it makes you really uncomfortable and then it becomes associated with the game

02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:33.620
Not with the people playing it. So

02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:38.200
Hopefully

02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:42.960
You know, it's something that the game companies will take into account or try to help with a filter

02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:48.340
But they also said that they didn't blame the they didn't hold the companies accountable for it

02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:52.760
But they did blame them for not doing more to curtail it. So

02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:54.760
yeah, and I

02:27:54.760 --> 02:28:00.200
Imagine it's got to be tough to when you're the game developer and there's this open environment like Xbox Live and yeah

02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.240
I can totally see where if I'm playing a game online and the community is just really awful to me

02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.180
like I'm gonna blame the game and I'm not I'm probably not gonna go back because I don't want to see those people and

02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:15.040
It might kind of suck for the developer who quote-unquote may not have control over it

02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:19.280
Although granted you got a police your environment a little bit make sure it's not happening

02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:22.840
But I mean Xbox Live voice chat can be a very very difficult thing to

02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:29.320
Police, I think people just need to like fucking act mature a little bit mature on these games

02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:32.840
It's like Kai judo says in our chat room over at live.vog network.com

02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.800
Some guys go full-on dumbass when a girl gets on a game. It's so weird

02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:39.440
I was hanging out with a dude online for like two weeks

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.560
The guy was cool. Then one day a girl beat him in Halo 2 and he went batshit. I was shocked

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.740
It was the same guy like that's the problem dude needs to fucking

02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:55.020
Learn to be a human being well, I've had you know, things like that happen with me just a few times

02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:56.540
I've played online games

02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.420
I got one guy to shut up by telling him at stick a centipede in his dick hole

02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:03.700
Wow

02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:08.100
Yum Brianna's applauding over here. I

02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:15.060
Mean, you know I can give back cuz I'm not really gonna do it and he's probably you know

02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:19.100
Wouldn't and the other one I was like, so this is your username

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:21.440
I bet I can find you on the database and tell your mother

02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:28.060
Taking a hint from the girl who did do that when she was harassed online

02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:33.380
She found every single one of those guys copied and pasted the conversation with their parents

02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:34.940
It's awesome

02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:40.660
a lot of times these guys's emails will be like first initial dot last name at the place where they work and it's like I

02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:45.260
Can find you so easily and you're saying the most nasty shit on the internet

02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:50.860
Or or you know when I will remember when that happened even in a forum

02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:55.020
It was a certain somebody we used to play DDR with his friend

02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:02.300
Mmm, and so I tracked down, you know, I basically looked up their IP found out where they lived and said so you live here. Oh

02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:05.020
I'm sorry. This will never happen again

02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:07.020
It's

02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:11.380
The internet we can find everything we need to yeah people just need to

02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:15.980
Just need to be a little a little bit mature is a little maturity too much to ask online

02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:21.460
Apparently, well, this is why I rarely play with strangers if I play with strangers. I don't have voice chat on here

02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:25.820
Yeah, I hardly do it anymore either. I think I'm trying to remember what game it was

02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:29.780
I think the centipede when I remember what that was that was fantasy star online

02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.100
That explains

02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:42.140
It was just random group. I was running through rooms with mm-hmm

02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:47.980
And I don't even remember the situation, but he said just the most vile thing

02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:53.580
So and that was the first vile comeback I could come up with it's pretty good. Well, thank you. I'm pleased with that one

02:30:53.580 --> 02:30:56.940
I've been keeping it in my arsenal in case I ever needed the Rolodex of hate

02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:04.120
No, no, no, no, I can't I can't steal that from the fabulous Bianca del Rio, however

02:31:05.020 --> 02:31:08.920
I would probably have like the speed dial of pissiness

02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:11.340
about that

02:31:11.340 --> 02:31:13.180
All right

02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:17.220
Let's move on. We got some more news. We want to cover before we open up the skype line. So Allen

02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:20.820
Footage of

02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:23.560
Pokemon go the smartphone game was

02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:27.180
Leaked from South by Southwest that just happened. It's

02:31:27.700 --> 02:31:34.500
Niantic, which is an offshoot of Google which is made of the game ingress, which I know if Matt was here Loki Robin

02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:40.380
Him would go on and Jamie we play to um, don't act innocent. Yeah, I know we just had to do a lot

02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:45.380
Ton of farm level 10. Why are we going? Why are we going to Tucson? Can we not? Okay, that was that

02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:47.380
Has that been revealed? Oh

02:31:50.540 --> 02:31:55.340
There may or may not be a very big ingress event happening in Tucson that I may also

02:31:55.740 --> 02:32:02.500
We're only real reason to go to Arizona for anything and hold up hold up hold up and some really good

02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:08.420
We are meetings of my internet friends that you've already met. Yeah, I met a play ingress. No, they don't play

02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:11.980
Okay, so we had to get them hooked on ingress. Well if they're willing

02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:17.700
But so like Friday is friend day Saturday is nerd day. So, you know what?

02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:19.380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right

02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:25.620
Anyway, so the Pokemon go the way it's gonna work is if you have the notifications turned on your phone will buzz or beep when?

02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:29.900
There's a Pokemon near you you load up the game if you have any pokeballs and you decide you want this

02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:33.740
Pokemon you could tap the screen and throw the ball at it. Yeah, you have another Pokemon

02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:38.420
You get your gear. I believe this is with the in-game currency

02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:41.320
It says that the stores are gonna be at museums

02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:48.660
Monuments so in order to buy stuff in game you can't it's not just like you go to an NPC

02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:52.980
From the comfort of your living room. It sounds like you have to actually go out to get your Pokemon gear

02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:58.700
Also types of Pokemon will be specific to the environment that you go to

02:32:58.700 --> 02:33:00.700
So if you want a water or ocean

02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:06.820
Pokemon if there's a park that you go to that has a lake go there if you live on if you're lucky enough to live

02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:08.820
Coastside go to the beach. I

02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:11.380
imagined for landlocked areas a

02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:17.740
Public pool anything of like a fountain at a bank, you know, if you want to squirtle that's where he'd be. So

02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:20.540
Really excited for this

02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:24.420
There's a video of it

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:30.060
You can actually I think you go on Engadget and see their embed of the footage that was leaked from South by Southwest

02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:33.980
But yeah, if you want to stock up on stuff you need to go

02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:39.800
To a place of significance and also just go out and if you want a certain type of Pokemon

02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:41.800
It's it's all based on your geography

02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:47.880
I'm still curious and a lot of people on the the various forums that are out there are like so what about the battles?

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:52.580
What about the battle because they haven't really said a lot about that yet. Yeah the PvP, but I'm I'm curious enough

02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:54.420
I mean, I'm definitely gonna check out Pokemon go

02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:57.180
I don't know if it's gonna be make be enough to make me quit ingress

02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:03.860
But I mean if they are have a decent battle system in it, I I may not be playing ingress as much

02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:04.060
Yeah

02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:09.820
I just want to know like the people over there what their timeline is for the monetization because they haven't really revealed

02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:14.420
Mm-hmm what the cash shop is gonna feature. I mean, there's that little wrist

02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:17.140
doodad thing that you get

02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:19.140
That I imagine you buy separately

02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:23.260
But that's I really want to see because ingress their cash shop

02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:27.300
Which I think the game was out for nearly three years before they even put a monetization

02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:32.580
Well, they were a part of Google in the beginning. So Google was just you know, it was an experiment

02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:38.660
Yeah, but then after the separation when Google split into alphabet that Niantic is no longer a Google company

02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:41.060
They are now financed by Nintendo

02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:44.580
I think Google is also still a financier but Niantic had to come up with new ways to make money

02:34:44.580 --> 02:34:46.660
So gotcha enter cash shop

02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:53.020
Which has done very well and hell we paid what 45 bucks for super VIP tickets to this thing

02:34:53.020 --> 02:34:58.260
We're going to and in Tucson, but worth every penny. I don't want to hear it. Well, it comes with souvenirs and eat stuff

02:34:58.260 --> 02:35:01.380
That's right. You all spend money on dumb shit, too. So, you know what? I don't want to hear it

02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:05.220
Right, that's all. All right, awesome

02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:14.120
Okay, less awesome though is the news that a studio is closing and Sony did confirm this week that evolution studios

02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:18.460
was shut down and evolution studios latest game was drive club which

02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:22.660
You know not gonna lie drive club kind of had a rough, you know

02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:29.820
It was big expectations for it and then it came out late and then the online was kind of a fucking mess

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:31.820
Like there's no nice way to say it

02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:35.860
So unfortunately, I think because the game ended up being a comedy of errors

02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:41.320
Unfortunately, people are now out of a job because of it. I see you sighing over there Gabe

02:35:42.180 --> 02:35:44.180
Yeah

02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:46.540
Yeah

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:51.580
Yeah, I felt this same way about drive club although graphically speaking

02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:55.060
I thought I thought it was a beautiful game, but there was

02:35:55.740 --> 02:36:01.720
I fell in love, you know racing games are racing driving games are like my favorite of all time

02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:07.960
Like outrun on the Sega arcade was the game that wanted that got me to want to make games in the first place

02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:10.700
yeah, and

02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:13.660
But you know fell in love a Gran Turismo need for speed games

02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:19.900
but then I played Forza and then force a horizon and I never looked back and I when I play drive colors say it is

02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:25.620
trying too hard and that's not good because they have a so much potential but

02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:28.860
It's in four. It's really really unfortunate. So yeah, that's why I kind of

02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:32.780
Well some other stuff that

02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:38.420
Evolution had done they were also responsible for World Rally Championship on the PlayStation 2 is them

02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:42.020
But I think the game that you know, a lot of people were like, oh, yeah

02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:46.180
This was a great game was Motorstorm on PlayStation 3. That was that was a release

02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:49.940
That was a release team. I think with with the system system release. Yeah

02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:54.520
Yeah, it's a bummer. But unfortunately some of those things where you go

02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:57.340
Well, you know and it's it's so shocking like one

02:36:58.100 --> 02:36:59.260
I mean and again

02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:04.940
this doesn't happen in the movie industry one dud doesn't kill a studio in the movie industry or we would have never had Batman as

02:37:04.940 --> 02:37:06.940
Superman in the first place even though it's making buku bucks

02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:09.820
Yeah, but then though I hear it's a festering pilot crowd

02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:14.660
But that studio did also what the Jupiter ascending which didn't make any money back

02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:18.680
I wanted to see there was something else that they had done to that

02:37:19.420 --> 02:37:21.120
so

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:24.740
Everyone I know on Facebook that has seen Batman vs. Superman has said

02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:30.900
It's not great but it was entertaining

02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:34.180
Like it was fine

02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:37.460
Honestly, I want to see it well, I love Batman so I'll see anything about it

02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:41.540
I want to see it just for Wonder Woman to be honest. I want to see everyone

02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:47.380
Yeah, the critics are like it's the worst thing. It's like showgirls but superhero movies and most people are like no, it's

02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:53.660
Is going through a case of oh us to us to we'll have gritty characters everyone likes Batman

02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:55.660
We'll make all of our characters Batman

02:37:56.140 --> 02:38:01.860
Including like normal, you know, oh, I'm a hero and classic hero. No, I'm gonna be Batman. Mm-hmm

02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:06.420
Let's get to the mailbag

02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:12.700
What no, but every week you guys email us at participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read your emails

02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:20.340
You're live on air or we don't if you actually send any when you don't send an email. I'm giving you one last refresh

02:38:20.340 --> 02:38:25.740
It's because they're all busy at church or something. I am I see how it is. Y'all are just too busy gaming to send us an email

02:38:25.940 --> 02:38:31.580
It's fine last week. I said, oh, there's seven emails. There's too many to read and then over then

02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:37.300
It's $30 of marshmallow peeps and those Reese's peanut butter eggs insulin shock, they're all just

02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:40.700
Like they can't send emails

02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:47.860
You know what, you know, you know what where's my red velvet peeps, where are they I haven't I have yet to you know

02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:49.860
if a red velvet peep

02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:53.740
Had shown up in a store. I would've been like, yes, they have all the crazy flavors now like Oreos

02:38:53.900 --> 02:38:56.260
Yeah, you know what? I still want to find you a peep plushie

02:38:57.260 --> 02:39:00.900
I've seen them. I mean there were two of them at Hannah's house today

02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:05.580
There was an official peep store like two blocks from magfest. You better believe I went there

02:39:06.060 --> 02:39:10.140
Hi, there's a picture of me somewhere in front of the peeps car. So anyway

02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:11.380
All right

02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:16.980
Well, no emails but maybe next time participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to participate with our show

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:20.380
Well now we definitely have a reason to get angsty here on orange lounge radio. So

02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:24.120
Hold my earrings. Here comes the F use of the week

02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:29.260
I

02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:46.620
Really don't I guess I really don't have a major as you other than

02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:50.380
Holiday related for medical

02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:52.940
issues as

02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:59.260
People on my facebook have probably read by now, which I don't mean it to have a problem with people's religious preference

02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:01.260
I just don't get the grammar

02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:05.100
Don't get it. I hate misuse of any word and

02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:12.420
This use of tense and it's really getting on my nerves because I've started writing again you believe in the one true grammar God. I

02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:17.580
Believe I am a follower of sir Oxford of comma

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:19.580
Because

02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:22.260
It's the difference between

02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:28.340
The hookers JFK and Stalin and the hookers comma JFK comma and Stalin

02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:33.160
Instead of JFK and Stalin wearing pasties of my favorite is actually

02:40:34.060 --> 02:40:36.860
Let's eat grandma and let's see grandma

02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:40.900
And when you're talking about

02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:42.580
Your

02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:47.660
Pet you don't say you are pet you say your pet

02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:50.820
when you're saying and

02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:56.100
Rob I love you to death, but you do this and it gets on my nerves a lot

02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:59.380
When you use

02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:01.380
so and such and eyes

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:05.540
That's grammatically incorrect. The tea is hot. The tea is scalding

02:41:05.540 --> 02:41:09.380
I think he means like eyeballs it should be so and so and mine

02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:12.060
well

02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:17.260
You're not the only person I know that doesn't all those mistaken people and I don't give a fuck

02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:21.800
That was grammatically correct

02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:26.500
The most grammatically correct insult to the most smartest

02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:30.020
Smart asses

02:41:30.260 --> 02:41:35.680
Alan do you have better to be a smartest than a dumbass Alan you have any of use of the week that do not pick on me

02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:37.120
I

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:40.160
Not not anymore because of that last caveat. No

02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:44.640
I guess it's a little gross, but I'm getting like a blister on my foot

02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:48.480
And I'm like, why am I even getting this blister?

02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:52.200
And I just need to figure out what I need to do about it before it gets gross

02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:55.320
Self-diagnosed on WebMD. That's everybody else does

02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:58.080
It's cancer. No

02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:01.080
Yeah foot foot blisters gross you why?

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:03.080
Is it your shoes may be lying out?

02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:07.280
That's the thing. My shoes are fine. And it's in a weird really weird spot

02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:12.880
That's what I'm thinking

02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:19.840
All right, I broke his toe by the way speaking of medical conditions

02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:26.340
Sorry to hear that see you medical conditions a few of the week goes to my sunburn. I got a sunburn yesterday

02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:28.860
You're a real ed actual redneck. Yes

02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:31.140
Okay

02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:33.140
fuck that but

02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:39.540
Just also the fact that you know, I am usually like, you know, if it's if it's like, you know the summertime

02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:44.300
I think oh, I gotta put some walk off work outside today. It's fucking March. It is fucking March

02:42:45.300 --> 02:42:50.460
This is like the time. I got sunburned in Canada. It's fucking March and it's 80 degrees during the day

02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:55.620
Only in Northern California when it'll it'll hit like 99 or 100 degrees in April

02:42:55.660 --> 02:43:02.700
Like oh the summer's here early and I'm like, I'm scared because I'm thinking about July and August if it's 99 degrees in April

02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:04.860
I'm not about that 108 degree life

02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:10.380
No, but just at some point there's gonna be a wave and then everyone's gonna joke about it

02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:12.260
And I'm like and then like I don't want to die

02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:18.100
The air conditioner wasn't like working in my car yesterday and I was like son of a motherfucker. It was fine

02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:23.220
But I wanted to take everybody who was complaining about the rain and kick them in the nose

02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:27.220
Because it's not hard enough to maim them and you can fix a broken nose

02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:33.260
And tell them we have a drought and on top of that

02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:36.900
Important I

02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:43.820
Want to tell whoever created that law that says that when Folsom Dam it reaches higher than earth when Folsom Lake

02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:49.740
We just higher than 60% that they have to drain it. We're in a fucking drought. We need it. Okay

02:43:50.060 --> 02:43:53.140
No, obviously now I interrupted you I was gonna say we were just it

02:43:53.180 --> 02:44:00.280
Mathur Lake Park Rob and I earlier for angry stuff Lake was full beautiful green everywhere grass is growing. All the rain is great

02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:02.820
It's very pretty right now in California

02:44:03.620 --> 02:44:08.220
Do our guests have any F use they'd like to get out of their system game. What are the rules with the F use?

02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:10.220
Is it just anything at all?

02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:16.760
Okay, well keep it like nothing that you want we're already go back to your co-workers

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:22.540
Oh, yeah, we're already five minutes into this segment. So, you know, I'll be Jonas

02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:24.660
I know you don't understand what that rule means, but don't be Jonas

02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:29.060
I'll have I'll just say one wouldn't one quick thing then

02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:37.460
Drivers in the left lane going 55 miles an hour get out of there get the hell out of there. That's enough

02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:42.060
That is enough. And I said the price I joke with Brianna one day I said I said recently

02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:45.920
Being from New Jersey. I want to build a massive

02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:52.640
Racing rate racetrack and I want to place all the drivers all the bad drivers in Northern Southern, California

02:44:53.400 --> 02:45:00.800
versus New York, New Jersey and Connecticut drivers and just go to war in this big thing in the middle of Kansas and in the

02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:02.080
middle of nowhere and

02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:07.120
Yeah, because God helped me. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They don't know what the hell they're doing

02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:13.240
Okay, it cracks me and even work even better when it they're normally going slow because they're using their phone

02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:16.360
So once they put their phone down because someone blared the horn in them

02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:21.480
They have the nerve to give the finger to that person to blue that who blared the horn and they haul ass doing 90

02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:28.040
Crossing three lanes of traffic without signaling. So telling you I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do a twisted metal thing one day

02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:34.880
Bri any F use from you

02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:37.840
She's saying no you love everything

02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:40.720
No comment

02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:47.720
I'm learning to drive right now and I'm gonna get my license hopefully by the end of April and whenever I see someone do a

02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:51.520
Dickish thing like what you've described I'll turn to Robin be like I'm not getting my license now

02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.620
Because someone just cut across four lanes doing 90 without a blinker

02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:58.080
It's like you you deal with it

02:45:58.080 --> 02:45:58.880
I'm fine

02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:02.120
And I always have to tell Alan like do as I say not as I do

02:46:02.640 --> 02:46:07.960
When I'm teaching him how to drive like don't fucking do the things I do when driving because they're all illegal

02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:13.240
Alright, by the way, may I make an announcement now that we've gotten the frustrations out of the way? Absolutely not

02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:15.800
All right. Go ahead

02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:19.440
My

02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:23.760
Middle I would say of the three of us who my mother birthed from her loins

02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.760
My brother Philip the middle child has given finally taking me off the hook

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:38.440
By spawning a little version of him who looks like a very small potato person with a 55 year old man comb-over

02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:47.240
He looks like well Philip when Philip was a baby he also looked like a scrunchie potato with a bad comb-over

02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:52.520
Actually, he didn't have the bad comb-over. He had the the frizzy spike. Mm-hmm. So anyway, I

02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:59.200
I have a nephew now his name potato named potato slow Spuddy

02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:03.920
Actually, it's funny cuz I've been just trying to decide whether that's call him tater tot

02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:06.640
Because his last name is Tate

02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:10.200
or if I'm gonna call him Minnie Phil

02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:19.780
Minnie Phil, so I would like to say congratulations to my my brother Philip and congrats and his fiancee Ashley

02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:27.420
For bringing Jackson into the world spell J ax so in it's a very millennial name up

02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:32.460
What that's it's not a braid and jade and Kate and laden. So already they're

02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:41.220
Having names names after Mortal Kombat character. That's what I was thinking. He's gonna grow up get bionic arms and kick ass

02:47:41.980 --> 02:47:48.620
One can only hope but still he's a very very pretty little bundle of joy. He's adorable

02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:53.940
Hey, I swear he looks just like my brother did as a baby. I was nine when my brother was born

02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:59.740
No, I was a little younger than that. But anyway, and I remember him as a baby and this infant looks like my brother

02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:07.100
And also several of my female friends who have had children say it's very unfair that she had such a smooth delivery

02:48:08.020 --> 02:48:09.140
so

02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:11.820
Much love. I'm so happy that I have a

02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:15.860
Nephew and I don't have to produce children for my mother

02:48:15.860 --> 02:48:21.520
Well, congratulations to Jamie's relatives who I know don't listen to this show. This is why I'm saying it. All right

02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:24.940
Well, let's move on

02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:31.380
With just a couple more stories and then we're gonna open up the skype line. I want to borrow him gonna unleash the floodgates. I'm

02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:36.580
Borrow him and turn him into hash browns. No, I'm just gonna borrow him for a little bit go

02:48:36.580 --> 02:48:38.580
Oh, he threw up here. You can have him back

02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:40.860
Alright

02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:43.200
Let's get to those stories Alan

02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:47.260
Jackbox games has announced they are making

02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:54.700
Jackbox party pack 3 just a surprise to no one because the first two are bugging incredible and they're tons of fun

02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:57.500
And you don't even have to be drunk, which I'm sure it helps

02:48:57.780 --> 02:49:03.620
but they are amazing games and they've already said that a drawful 2 which I think was the sleeper hit or

02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:10.380
The most popular choice of the last party pack drawful 2 is coming out in spring of tooth of this year

02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:17.820
which would make me think it'd be out now or very very soon is not going to be a part of the party pack 3

02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:22.420
Because obviously they don't want you to buy a game twice. They're not sleazy like that

02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:24.940
so look for

02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:31.140
The jackbox party pack 3 as sometime during fall of this year

02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:38.380
Awesome tons of fun. Yay. I'm looking forward to it because you know Jackbox they make some good stuff

02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:39.980
Of course

02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:46.860
They're such jokers those guys and here's what their press release says while we toyed with other names for this collection of party games

02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:55.140
Koala saga happy birthday mom and Tokyo blood to name a few we decided the jackbox party pack 3 works best

02:49:56.540 --> 02:49:58.540
All right, they're silly

02:49:58.820 --> 02:50:03.780
Alright, well, let's do one more story here and it was funny because earlier in the show

02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:05.940
You guys were talking about the Capcom of the old days

02:50:05.940 --> 02:50:12.360
Well, isn't this interesting because Capcom is actually running a survey right now that asks. Would you like Megaman 11?

02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:15.700
No shit. Yes, of course

02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:17.460
but anyway

02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:21.260
This is after you know, the success of the Megaman legacy collection

02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:26.420
So Capcom is actually asking do you want to see a Megaman 11 the third set of questions asked?

02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:31.780
Would you like future collections of Megaman games and what games would you like to see such as the X series zero?

02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:38.100
Legends battle network ZX star for us. What do you want? By the way the surveys in Japanese? Sorry, you can't take it

02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:43.140
So they're gonna come I can take it for us. Yes. So Akuma you need to represent all of us. They're

02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:49.220
Making sure you take the survey. Enjoy. I would like to see Megaman 11. Why not?

02:50:49.980 --> 02:50:52.260
Even for nothing else. I just want another soundtrack

02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:55.740
Honestly, I could give or take the game. I just want another soundtrack

02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:59.460
I'm just getting tired of them asking do you you know do you know should we make a mega?

02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:04.060
Make the effing game. It's like Legends 3 you fucking fuck

02:51:05.860 --> 02:51:07.860
That too that too

02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:12.180
Alright, hey skype lines open one eight seven seven game

02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:18.300
Oh LR or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word if you want to call in and talk to us or maybe have

02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:23.100
A question for our guests that we have here in studio tonight. You can give us a call and we will

02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:28.220
Take them. So guess what the skype line already lighting up. So let's get to it

02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:31.260
Hello you are on orange lounge radio, who's this

02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:35.140
Hey, buddy, how's it going Zaku? What's up?

02:51:36.700 --> 02:51:43.300
Not much. I mean it's been a while like, you know, but well weeks months that last

02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:47.900
Called in but everything's good. Everything's things solid

02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:52.180
just try, you know paxies is coming up and

02:51:53.060 --> 02:52:00.020
You know, even though you know trying to find rooming was in a it wasn't turned out as I expected

02:52:00.020 --> 02:52:02.020
I did plan for the worse

02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:05.580
Although it's a costly and you know costly endeavor that I will have to take

02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:08.420
Nevertheless, I'm not gonna miss the packs for

02:52:08.940 --> 02:52:13.820
You know for the world. Well, that sounds like that may end up being my dragon con. I don't know yet

02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:15.980
I have to chat with some people see what's gonna happen. But

02:52:16.660 --> 02:52:20.380
Yeah, I I get it. So so paxies we looking forward to it paxies

02:52:21.300 --> 02:52:24.760
Hopefully some you know a little bit more swag or you know

02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:31.860
Well from the show from the showroom the show floor, but aside from that, you know better at better like after parties

02:52:32.700 --> 02:52:36.140
Although I probably missed the boat on like, you know, some of the you know

02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:42.740
Some good ones that you know, probably are already sold out and or like booked up for free reg

02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:48.180
Free shit is always a great perk to any convention. I'm sure

02:52:48.180 --> 02:52:55.580
But I guess I guess more importantly like for some reason I've been on a buying spree for well

02:52:55.580 --> 02:53:00.400
I guess in the past year for peripherals like obviously the headsets I got in a

02:53:00.940 --> 02:53:06.560
taxi last year and then you know a couple of years back the joystick both the

02:53:07.340 --> 02:53:10.660
Solid stick that I have if you could yeah, you probably see it right now

02:53:12.180 --> 02:53:17.940
So, yeah, whatever is there but yeah as you can see I'm still into flight simming but

02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:20.500
besides the point

02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:22.540
Yeah, I

02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:26.340
Guess I'm looking forward to like, you know, what you know

02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:34.180
How this whole like VR thing's gonna play out because I do you do you think there's gonna be more VR to try like at

02:53:34.180 --> 02:53:37.100
This show on the show floor than we've probably ever seen before

02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:41.460
I mean I seem to remember it packs that like oculus would usually have a booth of there to be something to experience

02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:47.100
But now with like so many people getting into VR and does Sony do packs that are sometimes they do sometimes they don't are

02:53:47.100 --> 02:53:50.940
They gonna be there. Yeah, I don't know but I mean it's a hit or miss

02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:55.460
I know Microsoft's there with without a shadow of a doubt. Well, maybe they'll show HoloLens or something

02:53:55.460 --> 02:54:01.380
It's you know, although I know HoloLens is probably still early on but it'd be interesting to see especially with the PlayStation VR

02:54:01.380 --> 02:54:05.140
around the corner if PlayStation is gonna make a push with the

02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:09.780
VR and Bobby Blackwell in our chat over at live dot vog network comm reminding us

02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:12.320
Oh, yeah, Sony has done packs prime in the past. No

02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:14.980
Yeah, I know they but it's kind of hit and miss like they don't do it every year

02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:17.740
It's like it seems like if they have something to promote they do it

02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:24.540
Oh like as of recent like these past few paxis, you know, a lot of the major players have you know, a lot of the major

02:54:25.340 --> 02:54:31.860
Developed, you know publishers have been pulling out, you know, obviously there's been in for me in the past where you know

02:54:31.860 --> 02:54:35.380
the likes of like Ubisoft and or to well and

02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:41.380
In the case of Sony. Yes, they pulled out and I believe Nintendo did it one year

02:54:41.380 --> 02:54:45.740
I know I know squint, you know Square Enix is obviously a you know, it's a shoe in but

02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:52.140
It's been kind of varying like I remember five years ago when I first went. Yes. It was it was huge

02:54:52.140 --> 02:54:59.040
Not well, it was it would be like what I would imagine e3 being but that's just my that's just my wishful thinking

02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:04.980
But now it's like geared towards like I don't know board, you know, like actual tabletop

02:55:05.260 --> 02:55:09.460
It's kind of like a you know, because of the atmosphere around there

02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:14.300
You know half the shows like tabletop the other half is just obviously video gaming

02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:21.340
So it's it's having that, you know, it's trying to find that equilibrium that pleases every you know, every gamer

02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:24.580
Yeah, and that's pretty much where it boils down to

02:55:25.260 --> 02:55:30.220
Well, if nothing else Zaku, even if the convention hall doesn't end up having everything you're looking for

02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:33.460
You can always sit in the hall with your 3ds and endlessly street

02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:36.240
I don't have a 3ds. I have a tablet the 3ds

02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:40.360
Do you know by the way tangent time the 3ds turned five years old today?

02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:45.920
Can you believe that like what we were just talking about earlier in the show the Spice Girls are 20 BAM

02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:52.040
You're old. The 3ds is now five years old BAM. You're still old. Yeah. Oh my god, but you know

02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:54.040
I didn't catch on to the whole

02:55:54.240 --> 02:56:00.900
DS 3ds thing and I guess that's probably because I was always a PSP guy even though mine is still collecting dust up there in

02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:04.200
The bin well, yes, and they actually released a new system called the Vita

02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:06.380
I don't know if you've heard of it it kind of good. Yes

02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:16.920
Well, yeah, I get your point, all right, but yeah, but being even then the beat is just like

02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:21.080
People have forgotten about it. Well Zaku Zaku

02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:23.180
I expect a full wrap-up when you get back from

02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:26.540
Paxis because I want to hear about the show since I'm not really gonna be able to go this year

02:56:26.540 --> 02:56:28.540
So I want to hear about it when you get back

02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:32.360
Also, I went to round one in Chicago earlier this month

02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:38.840
This is the arcade that has a bunch of like Japanese import games and stuff they have one in San Jose

02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:40.840
I have yet to go because

02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:47.280
I'm lazy. I don't know actually though with Dark Sakura's birthday soiree in the Bay Area coming up

02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:52.980
Mm-hmm. I may have to start going around one in San Jose. Oh, yeah, I just move the party there. I

02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:56.080
Mean, I look into it like it's not

02:56:56.660 --> 02:57:00.640
There will be a small person there. Yeah, and we need alcohol to be present

02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:06.600
You know look into that anyway, sorry Zaku go ahead. Yeah, I mean it's not in Chicago proper per se

02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:13.000
It's like 45 minutes out of like the inner loop, which is the big, you know, the Manhattan over there and you know

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.940
Thank God for lyft and the ability to expense these things in my expense report

02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:25.460
Which you know, obviously I was able to expense, you know, the you know, the actual game card and every must be nice

02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:31.180
Yeah, I mean when you work for a company that has a Chicago office and most of the Android developers

02:57:31.180 --> 02:57:36.180
I work with are all out there. So I get to expense this fucking show. How do I how do I get new microphones?

02:57:36.180 --> 02:57:42.100
Can I can I bill it to sack IGDA is there a budget over? No, no breeze give he's giving me the frown

02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:42.860
All right

02:57:42.860 --> 02:57:46.500
It's kind of like the I mean, it's kind of like the the Japanese one

02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:48.860
Like I remember when I went to Japan almost two years ago

02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:54.220
I remember round ones just being like huge in terms of like the other arcades

02:57:54.260 --> 02:58:00.860
I went around, you know went to in Tokyo and this one was kind of like that, but it also had a mix of the American

02:58:01.620 --> 02:58:06.980
Redemption games and whatnot. So you still have to have the gambling for children or it's just not an arcade

02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:11.340
Yeah, plus the pool, you know, plus the pool tables pink ponte. Do they have to go?

02:58:11.860 --> 02:58:13.860
Do they have a Chinko?

02:58:14.140 --> 02:58:18.700
No, they do not that's separate. That's usually a dedicated

02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:21.420
Chinko is kind of like a dedicated thing

02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:27.660
You have to go to a dedicated place in in Japan or unless it's like in a certain floor of a Japanese

02:58:27.860 --> 02:58:32.540
Arcade which is an average of like a few stories, but long story short. Yes

02:58:32.540 --> 02:58:36.860
It's they had a lot of the bimani games that you know, I've been craving for a while

02:58:36.860 --> 02:58:42.540
But you know, it's kind of like a marriage like there the American round ones are almost like a marriage between

02:58:43.140 --> 02:58:49.380
The Japanese one and a Dave and Buster's with a little bit less of Dave and Buster's a little bit more of the round one

02:58:49.900 --> 02:58:54.660
All right. Well Zaku, I gotta let you go so we get some more calls, but thank you for the phone call

02:58:54.660 --> 02:58:58.340
I appreciate it and have a good night. Yep. Have a good night. I will talk to you soon. Bye

02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:04.060
Alright one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call

02:59:04.180 --> 02:59:09.760
I did want to point out because I've been informed that some of my pals that I play ingress with are actually listening right now

02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:14.080
So I figured they could actually appreciate this joke that I'm about to say

02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:20.080
which is that the reason why I would be in favor of you moving your birthday party is because I've already capped the portals at

02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:22.060
The mall where your birthday party is originally scheduled

02:59:22.060 --> 02:59:27.160
I have not kept the portals at round one and I fucking you need uniques then let's do this

02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:31.560
I'm done. Don't move your birthday party because of my stupid ass

02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:37.960
Don't get around one, but I told Becky that it would be okay for Julian there before they start kicking kids out. Mm-hmm

02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:41.240
And Becky is my bestie. That's very sir

02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:44.640
Really quickly since along those same lines. I'm Alan

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:48.120
Did you want to describe for our listeners without giving any of the James Bond secrets away?

02:59:48.120 --> 02:59:54.440
I actually took you out on a late-night adventure last night our first big like ingress like op we did together

02:59:54.440 --> 02:59:59.160
Did you did you want to share with the listeners what that was like like what what we did on Friday night?

02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:03.640
What's all involved in it? Yes without giving any of the secrets away if you know what I mean, okay

03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:07.120
Well

03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:11.560
The the to get your team points and ingress you have to cover

03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:15.680
Geography like you take three points and you make a triangle

03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:22.160
Which you think all right you walk down to the supermarket the bank or wherever and you make a triangle there

03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:24.960
But people will do a big-ass field that will cover

03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:27.400
several states

03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:29.880
like huge undertakings and

03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:37.040
You when you link when you make the triangle you can't cross the lines with anything existing

03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:40.600
So what we did for a field like that

03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:43.360
It's my mic on. Yeah

03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:45.560
for basically we were

03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:47.040
I

03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:49.560
Trying to decide what is too much or too little to say

03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:56.200
we weren't throwing the field, but we were responsible for making sure the lane was cleared so that the

03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:00.120
The connect the dots that they were trying to do wasn't blocked

03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:05.600
Because even if it's a line from your team from your faction, you can't intersect a line, right?

03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:09.760
So yeah, we went out drove out to the middle of nowhere and I'm on t-mobile

03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:16.560
So I'm like we're gonna go out to the boonies to take down this, you know innocent link that you know

03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:19.560
It's just in the way. It's just inconvenient. I may have no data

03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:24.960
So luckily when we got there you you had data on your t-mobile connection and mine was the one that was yeah

03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:28.840
You were on like one or two. We were like on one or two bars and I had five bars. It's really awful

03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:32.040
I was just expecting does that you actually went way more into I was just expecting you to say yeah

03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:34.680
It was really fun to sit in the dark for 45 minutes Rob. That was a lot of fun

03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:35.240
Yeah, no

03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:41.520
So you don't want the other team to know that something really major like that is going on because they'll throw links and block the

03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:46.280
Path so yeah, we had to sit in a car in the dark, which is not creepy at all for like

03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:51.140
45 minutes until the person that was running the operation

03:01:51.140 --> 03:01:57.280
They're like there's like 15 to 20 people involved out there on their cell phones in their cars involved in operations like this

03:01:57.280 --> 03:01:59.280
So yeah, we had to weigh. Okay

03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:04.360
1040 it's gonna go up at 11 do it now like and we had to okay destroy it destroy it clear

03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:07.520
Yay, and then have to see if they wanted you to drive anywhere else

03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:10.280
Yeah

03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:13.720
All right, but you had fun right? Yeah

03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:22.440
All right, we're gonna take more calls one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word

03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:28.280
I think we've got another call coming in. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi. This is raging leader

03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:33.560
Hi rage nader who apparently is using that avatar software to actually call in as a cat tonight

03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:41.160
I've seen Tiger Claw use this before but I guess rage nader now expressing your a kitty cat side here on the video stream that

03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:44.000
Our radio listeners can't see but that's okay. What's on your mind, buddy?

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.120
not whole

03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:52.560
Well, you know if I remember right you kind of sort of touched on something early in the show

03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:57.760
Yeah, recently I bought a carry vault no real steam

03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:00.280
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:07.720
Know the one thing I don't remember you mentioning is what your thoughts are on that bundle

03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:11.360
On which bundle I'm sorry

03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:14.360
Vault

03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:16.360
bundle Oh Atari vault, um

03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:20.020
If you like classic games enough then yeah

03:03:20.020 --> 03:03:25.400
I think it's worth the money especially because they put in the multiplayer where you can you know chat over the or I'm sorry

03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:27.920
Actually play the games over the internet and all that stuff

03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:33.040
But I they release something very similar to it already on iPad and iPhone

03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:36.200
So I think if you already own that it may not be worth the money

03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:39.680
But if you have an appreciation for old games, I think it is worth the money

03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:46.800
Just remember a lot of the old games were kind of one-trick ponies, you know, but that's also what made them great

03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:51.120
I think a game like kaboom is to which I don't think is in the pack because that was Activision

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:55.480
But a game like kaboom is kaboom is still fun to play today in my opinion

03:03:56.040 --> 03:04:01.080
That's you know, and it's it's disgustingly simple. It's just collect the ball at the bombs and the little little pots of water

03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:04.660
There's not a lot else to it. So, you know, it depends on

03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:10.640
How much you can appreciate those old games, but if you're the type that only spends five seconds

03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:14.240
On an old game, they're like, yeah, whatever done over it

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:18.320
Then I don't think there's gonna be enough value here for you or if you already have these Atari games some other way

03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:20.800
Yeah, oh I kind of

03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:29.100
Well, I just got the entire develop dollar day myself. Thanks to fifth ring. But uh, yeah

03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:34.180
You know, it is a nice package, you know, they're falling because no

03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:41.900
No, well two things. No, the target 2600 was my first system way back in day B

03:04:42.420 --> 03:04:45.820
Now great. I did have some of these games via

03:04:46.740 --> 03:04:51.480
Game room, but unfortunately, I can't read down the game room

03:04:53.660 --> 03:05:00.220
Yeah, that's that I know I had a good guy Microsoft moment earlier, but that's a bad guy Microsoft moment to be honest

03:05:00.220 --> 03:05:04.060
Yeah, but uh, no, it's a follow-up question

03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:09.460
You know now that Atari well is out on Steam, you know, well, I were

03:05:09.980 --> 03:05:12.820
Presumed is probably out for consoles as well. But

03:05:13.380 --> 03:05:15.380
No

03:05:16.180 --> 03:05:19.540
Is there any other anthologies that you would like to

03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:23.180
See come out. No, like maybe a

03:05:24.060 --> 03:05:26.560
version of the Capcom classics collections

03:05:27.180 --> 03:05:33.660
Or something like that. I'm such a retro whore. I I'm I'll be happy. I'll be thrilled if they put anything out

03:05:33.660 --> 03:05:39.340
I'm always adamant for my guardian legend release on PC, but you know

03:05:40.340 --> 03:05:42.340
Someone never fucking get it

03:05:42.780 --> 03:05:44.500
Do an update?

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:46.900
Like a really good one that won't get shut down

03:05:46.900 --> 03:05:52.580
I would appreciate a like Commodore collection of like old Commodore 64 classics

03:05:52.580 --> 03:05:54.760
I would like to see that on Steam some games like, you know

03:05:54.800 --> 03:05:57.100
Good old jump man and jump man jr

03:05:57.100 --> 03:06:02.380
And just this shit that we the temple as phi and and all these things that we used to play on

03:06:03.020 --> 03:06:05.340
On the Commodore 64 would I would love that?

03:06:06.100 --> 03:06:06.940
Ah

03:06:06.940 --> 03:06:08.780
Cool. All right. Yeah

03:06:08.780 --> 03:06:14.560
Yeah, I probably go with the konami collection now that they're ever actually do it

03:06:15.300 --> 03:06:17.300
Cuz they're all there

03:06:17.540 --> 03:06:24.220
Okay, they used to have a game tap one that was Contra and I want to say Castlevania was in it

03:06:24.220 --> 03:06:28.420
So they did do so. No, what's the theme night? It was at the old 8-bit Castlevania's

03:06:28.420 --> 03:06:31.340
I think we're on PC because you used to be able to play him through game tap

03:06:32.340 --> 03:06:35.300
So it was sort of out there it was sort of out there

03:06:35.300 --> 03:06:41.220
But yeah, I don't know you could do the whole thing where if you have an Xbox one you can play the game

03:06:41.220 --> 03:06:45.500
But that's kind of cheating. That's not really playing the games on your PC. But anyway, all right. We're aging

03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:48.620
I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call. I appreciate it. Sure

03:06:49.540 --> 03:06:55.340
You two pets for the kitty. All right, I guess that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight

03:06:55.580 --> 03:06:58.660
If you didn't get through but you yeah, I still have something to say

03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:04.460
Participate at orange launch radio.com is a great place to do it. I know we're running a little long tonight

03:07:04.460 --> 03:07:08.460
It's about time to wrap things up and thank you for putting up with the audio things this week

03:07:08.460 --> 03:07:11.460
I will look into that over the next week and try to figure that out

03:07:11.580 --> 03:07:16.180
Looks like I'm going on a shopping spree fix that. I want to get that fixed before the

03:07:17.540 --> 03:07:20.620
Indie arcade event that's for sure. I don't want that on the stream

03:07:20.740 --> 03:07:25.860
But anyhow Alan say this podcast is single-handedly keeping the Guitar Center in

03:07:26.540 --> 03:07:30.860
Sacramento probably business because whenever you need studio mics

03:07:31.980 --> 03:07:34.560
Now now that Radio Shack is gone

03:07:35.300 --> 03:07:40.680
That's really the only reason to go to Guitar Center true. Well, I Gabe Brianna

03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:43.980
I really want to thank you guys for being here tonight taking the time out to be on our show

03:07:44.220 --> 03:07:47.920
Best of luck with the rest of the planning for Sacramento indie arcade

03:07:48.060 --> 03:07:53.140
I am very thrilled and excited to be a part of it with my co-hosts and yeah

03:07:53.220 --> 03:07:58.740
Looking forward to it in a couple weeks same here same here. Thank you so much. I want to play some games. Can't wait

03:07:59.260 --> 03:08:01.860
Brianna I still look forward to the convention and thank you for being here

03:08:03.540 --> 03:08:05.220
You're welcome you guys are welcome back anytime

03:08:05.220 --> 03:08:09.380
You don't have to wait till next year if you have something update us on in a few months. Let us know. All right

03:08:09.940 --> 03:08:11.820
Especially if you have any other big IGDA events

03:08:11.820 --> 03:08:15.780
I would love to get to some more bring some of your dev friends in here and let's get them on the air

03:08:15.940 --> 03:08:17.940
It'll be fun fun. All right

03:08:18.500 --> 03:08:22.320
We always at the end of the show like to go around and get everybody's final thought

03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:25.800
Do you guys have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight Gabe?

03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:29.000
This is also a good chance to plug your personal Twitter's and stuff if you want

03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:34.100
To keep up to date on what we're on what I've got going on with my team

03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:49.840

03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:55.440
Impeccable and and and so just so necessary for what we're trying to do

03:08:55.440 --> 03:08:59.780
We need to know how we're doing. Otherwise, we think we're doing fine, and we know that's not the case

03:08:59.780 --> 03:09:03.180
So be sure but meanwhile follow us on us and games on Twitter

That's always that reality setting in that. Oh my gosh, it's here Rianna any final thoughts tonight

We do have an extra life team sack indie arcade

03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:28.840
extra life is like the charity portion video game portion of the Children's Miracle Network and

03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:33.960
The Sacramento indie arcade started a team to help benefit our local Children's Hospital here

03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:39.500
I love it the UC Davis Children's Hospital that serves 33 counties throughout Northern, California

03:09:39.540 --> 03:09:43.560
So if you're already playing games and you want to accept donations

03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:49.880
Everything's done online you can play from anywhere in the world and you can just select the UC Davis Children's Hospital

03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:52.480
We've partnered with them to show

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:59.580
Others who aren't really big in the game scene that games are more than just Call of Duty and whatnot, you know, so

03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:03.760

Trader Joe's plantain chips are disappointing and I'll be writing my congressman. All right, that's a very worthy cause I was very disappointed in them

03:11:47.420 --> 03:11:54.100
I'm gonna go and eat ice cream. You can do that because you're a fucking grown-ass woman. I could sleep in and not go
