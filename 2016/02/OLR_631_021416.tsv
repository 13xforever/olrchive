7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week Amazon announced a new video game engine named Lumberyard and it's available now completely free!
19000	22000	It's currently PC and console only but will soon find its way to mobiles as well.
22000	28000	This is just one of many monetary stories and we'll tell you about all these and more starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on February the 14th of 2016, episode number 631 of our show.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you from Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.
50000	52000	But you might know me on Twitter at Skie.
52000	58000	And joining me at my side as always, my trusty co-hosts over the past I've lost count number of years.
58000	61000	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
61000	62000	Rawr.
62000	64000	Rawr. 13 and a half by the way.
64000	65000	Rawr.
65000	66000	Rawr. How are you doing?
66000	69000	Um, I'm okay. I bit my tongue so hard it bled.
69000	70000	That's not good.
70000	73000	And now I have a hole in the side of my tongue and it feels weird.
73000	74000	Do you need a tissue?
75000	85000	And I love my friends, but I'm a little peeved when I get woke up from a deep, deep sleep at one in the afternoon.
85000	88000	Yeah, I was gonna say to be fair, wasn't it like one in the afternoon?
88000	91000	Lazy, lazy Valentine's Day for DarkSakura.
91000	95000	Texting me about troubleshooting their computer.
95000	98000	I'm like, I'm not at work, dude.
98000	102000	But I was impressed with myself that I could do half a sleep via text message.
102000	103000	Awesome.
103000	105000	Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.
105000	107000	There's lots of hearts here on Valentine's Day.
107000	112000	Even the blackest heart here on the show. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
112000	113000	Hello.
113000	114000	How are you doing?
114000	115000	Doing fine.
115000	116000	Yeah?
116000	122000	We just had a big live announcement here at the Voice of Geeks Network that we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.
122000	126000	Usually we're on at 6, but we're on at 6.30 tonight and I'll do my little spiel here.
126000	129000	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
129000	134000	vaughnetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
134000	137000	So we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight, but not too terribly late.
137000	139000	We'll still have a great show tonight.
139000	145000	But Loki, I don't know what you've been working on over there while we were doing that announcement stuff.
145000	147000	You still working on Time to Car?
147000	150000	I don't know.
150000	152000	You don't know?
153000	159000	Well, the thing is, see, I was trying to get something done just to release it and I don't even like the way it is right now.
159000	165000	I don't like the state that it's in and I don't really want to complete it in the state that it is right now.
165000	166000	I just want to work on something else.
166000	167000	Interesting.
167000	174000	Now, I still may finish it and I have a better idea of what I want to do with it, but it's too out there right now.
174000	181000	It's so far away from its initial idea that I don't know what the hell to make of it.
181000	185000	So I'm going to put it on the fence or back burner for now.
185000	188000	I've got several projects on the back burner right now.
188000	193000	So we'll put another one on the back burner after I start another one, of course.
193000	198000	So, of course, we do have our live chat room and you can visit our chat live.vognetwork.com.
198000	202000	And AkumaJP is starting us off tonight saying, yay, half Loki 3.
203000	207000	No, I've got like I've got like I want to come up with ideas.
207000	213000	I basically create a text file for them on my on my computer and I just start kind of jotting ideas down with it.
213000	215000	I've got so many of them. It's ridiculous.
215000	222000	And I'm just looking now that I've got Unity 5 and that's another reason why I kind of want to put the one I was working on hiatus right now,
222000	228000	because it was being developed in Unity 4 and I was really limited on what I could do with it.
228000	233000	That's why I didn't look that great, because I was stuck with using all the Unity basic stuff.
233000	238000	Whereas now Unity 5, you have all those pro features that were originally locked away from you.
238000	245000	Instead of worrying about porting it over and everything, I'm just going to probably start something different for right now.
245000	248000	And then just because I just want to work on something different.
248000	254000	I've mentally been drained. I was like trying to work on this like high score table for the longest time.
254000	259000	I'm like, for what? For this demo? It just didn't make any sense for me to do that.
259000	262000	And I even went back and played the demo, what I had done.
262000	266000	I'm like, you know, it's not as fun as I thought it was originally.
266000	270000	For what it's worth, I totally get it.
270000	274000	I've had those situations where it's like, I need to put this on the back burner. I understand.
274000	279000	But a lot of people did tell you that for your first big game you were being very ambitious.
279000	281000	Would you change anything in retrospect?
281000	285000	No, I wouldn't actually. It's just, you know, I don't know.
285000	292000	The idea was like, I had an idea and I could have, you know, done it that way.
292000	296000	But I wanted to do something different with it later on.
296000	301000	Because I decided, you know, okay, I don't know. I had some more ideas to go along with it.
301000	303000	I just, I want to implement that instead.
303000	307000	But in order to do that, it's just completely redoing the whole thing anyways.
307000	310000	And I just don't want to do that. I don't want to waste any more time on this.
310000	316000	I'd rather do something that I think would be more interesting gameplay-wise. Let's put it that way.
316000	320000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the last 10% takes 90% of the time.
320000	322000	Of course, yes. No, I understand that.
322000	326000	And that's the thing. It's like, but you got to, the problem was I kind of took it the wrong way.
326000	331000	You got to develop, you know, the core gameplay first and then work on the rest of it.
331000	335000	And the problem is the gameplay on it wasn't quite there. It just wasn't fun.
335000	339000	And I don't want to release something like that, even if it's unfinished.
339000	343000	Because then that looks even worse. I'd rather just come up with something I think is interesting.
343000	347000	I play it and it's fun. Then go from there.
347000	349000	And I have a few ideas of things I want to do.
349000	352000	And some even way more ambitious than what I started.
352000	356000	So, I still want to do those two, but we'll get around it.
356000	359000	Alright, fair enough. Well, best of luck to you in whatever it is you choose to do.
359000	362000	You know, SG100Matt in chat saying if we've learned anything about Loki over the years,
362000	366000	Loki is always go big or go home. Loki doesn't half-ass things.
366000	369000	And I go home a lot. So, it's fine.
369000	372000	Alright, we're going to get right into the show tonight.
372000	374000	Usually we would do a kick-off topic to start things off,
374000	378000	but since we did have our live announcement tonight, we're going to go right into How Was Your Gaming Week?
378000	382000	But I do just want to give a quick shout-out to the three new shows joining The Voice of Geeks Network.
382000	387000	If you like video games, you absolutely need to be subscribed to GameBui.org,
387000	389000	which is joining The Voice of Geeks Network.
389000	396000	They've got well over 100 episodes of really deep informational gaming content and discussions.
396000	399000	And Captain Spike and Slidekick are very talented.
399000	403000	I've been honored to be on that show way in the past. I was on episode 37 or something.
403000	405000	In a row?
405000	407000	Haha. But they are now a part of the network.
407000	410000	Look up whichever one was about music games. That was the one I was on.
410000	412000	And we're very excited to have them here.
412000	415000	Also joining us, probably not a huge surprise.
415000	418000	Shane's been here the past few weeks, and it was really only a matter of time
418000	420000	before Ranger Pride also came onto the network.
420000	423000	So if you like Power Rangers, you need to be checking that out.
423000	428000	And then I announced that Extfer and I brought back from a very long 10-year hiatus,
428000	432000	a show we used to do on Orange Onch Radio, the network, called Guys on a Show,
432000	437000	which is going to be about all things pop and geek culture and passion.
437000	441000	But obviously, you can expect when Extfer's involved, with tongue planted firmly in cheek.
441000	444000	And the first three episodes of Guys on a Show available right now.
444000	447000	We surprised everybody. It's out on iTunes right now.
447000	449000	We dropped the album on iTunes right now.
449000	453000	So you can check that out by just searching for Guys on a Show
453000	455000	or head on over to guysontashow.com.
455000	457000	And also Twitter, Guys on a Show.
457000	460000	And while you're on Twitter, you should also follow GameBooey.org
460000	463000	and RangerPrideCast on Twitter.
463000	467000	All right, so since that pretty much took over our kickoff slot tonight,
467000	469000	let's get into how was your gaming week
469000	472000	and the types of video games you've been playing this week. DarkSakura?
472000	475000	I really haven't played very much because I've had a lot of stuff going on.
475000	477000	It's a side project I'm working on.
477000	484000	But I played a little bit of Hot to Full Boyfriend last night
484000	489000	by hooking up because it's now on the OS X App Store.
489000	494000	And so I played it. I had my Mac already hooked up to the Sony TV
494000	497000	so that they could watch the new Yamato series.
497000	500000	The Space Battleship Yamato.
501000	505000	And so I decided just to test out games on it.
505000	509000	So I turned on Hot to Full Boyfriend and started dating some pigeons.
509000	511000	It was great.
511000	513000	I'm going to have to play through that all the way again.
513000	517000	I love that you had this gigantic TV and the great resolution
517000	521000	where people would try to play things like, I don't know, Destiny.
521000	523000	You know, things that really push the graphical envelopes.
523000	524000	And here you are playing...
524000	525000	Destiny? Come on.
525000	527000	I don't know. It was the first game that came to mind.
527000	530000	And you're playing Hot to Full Boyfriend.
530000	533000	Because... And it was really pretty.
533000	535000	I put a picture up on my Facebook.
535000	536000	Nah, I saw that. It was very pretty.
536000	538000	It's on my Tumblr too. I put a picture on my Tumblr.
538000	540000	Fine. How about like Mario Kart 8?
540000	544000	Even as cartoony as that is, I bet that would be badass on a big screen TV like that.
544000	546000	We'll do that anyway.
546000	552000	The whole point was for me to test the HDMI out on my Mac.
552000	553000	I understand.
553000	554000	And it was pretty nice.
554000	558000	It made me realize now that the wallpaper I have is super low res in comparison.
558000	561000	It looks fine on the Mac, but not on the big TV.
561000	566000	I've also been playing some Animal Crossing.
566000	567000	Some Happy Home Designer.
567000	570000	Because I got some new Amiibo cards.
572000	575000	Really? Yeah, not a whole bunch else.
575000	580000	And I've decided that I really don't like Super Hexagon because it makes me mad.
580000	582000	Really mad.
582000	587000	And so I've gone back to my stress relief game of...
587000	590000	Crap, what's it called?
590000	592000	I used...
592000	593000	Mass Effect?
593000	594000	No, not Mass Effect.
594000	595000	Dragon Age?
595000	596000	Not Dragon Age.
596000	599000	Can I say quickly while you're thinking about Super Hexagon?
599000	602000	That's kind of the point, I think, is to anger you a little bit.
602000	605000	It's so fun in the short little bursts.
605000	607000	I'm glad you think it is.
607000	609000	I know. It can get very frustrating.
609000	610000	Just like...
610000	611000	Fractal.
611000	612000	Fractal.
612000	614000	Fractal is my stress relief game.
614000	615000	And Moonlight Mahjong.
615000	617000	You know that's funny.
617000	619000	MXC actually called it in our chat room.
619000	620000	Fractal.
620000	621000	Props to you, MXC.
621000	623000	But I was going to say about Super Hexagon.
623000	626000	Try something different than what you're doing now.
626000	632000	Because for me, to beat the first level, all I had to do was stop playing full screen and go to windowed.
632000	633000	Obviously, you're not going to be able to do that on the phone.
633000	634000	Well, I never play windowed.
634000	636000	But you can...
636000	637000	I mean, not windowed.
637000	638000	I never play full screen.
638000	642000	Because I get motion sick on full screen games.
642000	644000	Oh, I know what else.
644000	646000	I played a little bit more Dragon's Dogma.
646000	647000	Oh yeah?
647000	648000	It's alright.
648000	653000	I'm not completely in love with it yet, but I like it decently.
653000	654000	Decently.
654000	655000	And that's it.
655000	656000	Alright.
656000	657000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
657000	658000	Oh, wait, wait.
658000	659000	Ingress.
659000	661000	I hit level 5.
661000	662000	That's always a given.
662000	664000	I think all three of us are addicted to that game.
664000	666000	And also Heroes of Dragon Age.
666000	667000	Excellent.
667000	669000	Loki, how about you?
669000	671000	I just basically played three games this week.
671000	676000	So I played more of Lego Avengers just to unlock more characters for my son.
676000	678000	So I did that.
678000	680000	I've got like...
680000	683000	I think I'm like 50% done with all the unlockables in the game.
683000	686000	And we're 25 hours into it already.
686000	688000	So that's a lot.
688000	690000	And then I played more Fallout 4.
690000	693000	I'm just going through the...
694000	696000	Was it a companion quest for MacCready?
696000	699000	So I'm pretty much done there.
699000	702000	I mean, I did all of his, but I still haven't gotten his perk yet.
702000	704000	Which is really the only reason why I have him with me anyways.
704000	706000	Because he's annoying.
706000	708000	I mean, he's not as annoying as some of the other characters.
708000	710000	But I just want his headshot perk that's all fucked up right now.
710000	713000	Because I've disconnected my Playstation 4 from the internet.
713000	717000	So I can keep my really buggy, glitchy version of Fallout 4.
717000	722000	I mean, you know, the more buggy, glitchy version of Fallout 4 right now.
722000	724000	And then I played...
724000	726000	What was the other game I played?
726000	728000	I played also...
728000	732000	We actually played a little bit more of the League of Marvel Super Heroes.
732000	734000	Because my son-in-law played the older game.
734000	737000	And then I also played Ingress a little bit.
737000	740000	Mainly just on the way to and from work.
740000	742000	Just driving.
742000	744000	I know that's dangerous, but I don't care.
744000	746000	We're in traffic. We're moving like 50 miles an hour. It doesn't matter.
746000	748000	Alright.
748000	750000	Well that's it for your gaming week.
750000	753000	Still been playing a lot of Diablo 3.
753000	755000	Working on my Witch Doctor in Seasons.
755000	757000	I'm past Paragon level 500 now.
757000	763000	And that also means that I am past the point where my non-seasonal characters are at.
763000	765000	And I did that already once last season.
765000	767000	So that just shows you how into the game I am.
767000	770000	But I've been playing with friends and having a great time with it.
770000	773000	Again, that Seasons is only on PC.
773000	775000	I don't play on consoles as much.
775000	779000	But I notice a lot of my friends are playing on Xbox One.
779000	782000	I have a couple different groups of friends that are playing on Xbox One.
782000	785000	So I'm like, maybe I need to play Diablo 3 on Xbox One.
785000	787000	But here's the funny thing. I own it on PS4.
787000	790000	So I would literally have to buy a third copy of Diablo 3.
790000	792000	So I'm like, maybe when it goes...
792000	794000	Well, I didn't buy the first Diablo 3 on PC.
794000	796000	Because there was that whole World of Warcraft subscription thing.
796000	798000	But, we'll see.
798000	800000	And then, it does go on sale quite a bit.
800000	802000	It was down to like $24 the other week.
802000	804000	And I was like, maybe?
804000	806000	Yeah, so maybe if it goes on sale.
806000	808000	If it goes on sale again, I'll probably pick it up.
808000	810000	I'm considering Knack because it's down to $8.
810000	811000	Is it really?
811000	813000	I don't know yet. Maybe.
813000	816000	I just don't have... I want to finish some games.
816000	818000	But Fallout 4 is never going to finish.
818000	821000	Because once I'm done with Fallout, I'm going to have to start my asshole character.
821000	824000	Which, you know, that's going to be another several hundred hours.
824000	827000	Can I talk about a piece of video game hardware that I picked up?
827000	830000	And this is one of the things I just bought because I wanted it.
830000	834000	And Shane was trying to tell me they're not that great.
834000	836000	But I wanted it.
836000	838000	So I bought the wireless PlayStation 4 headset.
838000	840000	Because I like playing games.
840000	845000	I found that from playing more PC games, I really enjoy gaming with the headset.
845000	846000	And even though I like...
846000	848000	Which one? Do you have the stereo headset?
848000	850000	I have the official wireless one.
850000	852000	Is it the stereo headset? Is it surround sound?
852000	854000	7.1.
854000	855000	I have the...
855000	856000	Gold or something like that.
856000	858000	Yeah, I've got the PlayStation 3 one.
858000	860000	Which works on the PlayStation 4.
860000	863000	And I use it when I play with my friends Call of Duty and stuff.
863000	864000	Yeah.
864000	869000	And the thing with that device is that as much as I love to plop down on the TV and play the games,
869000	873000	I don't necessarily get that same sound stuff coming from the little soundbar I have.
873000	875000	I don't have a deluxe sound system.
875000	878000	I just have one of those little bars that outputs all the sound.
878000	881000	So I was like, you know what? What the hell? I'm just going to get some headphones.
881000	885000	And so far, I'm really enjoying using the headphones.
885000	888000	But I will say this. I tried playing amplitude with the headphones on.
888000	892000	And the bass got all distorted in different parts of the song.
892000	894000	So I might just need to play with the settings a little bit.
894000	897000	I always play with headphones plugged into my controller.
897000	902000	That's not how I play because my wife's usually watching Netflix on her thing or she's doing something else.
902000	906000	And so they don't like hearing the audio coming from that.
906000	908000	But I love it with headphones.
908000	912000	And Tigerclaw says a wireless headset. That would be kind of a hassle if you forget to recharge it.
912000	914000	You can still use them when they're plugged into the PlayStation 4.
914000	919000	But since they're the official Sony ones, you charge it with the same cable you use for your controller.
919000	923000	So it's just like charge one then charge the other and kind of flip back and forth.
923000	926000	It doesn't seem to be too difficult. So far, so good.
926000	928000	I did play one new game this week.
928000	932000	It was a game that released on, I think, PlayStation 4 and PC this week.
932000	935000	I'm not sure about Xbox One. Maybe somebody in chat can set me straight.
935000	937000	But I played Firewatch.
937000	939000	I think it's on Xbox One also.
939000	941000	It just came out this week.
941000	944000	And it was really not a game that was on my radar at all.
944000	947000	But I saw a lot of my friends on Twitter talking about it.
947000	949000	And that it was another one of those kind of...
949000	951000	Walking simulators?
952000	954000	I guess if you want to call it that.
954000	959000	But I feel like, okay, if you call something like Gone Home or Everybody's Gone to the Rapture a walking simulator...
959000	960000	They do.
960000	964000	But this game, yeah, I mean it's not like it's action packed.
964000	966000	You're not like fighting enemies or whatever.
966000	970000	But I feel like there's still kind of a deeper level of interaction maybe in this game.
970000	976000	Because the little twist in this game is that you're playing basically a ranger who's by themself out in the forest.
976000	982000	The Firewatch refers to the fact that they watch for fires and emergency scenarios and so forth, right?
982000	984000	It's like a two day hike out to the thing.
984000	988000	Exactly. And so they can only communicate with each other by radio.
988000	991000	So you're playing this main protagonist.
991000	994000	And the protagonist interacts with the boss via radio.
994000	1000000	And it's kind of like, for me a little bit, it invokes GLaDOS a little bit in Portal.
1000000	1002000	I get a little bit of that similar feeling.
1002000	1008000	Because the boss that he's talking to on the radio can be a little bit sassy with him and things like that.
1008000	1014000	So there's that. But you can ask about a lot of different objects and radio back.
1014000	1020000	And it's a little deeper too because some of the decisions that you make and some of the things you say could...
1020000	1026000	Like I had a case today where I said something that pissed her off and she wouldn't talk to me for like five minutes.
1026000	1028000	Or answer my calls or anything.
1028000	1030000	So it was kind of an interesting little twist there.
1031000	1034000	But yeah, it is one of those very story-driven things.
1034000	1039000	But I was very interested in it because it's not a scary game.
1039000	1043000	But you get this whole sense the time you're playing that something's off.
1043000	1050000	So I kind of like that. Because you know I'm not a big fan of jump scares, but I like unsettling games.
1050000	1052000	And so Firewatch is definitely that.
1052000	1057000	The one thing I am going to rag on the game though, and I think a lot of people are calling this out from what I see on Twitter.
1057000	1059000	There's a little bit of jitteriness on the PlayStation 4.
1059000	1065000	And whenever it tries to autosave you really notice like jump, jump, jump, jump around.
1065000	1068000	And it can really take you out of the experience.
1068000	1070000	Because otherwise a lot of the visuals are gorgeous.
1070000	1076000	You're walking around at sunset. You can look out and see an objective that's all far away.
1076000	1079000	But that's a place you know you can actually travel to.
1079000	1081000	So it's a gorgeous looking game.
1081000	1086000	But because of the PlayStation 4 performance issues it can take you out of the experience momentarily.
1086000	1089000	But I would actually say that's kind of a minor beef.
1089000	1091000	But that is something you may want to consider.
1091000	1094000	If it's like do I get it on PlayStation 4 or do I get it on PC?
1094000	1097000	Because I hear the PC version doesn't really do that.
1097000	1100000	I suppose that would depend on your PC as well.
1100000	1102000	So anyway.
1102000	1105000	Going to the chat over at live.vognetware.com.
1105000	1107000	Dungeon Buster says there is no Firewatch on Xbox One.
1107000	1113000	Only a tantalizing hint that it could come over to other platforms if there is a desire for it to.
1113000	1116000	And TigerClaw says it isn't a game that you play with the kids.
1116000	1119000	The characters have adult conversations that aren't kid friendly.
1119000	1121000	That is very true.
1121000	1125000	I believe this could depend on what you do in the story in the very beginning.
1125000	1129000	But I had nudity in the first 15 seconds of the game. Dude nudity.
1129000	1131000	So it's not something you want to play.
1131000	1132000	Would that be dude-ity?
1132000	1133000	Yeah dude-ity.
1133000	1136000	It's not something you necessarily want to play with kids around.
1136000	1140000	Or maybe you do. Just kind of know that there's going to be explicit.
1140000	1144000	Hell. From what I understand parents are taking their kids to see Deadpool.
1144000	1145000	And I'm like.
1145000	1146000	Lucky bastards.
1146000	1148000	And these are very stupid parents.
1148000	1150000	Well you know.
1150000	1153000	I should take my kids to see Deadpool because at least I'd see Deadpool.
1153000	1157000	And that's probably why a lot of kids are going to see Deadpool.
1157000	1160000	I saw someone even watch part of Iron Man 3 on TV the other day.
1160000	1162000	I was like. Hey look see here's what the movies look like.
1162000	1166000	And he's like. I don't want to watch it. It's scary.
1166000	1168000	I'm like. Come on you're like fans of all this stuff.
1168000	1172000	Like he talks all the time about you know all the Iron Man stuff.
1172000	1176000	And he'll talk about like the Minecraft things.
1176000	1177000	He'll talk about all the enemies and stuff.
1177000	1179000	And he always plays on peaceful with no enemies.
1179000	1181000	I finally convinced him like. Hey listen.
1181000	1183000	You play creative mode with enemies and they don't do anything.
1183000	1186000	You can just go and punch him in the face and there's like.
1186000	1187000	Hi.
1187000	1189000	So finally got him to do that and he's like super psyched about.
1189000	1191000	Oh hey look at all these things I did.
1191000	1194000	But like see I'm trying to get him to watch the Avengers movies.
1194000	1197000	So that I can show him this stuff and he just won't do it.
1197000	1201000	You know what I bet happens is that like when he's like six or so something's just going to flip.
1201000	1204000	And then suddenly it'll be like he loves ultra violence.
1204000	1208000	I just noticed that happened with kids that even happened to me.
1208000	1209000	That's not going to be him.
1209000	1212000	My parents say I was completely different when that is not going to be him.
1212000	1215000	That'll be my youngest son because my youngest son.
1215000	1221000	What he does now is he's like super cuddly and everything and all said I'm going to beat the shit out of you.
1221000	1224000	Like he will just run up to you and just punch you in the face.
1224000	1226000	I mean that is what he does.
1226000	1233000	All right anyway I would overall recommend Firewatch at least based on the little bit that I've played.
1233000	1236000	If you like the heavily story driven games.
1236000	1240000	If you need more action in your games it's probably going to be a pass for you.
1240000	1246000	But if you're if you like those games like Gone Home, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and the more story driven experiences.
1246000	1248000	Then I think Firewatch will be right up your alley.
1248000	1252000	All right some quick housekeeping before we get into the news tonight.
1252000	1255000	Please follow us on Twitter. Twitter dot com slash O L R.
1255000	1260000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google Plus at Orange Launch Radio as well.
1260000	1265000	We will not be here next week. There is no live show or podcast show next week.
1265000	1267000	And the reason for that is there might be a dead show.
1267000	1270000	There might be a dead show. Are you going to periscope something.
1270000	1272000	Actually that's what I'm doing next week.
1272000	1273000	You're going to see Deadpool.
1273000	1274000	I'm going to go see Deadpool.
1274000	1276000	We should totally go see Deadpool.
1276000	1277000	I'm going tomorrow with Dan.
1277000	1278000	You'll want to see it again.
1278000	1279000	Damn it.
1279000	1281000	Oh you know I'm going to go see it again.
1281000	1283000	So we should ingress and see Deadpool.
1283000	1284000	Hell yes.
1284000	1285000	OK.
1285000	1286000	And then we should periscope it.
1286000	1287000	OK.
1287000	1293000	Usually I would be insanely jealous but I am going to Magfest which I'm super pumped about and that's why there's no show next week.
1293000	1296000	So if you are going to Magfest I really look forward to see you there.
1296000	1300000	If you are somebody that I told about this show at Magfest.
1300000	1303000	Welcome to Orange Launch Radio and thank you so much for being here.
1303000	1306000	And I'm really looking forward to having a great time at Magfest.
1306000	1310000	My first time going and I'm coming all the way from the West Coast to go to Magfest.
1310000	1312000	So I'm really excited about it.
1312000	1315000	So I will see you there in National Harbor, Maryland.
1315000	1316000	I arrive on Thursday.
1316000	1319000	But there will be no show because I don't get back until Monday.
1319000	1325000	Which by the way, what a great idea to premiere three new shows on the Voice of the Geeks Network this week.
1325000	1329000	I'm not going to be here for half the week but we have a way to work it out.
1329000	1330000	All will be well.
1330000	1331000	All will be well.
1331000	1336000	I do want to address one other issue this week that I'm going to be honest.
1336000	1344000	This issue really bugged me and it has to do with a lot of you guys listen to this show on an app called Stitcher Radio.
1344000	1348000	Which is something that we have promoted here on Orange Launch Radio pretty heavily in the past.
1348000	1354000	And what happened with Stitcher is that our latest show was not showing up on Stitcher.
1354000	1358000	And we got tweets from several people that said, hey did you guys do a show this week?
1358000	1366000	I don't see it. And I was confused because I'm going into iTunes and I'm looking at the Voice of the Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and I see the latest show.
1366000	1368000	But I go onto Stitcher and it's not there.
1368000	1373000	But unfortunately Stitcher doesn't really have a way for me to ping, like force ping the feed or anything like that.
1373000	1377000	Well come to find out, long story short, Stitcher's been down for the last three days for maintenance.
1377000	1383000	So these people that have been relying on Stitcher Radio to listen to podcasts are really up a creek right now.
1384000	1389000	So I'm going to be honest, and this is a rough kind of hard thing for me to say.
1389000	1394000	But I don't think I can really continue to promote Stitcher Radio here on the show.
1394000	1396000	And I'm not going to.
1396000	1399000	And I'm not saying we're going to take ourselves off or anything.
1399000	1403000	And if that's how you choose to listen to the show, that's cool.
1403000	1406000	I'm all about getting Orange Launch Radio any way you can.
1406000	1411000	But if you are currently using Stitcher Radio, I would recommend you look into an app called TuneIn.
1411000	1418000	And the main difference is, on TuneIn, they don't actually download the shows in a different bit rate.
1418000	1420000	You're connecting directly to our feed.
1420000	1423000	So you're not relying on any third party to get the shows.
1423000	1426000	You're going to be getting the shows yourself.
1426000	1428000	That is just one recommendation.
1428000	1432000	Part of the reason I like TuneIn is that you can also use live radio with it.
1432000	1435000	So not only can you get OLR in it, but you can get the VoG network stream in it.
1435000	1437000	So that's why I'm a little partial to that.
1437000	1441000	But whatever you want to use to listen to the show, iTunes Podcast has it.
1441000	1444000	Google Play Store is supposed to be having podcasts.
1444000	1447000	I know we are on there whenever they roll that out.
1447000	1449000	So I'm very excited.
1449000	1453000	But unfortunately, this is one too many burns from Stitcher for me.
1453000	1457000	But this isn't a permanent thing.
1457000	1462000	If they are able to fix things and maybe communicate a little more, ever since they got bought,
1462000	1465000	I feel like a lot's gone downhill in that department.
1465000	1472000	So not saying forever, but I would recommend Stitcher folks find another way to listen to OLR
1472000	1476000	because I'm not encouraged by the support that's been coming from them.
1476000	1479000	And that's just the honest advice.
1479000	1481000	So sorry, I know it's a little harsh.
1481000	1485000	And I do, I just want to emphasize, I love all you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed.
1485000	1492000	But just as a podcaster, what's happening where you can't get the show is extraordinarily frustrating.
1492000	1496000	And that's why I'm putting my foot down and saying I'm just going to recommend something else.
1496000	1498000	Okay.
1498000	1503000	And some folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com are suggesting some other Android solutions.
1503000	1506000	MXC says Pocket Casts is good.
1506000	1508000	Mr. Rizos, I'm sorry, is that Rizos or Rizos?
1508000	1511000	Sorry, says try Pocket Cast if you're using Android.
1511000	1514000	There's some other comments there from our chat.
1514000	1517000	And then SHO 100 Matt says Stitcher did just update a few hours ago
1517000	1520000	saying that they're hoping to get service up via test sometime today.
1520000	1523000	Good luck to them. I hope they're able to work it out.
1523000	1528000	All right, let's go around and talk about what's going on this week in the news.
1528000	1530000	Loki's starting us off.
1530000	1536000	So Activision has finished their full reports for fiscal year 2015.
1536000	1539000	And they're talking about kind of the revenue and everything.
1539000	1546000	Apparently revenues are up 4.6 billion from 4.4 in 2014.
1546000	1553000	Of that, they said that 47.5% was due to subscriptions, including World of Warcraft.
1553000	1559000	Licensing, including Skylanders and all sorts of different things and Call of Duty.
1559000	1566000	Among all that, though, they're also saying that 53% is actually digital revenue now.
1566000	1568000	So from digital sources.
1568000	1572000	I'm thinking probably a lot of that has to do with all the DLC stuff that they have out.
1572000	1577000	I mean, especially with like the season passes for, you know, Call of Duty is probably a big thing.
1577000	1582000	You know, Destiny with all of its DLC stuff and it's consumable.
1582000	1585000	So that's probably a lot to do with it.
1585000	1594000	Right now, they're still saying, though, that apparently Guitar Hero Live and Skylanders Supercharged
1594000	1596000	have fallen short of expectations.
1596000	1601000	Skylanders I can totally see because it's hard to keep that brand alive.
1601000	1609000	I mean, it's kind of it's become popular on its own, but I mean, they're not doing too much crazy stuff with it.
1609000	1611000	They're just kind of adding one new gimmick each year.
1611000	1620000	Whereas I think, you know, Lego Dimensions and Disney Infinity has a lot of that licensing that they can kind of back up on.
1620000	1623000	You know, they've got, you know, the Marvel and Star Wars.
1623000	1630000	I mean, that's huge compared to Skylanders, which anybody coming into this, it's like who Skylanders what?
1630000	1635000	I kind of agree with you a lot here is that Skylanders maybe established the model,
1635000	1639000	but now all these other players are coming in and kind of pushing Skylanders out.
1639000	1644000	Well, and like Skylanders, I think, I mean, it looks like an interesting game and from what I've seen, it's OK.
1644000	1650000	It's just like for me, like if I was trying to get this for my son, like who are these characters?
1650000	1651000	I don't know who these characters are.
1651000	1655000	I know that they're talking about bringing a cartoon and stuff like that.
1655000	1659000	And there's a lot of kids that are really big fans of it because they've already been playing the other games.
1659000	1661000	And so they know the characters and everything.
1661000	1669000	But coming in from the outside, it's hard to kind of get hooked into that world without, you know, kind of knowing who these characters are.
1669000	1673000	Whereas if you're Disney Infinity and stuff, I mean, it's like Star Wars.
1673000	1679000	Oh, shit, we saw the Star Wars movies and we know all the Star Wars characters, you know, Marvel characters and Disney characters and all that stuff.
1679000	1682000	I mean, that's that's easy to kind of hook people into that.
1682000	1687000	And I think even the Lego Dimensions stuff, aside from it being insanely overpriced, which I think a lot of that,
1687000	1694000	especially when they have like Doctor Who, Portal, Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, that's totally aiming at the adult crowd.
1694000	1695000	Right.
1695000	1697000	You know, just buys that kind of stuff.
1697000	1705000	So I think that's kind of the problem they have with Skylanders and they need to figure out some way to, I don't know, do something a little bit more interesting with it.
1705000	1707000	It needs to kind of innovate a lot.
1707000	1710000	And maybe, you know, I don't know if there's a lot necessarily they can do.
1710000	1712000	Maybe Activision needs to try to push a new character.
1713000	1715000	Here's the other thing that's like kind of a big no-no with them.
1715000	1725000	It's like every time you buy a new version of Skylanders, you have to buy a whole new like starter pack, the whole new portal and everything to run with it because it doesn't work with the other stuff.
1725000	1729000	Whereas like Disney Infinity, I mean, not so much Lego Dimensions because it's the first time they released it.
1729000	1734000	But Disney Infinity, you can use that same portal from the first one on all the new games.
1734000	1737000	It's going to support any new game that they put out.
1737000	1741000	So, I think it's kind of dumb that they do it that way because it's more expensive.
1741000	1752000	You get to plop down, you know, $80 versus what I bought Disney Infinity 3.0 for $20 because I bought a digital version because I had the hardware for it already.
1752000	1755000	And I just thought I'd buy toys. So, I don't know.
1755000	1758000	Not surprising though that Activision is making so much off digital.
1758000	1761000	I mean, especially the Blizzard side of things.
1761000	1762000	Oh yeah.
1763000	1771000	And you know, they're doing these really weird things and Shane and I were talking about this the other day where it's kind of sketchy how, I know that's a strong word but I really can't think of a better one.
1771000	1776000	Where Blizzard is now trying this thing where instead of like pre-ordering games, you straight up pre-pay for games.
1776000	1778000	Like that's what's happening with Overwatch.
1778000	1783000	If you pre-pay for Overwatch on PC, you get like special skins and these sorts of things.
1783000	1786000	And it's like, you know, we're talking like $60.
1786000	1790000	So, it's like a $60, it's a full pre-order. You're paying the full $60 up front.
1790000	1795000	But the Blizzard fan base is so strong and the hype is so real for a game like Overwatch.
1795000	1799000	Which they're, you know, and God I hate the way they do this.
1799000	1804000	Is that they really funnel out the beta so that only certain people, it's to drive the hype.
1804000	1808000	And they've really got this formula down. As frustrating as it can be.
1808000	1814000	Well yeah, and people need to grow up and realize that skins for a game is fucking stupid.
1814000	1817000	And not a reason that you should pay $60 before it comes out.
1817000	1821000	And like, I think that can be, you know, a lot of games are like that.
1821000	1826000	Where it's like, you know, look at oh, order a GameStop and you get like a gold skin for your gun in Call of Duty.
1826000	1832000	Who gives a shit? It's a fucking skin. No one's gonna fucking notice what your gun skin is.
1832000	1835000	And even if they do, no one's gonna give a shit that you have the gold gun skin.
1835000	1838000	No one's gonna be like, oh my God, you're so cool because you have this skin.
1838000	1840000	Because they know what it comes from.
1840000	1842000	Yeah, exactly. No one cares.
1842000	1848000	S2100Matt says, this is the same Blizzard fan base that bought ridiculous mounts in WoW.
1848000	1853000	And on top of a regular monthly fee. Although I can't talk, I bought a mount in Final Fantasy XIV.
1853000	1857000	I was gonna say, the mounts, that's not so bad. I mean, I understand that people want to do that.
1857000	1863000	And a lot of times they're doing that for charity as well. So that's, I don't see is, you know, a terrible downside to that.
1863000	1869000	I mean, that's fine. If you want to spend the money on customization like that, they go ahead and spend the money on customization.
1869000	1874000	I don't understand the point behind it a lot of times, but I don't know.
1874000	1883000	It's just trying to get people to pay for a game in full, especially in this type of market where, I mean, Blizzard's maybe not so bad.
1883000	1889000	I don't think that they have a reputation of releasing games that are absolute broken when they come out because they develop mainly on PC anyways.
1889000	1897000	But paying for a game in full way before it comes out is a kind of a risky move, especially in this market.
1897000	1901000	Because of all the stuff that comes out absolutely broken at launch.
1901000	1910000	Not to say that I don't do that still for games I really want, but, you know, Bethesda games I expect a certain level of broken, so it's fine.
1910000	1919000	AkumaJP in chat says, no one cares what skin you have. That's what she says. Bad taste in joke, I know, but I can't help it.
1919000	1925000	Alan Halkemi says, Final Fantasy XIV shop like that is evil. They've only done one account-wide mount for $25.
1925000	1929000	Every storm out since is like $10 or $15 and it's per character.
1929000	1937000	Dungeon Buster says, The Taken King's physical release disk was only for vanilla Destiny. You still had to punch in a code for The Taken King to download it.
1937000	1945000	You know, I saw a comment here by Dungeon Buster. Skylanders isn't a bad game, it's just getting slammed by having to compete against the likes of Nintendo and Disney.
1946000	1958000	Nintendo. There's something you want to do. You want something for your amiibos. There you go. Fucking rip off fucking Skylanders and put out like an RPG game where you actually play as the damn characters.
1958000	1967000	That right there would probably get me to buy some of your amiibos. Because I think that would be pretty awesome. And it would be like, hey look, we have an actual use for this shit.
1967000	1972000	Here's the reality of that. I love that idea, but isn't that Smash Brothers?
1972000	1978000	Well Smash Brothers is a fighting game. Let's just change the genre. Let's just do an action RPG or something like that.
1978000	1988000	Okay, so maybe a platformer. Although I would be like, that's Mario Maker. How about a racer? Oh, that's Mario Kart. I feel like Nintendo has already done a game with all these genres.
1988000	1999000	But just spin off. You can even spin it off and just create almost like a Kingdom Hearts type thing where you have these different licensed properties coming into this brand new world that you're creating brand new characters for.
1999000	2005000	So I don't see why they couldn't do that. And hell, it'd give them an excuse to make more amiibos. I don't know.
2005000	2020000	Alright, well let's move on and talk about a feature that another company is proposing doing. And it's Microsoft. And you know, Microsoft made a lot of waves this week in updating everybody on what's going on with Quantum Break.
2020000	2027000	And I'm pleasantly surprised to hear Quantum Break's coming a lot sooner than I thought it was. They announced the release date for, what was it, April? For Quantum Break?
2027000	2028000	Wow, really?
2028000	2041000	Yeah, it's soon. Sorry, I don't have the date in front of me where it's at. I'm trying to look that up right now. Quantum Break, April 5th is when Quantum Break's out, right? That kind of came out of nowhere. I was like, oh, it's going to be a holiday game.
2041000	2045000	Yeah, I thought for sure that was a holiday, because we didn't hear anything about it for the longest time.
2045000	2051000	No, just like we just dropped three episodes of Guys on the Show on everybody, they just came out and said, okay, it's ready. April 5th.
2051000	2053000	Is it because, are they still doing the TV portion of that?
2053000	2054000	They are?
2054000	2071000	Well, I'm sorry, when you say that, I mean, because they have like some big name talent that's in the game. Who's that guy that plays Iceman on the X-Men? I think he's in there. Sean Asmore? Is that? Asmore? Ashmore.
2071000	2075000	My name is Sean. Sean Asmore.
2075000	2078000	I must be thinking about something else. Anyway.
2078000	2082000	I have your pizza.
2082000	2086000	So anyway, yeah, Quantum Break. So where was I going with this before we got into that?
2086000	2096000	Yes, Microsoft announced that Quantum Break is coming, and if you pre-order the game on Xbox One, you're going to get the Windows 10 version with it.
2096000	2108000	This is interesting. So what Microsoft's essentially doing here is like, alright, Sony, you guys do this cross-buy thing all the time, where if somebody buys it on PlayStation 4, they get it on the Vita as well.
2108000	2122000	Well, since we are basically injected into almost every PC out there, unless you have a Mac, which even if you have a Mac, you're probably double-booting, you will be able to get a copy of your Xbox One game on your PC.
2122000	2133000	And this may be something that actually ends up being a trend. Phil Spencer actually tweeted at somebody who asked, do you expect to see third-party games on the cross-buy list or just MS-related releases?
2133000	2139000	Phil Spencer replied, we'll make it a platform feature. We think it's good for gamers.
2139000	2145000	So, I mean, it's nice to get something additional for the money that you pay.
2145000	2158000	And by the way, in this case, specifically with Quantum Break, not only is it going to be Quantum Break, but you're also going to get Alan Wake with the backwards compatibility thing on 360 is also going to be included, and the little spin-off game they did.
2158000	2161000	It's not a bad deal.
2161000	2163000	And I like Alan Wake a lot.
2163000	2170000	I mean, I like Minecraft on Windows 10, but I am not going to the Windows 10 store to go shop for games.
2170000	2179000	So, I mean, I don't know. Cool. I mean, hey, something for free is better than nothing for free, so I'm down with that.
2179000	2188000	Now, ActDeft brings up in chat over at live.vognetwork.com something that kind of happened on the internet and on Twitter as a result of this.
2188000	2193000	And ActDeft says, I'm going to cancel my Xbox One pre-order for Quantum Break because more people will play it.
2193000	2208000	He's saying that in quotes. He's not saying that himself, but reflecting what was seen on Twitter this week, where some people reacted very angrily to this news saying, I can't believe you're doing this and that you promised this game is an Xbox One exclusive,
2208000	2212000	and now you're going to give it to PC people as well. I'm canceling my pre-order. I'm so mad.
2212000	2216000	Which, I don't know if that makes a lot of sense to me.
2216000	2217000	Oh, it doesn't.
2217000	2222000	I don't understand why you would be mad that more people can play it or whatever.
2222000	2224000	I guess they're complaining because...
2224000	2227000	They were promised it as an exclusive and it's not.
2227000	2230000	So maybe they feel burned in the purchase of the Xbox One game.
2230000	2240000	Yeah, exactly. Like, I bought this Xbox One for these exclusives and they're not exclusive anymore. Why did I purchase this one? I can just get it on this other platform that I already had that I didn't require this purchase on.
2240000	2244000	But I don't think it works in reverse. You can't buy the PC version and get the Xbox One version for free.
2244000	2251000	No, we don't know yet. Maybe if you buy it through the Windows 10 store instead of Steam, you will. Watch.
2251000	2257000	I'm on PlayStation Steam integration. Let's do that.
2257000	2260000	No, they were flirting a little bit when PlayStation 2 came out.
2260000	2262000	Yeah, that didn't happen.
2262000	2273000	But if there was any way to do Half-Life 3 and just the internet explode in a sea of jism, that's gonna be the way to do it.
2273000	2281000	But anyway, all that tinfoil hatting aside, I still don't understand the whole idea of just canceling your pre-order.
2281000	2287000	Because in my mind, you shouldn't be getting an Xbox One for just one game anyway.
2287000	2289000	Until that's all the Forza fans.
2289000	2290000	And you're still getting that game.
2290000	2292000	But you at least have two Forza games.
2292000	2302000	And so what? You're still getting the game. And I mean, let's be honest. I have a Windows 10 laptop. Doesn't mean this game is gonna run for shit on my laptop.
2302000	2310000	Just because it's free with Windows 10, or free if you buy it and you get a Windows 10 version, I can't run that shit.
2310000	2313000	My laptop's gonna be like, no.
2313000	2319000	It's gonna be benchmark for the Xbox One. There's certain multiplayer integration on Xbox One and so forth.
2319000	2325000	Well, I don't know if Quantum Break's a multiplayer game, but there's certain things you kind of come to expect with the Xbox One.
2325000	2331000	But I kind of like the idea that if I get a game on one system, I'm gonna get it on both.
2331000	2338000	I just fucking said, like, 20 minutes ago, that I want to get Diablo 3 on Xbox One.
2338000	2342000	If it had had the cross-buy, this wouldn't be an issue, right?
2342000	2348000	So, from that regard, from that frugal money-saving standpoint, I love this.
2348000	2356000	And if you're getting pissed off about shit coming out on Xbox One and then not being exclusive, I mean, I don't know.
2356000	2359000	I think it's just a dumb argument anyways. On any platform.
2360000	2368000	Bobby Blackwolf with some insight in our chat saying the idea that some people have is that this is Microsoft abandoning the Xbox One platform.
2368000	2369000	They're not.
2369000	2376000	In a way, it kind of makes it stronger. Like, they're trying to say, this is how we're gonna really try to push it past Sony.
2376000	2381000	If anything, I don't think they're using it to get you to buy more games on Windows 10.
2381000	2385000	Because eventually, what they're trying to do is they're supposed to be unifying all those platforms anyway.
2385000	2395000	So, where it's just Windows 10 on Microsoft's Xbox One and all these other devices, and you buy something on one platform, you get it on all platforms.
2395000	2402000	And Bobby also says you need Oculus-like specs to run it on a PC, which, again, is pretty high-end, and that's without VR.
2402000	2408000	And AkumaJP says, and remember, AkumaJP is in Japan, what's this Xbox One mystical machine you're talking about?
2410000	2412000	It's a console that came out in the early 2000s.
2413000	2418000	It had some pretty awesome games on it. I remember, granted, San Andreas was on it. First Halo game was on it.
2418000	2421000	Xbox One. Xbox One. The new one. The new one.
2421000	2423000	Wait, the new one?
2423000	2424000	Anyway.
2424000	2427000	That doesn't make any sense. Why would you call it the Xbox One if there's been two more before?
2427000	2432000	Okay, hello debate from, like, three years ago when they first announced the name. Get over it.
2432000	2437000	I'm telling you what, I'm just gonna go buy a Wii, and then that way I can play, you know, the new Zelda game when it comes out.
2437000	2438000	Is that Wii for you?
2438000	2440000	No, that's the original Wii.
2440000	2443000	You know, because it can run the new Zelda game, right, in 1080p?
2444000	2447000	Moving on. Dark Sakura, save us from this silliness.
2448000	2462000	So there's a survey out that was put up by the video games analytics group Quantic Foundry that interviewed over 140,000 gamers for something called a gamer motivation profile.
2462000	2469000	And it showed that basically the older that someone gets, the less appealing they find competition.
2469000	2480000	So things like PVP or competitive gaming, things like that, basically just stops appealing to them.
2480000	2486000	They're also saying that the big difference sort of hits right around age 35.
2487000	2503000	You know, things start going further after they're, you know, it has an allegory to, like, life choices and the capacity the one has for wanting to compete more, like, in work and everything too.
2503000	2505000	So I thought it was pretty interesting.
2505000	2509000	So is this study proving that everybody's a goddamn wuss?
2509000	2511000	No, I'm not motivated to compete.
2511000	2515000	I'll tell you what it is, and I can completely understand because I am 35.
2515000	2518000	So here's what it is, is you can't fucking compete.
2518000	2521000	You can do it all you want, but it's impossible, and you know why?
2521000	2533000	Because there are people that don't have jobs or don't have, you know, a life, or not a life, don't have family that they have to take care of, you know, a spouse, that type of stuff.
2534000	2539000	So they have unlimited time to get at the top of these leaderboards.
2539000	2549000	And by all means, it is impossible for you with your fucking two hours a day at the most playing these games to be able to compete on that level because you just don't have the free time.
2549000	2553000	And I'm looking at you, all you unemployed fucking retired people playing goddamn Ingress Rant.
2553000	2555000	I knew this was an Ingress Rant, I knew it.
2555000	2560000	I personally don't think that's the situation at all.
2561000	2569000	One of the notes on here, it says the appeal of strategy declined the least, but the motivation to compete with others did.
2569000	2576000	And for me, I personally just think that I am more satisfied with what I have, you know.
2576000	2584000	I don't feel any need. I know I'm good. I don't feel like I have to prove it, you know.
2584000	2590000	It's like, what's another one? It was like back when I was playing Busted Move all the damn time.
2590000	2596000	I entered one tournament, you know, and just kicked ass the entire hour before the tournament.
2596000	2603000	And I was kind of like, I had a broken controller, so I didn't win my fourth match.
2603000	2606000	And I didn't carry even really. I mean, I kind of didn't care.
2606000	2610000	And it's the same thing now. I know I'm good at these games that I'm playing.
2610000	2614000	I just don't feel a need to prove it to anybody.
2614000	2619000	I'm somewhere in the middle because I totally get that whole element of I don't really want a PvP.
2619000	2624000	And a lot of times I don't want a PvP because of some of the things we're low-key saying,
2624000	2628000	where it's just like you always get matched against people who are way outside of your bracket.
2628000	2633000	And I feel like matchmaking in games, nobody's really perfected it yet because, you know,
2633000	2638000	and the reality is it's not fun to lose over and over and over again.
2638000	2641000	And I get that, you know, sometimes there's winners and sometimes there's losers.
2641000	2644000	But, you know, in some games you get matched up and it's like you just can't,
2644000	2646000	you're just banging your head against a wall. You don't go anywhere.
2646000	2653000	But at the same time, I have a lot of fun when I'm playing like Rocket League with my friends.
2653000	2659000	And so when it's kind of like when that PvP environment is friends versus friends
2659000	2662000	and we're all kind of evenly matched, it's super fun.
2662000	2667000	It's also a lot of those competitive environments are toxic.
2667000	2669000	It's just very toxic people that you're playing with.
2669000	2675000	It's not like, you know, I remember like that was one of the things I used to do.
2675000	2679000	I even still do that with my friends when I play like Call of Duty with them and stuff.
2679000	2683000	It's like I'm very like, hey, you know, great shot.
2683000	2688000	You know, that was a great kill he got me and stuff like that and like very positive on that.
2688000	2689000	But there's a lot of people.
2689000	2693000	I mean, there's a vast majority of people you play with. They're fucking just toxic.
2693000	2694000	You don't want to waste your eat.
2694000	2699000	Like I said, you're talking about people that have very limited time in their schedule to play games.
2699000	2701000	And this is the kind of shit that you're, you know.
2701000	2706000	Oh, I spent two hours getting my ass kicked by someone that was just fucking yelling racial slurs at me the entire time.
2706000	2708000	I really want to play more of this.
2708000	2711000	I mean, that's kind of the problem is you have limited time.
2711000	2714000	And so you want that quality of gaming to be there.
2714000	2718000	And if that, you know, it's going to be impossible to make sure that, you know,
2718000	2721000	who you're playing with is going to be a very positive experience.
2721000	2724000	I don't know. A little bit of trash talking is fine.
2724000	2727000	But I mean, it's just when people take it way too seriously.
2727000	2729000	Kaijuto in chat says, I disagree.
2729000	2731000	If you want to be competitive, you have to get out there.
2731000	2734000	And I sort of like I kind of get that.
2734000	2739000	But at the same time, I still feel like matchmaking and a lot of the games I've tried could just be better.
2739000	2747000	And that you could still learn from people that are like, like, oh, God, Splatoon is a great example.
2747000	2753000	I think like I I hit my head against a wall in Splatoon all the time because I keep getting matched with people that are way up here.
2753000	2757000	And it's like I just I make no progress in it and I'm not learning anything.
2757000	2765000	And I don't know, maybe it's just maybe it's just but but when I play Splatoon with friends, I have a great time.
2765000	2770000	So I'd play more Splatoon if it had off screen play, but it doesn't.
2770000	2775000	So I don't. Now you're you're getting into things that aren't even about the topic.
2775000	2778000	You're just you're just finding new things to complain about, Loki.
2778000	2783000	I want to like that game. I don't like it, though, right now. And it's because I don't play much of it.
2783000	2789000	And that's the reason why right there, which is frustrating because they have it in offline mode.
2789000	2791000	Why can't you do that online?
2791000	2796000	Dungeon Buster in chat says, I miss hacked 64 player matches in Battlefront 1942.
2796000	2802000	You know, cluster fucks can be kind of fun, like when the game is just one giant cluster fuck that actually like that.
2802000	2804000	Just Cause 2 multiplayer right there.
2804000	2810000	Or going back to like Duke Nukem 3D when it was like eight people on a match. It's just one giant cluster fuck.
2810000	2815000	Like that's kind of fun. Like, you know, I don't know. I guess we should totally do that.
2815000	2822000	I have Duke Nukem 3D and like all these different platforms. Like I know I have it on PlayStation 3 and Xbox.
2822000	2824000	Yeah, I think I have Duke Nukem on PC for sure.
2824000	2826000	And definitely PC reboot.
2826000	2830000	So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We get some other stories we got to get to Loki.
2830000	2832000	All right. Sorry.
2832000	2834000	So this is kind of cool.
2834000	2840000	Lego Star Wars. They're going to be making an actual animated show that's coming to Disney XD this summer.
2840000	2843000	It's called Lego Star Wars Freemaker Adventures.
2843000	2847000	It's going to take place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
2847000	2850000	They're going to have some new heroes and villains that they're adding.
2850000	2854000	Plus it's going to be kind of lighthearted like most of the Lego stuff is.
2854000	2858000	And I'm totally down with this. I really wish they would do a Marvel show though as well.
2858000	2866000	Because I'll tell you, we watch that Lego Marvel Superheroes Overload or whatever that's called.
2866000	2875000	It's like a little made of like four or five different clips that they have on YouTube that they made around the time of the previous Lego Marvel game.
2875000	2881000	My kids watch that show every day, at least once, probably twice or three times a day.
2881000	2886000	And it's awesome. It's got, you know, Trey Baker as Loki in there.
2886000	2889000	And the humor is just funny.
2889000	2895000	So I'm really, if they can do that that well for just like 40 minutes and to the point where it's so rewatchable,
2895000	2898000	I'm totally down with them doing a Lego show.
2898000	2903000	I just hope that they follow it up with a Marvel show as well because I don't want to miss out on that.
2906000	2913000	Yeah, you know, the more you can tie into TVs and TV and get the kids hooked in, the more it's going to help the franchise.
2913000	2920000	I think that kind of got them hooked in with the whole game in the first place because it was on there like a Lego show and we watched it.
2920000	2927000	And, you know, that's one of the reasons also I was kind of disappointed that they didn't have the voice actors from, you know, the original game,
2927000	2932000	whereas all original voice acting doing the different characters, they just kind of splice it out of the movies
2932000	2936000	because the voice actors were the same in the cartoon as they were in the actual game.
2936000	2942000	And I thought they were great. It's just, I don't know, now it's just clipped out voices and it doesn't make any sense.
2944000	2951000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase PIPE.
2951000	2959000	Alright, well let's move on to your weekly Nintendo NX rumors because it seems like every week there's another damn NX rumor out there
2959000	2963000	as the hype continues to build for Nintendo's new platform.
2963000	2965000	Well, here's your rumors for this week.
2965000	2972000	Apparently, the Nintendo NX will support Unreal Engine 4 and Unity at launch, which, I mean...
2972000	2974000	Phones support that, so it's not surprising.
2974000	2981000	Yeah, I mean, it's kind of something you're gonna have to support if you want to get into a lot of the indies and, you know, a lot of the different titles.
2981000	2996000	So, this isn't exactly surprising, but the source that was talking about this says that Unity and Unreal Engine 4 will be ready in time for when developers outside of key partners are able to purchase dev kits of their own.
2996000	2999000	We may hear more about this at GDC, maybe?
2999000	3009000	Maybe, but I still feel like it's gonna be early. I really feel like Nintendo's gonna do it at E3. I think that is what they're waiting for, for sure.
3009000	3017000	But Nintendo, you know, in a separate report, Nintendo is still continuing their development and planning efforts for the NX in preparation for launch.
3017000	3026000	And this was something that the president of Nintendo, the new one, Tatsumi Kimishima, said as he was talking to investors.
3026000	3034000	That development and planning efforts for the NX in preparation for launch are underway, but obviously he didn't say a lot more than that.
3034000	3048000	He did continue to say that previous and current fiscal years have been a period of preparation to launch a number of new endeavors, such as NX development, development for smart devices, and business using our character IP, in addition to driving our Wii U and Nintendo 3DS business.
3048000	3057000	At the same time, it's been our priority to take a close look at areas of our existing business where the revenue and expenses have become unbalanced and to make sure that we corrected this balance.
3057000	3063000	As I've said before, we will be launching many of our new business activities as we move from this fiscal year into the next.
3063000	3070000	The question was to pick one area with which we will be able to achieve Nintendo-like profits, but I would like to suggest two areas.
3070000	3074000	One is our NX business and another is our business for smart devices.
3074000	3079000	I believe that keeping these two endeavors on track will be key to achieving Nintendo-like profits.
3079000	3087000	I don't have any further details to share about the next fiscal year at this time, but we will explain our plan and what we will aim to achieve Nintendo-like profits at a future date.
3087000	3092000	So, I mean, it's really all but a given that NX is going to show up at E3 this year.
3093000	3101000	If not sooner, but certainly by E3, I think we'll finally have a name and kind of know what the catch is with this.
3101000	3112000	If we haven't already figured it out, which a lot of folks speculating based on prior reports that it's going to be similar to a Wii U, but the tablet is simply a fully functional handheld system.
3112000	3121000	And that is the NX ecosystem, essentially. And apparently it will run Unreal and Unity, because it has to.
3121000	3134000	Well, Unreal is scalable, so that's the point. Hell, remember, there are Unreal games that are on Android devices and iOS devices, so it makes sense.
3134000	3143000	And Dungeon Buster reminding us that Iwata, before he passed away, did ask everyone to look forward to E3 this year for NX news, so it would be, you know, on track for them.
3143000	3150000	And SSG100Matt says Nintendo can take their time in releasing this. I'd rather they release it later and get it right.
3150000	3160000	Well, you know, we had an earlier rumor, and this was even something I had thrown out there as a suggestion in early January, that maybe one will predate the other.
3160000	3164000	That maybe we'll have the handheld this year, but we won't necessarily have the console until later on.
3164000	3167000	Why not split up when they're going to ask for your money?
3167000	3175000	Instead of making you pay $600 all at once, or whatever it's going to end up being, get your $250 for the handheld and your $300 for the console, or whatever it is.
3175000	3180000	I'm throwing arbitrary numbers out there. But get that separated a little bit so it doesn't feel like such a punch.
3180000	3188000	I really feel like that's the direction Nintendo's got to go to get more people to adopt this, is basically sucker people into buying two systems.
3188000	3195000	Which, to be fair, most Nintendo fans already have a Wii U and a 3DS. It's not going to be anything different. It's just that they'll work together.
3195000	3200000	Logie, I feel like you're trying to start dying to say something over there.
3200000	3204000	I just want the PlayStation VR this year, so, you know, I can play that.
3204000	3208000	There is that. That might be the thing you hear more about at GDC.
3209000	3216000	I hope we get some sort of price for it soon. I mean, maybe, I think it's going to be close to the holiday that we hear the price about it.
3216000	3221000	We'll probably know the release date around E3 and maybe the price around the holiday.
3221000	3226000	See, the PlayStation VR is supposed to be out the first half of the year. So...
3226000	3228000	I hope that's the case. I'd love to pick it up.
3228000	3229000	I really think there's...
3229000	3234000	Because that's a system I know that'll at least run VR, because my laptop ain't cutting it.
3234000	3240000	There's no other real time I can think of for them to say anything about it other than GDC.
3240000	3244000	Or they're going to have to wait until E3. Or, you know, it's Sony.
3244000	3246000	They could throw another event whenever they want.
3246000	3251000	Are they? I mean, can I order them?
3251000	3257000	I don't believe so. I think a listing was spotted, and that's where the price supposedly leaked out from.
3257000	3260000	But I don't think that was an intended mass thing yet.
3261000	3264000	Because you can't really pre-order something you don't necessarily know the price for.
3264000	3267000	Well, GameStop would disagree with you.
3267000	3268000	That's true, that's true.
3268000	3272000	Alright, moving on. Before we get to release dates, start Sakura.
3272000	3274000	Oh, I guess.
3274000	3286000	So, for fans who love their old Windows 3.1 games, which are some of my very, very fond memories back on a 486.
3287000	3298000	The Internet Archive, which is a non-profit that's devoted to basically creating an online archive for anything digital, I guess.
3298000	3303000	They've added a bunch of DOS games about a year ago up there.
3303000	3311000	But now they've expanded it to include over a thousand Windows 3.1 games and programs.
3312000	3320000	Like the article that I got my information from shows a picture of Election 92 that you can play. Who remembers that?
3320000	3323000	I don't, but I remember Minesweeper.
3323000	3331000	But they have the various list of programs up there, and the entire archive is available.
3331000	3335000	So I would most assuredly say, you know, check it out.
3335000	3340000	See what's up there, because you might find an old treasure that you forgot about, you know.
3340000	3350000	Just looking through the archive list, and yeah, the website is at archive.org slash details slash software library underscore win three.
3350000	3354000	Which they had previously already done a bunch of old DOS releases, you know.
3354000	3356000	That's, yeah, about a year ago.
3356000	3362000	So yeah, oh my god, that was about a year ago. So now we're moving into the Windows era, so that's pretty cool.
3362000	3370000	Yeah, just looking at some of the ones on here, we have the Windows 3.1.1 stock installation.
3370000	3379000	We have Sea Battle, Travel and Ted, Pharaoh's Curse, 3D Maze, The Spooky Door.
3379000	3381000	I don't remember any of these games.
3381000	3388000	Battlestar, some of these I did play, Monopoly Deluxe, Windows Risk, TDK Pinball.
3388000	3392000	Oh, I wonder if something like CivNet or one of those old Civilization games you have on there.
3392000	3395000	Windows 3.1 WinTrek, remember that Star Trek game.
3395000	3397000	Click and Play.
3397000	3402000	SSG100 Matt is asking if Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is on there. God, I hope so.
3402000	3408000	I'm looking, Brainwave 2, RoboWin, Blob Factory.
3408000	3410000	Alright, don't name all the games, I'll be here all night.
3410000	3415000	No, I'm just looking through it just to see if I can find any in particular that are, yeah, I should see if I can see them on there.
3415000	3418000	But yeah, there's just a ton of stuff on here, so.
3418000	3422000	Go dig through yourself. Find a game to play for 30 seconds before you move on to the next one.
3422000	3424000	Spooky Door.
3424000	3425000	The Spooky Door.
3425000	3427000	It actually has so many O's in both of them.
3427000	3429000	Better than the Spooky Door.
3429000	3431000	Better than the Poopy Door.
3431000	3436000	Now this is funny, it has Autodesk 3D Studio 3 on it.
3436000	3437000	Really?
3437000	3438000	That's old school.
3438000	3441000	Very old school. I like the fact that there's just like the stock Windows installation.
3442000	3445000	Hey, wanna play around with the Windows 3.1 desktop just for fun?
3445000	3447000	It was the 3.1.1.
3447000	3452000	Oh, excuse me, DarkSagra. 3.1.1 installation.
3452000	3454000	Actually, Wheel of Fortune's on here.
3454000	3455000	Wow.
3455000	3459000	You have the old Windows Wheel of Fortune. I'm just trying to see.
3459000	3463000	Do they have Jeopardy 2 so you can get all the 90's answers in there?
3463000	3469000	Try going back and playing a game like Jeopardy on an old system. It asks you questions from that era.
3469000	3471000	And it's like, oh my god.
3471000	3473000	Dan was doing that with Puzzle and Dragons.
3473000	3476000	Or playing The Price is Right will fuck you up.
3476000	3478000	Tamagotchi for Windows.
3478000	3479000	Alright.
3479000	3480000	Crazy.
3480000	3481000	Let's move on.
3481000	3489000	We're gonna talk about what games you can play in the here and now this week as we travel around the world and look at release dates. Loki starting in the US.
3489000	3493000	Alright, so this week, quite a bit of stuff's coming out.
3494000	3501000	So, let's see. Let's start with Street Fighter V. That'll be coming out on Playstation 4 as well as PC.
3501000	3506000	Then we've got Project X Zone 2 on 3DS.
3506000	3510000	And Return. Let's see. That's not coming out this week.
3510000	3514000	It's not even in order. That makes no sense.
3514000	3518000	On Friday, we have Fire Emblem Fates Conquest.
3519000	3521000	With, let's see here.
3522000	3526000	Bayonetta 2 is getting re-released, looks like, on Wii U.
3526000	3528000	I don't know if that's a price drop, maybe.
3528000	3530000	It looks like a price drop.
3532000	3537000	And Fire Emblem Fates Birthright and Fire Emblem Fates Conquest.
3539000	3541000	Both coming out on Friday.
3541000	3542000	And that would be it.
3543000	3548000	Alright, let's go over to Japan where Street Fighter V is also coming out over there.
3548000	3550000	And I know a lot of people are very excited about that.
3550000	3553000	That will be on February 18th for Street Fighter V.
3553000	3559000	On the Playstation 4, there's also a hot package which I think just has some of the extra skins like Daddy Ryu and stuff.
3559000	3564000	There's also a full system bundle that's gonna be coming out with Street Fighter V included.
3564000	3566000	So I'm sure some people are very much looking forward to that.
3566000	3570000	But that's not the only release on the Playstation 4 in Japan this week.
3570000	3573000	You can also get Shingeki no Kaioujin is coming out this week.
3573000	3575000	That is Attack on Titan.
3575000	3578000	Yay! I want that, like, a lot.
3579000	3582000	Playstation 4 region free, right?
3582000	3583000	So that's something you can do.
3583000	3584000	Yeah, I got Puyo Puyo.
3584000	3586000	That's right. So you can do it if you wanted to.
3586000	3587000	Puyo Puyo.
3587000	3590000	Going over to the Wii U.
3590000	3591000	Nothing.
3591000	3593000	For a long time.
3593000	3598000	So let's go over to the Vita, which, the Vita has more releases than the Wii U in Japan.
3598000	3602000	That Shingeki no Kaioujin is also out on the Playstation Vita.
3602000	3604000	Kankole- what?
3604000	3605000	Kyojin.
3605000	3606000	One of these days.
3606000	3609000	Kankole Kai comes out on the Vita as well.
3609000	3615000	Ikene Tu Yuki no Setsuna also comes out on the Playstation Vita.
3615000	3619000	So a little bit of a busy week over there in Japan, especially with Street Fighter V.
3619000	3622000	Let's go over to the UK, Dark Sakura.
3622000	3624000	I don't wanna go.
3625000	3627000	We're not physically going there, we're just mentally going there.
3627000	3629000	I know, I actually lost my place on the webpage.
3629000	3630000	To talk about their release date.
3630000	3632000	Excuse me, princess.
3632000	3638000	Okay, so on the 16th, we have Layers of Fear for the Mac.
3638000	3642000	And then The Escapist, The Walking Dead for PS4.
3642000	3649000	On the 17th, Californium on Mac and PC, and Rainbow Moon on PS4.
3649000	3652000	And that's it for the week.
3653000	3657000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
3657000	3659000	But first, Loki.
3659000	3666000	Alright, so I think we talked about this before, but Ubisoft has confirmed that there will not be a new Assassin's Creed game this year.
3666000	3672000	And instead Watch Dogs will be coming, which may not necessarily make it out this year as well.
3672000	3677000	It's supposed to be out by March of 2017 though, so expect that.
3677000	3684000	And basically saying, this year we are stepping back and reexamining the Assassin's Creed franchise.
3684000	3691000	As a result, we decided that there will not be a new Assassin's Creed game in 2016 since the release of Assassin's Creed Unity.
3691000	3695000	We've learned a lot based on your feedback, because it was really terrible.
3695000	3704000	We've also updated our development process and recommitted to making Assassin's Creed a premier open world franchise, blah blah blah blah blah, PR speak.
3704000	3707000	Okay, so that's all you need to know about that.
3707000	3728000	What is on their table though, between now and the end of March 2017, For Honor, South Park, The Fractured But Whole, Ghost Recon Wildlands, and of course the new Watch Dogs game, and some other AAA titles.
3728000	3732000	I am excited about the South Park game.
3732000	3735000	Yeah, South Park's game is definitely one I gotta check out.
3735000	3739000	It reminds me, I gotta go back and finish the South Park game.
3739000	3744000	And yeah, a lot of people picked up that other South Park game, The Stick of Truth. It's pretty amazing.
3744000	3750000	Speaking of which, South Park, The Stick of Truth, has sold 5 million copies.
3750000	3757000	5 million copies. So, maybe we can sell a few more in anticipation of the sequel.
3757000	3764000	Definitely play it if you haven't yet, because it is a fantastic game. It is basically the show. I mean...
3764000	3766000	It's a really long episode of the show.
3766000	3772000	Really long episode of the show. I mean, it is fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about the game.
3772000	3779000	Alright. Well, moving on to one more story here that's actually a really big deal that happened in gaming this week that we should talk about.
3779000	3785000	And that is that Amazon has released a new game engine, and they've released it for free.
3785000	3790000	So, right now out there, you hear a lot of people often talking about Unity or they're talking about Unreal Engine.
3790000	3795000	Well, a new 3D game engine was released by Amazon, and it's called Lumberyard.
3795000	3800000	And this is going to allow you to create games for the PC or consoles and mobile.
3800000	3806000	It is based in part on the CryEngine, but there's other tech and code that comes from Double Helix.
3806000	3811000	I believe Amazon had acquired them some time ago, who had made Killer Instinct on Xbox One.
3811000	3820000	There's also some Amazon AWS code, and it's really going to focus on multiplayer and social games and where online instances are important.
3820000	3827000	And that's pretty cool because that is how Amazon is essentially quote-unquote monetizing it.
3827000	3835000	Because by them integrating the Amazon web services into it and the whole cloud and using that for the multiplayer,
3835000	3843000	that's how they're essentially making money off of it is because if you use the easily built-in multiplayer stuff, it's going to integrate with Amazon.
3843000	3853000	And not just that, but the whole social element where Twitch TV, you're going to be able to have your game have those interactions with Twitch very easily.
3853000	3855000	And I'm not just talking about streaming the game on Twitch.
3855000	3861000	I'm talking about like when people type things on chat and it does things in the game, that is all integrated into Lumberyard as well.
3861000	3867000	So this is interesting how Amazon is using a game engine to essentially bolster their other properties.
3867000	3877000	I almost have to wonder at some point if, I don't want to necessarily say the word antitrust, but it's going to come to a point where there's too many hands-in-hands going on in Amazon.
3877000	3880000	I think this might be about the limit. So we'll see.
3880000	3886000	But I mean, I don't see this as negative necessarily. I think more options are a great thing.
3886000	3893000	And having this engine that's going to be completely free is going to be extremely competitive and probably get more people out there actually making games.
3893000	3901000	By the way, Gamelift is the other side of this and that is where you actually create the session-based multiplayer games.
3901000	3906000	That's not necessarily directly in Lumberyard, but obviously those two are pretty much hand-in-hand.
3907000	3917000	So Lumberyard will support PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Supposedly mobile and VR support also coming to Lumberyard.
3917000	3924000	Akuma JP points out in chat, Lumberyard is basically CryEngine equals UI disaster.
3924000	3931000	So it may be something you, I don't know if Amazon's polished it up or what, but it may be something you have to spend a little bit of time learning.
3931000	3937000	I can't imagine Amazon wouldn't put something out there though that they don't have a really good support at like teaching people how to use.
3937000	3943000	But I think at the end of the day, you know, different programmers are going to prefer different things.
3943000	3949000	And it might be really hard to pull somebody who's been doing Unity off of that into Lumberyard.
3949000	3953000	I don't know, Loki, you use these things way more than I do. What do you think when you hear about this?
3953000	3957000	Is this something where you're like, hmm, I want to check this out or nah, I need to look at it.
3958000	3965000	I know Crytek was available for a while. I mean, it's still available, but like, I don't know if I would try to use that.
3965000	3971000	I mean, it's free. I was going to download it, but it's 10 gigs right now, so obviously I'm not going to download that right now.
3971000	3976000	But I'll take a look at it, I guess. I mean, it just depends on what it looks like.
3976000	3980000	And I don't really have anything that would necessarily need to use this to make.
3980000	3986000	I mean, like, I don't know. I'll stick with what I'm comfortable with for right now.
3986000	3992000	But it's good to have alternatives, I guess. I like the Twitch integration thing. That's kind of cool.
3992000	4000000	Yeah. It'd be very interesting to see what Twitch looks like a couple years from now, where it's not just watching people playing games, it's interacting with people playing games.
4000000	4004000	It's going to be very, very, I mean, that's already out there in some capacity.
4004000	4014000	I want to say right now, or in the very near future, is when Twitch is celebrating the Pokemon, or Twitch plays Pokemon, things like the second anniversary of that whole thing.
4014000	4022000	And that was kind of the little pebble that started the avalanche of more interaction in streams.
4022000	4029000	Yeah, that was ridiculous. Who would have thought that you could have had a group of people just play Pokemon in that manner?
4029000	4032000	And played through, like, most of the games.
4032000	4035000	Yeah. I think they beat it. I'm pretty sure they beat it.
4035000	4038000	Did the fish ever play in Pokemon ever finish Pokemon?
4038000	4043000	I don't know if any of those other, I mean, there was a lot of knockoffs after that, and I didn't really follow any of those.
4043000	4051000	Alright, let's move on. Let's go back to a simpler time where, you know what, the internet, there was no internet, actually.
4051000	4061000	There was no internet, so there was nobody to yell at you at what you were doing wrong while you were playing a game besides, you know, maybe somebody who was sitting in the room with you.
4062000	4064000	The classic game of the week.
4064000	4071000	Darsakha's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, put down, get out of the lumber yard.
4071000	4075000	Get over here and check out this classic before you start a new game.
4075000	4079000	Darsakha, what did you choose for the classic game tonight?
4079000	4084000	I chose Chubby Cherub, which is stupid because it's not even a love game.
4084000	4087000	But I was like, Dan, pick a game that has a Valentine theme.
4087000	4091000	Chubby Cherub? I'm like, no, but it'll work.
4091000	4096000	So, Chubby Cherub was known in Japan as...
4096000	4099000	Sorry, here's the music. Sorry, I did the wrong part there.
4099000	4102000	It has cute music because it's a cute Bandai game.
4102000	4113000	But in Japan it was known as Obake no Kyutaro 1-1 Panic, which translates to Kyutaro the Ghost Bow-Wow Panic.
4113000	4117000	And I'm gonna stop there and tell you what Obake no Kyutaro is.
4117000	4127000	So, basically Obake no Kyutaro was a comic from like 1964 and then again in the 70s and it had a couple of anime series
4127000	4133000	about a ghost that likes to go around, scare people, and steal food.
4133000	4135000	And he's very, very afraid of dogs.
4135000	4139000	And he hangs out with some human kid.
4139000	4142000	I gotta look up the name again.
4142000	4146000	Named Shota. So, that's where that comes from.
4146000	4150000	In the US, of course, no one knows who Kyutaro is.
4150000	4159000	So, they remade the game into Chubby Cherub with a cute little naked blonde cherub baby running around.
4159000	4164000	Of course, with that old school 80s Bandai artwork.
4167000	4171000	Okay, maybe I'm an idiot, but I don't know a lot about this game.
4171000	4175000	I always thought it was a tongue-in-cheek reference to Chubby Checkers.
4175000	4177000	No. Nothing to do with it.
4177000	4182000	This whole time, I always thought Chubby Cherub was a silly little play on, you know, the famous, you know, from the 50s.
4182000	4183000	Chubby Checkers.
4183000	4184000	Come on, baby.
4184000	4185000	Yeah, and I thought...
4185000	4186000	Let's do that, please.
4186000	4188000	Exactly! Everybody knows that, right?
4188000	4189000	Yeah.
4189000	4190000	Oh my gosh.
4190000	4191000	Not Chubby Checker.
4191000	4197000	So, now that you stand corrected, you know, 30 years later...
4197000	4199000	I gotta be honest, though.
4199000	4200000	It's a stupid little game.
4200000	4205000	You know, I love and respect your opinions, DarkSakura, but this game kind of looks like shit.
4205000	4206000	It is shit.
4208000	4209000	But it's classic shit.
4211000	4214000	And it's like in Valentine's Day, and Dan picked...
4214000	4217000	Proof that Dan can pick a shitty game.
4217000	4222000	I would have thought that, you know, a good pick would have been Chulip, which is a kissing game.
4223000	4224000	Maybe next time.
4224000	4225000	I don't think that's even old enough.
4225000	4226000	It's 2002, actually.
4226000	4227000	Oh, maybe next time.
4227000	4228000	Maybe next time.
4229000	4230000	No, that's alright.
4230000	4231000	So, anyway...
4232000	4233000	This is the game, too, that...
4233000	4234000	Maybe we're gonna say it.
4234000	4235000	I'm sorry.
4235000	4236000	The misspelling.
4236000	4237000	Can I say that?
4237000	4238000	Do it.
4238000	4239000	The congratulation.
4239000	4241000	Because I actually see that on the screen right now.
4241000	4249000	Anyway, basically, to go back to the original game, Kyutaro's friends are kidnapped by burglars.
4249000	4251000	And so Kyutaro has to save them.
4251000	4256000	But there are many dogs in the way, and that's why I went back to say things about Kyutaro.
4257000	4260000	He is afraid of dogs.
4260000	4265000	So, basically, he has to cross 12 levels, and at the end of each, he's got a protagonist...
4265000	4267000	Wait, why did I say protagonist?
4267000	4268000	An antagonist.
4268000	4272000	A different, you know, fight he has to do.
4272000	4273000	He saves his friends.
4273000	4277000	And he eats food that keeps his flight up.
4277000	4281000	But if the flying meter goes all the way down, he'll have to stay on the ground and walk around.
4281000	4286000	And he can bark at the dogs before they bark at him.
4286000	4288000	And if his bark hits the character...
4288000	4292000	If the bark hits Kyutaro, then he dies.
4292000	4296000	There are heaven and hell stages.
4296000	4300000	So when he goes down on one of the stages when there's a down, he goes to hell.
4300000	4302000	And it's dark and he can't see anything and he can't fly.
4302000	4306000	Or when he touches a dog...
4306000	4309000	When he gets touched by a dog, it acts like a miss.
4309000	4312000	But it keeps going until he gets to the exit.
4312000	4315000	So, I mean, the game is, like, not very well put together.
4315000	4319000	The heaven stages basically are scrolling stages.
4319000	4323000	And he gets warped all the way through the levels.
4323000	4326000	So, anyway, like I said, it's not a very good game.
4326000	4332000	So, their main character is Kyutaro, or in the US, Chubby Cherub.
4332000	4335000	And they fly through the air or walk on the ground.
4335000	4338000	Flying has a meter, which, like I said, if it drops low, he has to walk around.
4338000	4343000	Lollipops give him the ability to shoot four shots at the dogs and other food replenishes the meter.
4343000	4352000	And it's funny, though, because the person who did Kyutaro was Huchiko Fujio.
4352000	4361000	And I think it's cool that the original artist for Kyutaro no Obake did the drawing of Chubby Cherub.
4361000	4364000	So that was pretty cool.
4365000	4367000	Beagles are the main enemies in the game.
4367000	4370000	They also have bulldogs. They're not very fast, but they bark a lot more.
4370000	4372000	Damn those bulldogs.
4372000	4373000	And there's cats.
4373000	4378000	Cats are really not so much of a threat, but they're pretty much impossible to get rid of.
4378000	4380000	They just kind of get in the way.
4380000	4381000	Yeah.
4381000	4382000	Meow, meow, meow.
4382000	4383000	As cats tend to do.
4383000	4384000	Yeah.
4384000	4386000	They're just kind of sitting there wanting to be fed.
4386000	4393000	This was listed as the 50th worst nest game of all time.
4394000	4399000	Sean Riley, the reviewer, said that the graphics were-
4399000	4400000	Is that Sean Baby?
4400000	4401000	I guess.
4401000	4404000	It might be. I just remember when that guy was everywhere.
4404000	4405000	Hold on. Yeah, Sean Baby.
4405000	4406000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
4406000	4412000	Described the game as ugly and that the cartridge was a waste of plastic and could be used for many other things.
4413000	4419000	So, thank you, Dan, for this suggestion of an awful game based-
4419000	4426000	That was a revamping of another really awful game based on an actually pretty cute manga series.
4427000	4430000	Well, what a shitty way to wish everybody a Valentine's Day.
4430000	4432000	Have a shitty Valentine's Day, everybody.
4432000	4435000	At least it didn't tell them to play Back to the Future.
4437000	4439000	That would be pretty bad.
4439000	4441000	I can't believe that this playthrough-
4441000	4443000	But it has really cute music.
4443000	4450000	It does have cute music for an 8-bit game, but I can't believe that this playthrough that this person's doing goes on for an hour and 20 minutes.
4450000	4453000	I would not be able to tolerate this for an hour and 20 minutes.
4453000	4457000	But then again, our tastes were so different back in the day on the NES, you know?
4457000	4460000	Like, repetitive games, it's all good.
4460000	4465000	You know what game that I actually- I haven't done a review of it yet, I think.
4465000	4468000	But it just used to piss me off so much because I'd play it for like 5 minutes and be like,
4468000	4471000	There's no end to this game ever, was MagMax.
4471000	4473000	Did you ever play that?
4473000	4474000	Oh, God.
4474000	4475000	Hated it.
4475000	4476000	Yeah.
4476000	4481000	But I would play it because I'd be like, I'm done with Dr. Mario and I'm gonna play MagMax.
4481000	4484000	And it was only when I was visiting my family in Dothan.
4485000	4488000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4488000	4490000	And you know what? Sometimes games are classically bad, okay?
4490000	4491000	You know what?
4491000	4492000	Chubby Cherub.
4492000	4498000	If I were to do, like, my Jamie explains you a thing podcast, I'm just gonna have this section that's called Game Shit.
4500000	4504000	Where it's gonna be- it's gonna have the GameStop logo on it, but it'll be Game Shit.
4505000	4507000	Or the Smashburger logo, you mean?
4507000	4510000	Whatever. Smashburger took it from- GameStop had it first.
4510000	4514000	No, I know. But you could do Game Shit while eating Smashburger.
4514000	4516000	No...
4517000	4520000	The problem is Smashburger doesn't accept my trades, so, you know.
4522000	4526000	I'm just- yeah, I'm gonna have a segment called Game Shit and Girl No.
4527000	4530000	Alright, we're gonna take a break, guys.
4530000	4535000	We have had a lot of show so far, but we've got plenty more to come, including when we come back for the quick break.
4535000	4544000	Rapid Fire News, we're gonna do, as well as talking about a potential sequel to a game I really didn't think was going to get a sequel, but it might.
4544000	4551000	And a very interesting movie and game tie-in, and then your calls as well over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
4551000	4558000	Or the old-fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR. We're also gonna get to your emails when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4565000	4573000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 631 for this February the 14th of 2016.
4573000	4580000	Happy Valentine's Day to all of our listeners, or, you know, Singles Awareness Day, whatever it is that you're celebrating out there, but hope you have a good day.
4580000	4581000	Happy Deadpool Weekend.
4581000	4582000	Happy what?
4582000	4583000	Happy Deadpool Weekend.
4583000	4587000	Happy Deadpool Weekend, which apparently is doing huge at the box office, from what I'm hearing, so.
4587000	4594000	But, you know, I feel bad because Alan and I did a really nice Valentine's Day dinner on Friday.
4594000	4598000	And then after that, he was like, well, so do you wanna go see a movie? He's like, I wanna go see Deadpool.
4598000	4604000	And I was like, ugh. Now, I wanna see, don't get me wrong, I wanna see Deadpool, but I don't wanna see it opening weekend with all the kids.
4604000	4605000	We're going tomorrow.
4605000	4613000	And all the frickin', you know, noisy teenagers. And I tell you about how I hate seeing movies with noisy teenagers, and you know there's gonna be a ton of them at Deadpool, so.
4613000	4614000	Well, you're such an old man now.
4614000	4616000	I really am. Damn those kids!
4616000	4619000	Except I'm the one who's having the old birthday, but oh well.
4619000	4627000	Whatever. But, hey, I'm looking forward to your birthday celebration, so I can't believe how fast this year is moving already. Crazy.
4627000	4634000	And, of course, I just keep wishing that the 2016 Angel of Death would go visit Ted Nugent.
4634000	4640000	You know. As long as you're getting rock stars, go after Ted.
4640000	4647000	Alright, look, let's move on. We gotta get some rapid fire news here in gaming, so let's start off with Loki.
4647000	4657000	Alright, so Sega, they're releasing a collection of their Sega 3D Classics as part of the Sega 3D Classics collection on 3DS.
4657000	4666000	And along with that, if you happen to be one of the first ones that purchases the game, you'll get some stickers!
4666000	4675000	So they're gonna have a decal sheet with, like, Mega Drive, Genesis, some weird bunny, which I have no fucking clue what that's supposed to be for.
4675000	4680000	I'm assuming something has to do with the Genesis and Mega Drive, but who knows.
4680000	4684000	But that's cool. And then, oh, here we go. It's probably gonna tell me right here.
4685000	4694000	Professor Asobin. I guess he was in the manual for the SG-1000.
4694000	4702000	Okay. Well, didn't know that. Cool. And, yeah. So when is that coming out? No fucking clue.
4702000	4709000	But soon, though. April 26th. $29.99. 3DS. Pick it up.
4710000	4717000	This is kinda cool. And I may have to plug my internet back in on my PlayStation 4, but Earth Defense Force 4.1 has some DLC out.
4717000	4721000	And the best part about it? It's free! For the first two weeks.
4721000	4729000	So with that, you're gonna get a couple missions. So they've got the Mission Pack 2 Extreme Battle and Time of the Mutants.
4729000	4737000	And that's gonna be 23 new missions. I guess 26 in the first add-on. And that's pretty awesome.
4737000	4741000	And after the two-week period, it's gonna be $10. So pick it up now.
4741000	4747000	And then finally, Mega Man is gonna be coming to Nintendo Badge Arcade.
4747000	4750000	Oh, yay. That shit.
4750000	4760000	So you can waste virtual currency getting badges for your 3DS if you really want to dump that money on that kind of stuff.
4760000	4766000	I still don't understand the point of that stuff. I really don't. And I know people that are really into it.
4766000	4772000	And it's like, I can't. I can't with that badge arcade thing on 3DS. It seems like the biggest waste of money.
4772000	4778000	But you know what? Spend your money. If it makes you happy, go for it. Go for it.
4778000	4784000	Alright, moving on. Let's talk about Pokemon. Because you know it is the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.
4784000	4789000	So Nintendo is rolling out lots of different celebrations for the Pokemons.
4789000	4795000	And Super Mario Maker is going to be getting some Pokemon-related content.
4795000	4803000	Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle, which as you may recall were the original three Pokemon before Pikachu and the cartoon and all that stuff.
4803000	4807000	And they had to do Pokemon Yellow. Those are the starter Pokemon.
4807000	4812000	There's an event course and you can unlock Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle costumes.
4812000	4819000	They are three separate costumes and they actually will provide retro sound effects when you complete courses and things like that.
4819000	4824000	Keep in mind, you know, if you want to get a Pikachu skin, there already is a Pikachu amiibo you can use to get it.
4824000	4830000	Or playing through the courses as many times as it takes to unlock it, you can do it that way.
4830000	4835000	My understanding is you have to actually beat this course three separate times to unlock each costume.
4835000	4838000	So that's kind of a neat little twist in that for what it is.
4839000	4843000	Speaking of Pokemon, a lot of people looking forward to Pokemon Go.
4843000	4850000	I have to admit, I was really nervous about Pokemon Go when I first heard about it.
4850000	4853000	But the more I think about it, the more excited I think I am for Pokemon Go.
4853000	4858000	But there's a lot of beta scams going on for Pokemon Go.
4858000	4865000	So there's been kind of a push to let people know that if you see a beta sign up out there for Pokemon Go, it's fake.
4865000	4872000	Now Niantic did say, Niantic of course, the developers of Ingress, which we've talked about also on this program before,
4872000	4876000	even though Niantic has said that there is going to be a closed beta that will take place in the winter,
4876000	4879000	they haven't really given any updates since then.
4879000	4887000	So my advice, if you see a Pokemon Go thing on Facebook that sounds too good to be true, it is.
4887000	4894000	Wait and look for something official to come from Niantic or to come from Nintendo themselves.
4894000	4899000	And you know when this news comes out, it will be all over Twitter.
4899000	4902000	It will be all over the gaming news sites.
4902000	4905000	Everybody's going to tell you about the official beta once it's out.
4905000	4908000	Niantic will say something under Google Plus and it will be out everywhere.
4908000	4916000	And also a couple of the Pokemon fan sites have said that there's indications that the game's release is going to be in mid-March anyway.
4916000	4919000	So I just found a post on it just a moment ago.
4919000	4925000	That would be great because I know not everybody knows the inner workings of Ingress necessarily unless you've played.
4925000	4930000	But a lot of people in Ingress are going to be getting a very important badge right at the end of this month.
4930000	4935000	It's a badge called Sojourner and it means that you have hacked every single day for an entire year.
4935000	4939000	And that's what they call a black Sojourner badge. You're going to get that at the end of February.
4939000	4940000	I'm not.
4940000	4942000	And I know, well, because you're newer to the game and so is Loki.
4942000	4948000	But when I know when I and I've been hacking every single freaking day and you better believe I looked up.
4948000	4952000	OK, when I go to Magfest, are there portals nearby? Am I going to be OK? Yes, I am.
4952000	4957000	Once I get that black Sojourner badge, it's going to be like relief.
4957000	4961000	Now I now I can now I can put the game away for a few days.
4961000	4965000	I can take a well-deserved vacation from Ingress until the bat phone goes off.
4965000	4969000	Rob, can you drop this link somewhere in the middle of nowhere?
4969000	4974000	Oh, OK. Anyway, I'm still looking forward to Pokemon Go.
4974000	4982000	Let's talk about Silent Hills. Yet again, the game that never was still continues to show up in the news somehow.
4982000	4985000	Like at least every month we have some damn story on Silent Hills.
4985000	4990000	But this is a pretty good one and it's a Twitter story, but it comes from Cliffy B.
4990000	4998000	And Cliffy B had tweeted earlier this week that Kojima once told me he wanted me to do a new Silent Hill with him together out of L.A.
4998000	5003000	I was flattered, but declined. And he replied when somebody asked him about it, saying,
5003000	5008000	I don't like L.A. I love new IPs and I would have fucked up Silent Hill.
5008000	5012000	So interesting that he confesses that I would have fucked it up.
5012000	5019000	You know what? He'd probably be actually pretty good about doing a new zone or was it a Zone of Enders game?
5019000	5022000	Because I think, you know, the combat and gears is pretty awesome.
5022000	5026000	And that's more of a combat focused game. I think pretty sweet. Right.
5026000	5031000	So, yeah. And then if you can imagine, he might have joined that Dream Team lineup.
5031000	5033000	I mean, this would have been a really kick ass game.
5033000	5037000	Maybe that's part of what was making it so damn expensive and why Konami pulled the plug on it.
5037000	5046000	I don't know. But then again, that would be trying to apply logic to a Konami 2015-2016 scenario, which I don't think is possible anymore.
5046000	5047000	So...
5047000	5048000	I just don't care anymore.
5048000	5049000	Yep.
5049000	5057000	And let's say the Onu DDR announcement, in which case I still don't care because it's probably going to be mobile or arcade game I'm never going to play.
5057000	5061000	Yeah. How about Dark Sakura? What do you have for us before we get to the Fugu question?
5061000	5064000	Well, there is Hatsune Miku news.
5064000	5070000	Basically, our favorite virtual idol is going to be going around with...
5071000	5075000	Anamanaguchi. I'm going to mispronounce this. Anamanaguchi.
5075000	5077000	Anamanaguchi. Yeah.
5078000	5079000	Anamanaguchi.
5079000	5080000	I'm a little gooey.
5080000	5083000	Just think of Anamanapia, but with Gucci at the end.
5083000	5084000	But without an O in it either.
5084000	5085000	Yeah.
5085000	5093000	So basically, the tour is going to start off in Seattle on April 23rd, right after my birthday if someone wants to take me to the San Francisco one.
5094000	5100000	And going to be going around with a really awesome chiptune band.
5100000	5105000	And she's got that makeover from Nomura, which is pretty cool too.
5105000	5113000	Future of the Final Fantasy All-Star Carnival has a teaser out and about.
5113000	5116000	It's going to be...
5116000	5117000	Is this an arcade game?
5117000	5118000	Yeah, it's an arcade game.
5119000	5122000	That's going to have two buttons and two joystick sliders.
5122000	5126000	And it will let you play across the country, of course, in Japan.
5126000	5134000	So you can enjoy the game with other people with cute little chibi versions of all your favorite characters.
5135000	5150000	And Zoe Quinn, which we know her for being a big icon with this whole, I guess, gamer gate deal, has dropped the harassment suit against her ex.
5152000	5163000	And she actually put out a statement that said, ironically, getting a restraining order against him was the least effective thing I could do in terms of getting him out of my life for good and for protecting myself.
5164000	5168000	When you seek charges, you're on trial as much as the other person, if not more.
5170000	5184000	And then she's also saying that there was the near impossibility of how to create a case for online harassment when basically all the people in the deciding capacity, they don't know how the internet works.
5184000	5193000	And one person told her to give up her career and stop going online if she didn't like the abuse, which is stupid, absolutely stupid.
5193000	5209000	She put out everything publicly, so it's basically done. But she says she's still going to work for trying to educate and reform so that the next person who experiences won't have the same thing happen to them.
5213000	5216000	Sometimes you're just done with bullshit.
5216000	5223000	Yeah, sometimes you just gotta say, I'm just cutting this fuck, I'm just severing this limb. I'm cutting this fuckery out of my life. Done.
5223000	5229000	Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we would be moving on to the FUGL Question of the Week.
5229000	5231000	Thanks for having a good home.
5235000	5242000	Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and google.com slash plus orange launch radio.
5242000	5247000	And we read some selected answers to a question that I forgot to post.
5249000	5250000	Oh, Rob.
5251000	5252000	Good job.
5253000	5265000	I was so busy preparing the clips and all that stuff for the announcement show tonight that I was like, I feel like I'm forgetting something. You ever have that feeling when you're like leaving the house, like I'm forgetting something, I'm leaving something at home?
5265000	5266000	Did I leave the stove on?
5266000	5268000	Yeah, did I leave the stove on?
5268000	5269000	Did I feed the cat?
5269000	5271000	Did I post the FUGL question?
5271000	5273000	Did I leave the stove on the cat?
5273000	5275000	Did I leave the cat on the stove?
5275000	5286000	Well, sg100matt in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com actually says, I thought you didn't put one up because of the delayed start due to the announcements between shows.
5286000	5289000	Yes, that is it. Thank you.
5289000	5293000	sg100matt, you read my mind. That is it.
5293000	5296000	That is why there is no FUGL question this week.
5296000	5297000	Alright, here it is.
5297000	5304000	No, I actually had thought of a question, so we're going to do this the Bill O'Reilly way, the classic YouTube clip.
5304000	5306000	Fuck it. We'll do it live.
5306000	5309000	So we're going to do a little bit of a live way of doing this in our chat room.
5309000	5312000	So, here's the question I was going to ask.
5312000	5323000	Since it is Valentine's Day, I wanted to know what is your favorite couple, romance, love story type of thing in a video game?
5323000	5327000	What's your favorite romance, love, awe?
5327000	5331000	And it could even be, I would say that a close friendship type of love.
5331000	5337000	It doesn't necessarily have to be like, you know, hearts in the eyes love, but it could be like a deep, deep friendship love too.
5337000	5340000	What is your favorite kind of love story in a video game?
5340000	5343000	So, if you guys want to answer in our chat room, I'll read some of those answers live.
5343000	5347000	What do you guys think? Loki, you're laughing over there. What is it?
5347000	5348000	Oh, Bobby.
5348000	5351000	What? Oh, God. Bobby. Oh, God. Bobby.
5351000	5357000	Over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Black Wolf says, Custer's Revenge.
5357000	5358000	It was a forbidden love.
5358000	5360000	Are you trying to get this show canceled?
5361000	5362000	Bobby Black Wolf.
5363000	5367000	That's not okay. That answer is, that is stricken from the list.
5369000	5374000	A Dark Sakura. I have a feeling I know where you might go with this, but I'm going to ask anyway.
5374000	5377000	Favorite romance in a game? Favorite romance story?
5377000	5379000	Getting boned by Cullen on a table.
5380000	5381000	That's pretty romantic.
5381000	5384000	For Dragon Age, right? Or Dragon Age Inquisition specifically.
5384000	5393000	All the Garris romance. I mean, I like that our games these days, you know, give us the option for who we want to romance and how we want to romance them.
5393000	5399000	And then how much crying we want to do at the end when, I'm sorry, not Solas. I'm not going to talk about Dragon Age.
5399000	5411000	But, you know, if you have your classic games where it was written into the story, there was, and I took it as a full on canon romance, was Selleys and Locke in Final Fantasy 6 slash 3.
5411000	5418000	You know what? My answer actually, it's funny you bring up the Final Fantasy series because my answer, not to totally cut you off, but I'm just piggybacking on it.
5418000	5428000	My answer would be from Final Fantasy 4, Cecil and Rosa. I mean that, I mean, and that was like growing up as a kid when it was Final Fantasy 2 to me.
5428000	5434000	That was like one of the first games I really remember having such a rich story. And I think that's why I'm so attached to it.
5434000	5443000	But that, you know, love plot that went in between Cecil and Rosa, that's always going to be like, they're my, what do they call it? It's my original OTP. What do they call that?
5443000	5444000	It's your OTP.
5444000	5445000	Yeah.
5445000	5446000	One True Pairing.
5446000	5453000	One True Pairing. That's it. That's my OTP. In video games, it's Cecil and Rosa. Sorry, Dr. Stalker, I didn't mean to cut you off. Did you have a further thought with what you were saying?
5453000	5457000	See now the love theme is in my head from the Celtic Moon CD.
5457000	5465000	Oh, good call because that actually had a romance theme that went, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
5465000	5466000	Yeah.
5466000	5472000	The Celtic Moon version was wild cats sing the Final Fantasy 4 soundtrack.
5472000	5482000	And anywho, even though Final Fantasy 8 was not the best of games, I will say that it did like Leon and What's Your Fuck.
5483000	5494000	Actually, no, I'm going to take that back. I'm going to take that back. As much as I liked Rinoa, I really, really liked Mr. Annoying, Tidus, and Yuna.
5494000	5495000	Yeah.
5495000	5502000	Especially the reunion, if you got the good ending for 10-2, because what can I do for you?
5504000	5508000	That was, you know, that was like the Final Fantasy series and a whole other cinematic level.
5508000	5510000	I bawled my freaking eyes out when I saw the ending.
5510000	5511000	Yeah.
5511000	5521000	And then like the whole, you know, the fact that she's going through the whole game based on having seen a glimpse that he might still be around.
5521000	5528000	You know, it's just a thing that, you know, just because the person in your life is gone doesn't mean that you stop loving them.
5528000	5531000	You know, for her and not all intents and purposes, he died.
5531000	5532000	Yeah.
5532000	5539000	But that doesn't mean that you still might seek things that remind you of them or, you know, keep that memory alive for you.
5539000	5542000	And that was really what got me about 10-2.
5542000	5547000	You know, just riding this Final Fantasy wave because, you know, when the stories are done right, they're right.
5547000	5554000	But I will say without, I mean, honestly, this is a how many year old game at this point. I have total license to spoil this game.
5554000	5560000	But Final Fantasy 13, without saying too much, you know, and talking about, I said the relationships don't necessarily have to be romantic, right?
5560000	5564000	What about the relationship between Lightning and her sister Sarah in that game?
5564000	5565000	Yeah, totally.
5565000	5574000	And then the ending of that game. And then I would argue in that game, and I've talked about, I've alluded to this before, but I didn't get into such spoiler territory.
5574000	5582000	I would say Fang and Vanille, if they weren't having a romantic relationship, they definitely had a deep love for each other.
5582000	5590000	And like all those, and then you have the Saz and his son, there's so many different love subplots in the game that like the ending of that game.
5590000	5599000	And I've said this before, the ending of Final Fantasy 13 specifically, I think because so many people poo-pooed that game because it was running down a giant hallway.
5599000	5604000	A lot of people didn't get to the ending, but the ending for that game is short, but perfect.
5604000	5614000	I mean, it is, I love the ending. And it's also one of those cases where I think the US, where they actually put in the US music because they had the Leona Lewis song, was perfect.
5614000	5617000	It really was. I love 13's ending.
5617000	5622000	What about the type of, what's a good word I'm thinking of, dutiful love?
5622000	5623000	A bromance.
5623000	5627000	Not a bromance. Where like Snake and Big Boss.
5627000	5630000	Oh, okay. Okay.
5630000	5635000	Or not Big Boss Snake and whoever, what was her name? God, I can't remember now.
5635000	5644000	But I'd almost say that when you have someone that you look up to that much, it's a type of love all on its own.
5644000	5652000	It goes beyond respect. It's almost like a parental love, if that makes sense.
5652000	5658000	You know, and funny enough, Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vonganetwork.com says, does it have to be male and female?
5658000	5662000	The Japanese game makers then tend to sneak in some male on male stuff.
5662000	5667000	No, I mean, you're asking a gay host of a video game podcast if it has to be male and female?
5667000	5671000	No, I think love is all different types of forms and genders and everything.
5671000	5676000	I think you, not you, ActDeafed, I think that you actually missed me correcting myself.
5676000	5677000	So, whatever.
5677000	5679000	It's delayed, don't forget.
5679000	5691000	Yeah. Anyway, I'm just trying to think of, because I, the term bromance, I hate, and I'm going to stop and take a quick rant.
5691000	5692000	Oh, dear.
5692000	5693000	Quick rant.
5694000	5705000	I hate shipping in some cases, because they will take characters who have a very good, close friendship.
5705000	5711000	You know, I would even say that the friendship that borders on romantic or has romantic elements.
5711000	5718000	But, you know, just because there are two characters who have that deep and abiding thing, they got to be fucking.
5718000	5720000	No, they don't have to be.
5720000	5721000	They don't have to be.
5721000	5727000	It's because deep down inside, a lot of people really like porn, Dark Sakura.
5727000	5729000	And so, for some people.
5729000	5732000	It's over sexualizing in society.
5732000	5733000	I know.
5733000	5734000	You know, two people.
5734000	5735000	Well, I mean.
5735000	5738000	It doesn't take two people to over sexualize, though, either.
5738000	5745000	Well, I mean, I'm just saying, like, you know, there are even those deep friendships, you know, in our history, like Eleanor Roosevelt.
5745000	5755000	And my brain is not working history right now, but they wrote themselves, wrote a wonderful loving letters back and forth.
5755000	5758000	Yet now people saying, were they lesbian lovers?
5758000	5759000	No.
5759000	5760000	When did they meet up and scissor?
5760000	5762000	That's what people want to know, right?
5762000	5764000	No, I get it.
5764000	5765000	I get it.
5765000	5774000	Because by what you're saying, essentially, is that when people make these things about sex, it is invalidating that people can have a romantic relationship.
5774000	5776000	A romantic relationship that doesn't involve sex.
5776000	5777000	Exactly. Exactly that.
5777000	5778000	I get it. I get it.
5778000	5782000	And I mean, and there even is, you know, for like for the ace people out there, right?
5782000	5786000	You can the type of.
5786000	5789000	Well, it doesn't even have to be about like for me.
5789000	5791000	Sorry, it doesn't even have to be about asexuality.
5791000	5792000	I mean, it can be.
5792000	5797000	But like, you know, like for I can love a woman and still be comfortably gay.
5797000	5809000	No, I mean, my my point is not necessarily like even an ace person will have a person, you know, can have a person that they are deeply in love with, you know, like their romantic partner.
5809000	5810000	Right.
5810000	5815000	Even if they have no interest in sleeping with them, that's still a different thing than a romantic friendship.
5815000	5816000	Does that make sense?
5816000	5817000	Yeah.
5817000	5819000	It's a different kind of romance.
5819000	5829000	Just because two people love each other, it doesn't mean that they want to be in an eternal relationship and cohabitate and, you know, look at adopting cats together.
5829000	5834000	But you know that Mario and Peach are fucking and toad watches, right?
5834000	5836000	All right.
5836000	5837000	Anyway.
5837000	5843000	Pons006 in chat suggests bromance, Ken and Ryu.
5843000	5845000	SSG100 Matt, interesting.
5845000	5848000	Top Gun was a dude movie back in the day.
5848000	5851000	Now people think that it's a gay themed movie.
5851000	5852000	Top Gun.
5852000	5856000	Thank you Cards Against Humanity for the sexually charged volleyball montage.
5856000	5858000	You know what? That was around before Cards Against Humanity.
5858000	5859000	I know, I know, I know.
5859000	5860000	All right.
5860000	5862000	We didn't we didn't get an answer from Loki.
5862000	5866000	What's your OTP for video games when it comes to romance and all that?
5866000	5870000	Probably the Heterolife partners of Sam and Max.
5870000	5873000	Because they're insane.
5873000	5877000	Of course, a Jay and Silent Bob style relationship.
5877000	5878000	Absolutely.
5878000	5879000	Heterolife mate.
5879000	5880000	Yeah, exactly.
5880000	5882000	I think that's awesome.
5882000	5887000	You got some laughs from our chat over there over at live.voggenetwork.com.
5887000	5888000	Sam and Max.
5888000	5891000	Or like, uh, Klonoa and Q-Pal.
5891000	5895000	They were, you know, they were just, they were buds.
5895000	5896000	They were buds.
5896000	5897000	That's right.
5897000	5898000	All right.
5898000	5899000	There you go.
5899000	5902000	Our impromptu foogle question of the week there.
5902000	5904000	And I apologize to our fan communities there.
5904000	5907000	But I will be more diligent about posting that in the future.
5907000	5910000	When I'm not trying to multitask hopefully next week.
5910000	5912000	Or two weeks from now because there is no show next week.
5912000	5914000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5914000	5917000	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
5917000	5918000	Let's get back into some other news.
5918000	5919000	Loki.
5919000	5924000	So apparently there is evidence that there is going to be a sequel to Knack coming out.
5924000	5925000	And this is coming from...
5925000	5926000	Why?
5926000	5930000	Because, I don't know.
5930000	5934000	It's a first party title and they wanted to, you know, give it another shot.
5934000	5936000	Maybe, you know, more people like it now.
5936000	5937000	You never know.
5937000	5943000	But this is coming from a LinkedIn resume for Mindy Liang.
5943000	5949000	And she's an animator basically crediting different things she's worked on.
5950000	5951000	So Knack 2 is listed there.
5951000	5954000	Animated 3D character motions and cutscenes for PlayStation 4.
5954000	5956000	Including a screenshot.
5956000	5961000	And so there's a screenshot of a Knack like character on fire.
5961000	5964000	So maybe that's something we're going to see.
5964000	5970000	And hey, if you want to check out Knack it's only $8 right now on sale until the 15th I think.
5970000	5974000	I'm really surprised they still haven't made that a PlayStation Plus game.
5974000	5975000	I'm surprised too.
5975000	5976000	And maybe they will.
5976000	5978000	Probably the month before Knack 2 comes out.
5978000	5982000	Well, I don't think the month before but maybe like if they announce it during E3 or something
5982000	5985000	they'll put it out for like, you know, free.
5985000	5986000	To build hype a little bit.
5986000	5987000	Yeah, I mean it does.
5987000	5988000	I don't think it was a terrible game.
5988000	5992000	It's just maybe not one people are necessarily interested in.
5992000	5993000	Maybe.
5993000	5995000	And who's to say they can't fix it?
5995000	6000000	Just because one game is bad doesn't mean the next one's going to be like terrible as well.
6000000	6001000	That's true.
6001000	6005000	I mean there are other games out there where the first one maybe wasn't so great
6005000	6007000	and the second one greatly improved on it.
6007000	6012000	Of course I can't think of any in the moment but I know it's happened before in games where the sequel really...
6012000	6013000	Well, okay.
6013000	6017000	Some would argue, I don't know if I necessarily agree with this, but some would argue Mega Man.
6017000	6021000	Mega Man 2 outshined the original in many different ways.
6021000	6025000	But see, the difference is I don't think the original Mega Man was a bad game at all.
6025000	6028000	Dance Dance Revolution, Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix.
6028000	6029000	Okay.
6029000	6030000	Or Beat Mania 2DX.
6030000	6034000	Only got better with Beat Mania 2DX way better than the original Beat Mania.
6034000	6037000	So there are some games that age very well.
6037000	6039000	Oh, you never know.
6039000	6040000	Alright, anyhow.
6040000	6044000	Let's move on to somewhat of a sadder announcement.
6044000	6048000	We have another gaming industry closure to talk about this week.
6048000	6054000	And that is the website GameTrailers.com closed its doors after 13 years this week.
6054000	6057000	Which, hmm, that means...
6057000	6059000	That's shitty.
6059000	6061000	They also started in 2002.
6061000	6063000	And we started in 2002.
6063000	6065000	And we outlived them.
6065000	6067000	Which I'm not saying that to be a bitch.
6067000	6070000	I'm just saying it's kind of humbling in a way.
6070000	6073000	But yeah, Game Trailers unfortunately is shut down after 13 years.
6073000	6079000	And what was kind of shitty about it is that they were just told in the news the day it happened.
6079000	6081000	They were given no notice.
6081000	6083000	Just that the lights went off, basically.
6083000	6086000	And so you had a lot of very confused people posting on Twitter.
6086000	6091000	Now, it should be noted, you know, Viacom sold it off a year ago.
6091000	6094000	And I think it went to a company that didn't really know what to do with it.
6094000	6097000	So they kind of just ran it into the ground, unfortunately.
6097000	6101000	That doesn't mean the people working there were pretty talented.
6101000	6109000	I distinctly remember as of recently, there's a clip going around from this past year's E3.
6109000	6111000	And it was from Game Trailer.
6111000	6115000	And it was four individuals on the panel.
6115000	6117000	One gal and three men.
6117000	6120000	And it's kind of like a reaction video.
6120000	6124000	They're reacting to the press conference and the Final Fantasy VII Remake.
6124000	6130000	I swear, all these dudes are breaking down and crying while the girl's kind of watching and laughing at them.
6130000	6135000	They're crying at the Final Fantasy VII Remake and then Shenmue 3.
6135000	6141000	And they're literally dancing and cheering and they're acting like kids.
6141000	6144000	And I say that in a very positive way.
6144000	6148000	I think a lot of us were kind of feeling that watching that press conference this year.
6148000	6154000	So I just know that's a recent Game Trailers thing that they've done very recently that was very well received out there.
6154000	6158000	Unfortunately, one moment like that wasn't really enough to carry the website.
6158000	6162000	Especially when Game Trailers kind of founded itself on, well, providing Game Trailers.
6162000	6164000	When there was no YouTube.
6164000	6167000	When there wasn't really a way to get video on demand.
6167000	6170000	When trailers weren't built into the damn consoles.
6170000	6175000	Unfortunately, Game Trailers didn't really evolve the way it needed to.
6175000	6178000	And they lost a lot of visitors as a result.
6178000	6182000	But hopefully the talent there will be able to bounce back and find new work quickly.
6182000	6185000	Kind of shitty that they got no notice.
6185000	6187000	They really got no explanation either.
6187000	6191000	They're just kind of left to figure out what happened.
6191000	6193000	Anyway, let's move on.
6193000	6195000	DarkSagra.
6195000	6198000	Well, sorry.
6198000	6200000	It's a deep word.
6200000	6203000	Yeah. Well, I was actually reading the email.
6204000	6207000	The FBI.
6207000	6209000	They suck.
6209000	6214000	Well, and what I mean by suck is they actually suck at creating games.
6214000	6218000	Or whoever they hired to make the game sucked at making the game.
6218000	6221000	So they made a game that's called Don't Be a Puppet.
6221000	6225000	And it's to encourage teens to think for themselves.
6225000	6232000	And display a healthy skepticism as they come across anyone who appears to be advocating extremist violence.
6232000	6237000	But yeah, it's pretty much a crappy game you play as a goat.
6237000	6239000	And not a very well designed goat.
6239000	6247000	So basically, the lesson learned from this game is hire a better designer or FBI.
6247000	6252000	So basically, they are as good making video games as PETA.
6252000	6256000	Which is not very good because I've played the PETA game.
6256000	6260000	I actually have that on my Playstation 4 and it's fucking terrible.
6260000	6262000	That's right! I forgot they put out a game on Playstation 4.
6262000	6264000	It's fucking terrible.
6264000	6266000	I just remember like so super...
6266000	6268000	Okay, because PETA is fucking terrible.
6268000	6270000	Super Tofu Boy and all that stuff that they do.
6270000	6274000	But you're saying that their games may actually be of a better quality than the FBI's games?
6274000	6276000	Maybe.
6276000	6280000	Alright. Let's move on. Loki.
6280000	6283000	So this is kind of cool. This is also from some tweets.
6283000	6286000	They're talking about DLC. Not too far off for Fallout 4.
6286000	6288000	Probably something they're going to announce at E3.
6288000	6290000	You know, a couple tweets from Bethesda Game Studios.
6290000	6293000	We know you're ready to learn what's coming for Fallout 4 DLC.
6293000	6295000	We're not far off and we think you'll be excited.
6295000	6298000	Which I'm assuming also E3.
6298000	6302000	Also, they're going to be doing a complete overhaul on the Fallout 4 survival mode.
6302000	6304000	Food, sleep, diseases, danger, and more.
6304000	6307000	So that'll be a tweet that's coming out as well.
6307000	6311000	They're also saying that there's going to be a $30 season pass.
6311000	6315000	So it'll save you $10 on the DLC.
6315000	6318000	So I'll be interested to see what it is.
6318000	6321000	I don't know. I played a lot more of it this week.
6321000	6324000	I'm down.
6324000	6327000	I definitely need to play some Fallout 4.
6327000	6328000	You do.
6328000	6330000	I keep waiting for Alan to buy it.
6330000	6333000	Just get it on console. I mean, you play on PC.
6333000	6336000	I don't think that Dan's actually playing or a copy if you want to play the PS4 one.
6336000	6338000	Ooh, yeah. I'd totally be down with that.
6338000	6339000	I'll ask him if he can borrow it.
6339000	6341000	Sweet.
6341000	6343000	Then I don't have to pay for it. Awesome.
6343000	6347000	Alright. Let's talk about World of Warcraft, believe it or not.
6347000	6353000	If you have yet to be sucked into the World of Warcraft, you may get your opportunity when you go to see the Warcraft movie.
6353000	6355000	Assuming you're going to go see the Warcraft movie.
6355000	6356000	See, now here's the thing.
6356000	6362000	I figured most people that were going to go see the Warcraft movie were World of Warcraft players.
6362000	6370000	But in order for this movie to be successful, they're going to need to do a good job of appealing to people who don't play World of Warcraft.
6370000	6372000	How about the people that actually liked Warcraft?
6373000	6380000	There's people that see movies that don't read books for those said movies, so maybe it's not reading the book.
6380000	6386000	And on top of that, I know a lot of people who hated World of Warcraft that love Warcraft and vice versa.
6386000	6390000	You can still love the lore and hate the game. For sure.
6390000	6399000	But anyway, apparently Blizzard is considering offering World of Warcraft free for people that have their ticket stubs to the Warcraft movie.
6399000	6407000	There's apparently a World of Warcraft Ultimate Movie Edition that will have the MMO and all expansions besides the newest one, Legion, that's not even out yet.
6407000	6413000	That will be included at no cost and there will be one month of game time that will be free on the house.
6413000	6420000	Apparently it has been confirmed on Reddit. This is something that's going to happen when Warcraft hits theaters on June 10th.
6421000	6433000	With World of Warcraft, Legion is supposed to be out before September 21st, but a lot of people are speculating they're going to launch Legion around the time of the movie to try to get the hype train rolling for Warcraft.
6433000	6443000	But again, to reiterate, I think if they don't do a good job pushing this movie, it's a given that most hardcore Warcraft players are going to make time to see this movie.
6443000	6449000	But they need to be able to convince other people that aren't familiar with the source material to be able to see this and the movie is not going to be successful.
6449000	6452000	So it will be very interesting to see how they market it and so on.
6452000	6461000	So it would make sense that if somebody who had no idea what Warcraft was about enjoys the movie, decides to play World of Warcraft.
6461000	6468000	And I said for a long time on Horde House, World of Warcraft, Summit version of it ought to be free anyway.
6468000	6474000	Yes, I'm aware of the one that they have where you can play up to level 20, but let's be real, you can't do shit up to level 20.
6474000	6481000	They should really just give base Warcraft away for free and do nothing but charge the subscription fee.
6481000	6486000	If they want to keep gold spammers out or whatever, then fine, charge the subscription fee or whatever.
6486000	6493000	I don't understand why they're still charging for base Warcraft. I think the price of entry is too high.
6493000	6496000	Because people know they've got to buy the game and they've got to pay a monthly fee on top of it.
6496000	6500000	So this just makes logical sense to me. I don't know.
6500000	6506000	Alright. Let's move on. Oh, I want to mention this real quick too.
6506000	6510000	Blizzard also hit their 25 year anniversary this week, believe it or not.
6510000	6514000	Blizzard has been around for 25 years, so they celebrated that little birthday this week.
6514000	6519000	Congrats. Let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.
6519000	6523000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6523000	6527000	DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and picks the email she's going to read on air.
6528000	6530000	Got my tongs ready.
6530000	6533000	I was going to say last week I think we complained about not getting a lot of emails.
6533000	6536000	We got quite the response because of it, right? We have a lot of emails tonight, right?
6536000	6537000	Yeah.
6537000	6539000	Alright, let's get to it.
6539000	6543000	This comes from Robert M. Again, this is likely a topic you've already covered in the announcement.
6543000	6551000	But I am somewhat obsessive over the VoG network metagame and entering the podcast code words.
6551000	6556000	Though I freely admit I could be and should be doing more to participate beyond that.
6556000	6560000	Since the program started, two shows whose codes are tracked on the site,
6560000	6562000	USL and Hoard House, have sunsetted.
6562000	6566000	Will any of the new shows be using the password system?
6566000	6573000	Not, of course, that I would make that my sole reason to subscribe or not subscribe to any of VoG's podcasts.
6574000	6580000	Great question. Admittedly, any show on VoG is able to do this.
6580000	6585000	And I think it's just been a while before we've kind of approached the shows going who's on board and who wants to do this.
6585000	6590000	So I don't really have a definitive answer for you on that now.
6590000	6594000	But we probably are going to re approach the shows in the network and say, hey, who's interested in doing it?
6594000	6599000	And then take it from there. So we'll see who signs on for that.
6599000	6603000	I think the gamification is fun and it's part of what makes VoG a little different.
6603000	6610000	And, you know, yeah, and I agree, it kind of stinks that two of the shows that were doing it have unfortunately sunsetted for various reasons.
6610000	6615000	But it happens. VoG has been around for a few years now, so shows are going to come and shows are going to go.
6615000	6619000	So I hope to have an update for you on that in the future.
6619000	6622000	But at this time with the new shows, there's nothing yet.
6622000	6628000	I will say, though, that the new shows are all three of them going to premiere on VoG network.
6628000	6632000	You hear them here first before they actually hit the podcast feed.
6632000	6634000	So be ready for it.
6634000	6638000	Good morning, which is not morning for us, but oh well.
6639000	6647000	When the weather is stagnant in the Salt Lake City valley for a lengthy amount of time, air pollution that is emitted from many various resources has no way of clearing out.
6647000	6658000	As a result, the air pollution congregates, accumulates and just plain sits in the air above the valley, eventually creating what is called an inversion, which is a cute way of saying smog.
6658000	6661000	By the way, the title of this is God damn it, I'm a video game.
6661000	6670000	When these small conditions exist, not only is the sky overcast in a way that is visually depressing, a light haze settles in near the ground.
6670000	6679000	This isn't like the fog that you'd see in London, but the kind of like the light haze you see in certain survival horror video games franchise,
6679000	6685000	developed by a certain company that has earned much scorn for its preference of slot machines over Snake.
6685000	6689000	On Wednesday morning, such conditions existed in the Salt Lake Valley.
6689000	6696000	On Wednesday morning, I looked out of my window and thought to myself, if I hear a high pitched whale come out of my radio, I'm getting the fuck out of here.
6696000	6702000	Has this ever happened to you? Have you ever looked around at whatever environment you find yourself in and thought, God damn it, I'm in a video game.
6702000	6704000	Stay black or entertainment.
6704000	6708000	And don't you know, if you hear the whale on the radio, it's already too late. You're not getting out.
6708000	6710000	Just beware of the sirens.
6710000	6716000	I was going to say, there are definitely places that remind me of scary video games and Silent Hill.
6716000	6721000	And I've even texted Shane before. I think I'm in Silent Hill right now. Like I've sent him texts like that.
6721000	6723000	I do that all the time. So yeah.
6723000	6731000	Now when, this is before Silent Hill was out, but I mean, what was funny is that when I lived in Alabama,
6731000	6738000	we had this little Grove that was outside the dorms and it would get super foggy and we'd play hide and seek in the fog, which is pretty fun.
6738000	6745000	The first time I saw Silent Hill, I was like, Oh, Hey, it's like when I was in college. So it was sort of the reverse for that.
6745000	6754000	Anyway. So moving forward, this is from...
6754000	6759000	I'll just say though, until I see the world in pixels, though, I don't think I'm ever going to say I think I'm in Minecraft.
6759000	6762000	I don't think that's one that's ever going to come to mind.
6762000	6764000	So this is from AZHP. It's kind of long.
6765000	6770000	Hey, well, our crew AZHP here. I haven't been writing in lately because I've listened to every episode.
6770000	6775000	Just wanted to let you know that even though we quiet people don't say anything, we're here and we listen.
6775000	6776000	Smiley!
6776000	6779000	Appreciate it. I know that's true. Thank you.
6779000	6786000	So several years ago, there was an indie film called The FP, which revolved around post-apocalyptic Frasier Park.
6786000	6789000	No, I know what they're talking about.
6789000	6791000	He talked about that movie on a show.
6791000	6793000	I haven't watched it though.
6793000	6796000	A tiny burb just north of the grapevine on I-5 in California.
6796000	6800000	And the turf wars over the only liquor store in town.
6800000	6806000	What made the movie special was that the turf wars were fought using the ancient sport of beat beat revelation.
6806000	6812000	All of my DDR friends and even some of the people who never touched a dance pad in their life loved the movie.
6812000	6817000	It was really well written for the tiny budget they had and we all wanted to see more.
6817000	6823000	Apparently the creator also wanted to see more because the film was a flop financially.
6823000	6832000	Though a cult success among the nichest of video game players, he's had to do random movie gigs just to stay afloat these last few years.
6832000	6840000	But DDR and the FP was his passion and he really wants to see his new script be made reality and I want to help him do it.
6840000	6847000	He started an Indiegogo campaign to raise the money to make this movie the best star movie about smashy arrows it can possibly be.
6847000	6851000	As indies who got your start with DDR as well.
6851000	6857000	I hope you all can sympathize with an indie visionary's plight and help spread the word.
6857000	6864000	You can find the campaign by searching for Beats of Rage The FP Part 2 on Google.
6865000	6874000	And if you have never heard of the original movie before the FP can be rented on Amazon video for just four dollars or bought on Amazon or iTunes for 10.
6874000	6881000	You have plenty of time to you'll have plenty of time to see if you enjoy the original movie before kicking in for the new one.
6881000	6886000	As of this writing February 11th there are two months left in the campaign.
6886000	6892000	The creator's brother was actually the cinematographer for quite a few Hollywood productions like Nick Cage's Ghost Rider.
6892000	6899000	So the actual filmography is pretty darn good. It's definitely a good weekend slash sorry weekend drinking slash party movie.
6899000	6904000	So grab Shane and a few bottles of wine and make an I don't think you'll regret it.
6904000	6911000	You OK. Side note. Yeah. I found the bottle of shining Blanc that you gave me years ago and I opened it.
6911000	6915000	Did you drink it was still delicious. It's in my fridge right now. That's awesome. OK.
6915000	6919000	Anyway I hope you don't mind me asking you to spread the word on this movie.
6919000	6926000	I've had annual viewings of this movie at my house for the last years a few years and we've never we never get tired of it.
6926000	6932000	I don't have any stake in this financially. I just really love this movie and DDR and want to see a new movie come out of it.
6932000	6939000	Sorry for the long email and thanks for reading. Once again you can find the campaign by searching for beats of rage the FP part 2 on Google.
6939000	6943000	And there's the URL which I will copy into the chat room. Yours truly is HP.
6943000	6953000	P.S. I listen to your podcast in my new cart and for some reason it tries to override album art with whatever it finds when it searches for the artist's name of its album art database.
6953000	6958000	Here's what it gives me whenever I put an in line image.
6958000	6963000	I'll let Rob paint a picture with his words but like to imagine this is what you all look like when you record this podcast.
6963000	6966000	If you scroll down you can see the attachment that has the image and I did look at it.
6966000	6973000	I was like what the hell? Which is weird because we put album art inside every episode.
6973000	6980000	I have to do that manually in iTunes so I forget once in a great while but usually the album art should be in there.
6980000	6987000	So it's weird that you're I'd be curious what you're using to listen to podcasts because I wonder why it's still going out to get album art even though we put it in there.
6987000	6993000	That's weird. Anyway real quick though about the movie. That's awesome that you have the passion for that and you know what?
6993000	7001000	It's expensive enough to do the podcast that we do. I can only imagine how expensive and how excruciating it is to do a movie.
7001000	7007000	So I'll say this much. I don't know how accessible those guys are but I'll email them and see if we can get them on the show.
7007000	7012000	I think they'll be hilarious. We'll talk DDR stories. See what happens. I'll let you know.
7012000	7016000	Okay well I also put the link in the chatroom. I couldn't get the image up but I'll just look at it later.
7016000	7017000	It's okay.
7017000	7021000	Come on there we go. So this one's labeled commercials.
7022000	7023000	Okay.
7023000	7025000	Does the email get a load? And it's by YYR.
7025000	7026000	Yay.
7026000	7033000	Hello LR. In last week's and last episode's kickoff topic you guys discussed video game commercials once again.
7033000	7037000	My favorite of these is actually little known and generally not well remembered.
7037000	7045000	I can't remember if these ran on Saturday mornings or weekend afternoons but back in the days of the NES I saw this ad several times.
7045000	7049000	It was for a game I'd never heard of anywhere else called Mendel Palace.
7050000	7056000	The game was developed by Game Freak, the same Game Freak that would later develop Pokemon, and published in North America by Hudson Soft.
7056000	7063000	Its advertisement was different from most others you might remember. Around ten whole seconds of it consisted of gameplay footage.
7063000	7071000	I never understood why so many video game ads over the years showed little or no footage of actual gameplay from the games they were supposedly advertising.
7071000	7077000	Because usually they look like shit on TV. But I remember this ad actually. I remember Mendel Palace.
7077000	7083000	Sega's ads for Dreamcast games were absolutely awful in this regard. Most ads contained only a few seconds of footage or less.
7083000	7088000	On the other hand, Mendel Palace looked so interesting to me that I specifically sought it out.
7088000	7092000	All these years later it has remained one of my favorite NES games of all time.
7092000	7097000	It's a sort of action puzzle game where you need to eliminate the enemies on the screen to move forward.
7097000	7099000	And the enemies come in many different types.
7100000	7103000	Similarly to Bubble Bobble, but with a different style of action.
7103000	7108000	I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys arcade style action games and I hope some of you check it out.
7108000	7112000	And there's a link to the commercial which I will put in the chat room as well.
7114000	7119000	I suppose I haven't mentioned it previously, but multitasking is now out on Xbox Live Indie games.
7119000	7123000	Next stop, Steam Greenlight, and I hope to be on there by MAGFest.
7123000	7125000	Well I know what I'm gonna buy soon.
7125000	7127000	Alright, I know what I'm doing later.
7127000	7130000	Oh, and the new yyrgames.com has launched.
7130000	7135000	Go there and play Pixel Poops if you want to be on the brand new Super Poopers leaderboard.
7137000	7142000	Super Pooper, Taco Bell's gonna blind me. I don't know, that's all I got.
7142000	7144000	By the way, did you see the thing that I linked you?
7144000	7145000	Yes, I did.
7145000	7146000	That was pretty cool.
7146000	7147000	Anyway.
7147000	7148000	Okay, to tell people.
7148000	7150000	Which literally none of the listeners know what you're talking about.
7150000	7155000	There's a singer who has a big band orchestra that covers popular hits.
7155000	7159000	But he sings like the old 20s and 30s style warbler, so it's pretty cool.
7159000	7161000	It was a little weird, but it was cool.
7161000	7165000	It's like Max something. Anyway, I'll look up later. For all of y'all.
7165000	7171000	I will mention that I was asked whether I wanted to be notified if a spot opened up in the MAGFest Indie Showcase at the last second.
7171000	7175000	I said yes, but at this point I'm assuming I will not be a part of it.
7175000	7179000	Despite this, I hope to see some of you at MAGFest anyway.
7179000	7184000	It's a fantastic experience, and if I don't get to show games, it just means I'll have more time to play them.
7184000	7187000	Happy Valentine's Day, and have fun. Aaron Yyr.
7187000	7190000	Well, thank you very much for the email.
7190000	7195000	I look forward to seeing you at MAGFest, for sure.
7195000	7198000	I don't even think my Xbox 360 is hooked up right now.
7198000	7203000	I really wish Indie Games somehow was backwards compatible on Xbox One.
7203000	7207000	I know I'm asking for a lot, but whatever.
7207000	7210000	That's exciting, though, about the Steam Greenlight.
7210000	7212000	I'll be looking for that.
7212000	7214000	Okay, we have one more email.
7214000	7215000	Alrighty.
7215000	7222000	Okay. Hello, OLR. This email is addressed to Rob in reactions to what he said last week.
7222000	7224000	In regards to what he said last week.
7224000	7230000	This concerns what I can honestly say is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever happened upon, and that is Undertale.
7230000	7233000	Yeah, I know, I hear his eyes rolling already.
7233000	7235000	Wait a minute, did I bag on Undertale last week?
7235000	7236000	I don't know.
7236000	7237000	I don't remember doing that.
7237000	7238000	I don't remember you doing that either.
7238000	7243000	Oh, you know what? Maybe I referenced, you bought it for me on Steam and I still haven't played it.
7243000	7246000	But that doesn't mean I'm rolling my eyes.
7246000	7249000	Just to be clear, I just haven't played it.
7249000	7252000	But really, please give the game a chance and I know you'll fall in love with it.
7252000	7259000	The characters in the game have a way of making you feel attached to them in a way that made it hard for me to even consider a genocide run.
7259000	7261000	This is why I'm doing it on a different computer.
7261000	7265000	And your interactions with them break the fourth wall like the Hymen of Zeus.
7265000	7267000	Okay.
7267000	7269000	What?
7269000	7272000	The gameplay is addicting and just a lot of fun.
7272000	7275000	Most importantly, the story. I'm not going to spoil anything, of course.
7275000	7283000	I just want to state this game uses a particular method of storytelling at one point of the game that caught me off guard completely, and it moved me to tears.
7283000	7287000	In fact, the game as a whole did it multiple times.
7287000	7291000	Please, I'd be so happy to hear your thoughts on it in a future OLR episode.
7291000	7294000	What if I hate it? You're not going to be happy to hear it.
7294000	7295000	I don't think you'll hate it.
7295000	7296000	I don't think I will either.
7296000	7300000	Undertale is something special that I'm not going to forget for the rest of my life.
7300000	7301000	Sincerely, Garth Wolf.
7301000	7306000	P.S. Have a Valentine's Day fursuit photo of myself. Have a good one.
7306000	7307000	What?
7307000	7310000	Yeah, there's a picture attached where he's wearing the whole...
7310000	7311000	If it'll load.
7311000	7313000	If it'll load. Attachments are not working for Dark Sakura today.
7313000	7314000	No.
7314000	7315000	It was just...
7315000	7316000	There we go.
7316000	7318000	It was him being a fursuit.
7318000	7321000	I keep wanting to say theme park character, but is that an insult?
7321000	7322000	I don't want to be insulting.
7322000	7323000	Mascot.
7323000	7324000	Alright.
7324000	7325000	Mascot sitting on a park, just chilling on a park bench.
7325000	7329000	I love, I love, I love furries. I really do.
7329000	7332000	You know somebody's going to cut that out and use that against you someday, right?
7332000	7334000	Fuck them, then. I don't care.
7334000	7338000	I love, well, especially furry cosplayers.
7338000	7341000	People who take the time to make their fursuits like that.
7341000	7343000	It's a lot of craftsmanship.
7343000	7345000	You know what? I will say this.
7345000	7349000	I realize that that whole scene gets their shit and all that stuff,
7349000	7353000	but I will say they are dedicated to their craft,
7353000	7357000	and the cosplay that, you know, they pull off is pretty fucking impressive
7357000	7361000	when you realize they are not Disney or a theme park operating company
7361000	7365000	that just can, you know, crank these suits out in a factory like they make them.
7365000	7367000	So I'll give you that.
7367000	7371000	I'll tell you this. If you kind of want to have an idea of what goes into
7371000	7374000	making a fursuit, there's actually an episode of How It's Made
7374000	7377000	where someone makes like a game mascot,
7377000	7382000	and they go into like how the entire body of it is stitched.
7382000	7385000	How they keep them cool enough is what I want to know.
7385000	7387000	Because those things look hot.
7387000	7388000	Sometimes they put fans in them.
7388000	7391000	Some do put fans in them, but I've also seen some that have like
7391000	7393000	ventilation built in at key places.
7393000	7397000	And then there's like, I call them the hybrid fursuits
7397000	7401000	where people will do like the appendages and whatnot,
7401000	7404000	like another type of anthermorph, so.
7404000	7408000	And well done. I really, really, really dig your fursona.
7408000	7411000	And I will play, and I'm getting yelled at by Act Deft in chat, too.
7411000	7414000	Play Undertale. I will. I just, you know how it goes.
7414000	7417000	When Alan's home from work, we want to just chill in Diablo III.
7417000	7420000	So I will get around to it. I will.
7420000	7423000	But not this week, because I'm going to MAGFest.
7423000	7427000	Unless somebody makes me play it at MAGFest, which might happen.
7427000	7430000	I don't know. Do they have the whole...
7430000	7432000	I'm going to ask SSGA 100 Matt.
7432000	7435000	Black Wolf says Undertale and chill, maybe.
7435000	7439000	Do they at MAGFest, do they just have like places where you have
7439000	7441000	like old school Nintendo Entertainment Systems
7441000	7444000	and you can like rent games? Like they have at PAX.
7444000	7447000	Because that was some of the most fun I had at PAX East last year,
7447000	7449000	was like, what the hell do you mean, Bobby Black Wolf?
7449000	7451000	You haven't played the Guardian Legend.
7451000	7453000	We are fucking fixing this right the fuck now.
7453000	7456000	We marched into that room and checked out Guardian Legend
7456000	7458000	and had a good time just playing that.
7458000	7460000	I hope they have some of that at MAGFest.
7460000	7463000	Oh, thank God. Everybody's telling me yes. Yay. I'm so excited.
7463000	7465000	Okay, that's happening then.
7465000	7471000	Yay. Dan and I may sit through and have me make him sit down and play through the Guardian Legend.
7471000	7472000	Oh, good.
7472000	7474000	Because he's never beaten it.
7474000	7476000	You should stream that or something. It'll be fun.
7476000	7479000	I have beaten the shit out of that game. I can't do it anymore.
7479000	7481000	It's hard. It's a hard game.
7481000	7483000	It is.
7483000	7486000	Let's see. AkumaJP in chat is asking naked pics from fans.
7486000	7488000	Um, no.
7488000	7490000	No.
7490000	7494000	I... Yeah, let's keep it professional.
7494000	7496000	Unless you're really hot.
7496000	7498000	No.
7498000	7500000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
7500000	7502000	Keep that in your trousers.
7502000	7504000	Direct message me on Twitter.
7504000	7506000	Is that it for email tonight?
7506000	7510000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7510000	7512000	This is the place to send emails.
7512000	7514000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7514000	7516000	Every week we get a little bit angsty on this show.
7516000	7518000	Because, rawr.
7524000	7526000	This is bad.
7526000	7528000	Here is justice.
7528000	7530000	Here is punishment.
7530000	7532000	Here...
7532000	7534000	This is fucked up.
7534000	7538000	FU to making a valve with a situation.
7538000	7544000	Um, I made a valve that I was gonna, for everything that I was gonna cook,
7544000	7546000	I wasn't gonna go out and buy anything new.
7546000	7548000	I was gonna use this in the fridge, right?
7548000	7550000	You know, I've got frozen vegetables.
7550000	7552000	I have konnyaku. I have noodles.
7552000	7554000	I have different stuff.
7554000	7556000	And then I realized this morning
7556000	7558000	when I went to go fix coffee
7558000	7560000	and use the last of it, I'm not a creamer.
7560000	7562000	So I have to go buy creamer.
7562000	7564000	So it's just stupid.
7564000	7568000	It's not like I can drink Irish cream before, you know, work every day.
7568000	7570000	I mean, I could.
7570000	7572000	But I would not.
7572000	7574000	Because I don't want to, you know, be a drunk driver.
7574000	7576000	I wouldn't be drunk either, but you know what I mean.
7576000	7578000	I know what you mean.
7578000	7580000	Setting a bad example.
7580000	7582000	It's all about you.
7582000	7584000	And also in FU, to me having missed the FUs
7584000	7586000	for this whole past schedule of mine,
7586000	7590000	I go back to closing shift again,
7590000	7594000	the week of the 20th?
7594000	7596000	March 20th?
7596000	7598000	Oh, March 20th.
7598000	7600000	So we still have a few shows of early Dark Soccer departures.
7600000	7602000	Yeah.
7602000	7604000	But it's gonna be nice to be back on a Monday through Friday again
7604000	7608000	and not have, you know, my days off split.
7608000	7610000	Not tonight because of the holiday.
7610000	7612000	Yeah. Well, tomorrow I requested off and I got off.
7612000	7614000	Cool.
7614000	7618000	And yeah, I missed having two days in a row.
7618000	7620000	It's really hard to feel rested with one day
7620000	7622000	and then having to go right back to work.
7622000	7624000	It doesn't feel like I have any real gap in my week.
7624000	7626000	So nice.
7626000	7628000	Very happy.
7628000	7630000	All right.
7630000	7632000	Loki, your FU of the week.
7632000	7634000	My FU to my ankle for still hurting
7634000	7636000	from me stepping on it funny
7636000	7638000	when I was playing Ingress and FU to my arm
7638000	7640000	for hurting for, I don't know,
7640000	7642000	I must have slept on it weird, but it's hurt,
7642000	7644000	it's been hurting for two weeks now and I can't like
7644000	7646000	move it in certain directions, which is weird.
7646000	7648000	But, but,
7648000	7650000	you know, one of my previous FUs
7650000	7652000	has been FU to Red Bull for not
7652000	7654000	getting me my free Red Bull, but I finally got
7654000	7656000	my fucking free Red Bull.
7656000	7658000	So I'm happy about that.
7658000	7660000	Finally got that sweet,
7660000	7662000	sweet settlement Red Bull.
7662000	7664000	The taste of an agreement.
7664000	7666000	Which, by the way, I registered
7666000	7668000	for myself and for my wife.
7668000	7670000	So she's like, why did I get one in the box
7670000	7672000	with my name on it too? Because I wanted two of them!
7672000	7674000	Is why.
7674000	7676000	I can't just see
7676000	7678000	that conversation between you and Nelly too.
7678000	7680000	All right, my FU of the week.
7680000	7682000	Honestly, I don't have a lot to be
7682000	7684000	angsty about because I've had a pretty good week.
7684000	7686000	I will say this, FU to the fact that
7686000	7688000	every time I host Rocky, which I did
7688000	7690000	last night, I managed to throw out my voice.
7690000	7692000	Although I'm doing pretty good through
7692000	7694000	today's show, but like last night,
7694000	7696000	like this morning, I couldn't talk.
7696000	7698000	Like Alan said, good morning,
7698000	7700000	and I said, I couldn't
7700000	7702000	talk. Thankfully, thanks to
7702000	7704000	hot liquids and drinking a lot of water today,
7704000	7706000	I have my voice back. But FU to the fact
7706000	7708000	that I don't know how to not
7708000	7710000	throw my voice out at Rocky and I need to stop
7710000	7712000	yelling as loud as I do
7712000	7714000	and throwing out my voice. But the show was really
7714000	7716000	great last night. If you're local
7716000	7718000	and you weren't there, you missed it.
7718000	7720000	Alan Alchemy in chat says he squawked
7720000	7722000	like a goose. I really did. It was
7722000	7724000	I couldn't talk. It was scary.
7724000	7726000	It was scary. Can you imagine if I
7726000	7728000	lost my voice, like for a long time?
7728000	7730000	Oh my god, what would I do
7730000	7732000	with myself? I would be able to podcast.
7732000	7734000	I would be able to teach.
7734000	7736000	Oh my god.
7736000	7738000	I guess I'd finally play games like Undertale
7738000	7740000	because I have nothing else to do.
7740000	7742000	Alright, just a couple more
7742000	7744000	stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line.
7744000	7746000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7746000	7748000	But first, Loki.
7748000	7750000	Alright, so Minecraft Windows 10 edition
7750000	7752000	is getting yet another update. They're finally
7752000	7754000	getting closer to being like the PC version.
7754000	7756000	So with this,
7756000	7758000	they've gotten some more updates
7758000	7760000	to the Redstone stuff. So for example,
7760000	7762000	different mechanical contraptions
7762000	7764000	you can make. The
7764000	7766000	compactors, repeaters, suspencers, droppers,
7766000	7768000	hoppers, trap chests,
7768000	7770000	etc. are now available to build.
7770000	7772000	Also, they added witches
7772000	7774000	and item frames.
7774000	7776000	So those are available for the Pocket edition and
7776000	7778000	Windows 10 beta edition as well.
7778000	7780000	Slime Blocks, wearable pumpkins,
7780000	7782000	and Red Sandstone
7782000	7784000	have been added, as well as
7784000	7786000	chicken jockey mobs.
7786000	7788000	I still haven't seen that yet.
7788000	7790000	Awesome.
7790000	7792000	I can't wait to check that out.
7792000	7794000	I guess eight more achievements
7794000	7796000	as well.
7796000	7798000	Alright, I'll have to check that out.
7798000	7800000	It runs really well, I think.
7800000	7802000	Oh yeah, I've played it on Windows 10 before
7802000	7804000	and I love that you can see
7804000	7806000	it endlessly in that game.
7806000	7808000	I mean, it renders the new areas
7808000	7810000	so fast.
7810000	7812000	I know that they have all those different
7812000	7814000	Sonic Ether, really awesome
7814000	7816000	shaders and stuff for it.
7816000	7818000	That's what I wanted the PlayStation 4
7818000	7820000	and Xbox One versions to have.
7820000	7822000	Keep it the blocky stuff,
7822000	7824000	but make it look extra nice.
7824000	7826000	And maybe do the water differently.
7826000	7828000	But unfortunately,
7828000	7830000	that's not what we got.
7830000	7832000	Minecraft 2, I guess.
7832000	7834000	Unfortunately, tonight, in the Department of
7834000	7836000	Things We Didn't Fucking Ask For,
7836000	7838000	somebody,
7838000	7840000	somebody, Dark Soccer laughed at that,
7840000	7842000	somebody has recreated
7842000	7844000	the Nintendo Classic
7844000	7846000	game, I use that term very loosely,
7846000	7848000	because you all know how I feel about this game.
7848000	7850000	Somebody has created the Nintendo game
7850000	7852000	Duck Hunt in VR.
7852000	7854000	And the criminal responsible
7854000	7856000	for this is Joseph Delgado,
7856000	7858000	who actually did this during
7858000	7860000	the Global Game Jam
7860000	7862000	2016 last month.
7862000	7864000	And I say this very
7864000	7866000	tongue-in-cheek, because I'm just not a fan of Duck Hunt,
7866000	7868000	but honestly, this guy did something
7868000	7870000	I can't do, so I'm just saying that tongue-in-cheek.
7870000	7872000	Awesome work, dude.
7872000	7874000	He is actually studying computer science at
7874000	7876000	the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
7876000	7878000	And
7878000	7880000	he built the game in a single
7880000	7882000	day, and then he uploaded what he did
7882000	7884000	in his YouTube channel, and it actually
7884000	7886000	kind of like, you see the little orange
7886000	7888000	gun kind of floating in space that you
7888000	7890000	kind of use, and then the
7890000	7892000	ducks, and it's almost like you're actually in the
7892000	7894000	environment, and you can like look around and see
7894000	7896000	that little shitty dog and everything else.
7896000	7898000	He also made a game
7898000	7900000	oh, I'm sorry, he actually put in the Game C
7900000	7902000	minigame where you can shoot the little
7902000	7904000	clay pigeons and all that stuff.
7904000	7906000	The game is planned to be released for
7906000	7908000	free for the HTC Vive VR
7908000	7910000	platform when that comes out in April.
7910000	7912000	But that is, of course,
7912000	7914000	hoping that Nintendo
7914000	7916000	is not going to do anything to shut it down.
7916000	7918000	Although, when I looked at it, I mean,
7918000	7920000	yeah, okay, it's really similar and has a lot of
7920000	7922000	the same stuff, but if Nintendo wanted him
7922000	7924000	to shut it down, I'm pretty sure he could just change
7924000	7926000	some of the sprite art, and it would
7926000	7928000	I don't know, if he's willing to do it, we'll see.
7928000	7930000	Who knows.
7930000	7932000	Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
7932000	7934000	Bobby Blackwolf saying,
7934000	7936000	someone did this early on
7936000	7938000	in the DK1 lifespan, it just
7938000	7940000	didn't make the news sites. Maybe,
7940000	7942000	I'm assuming this one did because it came out of a
7942000	7944000	game jam, so maybe it was kind of faster.
7944000	7946000	I don't know.
7946000	7948000	I don't know with the DK1 if
7948000	7950000	they really had good controller support
7950000	7952000	as far as using the actual
7952000	7954000	controllers that they have
7954000	7956000	to manipulate
7956000	7958000	stuff in space.
7958000	7960000	I mean, that's what it has on there. It looks kind of cool.
7960000	7962000	The floating gun and everything.
7962000	7964000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster
7964000	7966000	says, now everyone can have that dog
7966000	7968000	laugh at them in VR.
7968000	7970000	Tigerclaw says, I can never play a game
7970000	7972000	like Duck Hunt. Ducks are cute and stuff.
7972000	7974000	Why would you want to kill them?
7974000	7976000	And my favorite, SSJ100
7976000	7978000	Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7978000	7980000	of course, something this crappy
7980000	7982000	would come from New Jersey.
7982000	7984000	That's not nice.
7984000	7986000	It doesn't look bad. I think it looks pretty cool.
7988000	7990000	Okay, that was funny though.
7990000	7992000	Sorry to any of our New Jersey people listening,
7992000	7994000	but you know, just tongue in cheek.
7994000	7996000	It's funny. Alright. I'd play it.
7996000	7998000	Yeah, I mean, as much
7998000	8000000	as I hate on Duck Hunt here
8000000	8002000	on the show, you guys know it's a little bit of an in-joke.
8002000	8004000	I would check it out just for laughs, but
8004000	8006000	again, we don't need to shoehorn
8006000	8008000	everything into VR, okay?
8008000	8010000	Totally cool with new
8010000	8012000	VR experiences, but this
8012000	8014000	guy's a student. It's part of a
8014000	8016000	game jam. Scenario's a little
8016000	8018000	different here. I think it's okay. Alright.
8018000	8020000	Let's get into
8020000	8022000	the Skype line tonight.
8022000	8024000	We're going to take your calls. OrangeLoungeRadio.
8024000	8026000	All one word on Skype. Old school.
8026000	8028000	1877 game OLR.
8028000	8030000	While we wait for some calls, I should say.
8030000	8032000	Do we have any last minute stories here over from Loki?
8032000	8034000	No.
8034000	8036000	What?
8036000	8038000	Sorry. There's something going on.
8038000	8040000	Alright. Well, we'll see if we get any calls then.
8040000	8042000	Again, that's OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word on
8042000	8044000	Skype. TigerClaw on chat
8044000	8046000	says, what if they recreated Super Metroid
8046000	8048000	in VR? Do you think that draws the line?
8048000	8050000	Yes, because
8050000	8052000	It wouldn't be the same game. It would not be the same game
8052000	8054000	whatsoever. I mean, a game
8054000	8056000	like Metroid Prime
8056000	8058000	might work a little better in VR.
8058000	8060000	But even then, I'm like, you know,
8060000	8062000	these experiences weren't really created
8062000	8064000	for VR. So I'm just
8064000	8066000	It's kind of like when you see the movies that were
8066000	8068000	like converted into 3D
8068000	8070000	post-production. It can be really
8070000	8072000	hit and miss. I'm sure there's going to be
8072000	8074000	something out there that gets converted for
8074000	8076000	VR that works out pretty well. But
8076000	8078000	I just don't really have an
8078000	8080000	interest in trying to shoehorn classics
8080000	8082000	into VR. Now, if Nintendo
8082000	8084000	one day was like, we're going to make a
8084000	8086000	Metroid game for VR. And I don't
8086000	8088000	fucking know why they do that. But if they
8088000	8090000	did it, I would be like, okay,
8090000	8092000	fuck yeah, let's check this out. How cool
8092000	8094000	is this going to be? But I just
8094000	8096000	don't really see that happening unless the
8096000	8098000	NX is going to adopt VR. I do have a couple things.
8098000	8100000	So first off,
8100000	8102000	according to NECA Toys,
8102000	8104000	they're saying that Sony is bringing back
8104000	8106000	Crash Bandicoot
8106000	8108000	because I guess they would have some sort of in on
8108000	8110000	that. Meaning that, you know, they'd be
8110000	8112000	making toys for it.
8112000	8114000	Also, apparently
8114000	8116000	they're bringing back that really shitty
8116000	8118000	PC gaming show to
8118000	8120000	E3 again. Which I will not
8120000	8122000	watch this time. Oh. I didn't realize
8122000	8124000	that was happening. Interesting.
8124000	8126000	Yes. When did they do that? That was like a... It was
8126000	8128000	a live broadcasting. It was like three
8128000	8130000	hours long or something. When did they do that?
8130000	8132000	It was so fucking boring. Was that the
8132000	8134000	second night? Not even the first night? I don't know.
8134000	8136000	But this time it's supposed to be June 13th
8136000	8138000	at noon.
8138000	8140000	Oh.
8140000	8142000	I don't know what the... I don't know.
8142000	8144000	It was so boring last time. I am not
8144000	8146000	watching that thing.
8146000	8148000	Oh. Did they snag the
8148000	8150000	EA spot? I bet
8150000	8152000	that's what it is. They probably
8152000	8154000	took the spot that would have usually been EA.
8154000	8156000	Yeah. It was just a big advertisement
8156000	8158000	fest last time. I mean,
8158000	8160000	no thank you. I'm not gonna
8160000	8162000	watch it. I think they showed like a new Heroes
8162000	8164000	of the Storm map. There was like a couple little things
8164000	8166000	here and there, but it wasn't a lot.
8166000	8168000	S200Matt says, oh, that
8168000	8170000	was a PC show. God, that was a waste of time.
8170000	8172000	People really thought they were gonna announce
8172000	8174000	Half-Life 3 during it. Hey, you know what?
8174000	8176000	If they did announce Half-Life 3
8176000	8178000	this year, no one is ever gonna bag on that show
8178000	8180000	again. I'm just saying.
8180000	8182000	I'm just throwing it out there. They wouldn't...
8182000	8184000	Yeah, it wouldn't be done at that show.
8184000	8186000	And I would think if you're gonna launch
8186000	8188000	or do Half-Life 3
8188000	8190000	that it would be console as well.
8190000	8192000	Honestly, I think that they would wanna capitalize
8192000	8194000	on as many people as possible
8194000	8196000	on that. Yeah, I agree.
8196000	8198000	I think Half-Life 3 will ultimately be console
8198000	8200000	as well. Even though they might do like a
8200000	8202000	It's On Steam first
8202000	8204000	because they can. Oh yeah, I can see that.
8204000	8206000	We'll see. Anyway,
8206000	8208000	putting out one more call for calls.
8208000	8210000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on
8210000	8212000	Skype if you wanna give us a call.
8212000	8214000	Otherwise, I do wanna remind our podcast listeners
8214000	8216000	the show is probably gonna feel a little short this week.
8216000	8218000	We did get a 30 minute late start tonight
8218000	8220000	because we did the special announcement
8220000	8222000	show live at the Boyziques Network, so that's why if
8222000	8224000	things seem a little shorter tonight, well, they were.
8224000	8226000	But it is already, believe it or not, 9 o'clock
8226000	8228000	on the West Coast.
8228000	8230000	Again, there is gonna be no live OLR
8230000	8232000	next week because I'll be at MAGFest.
8232000	8234000	Although, and it sounds like Loki and Dark Soccer
8234000	8236000	are gonna have a ball without me here
8236000	8238000	going to see Dead School and playing Egress. We'll see.
8238000	8240000	We'll see what happens. We'll see.
8240000	8242000	But I will be at MAGFest.
8242000	8244000	I will be tweeting.
8244000	8246000	I really, you know, I've been putting together
8246000	8248000	the guidebook app, the things I wanna do.
8248000	8250000	And I have left myself a lot of free time.
8250000	8252000	But I did find, surprisingly, there is
8252000	8254000	a lot I wanna see, so I'm just
8254000	8256000	irritated that I didn't realize MAGFest
8256000	8258000	started as early as it did. When they said it was
8258000	8260000	Thursday through Sunday, I thought
8260000	8262000	that meant like Thursday night. But it actually
8262000	8264000	meant like, it actually starts at like 2 o'clock
8264000	8266000	on Thursday or something like that. It starts like really
8266000	8268000	early. And I don't
8268000	8270000	even get into DC until 3
8270000	8272000	or 4 o'clock local time on
8272000	8274000	Thursday, so I'm gonna miss
8274000	8276000	a little bit. But as long as I don't miss the VCR
8276000	8278000	clue thing, that's why I'm praying
8278000	8280000	my flight doesn't get delayed because I'll be so mad.
8280000	8282000	So mad if that happens.
8282000	8284000	Alright.
8284000	8286000	And Bobby Blackwolf
8286000	8288000	is saying follow him on Twitter
8288000	8290000	with the hashtag RoadToMAGFest
8290000	8292000	and you can
8292000	8294000	check that out over on
8294000	8296000	Twitter. He'll be posting about that
8296000	8298000	as he's going to MAGFest.
8298000	8300000	Our phone is ringing, so
8300000	8302000	let's get to it. We're gonna go to the phones
8302000	8304000	and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.
8304000	8306000	Who's this? Hi, it's
8306000	8308000	Derek H. First time listener,
8308000	8310000	long time listener.
8310000	8312000	First time listener, long time
8312000	8314000	listener. Derek,
8314000	8316000	it has been a very long time, my friend.
8316000	8318000	How are you?
8318000	8320000	I've been better. I've been worse.
8320000	8322000	You know what? I was about to
8322000	8324000	ask how you guys are doing, but
8324000	8326000	listening to the show, I can tell you're doing awesome.
8326000	8328000	Congratulations on another
8328000	8330000	great Rocky Horror Picture show. I probably
8330000	8332000	will never see it because
8332000	8334000	you're not across the street from
8334000	8336000	me, but I know that I'm
8336000	8338000	missing something good. Thank you very much.
8338000	8340000	I appreciate that. They do some showings in L.A.,
8340000	8342000	but it's different no matter where you go.
8342000	8344000	But how are you, my friend?
8344000	8346000	What do we owe this phone call tonight?
8346000	8348000	I was listening to the show and I heard
8348000	8350000	the call. You said, call in.
8350000	8352000	So I was like, I don't think I've called
8352000	8354000	into Orange Lawn's Radio in a while. I will
8354000	8356000	call in because I actually would like to
8356000	8358000	I would like your guys' take on
8358000	8360000	something that I've been mulling
8360000	8362000	over
8362000	8364000	for the past few weeks now.
8364000	8366000	Okay.
8366000	8368000	This mini
8368000	8370000	PC deal that's going on
8370000	8372000	where you can get a full-fledged
8372000	8374000	PC. At first it was
8374000	8376000	the Raspberry Pi
8376000	8378000	for $35.
8378000	8380000	And I was
8380000	8382000	I want one, but I was able to say
8382000	8384000	nah, what can I really do with it?
8384000	8386000	But you can do a lot of stuff with it, but still
8386000	8388000	I was like, yeah, it's a toy.
8388000	8390000	And then the Kangaroo
8390000	8392000	PC came out. That's $99
8392000	8394000	and you can do whatever you want with it.
8394000	8396000	Play games and everything.
8396000	8398000	And it's kind of getting hard for me
8398000	8400000	to
8400000	8402000	dismiss it like I had before.
8402000	8404000	And even worse
8404000	8406000	it's hard for me to justify
8406000	8408000	spending any money on my
8408000	8410000	big, giant, old-fashioned, stupid
8410000	8412000	computer now. When I looked
8412000	8414000	I was like, well
8414000	8416000	there's one that does like 90% of this stuff
8416000	8418000	for $100.
8418000	8420000	And I spend that much on
8420000	8422000	a mouse.
8422000	8424000	Isn't it amazing
8424000	8426000	how technology
8426000	8428000	gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper?
8428000	8430000	Well there's that one that they included with a magazine
8430000	8432000	too.
8432000	8434000	They had like a whole PC that was with a magazine.
8434000	8436000	That's right, they had like a magazine they were selling
8436000	8438000	and it was like the little, like back in my day
8438000	8440000	it was a demo disc for PlayStation
8440000	8442000	games and now it's like, oh hey,
8442000	8444000	now you get a whole freaking PC
8444000	8446000	included with the magazine.
8446000	8448000	That stuff is crazy, but you know
8448000	8450000	when we talk about this kind of stuff
8450000	8452000	I'm reminded of, I remember
8452000	8454000	a few years ago, when I say a few years ago
8454000	8456000	I'm talking like 10 years ago, I remember when
8456000	8458000	like the Mac Mini had first come out
8458000	8460000	and that was like, hey, you have
8460000	8462000	this kind of like, for all practical purposes
8462000	8464000	bare bones computer that's
8464000	8466000	a cheaper price. Now granted
8466000	8468000	you know, it was the Apple, still the
8468000	8470000	Apple premium Mercedes Benz
8470000	8472000	brand and all that stuff, so it's not like we're talking about
8472000	8474000	$99, but it was still that
8474000	8476000	whole, hey we're going to strip out a lot of the fluff
8476000	8478000	and do this very like bare bones PC.
8478000	8480000	So, I don't know, I mean a lot of
8480000	8482000	this stuff is,
8482000	8484000	it's not surprising necessarily
8484000	8486000	but it is just fascinating
8486000	8488000	like how much more we can do with it.
8488000	8490000	You know, I know a lot of people
8490000	8492000	get those Raspberry Pis because you can
8492000	8494000	install emulators and play
8494000	8496000	games for days on there.
8496000	8498000	I actually have a project right now because
8498000	8500000	I have a non-functional
8500000	8502000	Mac SE
8502000	8504000	that I'm going to put
8504000	8506000	a Raspberry Pi in and a small
8506000	8508000	LCD monitor and
8508000	8510000	just use it as you know, a little
8510000	8512000	emulator.
8512000	8514000	Crazy. I think
8514000	8516000	the whole, I think phones
8516000	8518000	have kind of opened people's eyes
8518000	8520000	to what they really need
8520000	8522000	a computer for because I remember
8522000	8524000	when I was
8524000	8526000	back in the good old days when I was young
8526000	8528000	we would look at laptops
8528000	8530000	and say well, laptops are okay but
8530000	8532000	if you want a real computer to do real
8532000	8534000	stuff then you need a real computer.
8534000	8536000	And then laptops got more and more
8536000	8538000	powerful and then tablets came out
8538000	8540000	and was like, well tablets are okay
8540000	8542000	but if you need a real computer you need at least a
8542000	8544000	laptop. And now people are
8544000	8546000	I see a number of people
8546000	8548000	plugging
8548000	8550000	Bluetooth keyboards into their
8550000	8552000	phones and they're like, well
8552000	8554000	it does everything I need it to do.
8554000	8556000	And I think that's kind of
8556000	8558000	opened people's eyes to say, I
8558000	8560000	don't really need one of these
8560000	8562000	big honking dinosaur computers
8562000	8564000	when everything I need
8564000	8566000	is in this
8566000	8568000	can fit in the palm of my hand. So why am I
8568000	8570000	spending $2,000
8570000	8572000	$2,000, $1,500 on a
8572000	8574000	computer when I don't have to.
8574000	8576000	You know what's interesting about all this
8576000	8578000	Derek is that, and I feel like it's
8578000	8580000	actually, I feel in a way even though
8580000	8582000	this is going to kind of sound cold but it's not
8582000	8584000	because I'm in the same boat. But I
8584000	8586000	think it's a sign that we're just getting old.
8586000	8588000	Because we remember
8588000	8590000	the way computers were when we
8590000	8592000	were younger. It's funny because somebody's making a joke in chat.
8592000	8594000	Tiger Claw says, remember the days when a
8594000	8596000	computer magazine would have codes you type in a basic
8596000	8598000	to run some program. Yes, I love those
8598000	8600000	things. I want those things to come back.
8600000	8602000	Right, me too. It's like I love that stuff.
8602000	8604000	But the reality is it's like you think
8604000	8606000	about now what teenagers
8606000	8608000	and kids today are growing up
8608000	8610000	with. See the difference here is we have
8610000	8612000	different expectations of what a computer
8612000	8614000	should be. Kids that are growing up
8614000	8616000	today it's like they get cell phones
8616000	8618000	when they're like 10 years old
8618000	8620000	and they have this completely different perception
8620000	8622000	of what technology is and how
8622000	8624000	technology affects their lives.
8624000	8626000	I remember when technology was
8626000	8628000	like an enrichment class you took in high
8628000	8630000	school. It was not something that was necessarily
8630000	8632000	mandatory or what have you. It was
8632000	8634000	like you know maybe you had basic
8634000	8636000	word processing skills or whatever but
8636000	8638000	like computer skills were an elective.
8638000	8640000	They weren't a necessity. That is so not the
8640000	8642000	case today. So I just, the reason
8642000	8644000	why I bring that up is I just think it's funny
8644000	8646000	when we talk about like our perception of
8646000	8648000	what is a computer? What is
8648000	8650000	technology? And what you know what do
8650000	8652000	I take with me on the go? What do I have
8652000	8654000	in my living room? It's changing. It's
8654000	8656000	changing by the year.
8656000	8658000	And now we're on this verge of VR.
8658000	8660000	How is that going to change things?
8660000	8662000	I mean maybe it'll end up being nothing
8662000	8664000	like it was in the 90s. But I
8664000	8666000	don't know. I was around with that
8666000	8668000	first VR and trust me
8668000	8670000	you guys aren't missing nothing.
8670000	8672000	But it was
8672000	8674000	kind of shitty then and now it's
8674000	8676000	it's come a long way. It really has.
8676000	8678000	I don't know. You know and
8678000	8680000	I've said this on the show before. If
8680000	8682000	VR has its Wii Sports
8682000	8684000	it's going to do huge.
8684000	8686000	But if they don't have that must have thing
8686000	8688000	it'll be another flash in the pan.
8688000	8690000	And when was the last time you got
8690000	8692000	well you guys are, well I don't know
8692000	8694000	when was the last time you guys played one of those
8694000	8696000	motion control games that were all the rage
8696000	8698000	a few years ago that were gonna
8698000	8700000	revolutionize
8700000	8702000	and revitalize
8702000	8704000	the industry. They're all gone.
8704000	8706000	They were the flash
8706000	8708000	in the pan. I got a feeling
8708000	8710000	VR is gonna be huge for
8710000	8712000	six to eight months
8712000	8714000	and then people are gonna say yeah no
8714000	8716000	give me 4K. Well
8716000	8718000	for what it's worth I did just play Just Dance
8718000	8720000	2014 earlier this week. But I
8720000	8722000	realized I'm the exception to the rule.
8722000	8724000	It's not really for everybody.
8724000	8726000	And I totally get that point. And it's you know
8726000	8728000	I think with a lot of those
8728000	8730000	motion games it kind of became the same thing over
8730000	8732000	and over and it didn't evolve.
8732000	8734000	And as we were talking about earlier tonight
8734000	8736000	with the unfortunate closure of game
8736000	8738000	trailers if things don't evolve
8738000	8740000	they're not gonna necessarily
8740000	8742000	make it sometimes. And so VR is
8742000	8744000	gonna need that too. Anything.
8744000	8746000	Unfortunate. I laugh at that.
8746000	8748000	Look we
8748000	8750000	both run the same thing.
8750000	8752000	VOG and along with all games we
8752000	8754000	outlasted them. Screw those
8754000	8756000	people.
8756000	8758000	What do you call it? The establishment
8758000	8760000	where there are big giant companies behind
8760000	8762000	them. Independent networking.
8762000	8764000	That's what it's all about.
8764000	8766000	I'm with you and we're I mean not
8766000	8768000	to sound all ego-y but we're the
8768000	8770000	people putting them out of business. Not you and I
8770000	8772000	specifically. No you and I.
8772000	8774000	You, me, Black Wolf.
8774000	8776000	There are
8776000	8778000	people at the
8778000	8780000	unemployment line because of us.
8780000	8782000	And I say more power to them.
8782000	8784000	I'll double that number if I could.
8784000	8786000	Even worse their unemployment
8786000	8788000	line is monitored by
8788000	8790000	Bea Arthur like in History of the World
8790000	8792000	part one.
8792000	8794000	It's my wine break.
8794000	8796000	Derek it is
8796000	8798000	so good to hear from you here at OLR.
8798000	8800000	I know you're working on various projects.
8800000	8802000	You wanna drop a few quick plugs before I let you go?
8802000	8804000	I will drop one plug
8804000	8806000	and one plug only because
8806000	8808000	I don't wanna over
8808000	8810000	stay my welcome. My one plug
8810000	8812000	is AllGames.com
8812000	8814000	Look we're all one big happy
8814000	8816000	family. We may be estranged
8816000	8818000	but I still see everybody
8818000	8820000	as one big happy family. We're fighting
8820000	8822000	against demand. We're keeping
8822000	8824000	independent podcasting alive.
8824000	8826000	You don't have to be a big time
8826000	8828000	comedian or a
8828000	8830000	pop star or have a talk show
8830000	8832000	on TV to have a podcast.
8832000	8834000	We can do it still. We don't need
8834000	8836000	big giant companies behind us.
8836000	8838000	OLR, Bobby Black Wolf Show,
8838000	8840000	Electric Sisterhood,
8840000	8842000	Dead Pixel Live,
8842000	8844000	Bomb Submitted, R9cast.
8844000	8846000	We're all in this together
8846000	8848000	and by that I will say just please
8848000	8850000	go to not only vognetwork.com
8850000	8852000	just remember to
8852000	8854000	click over on AllGames.com
8854000	8856000	also. I will cosign what you
8856000	8858000	just said Derek. You're always welcome here at
8858000	8860000	OLR. Oh thank you.
8860000	8862000	I'll give everybody a big hug.
8862000	8864000	Alright sounds good. Have a good one Derek.
8864000	8866000	Thanks so much for the call. Bye guys.
8866000	8868000	Take care my friend.
8868000	8870000	I'm surprised. Derek, I don't think
8870000	8872000	he's been on this show since we were over
8872000	8874000	at AllGames and that was a while ago
8874000	8876000	at this point. That was 22.
8876000	8878000	Or 2012, 22.
8878000	8880000	In the year 22. You know
8880000	8882000	right after all the Jesus stuff.
8882000	8884000	But anyway.
8884000	8886000	No in all seriousness I cosigned what he said.
8886000	8888000	That's why I don't sit here on this show
8888000	8890000	and bash other indie podcasters.
8890000	8892000	And I know for some people that's what they
8892000	8894000	do is they like to do drama.
8894000	8896000	Stir the pot on and stuff. I don't like
8896000	8898000	all in this together. We've got no room for that.
8898000	8900000	And yes sometimes we're going to have
8900000	8902000	different ideas and we do things a little differently
8902000	8904000	and try new things or whatever.
8904000	8906000	Try to find the best way the puzzle pieces
8906000	8908000	fit together. But that doesn't mean
8908000	8910000	you completely turn your back on your roots.
8910000	8912000	So I
8912000	8914000	I cosigned what he said.
8914000	8916000	I'm going to do one more courtesy shout out for calls
8916000	8918000	but then I'm going to close up the Skype line.
8918000	8920000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on
8920000	8922000	Skype. Or 1877
8922000	8924000	Game OLR if you want to do it the old fashioned way.
8924000	8926000	I don't know if you pulled up any other last minute stories
8926000	8928000	Loki. Can I just say
8928000	8930000	here at the end of the show then some big
8930000	8932000	kudos to Akuma
8932000	8934000	JP. I want to thank our pal Akuma
8934000	8936000	JP. I said so in the chat room today.
8936000	8938000	We were talking earlier. Oh good.
8938000	8940000	Well he deserves some public kudos as well.
8940000	8942000	Totally thank you for sending me Toda KK.
8942000	8944000	And I got to go grab. Loki doesn't know that he
8944000	8946000	had something in the box too. I got to go grab it.
8946000	8948000	Well for those
8948000	8950000	who don't know Toda KK
8950000	8952000	was named after
8952000	8954000	one of the big
8954000	8956000	sound designers for Nintendo games.
8956000	8958000	You might have also heard
8958000	8960000	either KK song or Toda KK
8960000	8962000	song.
8962000	8964000	But KK Slider
8964000	8966000	in the US version
8966000	8968000	is Toda KK.
8968000	8970000	Nice.
8970000	8972000	Nice. A villager amiibo.
8972000	8974000	That's funny. Yeah. I just got
8974000	8976000	a villager amiibo which by the way you know those
8976000	8978000	are very hard to find here in the US
8978000	8980000	or at least you know I know they had a quick reprint or whatever
8980000	8982000	but they're still very hard to find. I stood in line with Shane for one.
8982000	8984000	And Animal Crossing is
8984000	8986000	a great memory for you know
8986000	8988000	all of us here at OLR so I thought that was awesome.
8988000	8990000	Thank you. But anyway another call is
8990000	8992000	coming in so I want to get to it. Hi Aaron
8992000	8994000	who's this? Hey it's Strelok.
8994000	8996000	Hey Strelok how you doing buddy?
8996000	8998000	Pretty good. Good to hear from you. What's on your mind?
8998000	9000000	Not too much.
9000000	9002000	Just kind of wanted to mourn
9002000	9004000	the death of game
9004000	9006000	trailers.
9006000	9008000	And what was a memory
9008000	9010000	or an impact that that site had for you?
9010000	9012000	I
9012000	9014000	really liked their reviews.
9014000	9016000	Brandon Jones
9016000	9018000	has an amazing voice. I hope he
9018000	9020000	continues to
9020000	9022000	do stuff somewhere.
9022000	9024000	I could listen to that guy all day. He's
9024000	9026000	awesome.
9026000	9028000	I was also a big fan of
9028000	9030000	their pop fiction series.
9032000	9034000	If you don't know
9034000	9036000	what that is basically they would take
9036000	9038000	like gaming
9038000	9040000	myths like
9040000	9042000	you know bringing
9042000	9044000	Aris back in Final Fantasy
9044000	9046000	7 and once and for
9046000	9048000	all you know debunk
9048000	9050000	that kind of stuff.
9050000	9052000	All those things that Electronic Gaming Monthly in April
9052000	9054000	would try to say is true that wasn't really true
9054000	9056000	and all that other stuff I'm sure. Yeah.
9056000	9058000	That's awesome. Like I'm liking
9058000	9060000	Simon Belmont and
9060000	9062000	TMNT2 for NES.
9062000	9064000	You know
9064000	9066000	I know a lot of these folks
9066000	9068000	that have found themselves out of work whether
9068000	9070000	it be by choice or by
9070000	9072000	you know being laid off or what have you
9072000	9074000	a lot of them have turned to sites like
9074000	9076000	Patreon or Kickstarter
9076000	9078000	to actually fund future projects.
9078000	9080000	Like I remember when
9080000	9082000	not Joystiq but their
9082000	9084000	WoW Insider
9084000	9086000	they lost that arm and then they lost the
9086000	9088000	MMO what was it
9088000	9090000	Massively. They cut loose.
9090000	9092000	Both those sites went to Patreon
9092000	9094000	and you know I mentioned
9094000	9096000	the Blizzard community is very
9096000	9098000	very very rabid
9098000	9100000	fans and I'll tell you that
9100000	9102000	WoW Insider thing got which I think they
9102000	9104000	call now Blizzardwatch. I think it's a
9104000	9106000	tongue in cheek thing for Overwatch.
9106000	9108000	That got funded like
9108000	9110000	a ton of times over and you know
9110000	9112000	they were able to continue doing that for their
9112000	9114000	jobs. Now you know you guys
9114000	9116000	know that when it gets into crowdfunding
9116000	9118000	and podcasts it's a little bit of a gray
9118000	9120000	area for me because I don't
9120000	9122000	want to do it for OLR
9122000	9124000	because I
9124000	9126000	just feel like if you give money
9126000	9128000	to us there's a
9128000	9130000	certain expectation that I need
9130000	9132000	to be able to turn around for you guys
9132000	9134000	and when I do have a normal day job
9134000	9136000	and all this other stuff like I really worry about
9136000	9138000	putting myself in that position. Like if I'm gonna
9138000	9140000	put myself out there and say this is my job
9140000	9142000	then I'm gonna have to treat it like my job
9142000	9144000	and be willing to learn my day job to do it.
9144000	9146000	Yeah. But
9146000	9148000	for these guys that have done it professionally
9148000	9150000	and maybe want to continue to do it
9150000	9152000	maybe they're in a different position than I am
9152000	9154000	and if they're able to deliver something
9154000	9156000	worthy of your monthly fee
9156000	9158000	or your yearly fee or whatever it is then
9158000	9160000	you know Patreon might be a way to do that.
9160000	9162000	Yeah.
9162000	9164000	Also it really sucks
9164000	9166000	the way it happened
9166000	9168000	like they literally
9168000	9170000	had like zero
9170000	9172000	warning that
9172000	9174000	that sucks. So I hope they can
9174000	9176000	find work. But I will say
9176000	9178000	with all of that too never say never
9178000	9180000	I'm just saying you know
9180000	9182000	for this show
9182000	9184000	right now
9184000	9186000	I would have to be able to
9186000	9188000	produce a lot more if that makes sense.
9188000	9190000	Yeah. So.
9190000	9192000	But anyway for game trailers
9192000	9194000	you know I think they are still probably all
9194000	9196000	recovering from the shock and I'm sure
9196000	9198000	some of them will brainstorm some ideas
9198000	9200000	and see how they can maybe move forward.
9200000	9202000	And I wish them the best of luck.
9202000	9204000	I wouldn't be
9204000	9206000	surprised if we see like a smaller
9206000	9208000	you know like
9208000	9210000	I don't know what you would call it
9210000	9212000	but you know like a spin off
9212000	9214000	site with like a
9214000	9216000	bunch or a few of the guys
9216000	9218000	from game trailers
9218000	9220000	pop up and maybe like a
9220000	9222000	Kickstarter or Patreon or something.
9222000	9224000	They just have to figure out what are their
9224000	9226000	strengths and what can they really offer
9226000	9228000	people that other sites don't
9228000	9230000	do and obviously that's not going to be true.
9230000	9232000	I love their reviews. Like their reviews were
9232000	9234000	actually really well done and there actually
9234000	9236000	weren't like
9236000	9238000	perfect 10s across the board
9238000	9240000	like you see a lot. They were pretty fair.
9240000	9242000	It's a good call out.
9242000	9244000	Well I hope they're able to continue
9244000	9246000	one way or the other. Yeah.
9246000	9248000	Any other thoughts for us, Sturlock?
9248000	9250000	I know
9250000	9252000	this is Dan and
9252000	9254000	Red Entertainment's line but stay black.
9254000	9256000	I'll try. Thank you very much
9256000	9258000	Sturlock. Alright. Take care my friend.
9258000	9260000	Bye.
9260000	9262000	Alright. I think that's
9262000	9264000	going to do it for the Skype line tonight. It's about 9.15
9264000	9266000	so we need to wrap up the show tonight but
9266000	9268000	I really want to thank all you guys who participated with
9268000	9270000	the show tonight. Again I'll be at
9270000	9272000	MagFest next week so there is
9272000	9274000	not going to be a live Orange Lounge
9274000	9276000	radio but we will be back in two weeks
9276000	9278000	with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio
9278000	9280000	and I do have and I pimped this earlier
9280000	9282000	in the show. I do have guys
9282000	9284000	on a show is back and we just
9284000	9286000	dropped three episodes out there so a little something
9286000	9288000	to hopefully fill the gap for you
9288000	9290000	before we come back in two weeks although that show is
9290000	9292000	really really explicit so it might not be for everybody.
