00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week, Pokemon Turn 20, showing no signs of slowing down, the cycle of releases continues as the next Pokemon games have already been announced.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 632 for this February the 28th of 2016.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining you here live from lovely Studio N7 in Sacramento, California,

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
where we are live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG Network.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And joining me on this adventure is my co-pilot, DarkSakura, or Jamie Sommers.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hi.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi. She's the femme chef of this show.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And she has some hair to kind of match right now, a little bit.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is my favorite chair in the studio.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
She's enjoying her recliner over there. How are you, DarkSakura?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm alright.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We are back after a week off. I was out in the Washington, D.C. area last week for MAGFest, which I'll talk about here shortly.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But did you enjoy a week off from OLR, DarkSakura?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I sure did.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah? What'd you do?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I did jack shit.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You said you and the hubby were cleaning the vault a little bit.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, that was today.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, that was today.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And it was mostly him and me just kind of watching and taking pictures and putting them on Instagram.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As the supervisor should do, directing and watching.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, the cat was being the supervisor, really.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
She's just like, I'm supervising you, but you're not putting food in my mouth.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then she's like, she's like been doing this thing lately.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're like, I'll sit down. And it used to be she'd just sit on my lap and purr, purr, purr, get up when she's done.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know, she just fucks off into the night.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now she sits on my lap angrily.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She thrashes around and then tries to bite my hand when I pet her.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But she won't get up.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm like, cat, if you don't want to be on my lap, why are you on my lap?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The joys of owning a cat or the joys of a cat owning you.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Whatever.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She's a brat.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wait, back to the vault thing for a minute here.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So you were mentioning, you are going to be, and for those that might be newer to OLR,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dark Soccer and The Hubby have a stash of classic modern game stuff called The Vault.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's an entire room. At one point it was an entire room in their house of just,

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I would call it crap, but it's awesome crap because it's like gaming.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a lot of stuff.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah. But so you're finally trimming it down a little bit.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But you said you're getting rid of like duplicates. Like you have four Coleco Visions.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I have two Coleco Visions.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
One of them is the same one I had as a kid.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The other one is one that we bought later when I was working at the former money store.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Which is amazing that they still work.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, yeah. I mean, well, they, they built them kind of,

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the less complicated the mechanics are, the longer it stands to reason it's going to work, you know.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But we're thinking about like getting together, like whole sets and eBaying them.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Or making them available to listeners if they want to, to buy them from us.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Buy my crap.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Seriously. Cause I mean like, cause then, you know, we can put it in the, into the,

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
send Jamie to X convention fund.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Dragon Con girl, you got to go sometime.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They would, they would love you at Dragon Con. I'm telling you, love you.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I might, that might be a thing.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Maybe I'll have to break out the Grey Warden for that.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I like that. There you go. Now you're talking. Now you're talking.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Also joining us also here with me every week on this lovely show, Sunday nights.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hello.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How are you doing, Loki?

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Fine.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How was your week off from the show?

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I went and saw Deadpool.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Did you?

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Alan's been begging me to go take him to see you at night.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was going to take him yesterday morning, but I was like,

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I want to go in the morning for a matinee and there's less teenagers there.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then what happened? I slept for 14 hours Friday night.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
14 hours. Loki, have you ever slept for 14 hours?

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Nope.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Especially since the kids came around.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
14 minutes. Yes.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
14 hours because I was, I was sick at magfest and just,

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I honestly think that was the first full night sleep I'd gotten in like two weeks.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Maybe 14 hours in a week.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sorry to rub it in, but yeah.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So we didn't end up seeing Deadpool because I slept for 14 hours.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But how was Deadpool?

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It was excellent.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I loved it.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm such a uncool kid. I'm like the only one who hasn't seen it yet, but soon, soon.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I still never saw it.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I love James Bond movies and I never went to go see Spectre.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I just out of it. Isn't it all blue right now?

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think so.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Jeez. I'm behind the times. I need to get with it.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And with it.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Uh, so, uh, so you went and saw Deadpool with your night off?

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You didn't go out and make triangles and ingress? I would have figured that.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, I did both.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, you did both. Of course. Of course.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
At the movie theater, you had to hack.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Awesome.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We are going to be at the Sacramento Indie Game Arcade show that's coming up on April 9th, I believe is the day.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a Saturday. I think it's like the second weekend in April.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We're going to be there at the Indie Arcade. We did this last year. We're going to do it again this year.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Although I know they've been kind of trying to convince Loki to be a part of it and showing a game is time to card.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You think you might make it?

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not working on that anymore.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, oh.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
At least not right now.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Excuse me.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was trying to work on something else, but I don't think mentally I'm just not capable of doing it right now.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Like, I think yesterday, it's just too distracting. My environment, I'm too tired to do it.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like, I was trying to program while the wife was watching Fuller House.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Which is awesome, by the way.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's pretty good.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you're expecting a fucking Emmy-worthy TV series, you're not going to get it.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It is just as bad as it was in 1990. That's what's awesome about it. It's so bad it's good.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's alright. We were almost done with everything. We've watched 12 of the 13 episodes. I'm sure she'll be finishing it tonight.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Dude, I'm sorry. Stephanie is just exposed in a lot of that show to a distracting mirror.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Like, the first episode, I can't even tell you what happened in it because it was just her fucking tits the entire time.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It was ridiculous.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a little weird because it's like, I grew up with you.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But it's funny though because they poke fun at themselves in the show and they also poke fun at stuff like that.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was impressed at what a good comedic actress Jodie Sweetin turned out to be because she didn't really do anything after Full House except a lot of drugs.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But, thankfully, she's cleaned up and she's got a great recovery story, wrote a book about it and all that stuff.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She's really done a lot. So, it's really cool that people can see she's actually, I would say, she's kind of one of the better people on the show.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That and, what is it, Kimmy's husband or ex-husband or separated husband. He's hilarious.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, Fernando or something?

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Fernando, yes.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, okay.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
My wife couldn't stop laughing at, like, who gives stationery for a birthday gift?

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That is my mother. It's her go-to gift since she got fired from the stationery store for stealing all the stationery.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And for some reason, she thought that was hilarious.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now, I never in a million years thought that OLR would start off one week with Loki and I sitting here discussing the finer points of the Full House sequel.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But, here we are.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not bad. It was, like, the first episode, like, if I was to judge it on the first episode alone, I was like, holy shit, this is way, way too cringy.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It was, like, it was incredibly cringy.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You have to stick with it until, like, the third episode when it's, like, random 90s singer who disappeared forever cameo. And it's like, the fuck is this? But this is awesome.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What, Millie Vanilli shows up?

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No, minor spoiler alert, Macy Gray.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh my god.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right?

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And just, like, it just gets, the whole show just keeps getting weirder. Like, they...

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Isn't that the I'm Like a Bird?

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No, that was Nellie Furtado, dear.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Macy Gray was a, I try to say goodbye and not choke. Remember?

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She got the very distinctive voice. She's awesome, though. And it was, it was kind of awesome to see her in the show being just as big of a cornball as everybody else. I don't know, it was awesome.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Maybe I'll watch it.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's on Netflix. Why not?

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's see. And of course, Dark Soccer and Loki join myself, Rob Roberts, here in studio every single week. But you guys join us in the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live at the Voice Geeks Network Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you are listening live, join us and chat live.vognetwork.com where Eric RPG was referring to Loki's review of Fuller House as Titty House. That's apparently what it is.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Like that first episode, and she also ends up naked in another episode as well.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
She's not naked!

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
She is in a tub of tomato juice, not wearing any clothes.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
DungeonBuster in chat says, waiting for Netflix to resurrect Airwolf and turn the helicopter into a drone. You know what, that seems to be the thing to do now is that 90 shows are like, they're not just being rebooted, they're just fucking coming back for a new season.

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You know, Full House, you call these new seasons.

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The X-Files?

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
X-Files was a thing, and by the way, if you've been watching X-Files, you gotta check out the TV reviews at vognetwork.com. Critical Myth and his team have been breaking down all those episodes.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Nice, cheap plug, right?

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And Twin Peaks, which I'm so fucking excited about, is coming back. I'm so excited about the new Twin Peaks.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But yeah, what other shows would come back? How about Baywatch?

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No, Northern Exposure should come back.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay, now did you catch this? I caught this when I was watching, it was actually one of the last episodes.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm only on like episode 3 of Full House.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, okay, well, there's a part where they're talking about, like, it's Steve and DJ, they're going out on a date or something like that, and so he's like, yeah, I've got Atlantis playing in the car.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He's like, you'll never believe what that song is about. You know, it's hilarious, you know, in the context of the shows.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's see, go into the chat, live.vognetwork.com, s2100matt says they are bringing back Baywatch. Get out, really?

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But the Hoff's not gonna be in it. Pamela Anderson won't be in it, it won't be the same.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
See, at least Twin Peaks actually has, you know, what's his name, I can't remember in the moment, Kyle McLaughlin. Thank you, Cooper.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Kyle McLaughlin's gonna be back in that. Full House has the original actors and actresses for better and for worse.

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's pretty, I don't know, it's pretty awesome. Anyway, I know you guys are here to hear us talk about video games, so we are gonna get into some game discussion tonight.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I do want to talk briefly, though, about the week off. We weren't here last week because I was in Washington, D.C.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was at a convention that I think a lot of you on the East Coast know, but maybe not as many of you on the West Coast are aware of.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
MagFest, a music and games fest, which took place in National Harbor, Maryland, over last weekend.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It was on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but Sunday was, like, done by two.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have to be honest, I'm not sure why they bothered with Sunday, because there was very little that happened on Sunday, but I digress.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Overall, I had a great time at the convention. It was truly one of my favorite conventions that I've been to.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And Bobby and I talked about this a little bit on the throw call at the end of his episode.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He called it a festival. I call it a convention. I really don't...

186
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's a ConVestable.

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a tomato, tomato thing to me.

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
ConVestable.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah. My thing is, do people convene there? Yes, it's a convention.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But anyway, whatever you want to call it, it's a lot like Penny Arcade Expo without the commercialism that it's turned into and the exhibitors.

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
MAGFest is a celebration of games and the music that gaming has inspired, essentially.

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're not going to get cutting edge, like, you're not going to have Nintendo there announcing things.

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're not going to have Blizzard with a newly playable game.

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
About the newest thing that was there was Street Fighter V, because it had come out that Tuesday, so it was already in the console room for people to play against each other.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's really it. But it was really otherwise a celebration of gaming.

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:02,000
They have a huge arcade room, and growing up on music games, being that this is what this show was started on all these years ago, I have to say, I was impressed.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I have never, and keep in mind, we used to drive to Los Angeles to go to Arcade Infinity back in the day.

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have never seen so many music games in one place.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That was very impressive. Just like 10 different DDR machines, Para Para, whatever the Dance Masters Connect thing that turned into in the arcade, that was there.

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Neon FM, which I was like, oh my god, it is a real machine. I'd never seen one. There was Neon FM there.

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Did you play it?

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, here's the weird thing. I didn't play a lot in the arcade, all things considered. I was busy doing other stuff.

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I just thought you would play Neon FM just to try it.

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There was a big line. There was a lot of lines for stuff. Really, I played the new DDR, but I just played an old song on it because I was so overwhelmed with the new song choices.

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I was just like, well, I'm going to pick one I know. So I played Ecstasy, and I was like, I remember this song being a 7-footer, and now it's a 10?

206
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I was like, alright, and I played it, and it was the same step chart, but adjusted for age because I was having an asthma attack practically by the end of it, but it was still a lot of fun.

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Somebody snapped a picture of myself and Jonko from Koopa Club playing DDR, so that was that.

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But then they had Killer Queen, which just always was swamped. They had some classic machines, too.

209
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I couldn't get the Tron to work, though, which was kind of a bummer. I don't know what was going on with that, but they had a lot of classic games, too.

210
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The arcade was very impressive, I will say that. But it's weird, even admittedly, that I didn't spend a lot of time in the arcade.

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They had a great indie showcase. They had a ton of indie developers that were there showing off their game.

212
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Our buddy YYR did end up with a space at the last minute. Somebody didn't show up. They were there on Friday, and then they didn't show up on Saturday, so he got the space.

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I was kind of surprised, like, why wouldn't you come back? But, I don't know, for whatever the reason, hey, I'm happy for YYR, so he took that space and was showing some games the rest of the weekend.

214
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But there was a lot of great indie stuff, and I got to play some things that I probably wouldn't have been aware of otherwise.

215
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Did you just play multitasking?

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I did play multitasking, and it is a lot of fun. It's on 360, and I'm going to give YYR this shout-out, because he's always been very supportive of OLR.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Multitasking is on Greenlight, and I really would love to see this get support. So please, we never ask for your money here at OLR, except to enlist in a charity thing or something.

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But go to Greenlight, search for multitasking, and give it your vote so that YYR can get his game on Steam, because this game is really a lot of fun.

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I want to see him encouraged to keep developing it, and come up with more mini-games for it, and so forth.

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I know it got a really good response at MAGFest, so I really want to see him succeed.

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So please take a moment to go to Greenlight, and just search for multitasking, and get that voted on there.

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Somebody will have the link in chat shortly, I'm sure. Oh, thank you, S. Jonah. Already ahead of me, putting that link there.

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Excellent. I did some panels, which were some good, some not so good, which you're going to come into at any convention.

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You know I was really excited about the Clue VCR game thing, right? Because I remember that from the 80s, growing up and playing that.

225
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think the person running the tournament had never actually played the game, so that did feel a little bit disorganized, disjointed.

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But, you know what, it takes a lot of guts to get up there in front of people and run something for prizes like that.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So I don't want to throw too much shade, but maybe two people could have done it next time, or I don't know.

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And then the documentary about that was pretty good, too.

229
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I did see a couple other panels. I saw the panel, it escapes me in the moment.

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There was another panel I saw that wasn't so good, and I'm not going to say what it was, but it was a topic that I was hoping to be more encouraged about.

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But it was just a lot of in-jokes and things that felt a little bit stale to me. So I was just, I don't know, I was a little let down by that.

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But yeah, I sound negative, but I'm really not. I actually had a really great time. A lot of great people, I met so many good people.

233
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The music, what they had going on with the music was phenomenal. It was a great setup in the ballroom.

234
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They had a stage A and a stage B, so that way while people were performing on one stage, the other stage could set up so they could keep going back and forth.

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like there was no break like you would expect at a concert. And I will say, the concert that really was just above and beyond amazing was Journey Live.

236
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Austin Wintory was there actually directing an orchestra of people that were playing the soundtrack to Journey as somebody was playing Journey.

237
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So what they did, they disabled the music and just had the sound effects in the game. And it was amazing. I maybe shed a manly tear or two.

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I just thought it was so amazingly well done. That made the whole trip worth it, if nothing else. I thought Journey Live was worth the whole thing right there.

239
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I was very pleasantly surprised when somebody showed up in the game. Apparently the Playstation 4 they were playing on was connected.

240
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We all had a good laugh when a trophy was earned in the game. Everybody laughed because you don't expect that.

241
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But then another player showed up. And it was not until the last chapter when another player showed up.

242
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And it was just another moment of like, oh my gosh, they're online. And this person has no idea that they are playing Journey for the guy that wrote the music and a room of thousands of people.

243
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I wonder how many Playstation messages that guy got when it was over. Or girl, who knows.

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I loved the Journey Live thing. That was awesome. I saw a couple other bands too. I saw the 1Ups, a little bit of that.

245
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I saw I Fight Dragons was good. That was a fun show. But I was sick through a lot of the convention.

246
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So it kind of killed my mood to like, oh, I want to jump around and be with a bunch of other people.

247
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I had some sinus-y, gross, sore throat thing going on. Lucky me, I was sick. So if you got sick at MAGFest, sorry, it was probably me. I'm patient zero.

248
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I really tried my best to not touch a lot of things and be sanitizer and all that stuff. But I didn't really want to totally ruin my convention either.

249
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But I had a really good time. I will definitely try to go again next year. I hear the timing may be different next year. So we'll have to see how that all plays out.

250
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But I had a really good time. I do hope though, I hope they are able to solve, I guess they had some major parking issues.

251
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Since I flew in and took Lyft, it didn't really matter to me. I didn't notice any of the parking issues. But I guess they had some really bad parking issues.

252
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And I do sort of think for a convention, okay, the hotel, gorgeous, gorgeous hotel. One of the best I've ever seen for a convention, period.

253
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But not a lot of food options around. And I have a feeling because the hotel is so nice and has such expensive restaurants in it, they probably put the kibosh on a lot of the cheaper options.

254
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But I really think that needs to be loosened up a little bit. Especially if you're going to get many more people at that convention.

255
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Because you really have to either bring in your own food or buy something at CVS Pharmacy when they're open and make it last the day.

256
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Because a lot of the places around there, they're good, but they're expensive. It's just not the type of thing you'd expect to eat at a convention.

257
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Imagine if the only place you could eat was Ruth Chris Steakhouse. It's good, but you can't really eat every meal there.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So I hope they do have some more options. Maybe a few more food trucks and all that in the future. We'll see what happens with that.

259
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I just found something on Steam, by the way. I went to go look up to vote on YYR's game. I found Bear Simulator.

260
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Did you?

261
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's a game where you're a bear. That's it.

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Why not?

263
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I can't. I'm done.

264
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Some folks in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com were talking about the Clue VCR game thing.

265
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And SG100Matt pointing out, Rob yelled during the Clue VCR tournament,

266
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Just accuse YOLO!

267
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That did happen. Because it wasn't going to end.

268
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And they were like, should we accuse? Should we accuse?

269
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And I was like, just accuse, YOLO!

270
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I was proud of myself. And Bobby and I were totally quoting the lines.

271
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Keep in mind, the Clue VCR game, not the same thing as Clue the movie.

272
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I am your singing telegram. Nope, that's the movie.

273
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Which is phenomenal in itself, but that's not what this was.

274
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is the Clue VCR game.

275
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I was never in Sumatra.

276
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That whole type of thing.

277
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Clue VCR game is quotable in its own cheesy way.

278
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Raginator in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,

279
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How did you like the East Coast winter weather while at MAGFest?

280
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It was fine. I've had colder days in Sacramento.

281
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I guess the weather treated me pretty good out there while I was there.

282
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
There was still some snow on the ground, but not just clumpy snow in different places.

283
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Ermagerd snur.

284
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, pretty much.

285
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So, there you go. I had a good time at MAGFest.

286
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Kudos to the organizers.

287
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I heard there were some bumps in the roads with things like autographs and things like that.

288
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But I honestly didn't notice any of it.

289
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I had a really good time at the con.

290
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I think as far as celebrating games, that is what happened.

291
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And there was just a lot to see and do and a great crowd.

292
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But really, the Colossus yell might be kind of done.

293
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's time for a new thing, I think.

294
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's the only negative thing I can say about the crowd.

295
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What's the Colossus yell?

296
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's from the old X-Men game.

297
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Like it just gets louder and louder as everybody in the room does it.

298
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And I'm just like, OK, stop.

299
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It was funny the first night. Please stop it.

300
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So, there you go.

301
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Alright, that was MAGFest.

302
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So, we're going to talk about our gaming weeks.

303
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But real quick, I wanted to talk about the Pokemon birthday that happened over the weekend.

304
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Pokemon turned 20 years old over the weekend, you guys.

305
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't know if that makes you feel old. It makes me feel a little old.

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Because I remember when the Pokemon anime was first coming stateside and watching all those.

307
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I was more into the anime than the video game, which is a weird thing for me to say.

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That never happens, but it did with Pokemon.

309
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We went to the theater to see the movie.

310
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Me too. We were the only people in the theater.

311
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You and I went.

312
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Not for the first movie. That was me and Precious.

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We went and saw the second or third one together.

314
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah, it was one of the other ones, but you and I went.

315
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We did. I think we saw the third one together.

316
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

317
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But, yeah.

318
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't remember what happened in it.

319
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
How do you feel? Neither do I.

320
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Apparently, they were all streaming on Twitch yesterday.

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They had like, instead of Twitch Plays Pokemon, they had a Twitch Watches Pokemon.

322
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And so, it was kind of like the Bob Ross thing.

323
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It was just, we're going to have a marathon with the chat.

324
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And so, I only caught it at the tail end.

325
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So, unfortunately, you get to watch a lot of it.

326
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But, I guess they did like all the movies back to back to back.

327
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I was kind of surprised that they had the rights to do that.

328
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But, at the same time, you know, those movies are very old at this point.

329
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So, I guess it's no big deal.

330
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I still like Digimon better to this day.

331
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah.

332
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Well, I mean, as far as anime goes, I think Digimon had a better plot.

333
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I just want to quickly mention here in the chat because

334
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt is trying to explain the whole Colossus yell.

335
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The story is that one of the original Magfests, the arcade room, had four X-Men arcade machines.

336
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That was a huge thing at the time and the audio was pumped up.

337
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So, whenever Colossus used his super, you would get the roar.

338
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It happened so much, it became a thing.

339
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Alright, well, we have new arcade games to make things of.

340
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm just saying. I'm just saying.

341
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Maybe I'm old. Get off my lawn. I don't know.

342
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Anyway, Pokemon.

343
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Dark Star, do you have a favorite Pokemon out of the, what, 700 that there are now?

344
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Do you have a favorite out of all the Pokemon?

345
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's a toss-up because I really like Raichu.

346
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But, I'd probably say Eevee.

347
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Actually, no, no, no. What's the one?

348
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Ninetales.

349
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Vulpix?

350
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Whichever one has the Ninetales.

351
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I think that's Vulpix.

352
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
No, I think there is one called Ninetales.

353
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Is there one called Ninetales? Okay.

354
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Because, oh, hold on. Now I have to look.

355
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Just because it's adorable? That's the reason why I like it the most?

356
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
No, because I love Kitsune.

357
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, no, Act F does say there is one named Ninetales.

358
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, which is based off of Kitsune.

359
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Okay.

360
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Which is a fox with Ninetales.

361
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Alright.

362
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And I like mythology.

363
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'll have to Google the picture because I'm not thinking it off the top of my head.

364
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'll find it for you.

365
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
My favorite Pokemon, I'm going to go with a classic.

366
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm going to go with one that's kind of mainstream, but I don't give a shit because she's my favorite.

367
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Jigglypuff is my favorite Pokemon.

368
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And that all is about the anime and how when people fell asleep she would draw on their face with a marker

369
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
because she would sing, they'd fall asleep, she'd get really pissed off that people were sleeping,

370
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
so she'd draw on their face with a marker.

371
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I always love that.

372
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So Jigglypuff is by far my favorite Pokemon.

373
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But there's other ones I love too.

374
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What about you, Loki? Favorite Pokemon?

375
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Come on, I'm dying to know.

376
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't watch Pokemon, but my favorite Pokemon has to be Gendo.

377
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Gendo.

378
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I like that.

379
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's Gendo.

380
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Have you ever seen the Evangelion parody that came from?

381
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yes, that's where I referenced that from.

382
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Oh, that's right. I freaking love that whole thing.

383
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Act F is pointing out that Ninetales is a Vulpix evolution, so I was close.

384
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I was very close.

385
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Here's your dang picture, Rab.

386
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
What was the first Pokemon game you ever played, Darcyra?

387
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Red?

388
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Red.

389
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Dan played red, I played blue.

390
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Mine was actually yellow. I didn't get into it until after the anime.

391
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And I had the little Game Boy color that was a little cheek for Pikachu.

392
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So when you turned it on, the little cheek lit up red. It was adorable.

393
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm just saying.

394
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I had the little Pikachu walker.

395
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The yellow one where he'd bop around on the screen and you could feed him.

396
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And he was like the Digimon Tamagotchi knockoff.

397
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Because Digimon and Tamagotchi came out first.

398
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So are they coming up with any new Pokemon?

399
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Because it seems like they only come up with a couple new ones each time a new game comes out.

400
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Like actual new Pokemon?

401
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah.

402
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Well, I think we're going to get into the games they announced this week in a little bit here.

403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I'm pretty sure that's going to come with a new series of Pokemon.

404
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Like when X and Y came out, they had new Pokemon in them.

405
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So each new generation does have new ones in it.

406
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So I'm sure whatever comes with the new generation will have stuff too.

407
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And don't forget, we have Pokemon Go coming up soon.

408
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Dear Tigerclaw, Digimon is not a clone of Pokemon.

409
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Digimon came out. No, no. Here's your thing.

410
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Tamagotchi led to Digimon come out.

411
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Because it's made by the same company.

412
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Digimon was a versus version of Tamagotchi.

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And the anime came out after all that came out.

414
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So learn your history when it comes to Digimon.

415
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Mic drop.

416
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Isn't that interesting?

417
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You know, that's almost like a moment of Beatmania 2DX just ripped off Guitar Hero.

418
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Remember that whole review that was on, what, X-Play or something?

419
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And where all of us that knew better about what had happened in Japan are sitting here going,

420
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Fuck off!

421
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You know, and that whole thing.

422
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So people here in the States probably didn't know any better.

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Do you think it's possible that maybe Digimon was brought over here to the US because of Pokemon's success?

424
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I mean, would maybe that be a fair thing to say?

425
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
No, because we had Tamagotchi.

426
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, that's true.

427
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I mean, think about it. The whole Digimon anime might have come about because of the Pokemon anime.

428
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But Digimon was a completely different thing.

429
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It never existed as a game until much later, until after the anime had been out.

430
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I see.

431
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
As if memory serves me right.

432
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And on top of that, I've got one of the WonderSwan games and a couple of the PlayStation ones.

433
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And I liked the PlayStation one because it was actually a full battler and everything, a couple of them.

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But no, they had completely different evolutions.

435
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The movie was pretty terrible though.

436
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It actually was really good if you watched the Japanese one.

437
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No, I only saw the US movie.

438
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I've actually got both of the movies. They're really good.

439
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Rama in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,

440
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
In Before Monster Rancher.

441
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of things we have been playing this week.

442
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Pokemon or no? Who knows? We're going to see.

443
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

444
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Come to think of it, I never did see the US one.

445
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't think.

446
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You're probably better off, let's be real.

447
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, because I imported them. Never mind.

448
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Anyway, my gaming week. I got Danganronpa, finally.

449
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Which I can play on my Mac. I'm happy because then I can take it to work and look at the weirdness.

450
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
God, that game is freaky.

451
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And I love it. I love it so much because it's so fucked up.

452
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It's like someone took the formula for Phoenix Wright and made a really fucked up story.

453
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And I love it. It's great.

454
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Also, I want a plushie of Monokuma. So, end of story.

455
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I also played some Dragon Age Inquisition.

456
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I haven't touched any more Dragon's Dogma.

457
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I played some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

458
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
A crapload of Heroes of Dragon Age.

459
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And Neko Atsume. Which isn't really a game so much as just collecting cats.

460
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But I got Guy Furi today.

461
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And I got, like, the Cat Maid Girl.

462
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I have not played that game. It's on my phone, ready to go.

463
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Rob!

464
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I know, I haven't played it. I'm so uncool.

465
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Rob!

466
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What?

467
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But there's so many kitties.

468
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, I know.

469
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And you see their little buttholes.

470
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yes, I'm aware.

471
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I know it's called Neko Atsume or whatever, but it's really kitty butthole.

472
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's really cat butthole.

473
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's really cat butthole simulator. That's what it is.

474
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It should be called, what, Nekoshiri.

475
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So, cat butt. There you go. Cat butts the game.

476
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Alright. Is that it for your gaming week? Cat butts?

477
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Cat butts.

478
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

479
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I mainly just...

480
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Ingress.

481
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Ingress.

482
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's a good one.

483
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I guess that's what I'm saying.

484
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That's alright.

485
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I mainly just played Lego Avengers.

486
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Just to unlock more stuff than that because my son keeps bitching about how he doesn't have enough characters to play.

487
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Most of them are just kind of repeats of each other, but whatever.

488
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So I'm almost done with that.

489
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I've unlocked all the characters that are in all the other hub worlds except for Manhattan because that's the largest one.

490
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And then I've gone through most of the levels as well.

491
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So that's just a matter of just finishing it.

492
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I bought the season pass for Fallout 4 because that's going to be going up in price here pretty soon and the DLC looks pretty awesome.

493
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So hopefully they'll check out in a few weeks. I think it's when the next piece of DLC comes out.

494
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And then, aside from that, I've been trying to program stuff and using Unity 5 and liking that it's using Microsoft Visual Studio instead of stupid other programs.

495
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah, I think I've known that in Ingress a little bit.

496
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I've been mainly just to and from work, but I haven't really had a lot of time.

497
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I played a little bit on the way here though.

498
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
There wasn't much for me to do though.

499
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I was going to take down a few fields and one of them I got to, someone already beat me to it by a few seconds.

500
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And then the other one I took down, but it's not anywhere near me.

501
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But whatever, I did it.

502
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And that was it. I'm running out of gear again.

503
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Alright, we'll get our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

504
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Act F is calling Nico Atsume the take pics of cat butts the game.

505
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Here it is.

506
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Seattle in chat is wondering what the fuck ever happened to Monster Rancher. That's a good question.

507
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't know, it was pretty awesome though.

508
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Pokemon killed them all. That was it, the end.

509
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
My gaming week.

510
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Well, since I had a flight I got to do some handheld gaming.

511
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So I played some more Final Fantasy Monster Rancher basically and played that.

512
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And that was good. I finally got the stupid Summoning Case.

513
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That mission is the hardest because it's half luck based.

514
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But finally once I got past that I was able to do some more missions.

515
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That was fun.

516
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
At MAGFest I did some local co-op with some friends.

517
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That was really fun that we got to do that.

518
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So yeah, that was fun.

519
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So I got to explore that a little bit.

520
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Pun intended.

521
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
A little more this week.

522
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Also, I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV because there was a patch this week.

523
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So a pretty major patch hit Final Fantasy XIV and it adds more story.

524
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There's two more dungeons.

525
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
There's a new raid.

526
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
There's a new Primal fight.

527
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So there's really a lot of content that was sort of badly needed.

528
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So I'm really glad that they've been addressing the content drought.

529
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So I'm hoping they can keep the inertia going into their inevitable next expansion.

530
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Since we know that Square is doing another Fan Fest this year for Final Fantasy XIV,

531
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we know there's going to be expansion at some point probably in the next year.

532
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So hopefully they can keep the inertia going because there's a lot of great stuff in XIV still.

533
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's just people that were playing it aggressively had a long time to wait for anything new.

534
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So I'm glad that they're finally on top of that again.

535
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And they're shutting down 11 for consoles next month.

536
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
They are.

537
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I got the email about that and the little reminder.

538
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It made me a little sad.

539
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I was like, oh, good times.

540
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So yeah, Final Fantasy XI no longer on consoles as of next month.

541
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Don't they still be bringing up the phones or something at some point?

542
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That's supposed to be the thing is that somehow it's going to be on phones, but it'll still be on PC.

543
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The game is not shutting down.

544
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
PC will still be out there.

545
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And honestly, hopefully that will be better for the game because maybe they can do some graphic upgrades and release that on PC.

546
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But then again, supposedly development has stopped on 11.

547
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They're not going to do more expansions or anything like that.

548
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So I don't know.

549
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Well, you know, with the phone market being largely free to play.

550
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah, good luck with that.

551
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Good luck with that.

552
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Dream on.

553
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We'll see.

554
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Speaking of Final Fantasy XIV in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, please no read in chat says that reminds me of Final Fantasy XIV and the Power Man 5000 controversy.

555
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah, I haven't done the new fight myself, but I did watch a YouTube that has the music in it.

556
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Okay, so the music in XIV is badass.

557
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And a lot of it is very themed for different fights.

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Like the Titan song is this rock song.

559
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Get it, rock?

560
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But it's like an awesome little rock song that plays really fast.

561
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It kind of goes like that.

562
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's great.

563
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And then when you fight Ravana, which is one of the newer bosses, it's like a Russian waltz that plays during it.

564
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's really cool.

565
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Well, for this new one, Separat, not Separat, Separat is the new primal or whatever that they have in it.

566
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And it has nothing to do with Separat.

567
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's like a world tree or something as you fight.

568
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I believe Separat was an Esper in VI.

569
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I could be wrong, but I think that was the thing.

570
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But anyway, the music during the second phase of the fight is industrial.

571
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So it's like a Nine Inch Nails sounding song or like, you know, stabbing westward in the 90s or whatever.

572
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Or I guess if you're the lead singer of Power Man 5000, you kind of think, you know, the first minute of the song sounds an awful like When Worlds Collide, which was their one hit they had in the 90s.

573
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So I don't know.

574
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I mean, I don't know.

575
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I guess they're a little similar, but a lot of industrial music has similar openings.

576
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I don't know.

577
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I think it was a big mountain out of a molehill.

578
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And that guy posted that thing.

579
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And then, of course, the Final Fantasy fandom attacked his Facebook like, you ignorant bastard, blah, blah, blah.

580
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then, you know, I don't know.

581
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So it was a little weird.

582
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
SG100Matt says, wow, didn't think Power Man 5000 would be mentioned in the news.

583
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yep, that was a thing that happened this week.

584
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Go check that.

585
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Check out his Facebook page.

586
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It happened.

587
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Anyway.

588
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So also, one other thing.

589
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is very important.

590
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
A lot of you have been waiting for this.

591
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So there was some maintenance on 14.

592
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I couldn't play every day this week because, you know, when there's new patches, there's always going to be some maintenance.

593
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So I was like, what do I play tonight?

594
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I need to find a game to play.

595
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So I was like, let's catch up on the Steam backlog.

596
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So I finally played Undertale.

597
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's right.

598
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Finally, after all this time, I finally installed and played Undertale.

599
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Boy, did it take me a minute to figure out why the fucking thing wouldn't launch.

600
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I had the big, like, I kept launching it and it was just automatically closed.

601
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Launch, closed.

602
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Launch, closed.

603
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I was like, what the hell?

604
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Like, I'm not able to play this game.

605
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't understand.

606
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, apparently, you cannot use the Steam beta and play Undertale.

607
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You have to drop out of the beta, install the regular client, and then you can play Undertale.

608
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Really?

609
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah, that was weird.

610
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm running the beta and I've been playing it.

611
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Maybe it depends on your system or something.

612
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But that was the trick.

613
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Once I dropped out of the beta, it worked fine.

614
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Weird, right?

615
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Very weird.

616
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But finally, once I figured that out, I'm not going to totally hold that against the game.

617
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It was just a weird, frustrating thing.

618
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But once I got into the game, I played through the prologue and a little past that, right?

619
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You know, there's a whole, like, for those that play the game, there's a whole little opening sequence.

620
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And then you get the official Undertale.

621
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And then there's a little more that happens after that.

622
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I can really best define my reaction to Undertale with a classic meme.

623
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And that would be the What Lady.

624
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes, that's the, if you just put what, w-a-t lady into Google, that was me playing Undertale.

625
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And that's the infamous older lady that may or may not have teeth looking into the lens who's wearing some big blue muumuu and it just says what underneath it.

626
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And that was me playing Undertale.

627
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the whole time I was like, what?

628
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But I can see why this game has its fans.

629
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Right from the very beginning, there's a little scene with a flower and it's like, I'm a happy flower that's gonna help you on your adventure.

630
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then the flower goes, and I want you to die! Die, die, die!

631
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And all this crazy stuff and it turns into a mean face and so forth.

632
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I will say, the writing is pretty witty.

633
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And there's just, like, it's got this very ironically underbelly of this really dark stuff on top of the fluffy surface.

634
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Like, what do I mean by that? The big character that's with you in the prologue, what's her name?

635
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The character that is just like a mother?

636
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Toriel.

637
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Toriel?

638
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Toriel.

639
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Toriel. You can even call her mom if you want.

640
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You can also kill her.

641
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You can! But that's the one thing about Undertale that's been spoiled for me.

642
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And if you want zero spoilers, mute real quick, give me 30 seconds.

643
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Okay, the one thing that's been spoiled for me is the fact that you can play completely passively or you can play kill everything, basically.

644
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Or you can play middle of the road.

645
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Or you can play middle of the road.

646
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Which is always recommended, play middle of the road to start.

647
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But knowing in the back of my mind that passive is a thing that you can do, that's how I've been playing it so far.

648
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So I've been trying to chat everything to death, basically.

649
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Which is interesting. I will say, to Undertale's credit, I like that the battle system is something a little different than just fight, run, walk, that whole thing.

650
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yet it still feels old school.

651
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You have this little dot and you want to avoid all the other dots.

652
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What do you call that in gaming? It's just collision detection, basically.

653
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The whole battle system is collision detection.

654
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You might be fighting a boss and all these pickles or something fly at you.

655
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But the green one will restore health if you can grab it, but all the others are bad.

656
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I thought it was a neat little twist on the classic RPG engine.

657
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, I understand why people are super into Undertale.

658
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Because it's kind of fucked up.

659
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But like, you know, in a fun way.

660
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So, there you go.

661
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Act F'ed is explaining the joke that I didn't catch.

662
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Her name is Toriel because, get it, two Toriel.

663
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And that sums up Undertale perfectly.

664
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That joke sums up the Undertale experience perfectly.

665
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But I had fun with it.

666
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Let's see. PleaseNoReadInChat says,

667
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I hit on Toriel first, then did the ass to call her mom.

668
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
She thinks I'm weird.

669
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I wonder why.

670
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm just irritated that two of my favorite characters so far in Danganronpa,

671
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
their fates aren't even spoiled for me.

672
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Aww.

673
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Which is fine because I kind of expected it because I don't take anything for granted.

674
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But still, I actually liked Sakura in that game, and I like Mondo.

675
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Pissed off.

676
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
No spoilers.

677
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
No spoilers. People already know anyway.

678
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Alright. Anyway, so that was my gaming week.

679
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I played mostly Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy Explorers while traveling,

680
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
and then a little bit of Undertale just to finally be like,

681
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
okay, I did it. You can stop sending the emails.

682
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But I enjoyed Undertale enough that I definitely want to play more.

683
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So, yeah.

684
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But even if my expression the whole time was,

685
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
what in the hell?

686
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Loki, do you think you're going to play Undertale at some point?

687
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Eh, probably not.

688
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That's like asking if I'm going to play any of my scene backlog.

689
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Eh, probably not.

690
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Does it mean I'm going to stop playing games?

691
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No, it doesn't.

692
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Alright, so some quick housekeeping here real quick.

693
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Hey, speaking of Magfest, I gotta pimp this.

694
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So even though I was sick as a dog on Saturday at Magfest,

695
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
we did some videos in the Indie Hall,

696
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and the first two are up on our YouTube channel.

697
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Just look for VOG Network on YouTube,

698
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and you can actually see some interviews that we did at Magfest.

699
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We did an interview with YYR about the games he's making like multitasking.

700
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
We also just completely discovered this game we thought was kind of cool

701
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
called That Rock Paper Scissors Game,

702
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
where it's a three-player game,

703
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and one person plays rock, another paper, another scissors,

704
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and you chase each other basically around a big map.

705
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's kind of a silly, simple concept, but it works really well.

706
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Like, who doesn't like those types of multiplayer or living room games?

707
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So we interviewed those guys as well.

708
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Bobby talked to them.

709
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Those videos are up on YouTube, and I just gotta give props to Bobby.

710
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Like, he edited those videos, and he put them together really slick.

711
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I was like, wow, this looks like something that...

712
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
This looks like...

713
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Legit!

714
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Sounds silly to be saying that, but it's how I felt.

715
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So check those videos out over at the VOG Network YouTube.

716
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I know we were not here last week,

717
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and so I hate to say that we're going to be having another missing show,

718
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
but, you know, I have a life and things that I like to do too.

719
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So we do have our next no-show weekend.

720
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's going to be April 3rd.

721
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I will not be here on April 3rd.

722
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Sorry, Loki, I'm probably surprising you with this.

723
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I told her earlier, but I will not be here April 3rd,

724
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
but get this.

725
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You'll get a kick out of this, Loki.

726
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Do you know why I won't be here?

727
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And I'm not coming back.

728
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm going to Tucson, the first, second, and third.

729
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You're going to laugh.

730
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Disneyland?

731
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
No, I'm not going to Disneyland.

732
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm going to Tucson.

733
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You know what's in Tucson?

734
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Racist!

735
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Well, every city has those, but...

736
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Well, I have friends that live in Tucson.

737
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That's very important.

738
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I have some friends in Tucson that I'm going to go visit and say hello to,

739
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
but then I'm also going to do an Ingress anomaly that's on that Saturday,

740
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the second in Tucson.

741
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Go to the Special K's.

742
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
What?

743
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Go to the Special K's.

744
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Is that close to the Phoenix area?

745
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh, the Circle K's or whatever?

746
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, it's like two hours outside Phoenix.

747
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'll get the codes or whatever.

748
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I don't have to do that. It'll be fun.

749
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Our Circle K's gave out codes.

750
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm going to actually go shop there.

751
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm going to be going to Tucson in a few weeks

752
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and visiting some friends that are there

753
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
and doing the Ingress anomaly, and I'm looking forward to that,

754
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
so that'll be fun.

755
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm allowed to take a vacation once in a while,

756
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
such as life.

757
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I don't think you just had an anomaly there.

758
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
In Tucson? No, I don't think so.

759
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Maybe it was in Phoenix, I'm thinking.

760
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I thought they just did that because that's why they have the codes there now.

761
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
No, I don't know.

762
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I don't think it was there. Maybe it was in Phoenix.

763
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Bobby Blackwolf is asking,

764
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Tucson, like an Earthbound convention?

765
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
They do have that.

766
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Earthbound convention is in Tucson,

767
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
but sadly, I think that's in the summer

768
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and I'm not going the right weekend to see that.

769
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So, there you go.

770
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Alright.

771
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Let's move on

772
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and get into this week's news.

773
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I think it's time. You guys have been waiting for it. Loki.

774
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Holy crap, they announced

775
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Pokemon Sun and Moon, and it's coming

776
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
this holiday, and I cannot be more excited

777
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
about this.

778
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Actually, I'm not, because I don't play Pokemon, but

779
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
it's pretty exciting for everybody else that plays

780
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Pokemon, and this is part of their

781
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Pokemon Nintendo Direct,

782
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and of course,

783
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
you know, showing off that there's going to be

784
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
some more products based off that coming out,

785
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
as well as like trading cards, plus toys, all that

786
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
fun stuff. You know, the usual

787
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
marketing stuff, and

788
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
yeah. So,

789
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
it'll be coming out, not really sure yet,

790
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
but holiday sometime.

791
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And that would be on the 3DS.

792
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Are you

793
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
pre-ordering Sun and Moon,

794
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Loki? Yes, I'll pre-order

795
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
that for my 3DS I don't have.

796
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That sounds like a perfect idea. Hey, that'd be totally

797
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
awesome. Let me invest the money in a 3DS

798
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
for them to, you know, put out the

799
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
NX, which will totally,

800
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
you know, just like, hey, it's cool, we

801
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
got a Wii U now, we can get the new Zelda game,

802
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
except that they're maybe

803
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
putting out another system. To Nintendo's

804
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
credit, they're pretty good about the

805
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
backwards compatible thing, though. If they do put out a

806
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
new handheld, it'll probably play the 3DS

807
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
games. I don't think they would put

808
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
all this effort into a new Pokemon game,

809
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
just to instantly antiquate it,

810
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
you know, the same season, if NX

811
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
is out this holiday. Now, that's the thing, is this

812
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
a game that only runs on the new 3DS,

813
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
or is this just, like, 3DS?

814
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
They haven't said, which is, um,

815
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
that could be peculiar, we'll see.

816
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I hope they don't limit it to the new 3DS,

817
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
because that'll lock

818
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
me out, because... Sorry, you can only get 10

819
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Pokemon on the 3DS versions of the game.

820
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm not gonna buy a new 3DS if a

821
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
NX is just around the corner.

822
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm gonna wait till after 3DS.

823
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
The new 3DS seems like the DSI to me.

824
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's, like, kind of unnecessary.

825
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Which is, I mean, it's fine, they can do

826
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
an upgrade of the system for the people that still haven't come on

827
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
board or whatever, or the real diehards

828
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
who must have the new technology, but I don't,

829
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
you know, there's no game on

830
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
the new 3DS that I want to play

831
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
that's exclusive to that. They have,

832
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
yes, I know there's Xenoblade, but I can play that on Wii.

833
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And there was, what, one other game, I think?

834
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So, there's really

835
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
nothing that I need the new 3DS for.

836
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Let me just drop some of the prices of the first-party Wii U

837
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
games. Please.

838
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Anyway,

839
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'll check out

840
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Pokemon Moon. I like Pokemon Moon

841
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
because it makes me think of butts. So, there you go.

842
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Darsakha, would you play

843
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Pokemon Moon because butts?

844
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Probably not.

845
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I haven't played, honestly,

846
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
to be serious, I haven't played any

847
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Pokemon games in ages.

848
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I didn't think X and Y were that bad.

849
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It was a very different, like, look for the series,

850
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
but I thought the battles were kind of interesting.

851
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
The fact that they were able to

852
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
modernize it a bit. So, I'm curious how they might take that

853
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
a step further for Sun and Moon. So, we'll see.

854
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Anyhow, Nintendo

855
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
also this week

856
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
released a fiscal year update

857
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
revising their

858
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
fiscal year projections for the year

859
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
ending March 31st.

860
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Because, you know, fiscal years run like

861
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
April to April. They don't start

862
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
like the way the calendar does.

863
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
They have scaled back the sales and profit

864
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
expectations, as well as

865
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
projections for 3DS sales.

866
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
This is because the holiday quarter had

867
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
a drop in profits.

868
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
They fell short of their 3DS

869
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
goal of 7.6 million units

870
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
sold by 1 million.

871
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It also says the

872
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
software shortfall of 9 million

873
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
down to 47 million units.

874
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So, unfortunately, the

875
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
DS projections, it didn't go

876
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
as good as they'd hoped.

877
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
They did, though, admittedly

878
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
highballed. I seem to remember discussing this when it first

879
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
came out, and I remember thinking, like,

880
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
the DS projections were kind of highballed

881
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
to begin with. Interestingly enough,

882
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
though, Wii U projections were

883
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
unchanged. So,

884
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
that's, you know, the Wii U,

885
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
you know, didn't underperform

886
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
or anything like that.

887
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Amiibo sales were still strong, however,

888
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
but the operating income and profit

889
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
projections did have to be lowered.

890
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The upcoming fiscal year will

891
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
include things like Star Fox Zero,

892
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The Legend of Zelda for Wii U, Bravely

893
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Second, and two Dragon Quest ports.

894
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Of course, this could also mean

895
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
the NX,

896
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
but we won't know any of that

897
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
details until after E3.

898
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So, alright.

899
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Let's move on. DarkSakura.

900
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Well,

901
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Ubisoft has taken

902
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
some crap

903
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
for reasons. However, now

904
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
they are looking to be acquired by

905
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Vivendi, I'm sure.

906
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah, I know.

907
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I kind of laugh, too.

908
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So, basically,

909
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
what happened is that Vivendi purchased

910
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
140 million euros

911
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
worth of shares in Ubisoft,

912
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
which brings their stake in the company

913
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
up to 10.39%,

914
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and so the CEO

915
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
of Ubisoft calls this an unwelcome

916
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
move, and wants

917
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
to retain its independence from

918
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
what could be a hostile takeover.

919
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So, they have

920
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
approached

921
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
different investors,

922
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
shareholders in Canada,

923
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
to see if they can invest more

924
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
so that they can maintain

925
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
ownership of the company.

926
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So, right now,

927
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and the

928
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
CEO is Yves Guillemot,

929
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
and his family

930
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
owns 9% of the Ubisoft

931
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
stock, and then

932
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
two of the major shareholders,

933
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
which are BlackRock and Fidelity,

934
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
own 15% together,

935
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
and they're on his side, but he needs

936
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
50% of the

937
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
vote to block Vivendi.

938
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So, he's really pushing

939
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
for it, and

940
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
basically,

941
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
his whole thing is that, you know,

942
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
if Vivendi takes over,

943
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
then the most loyal

944
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
employees to the company

945
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
are going to be leaving the company, which would

946
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
leave them with nothing

947
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
major. So,

948
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
they're hoping to keep it

949
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
out of Vivendi's hands.

950
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So, strange that Vivendi

951
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
kind of got out of the business

952
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
with the whole Activision stuff,

953
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
just to be wanting to get right back in. That's very

954
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
strange to me. They acquired

955
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Gameloft

956
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
earlier this week, and

957
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
bought more shares. So,

958
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
yeah, they're not out. Curious

959
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
what their long-term plan is over

960
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
there, but of course, when you're trying to take over

961
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
companies, you don't really make a lot of comments on that.

962
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So, we'll see.

963
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Moving on, Loki.

964
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Alright, so,

965
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
PlayStation TV,

966
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
unfortunately, is going to be discontinued

967
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
in Japan.

968
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Just didn't quite hit it off as

969
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
well as they thought it would. I mean,

970
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
it's dropped in in price

971
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
very low. In fact,

972
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
it originally started off at

973
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
around $100. Now, it's around

974
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
$40, probably even cheaper. I know I got mine for

975
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
$30.

976
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Just, you know,

977
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
unfortunately, it didn't

978
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
seem to

979
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
do well with consumers.

980
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
They didn't really know why.

981
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Basically saying you could use it as

982
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
a video streaming device.

983
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's like a mini-console, almost.

984
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But,

985
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
unfortunately, there's not a lot of people

986
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
using them.

987
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So, it's too bad. I don't use mine either, unfortunately.

988
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah, interesting, because the

989
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Vita seems to show more strength

990
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
in Japan. You know, we actually

991
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
have Japanese Vita release dates,

992
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
which kind of disappeared

993
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and died here in the States.

994
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And maybe that's why those people take the Vita

995
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and they're purchasing the Vita and not the

996
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
PlayStation TV.

997
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
That's true, because, well,

998
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Japan is a more handheld-driven

999
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
industry. We got a lot

1000
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
more people to play on transportation

1001
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and so forth, so maybe the TV thing

1002
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
was just kind of a

1003
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
not-so-great idea. But I'm still

1004
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
a little surprised to hear that.

1005
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Hmm.

1006
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Alright, let's see.

1007
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Going to Brad from

1008
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
PodCulture in our chatroom over at

1009
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
live.vognetwork.com, says, you can play Vita games.

1010
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
That is why I got one. You can play most

1011
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Vita games, right? Some of them are still locked out on the

1012
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
TV for some weird reason. And then there was

1013
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that whole thing with the workaround

1014
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
and all this. PleaseNoRead

1015
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
in our chat says, good, I bought my

1016
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
PSTV for 20 bucks and it's got to be the worst

1017
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
console ever made.

1018
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It's not the worst, but it's not...

1019
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't know about the worst, but...

1020
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Let's put it this way. For the price that I paid,

1021
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
it's way

1022
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
better than the Ouya was, and it's way more

1023
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
functional than it was, so

1024
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I would say it is a pretty decent

1025
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
console. And what I was planning on using

1026
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
it for is mainly just playing

1027
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
classic PlayStation

1028
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
games, that type of thing on there.

1029
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
PS1 games. PS1 games, also

1030
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Vita games that I

1031
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
have in my library, because I don't really have a

1032
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Vita anymore, so I have a bunch of

1033
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
games in my library that I wanted to check out,

1034
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
but the problem is, I don't play a lot of them

1035
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
because I have a lot of them.

1036
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
They're like multi-console games.

1037
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Some of them are on PlayStation 4 and

1038
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Vita, so it's like, well, why am I going to play

1039
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the Vita version when I have the PlayStation 4 version?

1040
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Right. Well, more news out of

1041
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Sony, going from

1042
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
basically what is the past now to the

1043
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
future. Sony has sent out

1044
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
invitations to a special press event

1045
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
that will be occurring in San Francisco on

1046
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
March 15th, and it is going

1047
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
to be all about PlayStation

1048
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
VR, and funny

1049
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
enough, this is timed quite appropriately

1050
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
with Game Developers Conference,

1051
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
so I think this is our big

1052
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
event that we've been waiting for.

1053
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Was it the rumor that we were supposed to find out about the pricing

1054
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
stuff around that time period?

1055
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I don't know if it was the rumor so much as

1056
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
the expectation is that if Sony

1057
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
is going to put this out in the first half of the year

1058
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
still, which may or may not be true,

1059
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
but it does seem like if they're going to say

1060
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
it now, then it's before the holiday

1061
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
period, because if they were going to wait until the

1062
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
holiday period, they would have just

1063
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
waited until E3, I think, but I

1064
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
do think this gives a good

1065
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
precedent that it'll

1066
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
probably be out in the summer.

1067
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I don't know still about the whole first half

1068
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
of the year, but maybe like summer, maybe

1069
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
June, if June counts as first half of the year,

1070
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
then maybe it'll make that, which

1071
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I guess it would, wouldn't it, because it is the sixth month.

1072
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But I'm like, if it's like

1073
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
late July, cut them a little

1074
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
slack, it's not the end of the world.

1075
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So yeah, the

1076
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
event will be on March 15th, and

1077
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
we are expecting to hear the price,

1078
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
the date, and

1079
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
the launch lineup. So, you know, when you're

1080
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
rolling out a new piece of hardware like that, that's going to

1081
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
be a pretty lengthy conference.

1082
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I'm pretty excited about it, I'm thinking about picking that up.

1083
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I mean, I almost bought a

1084
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Gear VR today, but then I was like kind of

1085
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
reading some reviews on it, and it's just,

1086
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
it doesn't seem like it'd be that interesting.

1087
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
For me, it's really about the software.

1088
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
What are the games going to be? And I've got

1089
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
to be honest, Res alone,

1090
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
even though, you know, that game is years

1091
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
old, it's still, I'm like, ooh, that is an

1092
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
experience I really want to try, and that's

1093
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
in the PlayStation VR.

1094
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Res would be pretty amazing, actually.

1095
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
You know, like most consoles,

1096
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I've got to have three. I'm going to have to have

1097
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
like the three must-have games before I'm

1098
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
finally going to break and buy the console.

1099
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Because I'm treating PlayStation VR

1100
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
as a console at this point because I expect

1101
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
it's going to be priced like one.

1102
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I would expect it's going to be

1103
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I really think

1104
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I'm going to say

1105
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
$5.99

1106
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
just because that way if it's $4.99

1107
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'll be pleasantly surprised.

1108
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I think $5.99

1109
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
is going to be too expensive.

1110
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The hopefulist in me says $4.99, the realist

1111
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
in me says $5.99. I would think $4.99

1112
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
at the highest. I would hope

1113
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
it's $3.99, but

1114
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I don't know if it's,

1115
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I don't think it would be. But I mean

1116
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
it's just going to be a hard sell if it's

1117
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
$4.99, I think. Because you're talking about

1118
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
it's way more than the actual console.

1119
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
This is going to be a blue chip piece technology.

1120
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
This is not going to be for everybody. This is going to be

1121
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
for a very select audience

1122
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
of gamers. So

1123
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
this is aimed at 30-somethings

1124
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
with disposable income.

1125
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I think it's what a 20 and 30-somethings

1126
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
would have to be. We'll see how much it is because

1127
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
if it's too expensive, I'll just pass on that too.

1128
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Bobby Blackwolf

1129
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
pointing out if it was going to be cheaper than the

1130
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
X5, they would have announced that by now.

1131
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Not necessarily.

1132
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Not necessarily. Maybe they want to

1133
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
strike while the iron is hot,

1134
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
get the pre-orders, and maybe the console

1135
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
will be coming right out. Who knows?

1136
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But I think it's a fair

1137
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
counterpoint.

1138
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Alright, let's move on

1139
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
while we wait for March 15th.

1140
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Dark Sakura.

1141
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Well, we've off and on talked about

1142
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Leland E. And for those who

1143
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
don't know, he was the

1144
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Democratic Senator for

1145
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
California for San Francisco.

1146
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
He's finally been

1147
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
sentenced

1148
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
for five years in prison

1149
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and a $20,000 fine.

1150
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
He actually did

1151
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
plead to the racketeering charge.

1152
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So for his plea deal, he

1153
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
also admitted to

1154
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
exchanging

1155
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
official acts for

1156
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
money conspiring to traffic

1157
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and weapons and money laundering.

1158
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And so his lawyer

1159
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
said that he is

1160
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
a 67-year-old man who has

1161
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
accepted his responsibility

1162
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
for his conduct. That he's led an otherwise

1163
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
exemplary life as a family man

1164
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and an active voice for the betterment of society.

1165
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, while he's exchanging

1166
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
political favors for

1167
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
weapons.

1168
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Bye, Felicia.

1169
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
He also agreed to

1170
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
forfeit $33,000 in campaign

1171
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
contributions that were part

1172
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
of his fund to run

1173
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
for Secretary of State for California.

1174
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And he also,

1175
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
his anti-video game

1176
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
law was, of course, struck

1177
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
down as unconstitutional

1178
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
that it violated the First Amendment.

1179
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Which is why we bring him up now.

1180
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You know, if in case you forgot,

1181
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
he was the big driving

1182
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
force behind trying to

1183
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
basically censor video

1184
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
games at the retail level.

1185
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And all this time,

1186
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I mean, the irony of the fact that he was living

1187
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
a Grand Theft Auto life while he

1188
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
was trying to get Grand Theft Auto banned.

1189
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Well, let's not also forget.

1190
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
His bill

1191
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
was signed into law

1192
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
by Schwarzenegger.

1193
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And it would have

1194
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
fined retailers $2,000

1195
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
per instance of selling

1196
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
M-rated games to minors.

1197
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And would have also required

1198
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
additional warning labels

1199
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
of what a mature

1200
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
game entails.

1201
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So, yeah.

1202
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Bye, Felicia.

1203
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Do not pass Go.

1204
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Do not collect $200.

1205
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That's the last time we'll ever have to bring him up on the show.

1206
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I hope.

1207
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Unless we're here in five

1208
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
years talking about his parole.

1209
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
But I figured it was at least worth mentioning.

1210
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It is worth mentioning.

1211
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Closing the book on that whole thing.

1212
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Anyway.

1213
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Let's try and talk about some

1214
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
release dates. We're gonna travel around the world and check out some

1215
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
games that you will be able to walk

1216
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
into a store and buy without question.

1217
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And without getting carded and all that stuff.

1218
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So, Loki, starting us off in the US.

1219
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Alright, so we've got

1220
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Elekhine's Gun

1221
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
on PlayStation 4

1222
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and Xbox One.

1223
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Return to Popolo Cross, a story

1224
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
of seasons fairytale on

1225
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
3DS.

1226
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Darkrai Primal coming out on

1227
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
PC.

1228
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Mortal Kombat XL edition.

1229
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
The one that has the DLC included

1230
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
with it. That is coming out on

1231
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

1232
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Let's see.

1233
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And then finally,

1234
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess HD.

1235
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That's coming out on Wii U

1236
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
this week.

1237
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That's it. Let's go to Japan.

1238
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Right now. And check out some release dates

1239
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
over there. Some price reductions on the PlayStation 4

1240
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
for Assassin's Creed Unity and

1241
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Far Cry 4 as they move into the best series

1242
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
on March 3rd. But as far as new games

1243
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
go, Gundam Breaker 3 and Life

1244
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
is Strange gets its Japanese version

1245
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
on March 3rd. Those on

1246
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
the PlayStation 4.

1247
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
On the PlayStation 3,

1248
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
no new games, but you get that same price reduction

1249
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
on Assassin's Creed Rogue and Far Cry

1250
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
4. Nothing of note on the

1251
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Wii U, although we do have

1252
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess HD

1253
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
coming out on March 10th.

1254
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So we're getting very, very close

1255
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
to that. On the PlayStation Vita,

1256
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
which you can, you know, not play on your TV

1257
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
anymore, I suppose. Gundam Breaker 3

1258
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
is out there as well. There's also a brand

1259
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
new Vita starter kit in Aqua

1260
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Blue and Glacier White.

1261
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And then there's a new game on the Vita.

1262
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Chalet no Atelier Plus,

1263
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Kukon no Ume no Renken Jutsu

1264
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
comes out on the PlayStation Vita.

1265
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS

1266
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
this week in Japan, Haiku

1267
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
cross team match

1268
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
regular and cross game box.

1269
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm not sure what that all entails. Must be like

1270
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
a limited edition type thing.

1271
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And just for you, Dark Sakura,

1272
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Doraemon!

1273
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Shin no Bita no Nippon Tanjuu

1274
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
comes out. I'm not really a big fan of Doraemon.

1275
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Really? I always thought that was something you were into.

1276
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I think he's cute.

1277
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
You know, a cat with no ears.

1278
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So I looked up that Haiku cross

1279
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
team match and the special kit that it comes with.

1280
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It's like a little, like the game comes in a

1281
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
tin. And by the way, this is like a little

1282
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
fighting game. It looks like an old school Street Fighter 2

1283
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
type of game. So I think this is just supposed to be

1284
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
like a, I don't know, just a little

1285
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
cute little

1286
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
extras that come with it. Cause you know they love

1287
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
collector's editions of Japan. They really do.

1288
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You thought we have a lot here.

1289
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Check there. Dark Sakura, how about the

1290
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
UK? On March 1st we have

1291
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Deponia Doomsday for Mac and PC.

1292
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Screen cheat for

1293
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Xbox One. X-Blaze code embryo

1294
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
for PC.

1295
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Let me move on to the next days. On the

1296
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
second, Bus Simulator 16

1297
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
for Mac and PC.

1298
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Bus Simulator? Is it a school bus?

1299
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
School bus.

1300
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
By the way, I found that album

1301
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
is on iTunes.

1302
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Is it really? I was listening to school.

1303
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I added it to all my Apple music. Of course you did.

1304
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Cause whatever.

1305
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And then on March 3rd is

1306
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Black Desert Online

1307
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
for PC.

1308
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I think it's in

1309
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I can't see the label on the thing.

1310
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm trying to pull it up.

1311
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But at a distance, or in the little tiny

1312
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
characters. Yeah, it's in Korean.

1313
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Act F'd

1314
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
in chat says Magic School Bus Simulator?

1315
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You know this whole thing does

1316
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
remind me though, I need American Truck Simulator.

1317
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That came out not that long ago on Steam.

1318
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I need to get that.

1319
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Those games are actually

1320
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
really fun. I don't know if you play them.

1321
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's very zen.

1322
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Like I imagine driving cross country probably

1323
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
is. More like

1324
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
how many caffeine pills can you take before

1325
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
you pass out

1326
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and crash your bus

1327
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
or your truck

1328
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
into the ravine

1329
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
where you die.

1330
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Did you see, this is going to be totally random

1331
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
but I don't even care. That's what we do on this show.

1332
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Did you see that series of tweets that was on

1333
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Twitter about the mega bus

1334
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
this week where the person tweeted

1335
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
like, they're pulling over

1336
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
the mega bus. Something's wrong with the mega bus.

1337
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And then the next tweet was a picture

1338
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and it goes, mega bus is on fire.

1339
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
What?

1340
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
The next tweet was update, mega bus

1341
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
exploded. And there was a big

1342
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
picture of the exploded mega bus.

1343
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It was kind of sad. Mega bus.

1344
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It was like life on Twitter.

1345
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Mega bus?

1346
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
You never heard of mega bus? No.

1347
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's like a Greyhound alternative.

1348
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Apparently they're extremely terrible.

1349
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Are they? I haven't heard horrible things about them.

1350
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
They'll remind me never to be on one.

1351
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Moving on.

1352
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

1353
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And then hopefully this show won't blow up

1354
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
and we can get to the classic game of the week.

1355
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
But first, Dark Sakura with news.

1356
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I have news?

1357
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Oh no, I'm just kidding. It's Loki, not Dark Sakura.

1358
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I was going to say, um,

1359
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
so EA has abandoned their

1360
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
trademark filing for ghosts.

1361
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
There will be no ghost games coming from

1362
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
EA anymore.

1363
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So, sorry.

1364
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I know you guys were all looking forward to

1365
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Battlefield 5, really

1366
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
spooky ghost edition, but

1367
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
not going to be happening.

1368
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Instead, this was originally

1369
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Ubisoft, I guess, was objecting to

1370
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
EA's attempt to trademark ghosts since

1371
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
they have ghost recon and a lot of the

1372
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
other Tom Clancy games and that type of stuff.

1373
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So now

1374
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
they've just decided not to do it.

1375
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And no idea what it was

1376
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
supposed to be intended for, but

1377
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
they've dropped it.

1378
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So we'll never know

1379
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
what the ghost game was from EA.

1380
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Nope.

1381
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
We won't, and nor will we care.

1382
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
But we can still get, you know,

1383
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
what was it, Tom Clancy ghost recon?

1384
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
That's still okay, though, right?

1385
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Yep, we should have Tom Clancy's Ghost

1386
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Hunters. That would be awesome,

1387
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
actually. Where they just go, like,

1388
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
search for

1389
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
EMF Fields.

1390
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Hey, it's a...

1391
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Try to record, was it white noise?

1392
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Or not white noise, uh...

1393
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I forget what they call those.

1394
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
The Supernatural Ghost Hunters?

1395
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Not the white noise, I forget, like, I used to be real into

1396
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
that shit, and I can't remember what the fuck they call

1397
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
that shit, um...

1398
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It's not white noise, it's, uh...

1399
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Fuck, I can't remember. Eh, who cares?

1400
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It, um...

1401
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Ghost voices or whatever, it's something.

1402
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Alright, I'm gonna move on.

1403
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Another week, another

1404
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Nintendo NX rumor, that's right.

1405
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
It seems like these are a dime a dozen, these

1406
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
NX rumors. I don't know why we keep

1407
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
reporting them here on OLR, but apparently

1408
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
each one of these rumors, no, really,

1409
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I mean, this is from a trusted source.

1410
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
This is, uh, this is it.

1411
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
This is a trusted source, and, you know, you can

1412
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
believe this. So, one of the big NX

1413
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
rumors this week is that

1414
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the NX will officially launch

1415
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
this year, and the Legend

1416
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
of Zelda, the new one, is a

1417
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
launch window game. So, we may be

1418
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
in it, and this is something that people have been

1419
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
speculating for a while, is that we may be in a similar

1420
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
situation when we were

1421
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
expecting the Legend of Zelda on the

1422
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
GameCube, and it ended up also

1423
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
being a launch title for the Wii.

1424
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
We may be looking at a very similar situation

1425
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
here with the new Legend of Zelda.

1426
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And then the same thing happened with

1427
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
the Zelda on the Game Boy

1428
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Color that was on

1429
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
the Advance. That was the Oracle of

1430
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Seasons and Ages, right? Where you had, like, the special

1431
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Advance

1432
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
shop, I think, that you could get if

1433
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
you played it on an Advance. So,

1434
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
you know, Zelda

1435
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
has done this before.

1436
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
There is a precedent. But, anyway,

1437
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
apparently this source is

1438
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
someone who works directly at Nintendo,

1439
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
and, you know,

1440
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
it makes sense, though,

1441
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
if the NX is coming out this year, and if Zelda Wii U

1442
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
is coming out this year, it's

1443
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
probably happening on the NX as well, but we'll see what

1444
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
happens.

1445
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
To register participation

1446
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
for this week's episode of Orange Andredi

1447
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
with VoGnetwork.com, use the past

1448
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
phrase, DIRT.

1449
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Also, more

1450
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
NX rumors, and this is something

1451
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
from a rumor spiller

1452
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
named Geno, who has

1453
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
released other information in the past,

1454
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
such as that Pokemon was going to be

1455
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
in a 3D engine, and that it would have

1456
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
a fairy type, that

1457
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
PlayStation 4 was going to have modern day

1458
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
graphics on a DirectX level like Unreal Engine

1459
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
4 and Frostbite 2,

1460
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Microsoft's Omni Projection unit

1461
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
that turned out to be the Illumeroom,

1462
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
so here is some of the

1463
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
juicy stuff he's saying about NX.

1464
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
There will be a, oh, your favorite

1465
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
word is coming up, DarkSagra.

1466
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
There's going to be an HDMI

1467
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
dongle that attaches

1468
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
to the television. It uses

1469
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
wireless HDMI technology.

1470
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's a very similar

1471
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
type of streaming thing that the

1472
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Wii U uses today, except

1473
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
now it's evolved.

1474
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
As speaking of Pokemon. Has the porn industry

1475
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
created the dongle?

1476
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
The dongle? I don't know,

1477
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
you're asking the wrong guy.

1478
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
This device will stream

1479
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
via the HDMI dongle

1480
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
to the TV, so you won't even need

1481
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
an HDMI cable. That's kind of interesting,

1482
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
actually. The analog

1483
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
controls have motors for

1484
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
haptic feedback, so if you hit

1485
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
a wall, the sticks will move away

1486
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
from the wall to simulate hitting it.

1487
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
That seems kind of cool, and something

1488
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
that I'm surprised we haven't seen before.

1489
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Supposedly there will be a Bluetooth

1490
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
syncing with tons of

1491
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
devices, smartphones,

1492
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
tablets. I wonder if this is where

1493
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
those earlier rumors about the

1494
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
smartphones and the PS4s and all that came from

1495
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
is through some type of Bluetooth integration.

1496
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
That could be interesting. You can

1497
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
answer phone calls and display

1498
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
text messages from your phone

1499
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
onto the NX. So

1500
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
does that mean I could be playing a video

1501
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
game and somebody could send me a text

1502
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
message and it's going to display on the TV while I'm playing

1503
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
the game? That could be interesting. Wait a second.

1504
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
You're telling me that there's going to be some sort of

1505
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
network integration with this system? I don't

1506
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
believe it. You know what?

1507
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
What? I have a phone

1508
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and it gets messages.

1509
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Can an Apple TV

1510
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
display text messages like that?

1511
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I don't have an Apple TV. Why are you

1512
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
looking at me? I thought

1513
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
because you have an Apple Watch, I figured you

1514
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
have the TV too. Silly me.

1515
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Alright. I

1516
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
actually don't know if you can.

1517
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I can get text messages on my Mac though. How about this?

1518
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
How about this Nintendo?

1519
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
How about you focus on fucking making the

1520
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
networking work correctly instead of trying to

1521
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
integrate your fucking text messages from your

1522
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
phone onto your TV because

1523
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
guess what? If

1524
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
my phone is fucking synced with the TV

1525
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
anyways or whatever the system is,

1526
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I probably have my fucking phone in my hand

1527
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
already. So what's the point of

1528
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
needing that on the TV? Well,

1529
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
the tech uses apparently the

1530
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
same hardware layout as the PlayStation 4

1531
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
and Xbox One and they're saying

1532
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
a 130 party

1533
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
developer said it's the easiest device we've

1534
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
ever developed for you. Take your code, compile it

1535
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
and it works.

1536
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And look to Pokemon Go

1537
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
to get an idea of the

1538
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
social features that will be in NX.

1539
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
This will take multiplayer, AR,

1540
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
and the StreetPass concept to a whole new

1541
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
level. And they're saying the strengths of the device are

1542
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
usability and ease of use.

1543
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Visually and functionally,

1544
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
it is as if

1545
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
the Samsung and the Nintendo 2DS

1546
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
had a baby. The operating

1547
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
system is Nintendos.

1548
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That's adorable, I'm sorry.

1549
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Nintendos is the operating

1550
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
system. Even you're smiling, Loki.

1551
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's kind of cute. It's cute. Shut up.

1552
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It's cheesy, whatever.

1553
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I love it. Nintendos

1554
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
is the operating system and it has

1555
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
a lot of the modern features of mobile

1556
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
operating system. Nintendo is being

1557
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
careful in showing it off because they're

1558
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
afraid that it would be mistaken as

1559
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
running Android, which was an

1560
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
earlier rumor about this device,

1561
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
interestingly enough. Remember that? That Nintendo was

1562
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
supposedly running an Android thing on

1563
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
its console. So maybe

1564
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
those link together somehow. I don't

1565
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
know. But anyway, again,

1566
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
huge rumors. Get your

1567
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
salt licks. We don't know any of this to be true.

1568
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
But it's fun to speculate.

1569
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So, there you go.

1570
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I mean, there's nothing in

1571
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
there that strikes me as

1572
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
what a bunch of horseshit.

1573
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I actually think the idea of

1574
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
playing a game and having

1575
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
a text message come up on your screen

1576
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
while you're playing the game is actually

1577
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
kind of an interesting idea. That's

1578
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
why I was asking if Apple

1579
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
already had that built into their ecosystem.

1580
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I mean, whatever. That's fine if they want

1581
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
to do that.

1582
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It's only

1583
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
between the computers and the phones anyway.

1584
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And watch.

1585
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Dark Tetsuya in Chat says

1586
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I do agree Nintendos is

1587
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
adorable. I hope that part is real

1588
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
at least. Yeah, me too.

1589
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
That's just as adorable as Glados was.

1590
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So, you know. Well, maybe

1591
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
it'll offer you cake.

1592
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
And then you find out there actually isn't

1593
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
cake at the end.

1594
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It's kind of like how they offered me, you know,

1595
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
DJ Hero and Fucking Saints

1596
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Row on the 3DS. And then there wasn't

1597
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
a Fucking DJ Hero and Saints Row on

1598
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
the 3DS. The broadband

1599
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
adapter is a lie. But there was

1600
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Fucking Submarine Game that I didn't give a

1601
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
shit about. That was on the 3DS.

1602
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Woo hoo! 3DS.

1603
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And Fucking Cubic Ninja or whatever the fuck that

1604
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
was. It's like, woo. Like a Box Boy.

1605
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Box Boy or whatever. Yeah, it's like

1606
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's like, I don't

1607
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I've made you a shirt. It has

1608
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
two letters on it. QQ

1609
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Alright.

1610
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Let's

1611
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
travel back. Let's travel back to a

1612
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
simpler time when there was

1613
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
no rumors on consoles. You

1614
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
read about it in the magazine and

1615
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
it was fucking fat. And then it didn't come out.

1616
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And then it never came out.

1617
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1618
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Dark Soccer's gonna step into what's left of the vault

1619
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and find a game that she- The vault is

1620
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
still there. We're just downsizing

1621
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
the extra. We're cutting the

1622
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
chaff. The downsized

1623
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and the outsourced vault.

1624
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
We're sharing the vault. You are outsourcing

1625
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
parts of it to other players. We're sharing the vault with

1626
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
other people for money. Alright.

1627
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
We'll rent a ColecoVision.

1628
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
The classic game of the week.

1629
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Dark Soccer, what did you find in the vault that you think

1630
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Hey, Bratz

1631
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
you should be playing this game. And actually, I gotta say

1632
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
yet again, here's a game you picked this week

1633
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
where I'm going, how has this never been

1634
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
a game? How was this never

1635
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
picked? This game is legendary.

1636
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
How many

1637
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
games are there in the world, Rob?

1638
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
There's a lot, actually.

1639
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I know, right? There's a lot of games. And hey,

1640
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I picked crap last time, so I picked a good one

1641
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
this time. Alright, so

1642
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
here it is. What is your classic game of the week?

1643
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Spy Hunter.

1644
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
You can hear it very

1645
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
faintly.

1646
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Anyway,

1647
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Spy Hunter came out in 1983

1648
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
by Valley Midway.

1649
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And it basically

1650
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
was supposed to be

1651
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
a James Bond game.

1652
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But they didn't get the license for it.

1653
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So basically, you're driving down roads

1654
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
in what's called the interceptor

1655
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
car, which can destroy other enemies

1656
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
with different weapons, so it's like the James Bond

1657
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
car, you know.

1658
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It had sit-down versions and stand-up

1659
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
versions, which of course

1660
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
the stand-up ones were more common because they could just be

1661
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
integrated into any old cabinet design.

1662
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It had a steering wheel

1663
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
that had the aircraft-style steering wheel.

1664
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
And you also

1665
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
had a stick shift for low and high

1666
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
gears and a pedal.

1667
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
There were many, many ports. There was even

1668
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
a pinball version.

1669
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Sequels, a new

1670
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
version of the game's everything.

1671
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And a movie that had

1672
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
The Rock in it.

1673
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Oh, don't ask me.

1674
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I didn't see it.

1675
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So it is, you know, a scrolling

1676
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
down,

1677
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
vertical scrolling driving

1678
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
game. You have a top-down perspective.

1679
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And you are driving

1680
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
the G6155

1681
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
interceptor.

1682
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah, you just go around

1683
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
shooting stuff and you can get like

1684
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
augmented weapons

1685
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
like different machine guns and things by

1686
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
entering a weapons van.

1687
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And you can summon

1688
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
your van by clicking

1689
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
you press

1690
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
a blinking

1691
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
weapons van button that would show

1692
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
up. And you get like oil slick

1693
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
smokescreen, surface-to-air missiles,

1694
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
stuff like that. And you have

1695
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
limited ammo for those and you'll lose

1696
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
them if the car is destroyed. You also have a little

1697
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
dashboard that shows you what you've got

1698
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
when. You can also

1699
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
convert the car to

1700
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
a go fast boat.

1701
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Vroom. By driving through

1702
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
a boathouse that will appear from the side

1703
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
of the road.

1704
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
So it's kind

1705
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
of an infinite game. It has no ending.

1706
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You play until you die. Until you run out of money.

1707
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
So basically, the guy that

1708
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
created

1709
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
the game, George

1710
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Gomez, was inspired by audio

1711
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
cassette tape music from

1712
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
the James Bond movies. And he worked with Tom

1713
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Leon who

1714
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
the two of them worked together on Tron.

1715
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So pretty cool. And of course

1716
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
it plays the Peter Gunn theme in the background.

1717
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So they wanted to have

1718
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
the James Bond theme. They were trying to get the

1719
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
license. And like I said, they couldn't get it.

1720
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So Peter Gunn it is.

1721
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
There was also a pinball version

1722
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
that came out in 1984 by Bally.

1723
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Since it was Bally Midway that put

1724
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
out the game. They had the license.

1725
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I don't think I've ever played a Spy Hunter table.

1726
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It's alright.

1727
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But Spy Hunter also had a sequel

1728
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Spy Hunter 2 in 1987.

1729
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And it had a co-op 2 player.

1730
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But instead of the

1731
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
top down, it had the 3D perspective

1732
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
from above and behind the car.

1733
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Excuse me. Also

1734
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Sunsoft in Japan had

1735
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
reprogrammed the game for the

1736
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
NES. And they also did

1737
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Battle Formula which was

1738
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
kind of much like

1739
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
it. But

1740
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
they were trying to avoid copyright infringement

1741
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
so they had

1742
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
a different front cover and everything.

1743
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So crazy.

1744
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And outside of Japan

1745
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
it was released as Super Spy Hunter.

1746
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Let's see what we had for other

1747
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
releases.

1748
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Yeah, so

1749
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
they were going to be doing

1750
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
a movie that did

1751
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
not go into production that had

1752
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
The Rock.

1753
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
All kinds of other stuff

1754
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
going on with that one. Yeah, I didn't really pay

1755
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
much attention to movie stuff when it was happening.

1756
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
So

1757
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
as far as different versions, we've

1758
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
had

1759
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
DOS, NES,

1760
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Atari 2600,

1761
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
8-bit family computer,

1762
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
well, the Atari 8-bit family computer.

1763
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
The CPC, the ZX

1764
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Spectrum, Commodore 64,

1765
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Apple II, ColecoVision,

1766
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
BBC Micro. There was a

1767
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
clone called Major Motion that

1768
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
came out by Microdeal on the

1769
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Atari ST and Amiga.

1770
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
The Nintendo port was kind of crap because

1771
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
it had really bad collision

1772
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
detection.

1773
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The Commodore 64

1774
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
and Atari 8-bit versions

1775
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
had very similar bugs.

1776
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Like, the car

1777
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
would drive on the side of the

1778
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
road and enemy

1779
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
cars couldn't touch it. There was just some weird

1780
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
stuff that would go on. Also

1781
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
there were re-releases for the Atari Greatest Hits

1782
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
of

1783
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Midway's Greatest Arcade

1784
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Hits Volume 1 for N64,

1785
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Midway Arcade Treasures,

1786
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
GameCube PS2, Xbox,

1787
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
the Extend to Play versions

1788
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
for PSP, and

1789
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Midway Arcade Origins

1790
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
for PS3 and Xbox 360.

1791
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It was

1792
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
funny.

1793
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Spy Hunter had actually

1794
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
been incorporated into other

1795
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
things in pop culture.

1796
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
In Murder, She Wrote, do we remember

1797
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
that show?

1798
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Hell yes, of course we do.

1799
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
How could you forget the great Angela

1800
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Langbury? Well, there

1801
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
was an episode called Hit, Run, and Homicide

1802
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
where

1803
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
her character realized

1804
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
that the

1805
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
solution to the case

1806
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
was after she was playing

1807
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Spy Hunter, so

1808
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I thought that was kind of

1809
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
a neat inclusion for inspiration.

1810
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Spy Hunter

1811
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
there's an easter egg for it in Microsoft

1812
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Excel 2000 that requires

1813
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
DirectX to work. I just wanted to say

1814
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
real quick, since the Spy Hunter music

1815
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
ran out, I thought maybe we could

1816
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
use a little bit of this here

1817
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
instead.

1818
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's the Murder, She Wrote theme

1819
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
song. Oh, Rob.

1820
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Did they ever make a game out of Murder, She Wrote?

1821
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Why the fuck not?

1822
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I'm pretty sure it was probably a PC game

1823
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
from Murder, She Wrote.

1824
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Can I finish, Rob?

1825
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I suppose.

1826
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Okay.

1827
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
In 2008, Pontiac had a commercial

1828
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
that had

1829
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
the Spy Hunter car being replaced

1830
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
by the Pontiac G8 GT

1831
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
after the original car was destroyed.

1832
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Zynga did

1833
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
a game

1834
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
it had in Mafia Wars

1835
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
that was a car called The Hunter Spy

1836
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
XS.

1837
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
The Hunter arcade game was seen in Big.

1838
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And in Teen Titans Go, which

1839
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
they had

1840
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
an episode called Video Game References

1841
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Cyborg played a game called

1842
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Pie Hunter.

1843
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Several games, actually.

1844
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I was gonna say

1845
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
that they'd made

1846
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Murder, She Wrote and Murder, She Wrote 2

1847
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
returned to Cabot Cove.

1848
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
They made a Murder, She Wrote game.

1849
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
They're on iPhone. In 2009,

1850
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
they made a Murder, She Wrote game.

1851
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Oh yes, Spy Hunter, though.

1852
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm done.

1853
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Fuck.

1854
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Just think, we're only a few more years away

1855
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
from Classic Game of the Week that could be Murder, She Wrote.

1856
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I'll do a Murder, She Wrote game before I do Halo.

1857
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
That's it.

1858
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
We've got Doriaki

1859
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
in the fridge and I'm gonna have some.

1860
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Alright, there it is. Your Classic Game of the Week.

1861
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Spy Hunter and a little bit of Murder, She Wrote.

1862
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
But like,

1863
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Dark Soccer can't argue

1864
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
because Murder, She Wrote is a true classic.

1865
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I mean, that's just how it is.

1866
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I can argue.

1867
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Alright.

1868
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
We're gonna take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

1869
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
We have plenty more to come

1870
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
with the show, including

1871
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
the Fugu Question of the Week.

1872
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
We're gonna get to your calls as well.

1873
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

1874
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
and emails.

1875
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Phone calls. You guys.

1876
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Plenty more when we come back right after this.

1877
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.

1878
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Live tonight with Episode 632

1879
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
of our show,

1880
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
February the 28th of 2016.

1881
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I apologize.

1882
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
My voice is kind of going in and out.

1883
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I'm still trying to shake.

1884
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Remember I missed a show like a month ago because I was sick?

1885
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That came back in full force for

1886
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
MagFest and I'm still trying to shake it.

1887
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I think I've probably had three different

1888
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
colds all at once is what's happening.

1889
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
This is what happens when you go to conventions

1890
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
is everything tries to kill you.

1891
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
It's called confunk.

1892
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah, confunk. A little bit of that.

1893
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Not meaning the smell of confunk, but the feeling of confunk.

1894
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I will give props to MagFest.

1895
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
It did not smell

1896
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
like butt.

1897
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
It actually was pretty respectable.

1898
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Maybe that's because it was so cold

1899
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and it was a big open space.

1900
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
There was proper refrigeration and ventilation everywhere,

1901
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
but I was very proud

1902
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
of you MagFesters for not

1903
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
smelling.

1904
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
MagFest did not MagFester.

1905
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
That's right. It did not MagFester.

1906
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Quick live programming note

1907
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
for those of you guys that are listening live tonight

1908
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
at The Voice of the Geek Network.

1909
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
We're going to do a special encore presentation

1910
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
of one of our new shows on the network, GameBui.

1911
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
If you've never heard them,

1912
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
GameBui.org did a great little

1913
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Zelda retrospective this past week.

1914
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
We're going to replay that after tonight's episode of OLR.

1915
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
We had some,

1916
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for lack of a better term, fuckery

1917
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
go on with the station this week,

1918
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
where I was not able to get new shows in

1919
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
for a couple days, which was really irritating

1920
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
the shit out of me, and unfortunately,

1921
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
nobody got to hear the new GameBui because of it

1922
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
on the feed.

1923
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So we're going to play it at a special time tonight

1924
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
here after the show, so apologies to the boys

1925
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
over there at GameBui.

1926
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And thanks for putting up with technical difficulties

1927
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
that are out of our control.

1928
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's frustrating in the slightest, but anyway.

1929
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Let's get to some rapid

1930
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
fire news.

1931
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Loki.

1932
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So this is kind of a neat little

1933
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
addition to the package for if you

1934
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
purchase the Xbox One version of Doom.

1935
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Not only will you get Doom,

1936
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
but you'll also get the original Doom and

1937
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Doom 2, which were re-released

1938
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
on Xbox 360 via

1939
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Xbox Live Arcade. You will get

1940
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
those since they will be backwards compatible with

1941
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
the Xbox One.

1942
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
So that's pretty sweet.

1943
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So yeah,

1944
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
go check that out. It's kind of a nice little bonus

1945
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
if you want to purchase that game on that platform.

1946
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Also, speaking of backwards

1947
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
compatible games, there's been

1948
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
some more added to the Xbox One,

1949
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
including Geometry Wars,

1950
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Retro Evolved, Carcassonne,

1951
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and I think

1952
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
a few others. Let's see.

1953
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Nope. Those are the only

1954
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
two that they mentioned. Oh.

1955
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Yep. But Geometry

1956
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Wars. That's pretty awesome.

1957
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Never really got into Carcassonne, though.

1958
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And finally,

1959
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
March is right around the corner here.

1960
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And with that, of course, you can expect some new games

1961
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
that will be free on

1962
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Xbox and PlayStation

1963
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
platforms, starting off with the Xbox

1964
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Games with Gold.

1965
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
For Xbox One, you're going to have

1966
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment

1967
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
from March 1st through March 31st,

1968
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and Lords of the Fallen

1969
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
from March 16th through April 15th.

1970
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
A little bit extra time on that one.

1971
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And then on Xbox 360,

1972
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Supreme Commander 2,

1973
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
March 1st to March 15th,

1974
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
and the original Borderlands

1975
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
from March 16th to March 31st.

1976
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
And of course, as usual,

1977
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
the Xbox 360 games are backwards compatible

1978
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
with the Xbox One.

1979
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And then on top of that,

1980
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
we've also got

1981
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
for

1982
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
PlayStation 4, now you

1983
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
may remember there was the whole vote to

1984
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
see which game would be included

1985
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
free for March. Well,

1986
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Broforce won, so you can expect

1987
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
that on PlayStation 4,

1988
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
as well as Galaxie, which

1989
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
looks pretty awesome. It's kind of a

1990
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Saturday morning cartoon, anime

1991
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
style

1992
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
space shooter game that

1993
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
looks pretty badass, actually.

1994
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
So that'll be coming out on PlayStation 4.

1995
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Flame Over and Reality

1996
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Fighters on PlayStation Vita,

1997
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
and Super Stardust HD

1998
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
and the last guy on PlayStation

1999
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
3.

2000
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So, I don't know.

2001
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Those two, though, on the

2002
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
PlayStation 4, though, are pretty awesome. And of course,

2003
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I believe the other two titles that were not

2004
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
part of the free selection there

2005
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
will be discounted for the month of March.

2006
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And I believe that was Assault Android

2007
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Cactus is one of them.

2008
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yes, I'll definitely be picking that up, but a lot

2009
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
of good free stuff.

2010
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yeah, that Galaxie looks

2011
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
badass. I actually almost

2012
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
purchased that, and now I

2013
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
get it free.

2014
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It's always irritating when you get a game, and then

2015
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
it goes free like the very next month, right?

2016
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
But, you know, that's what

2017
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
happens in this day and age sometimes.

2018
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Well, how cool is it that

2019
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
hidden stuff is found in a video

2020
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
game years and years later,

2021
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
especially a game like

2022
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Mortal Kombat? That's right.

2023
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
There are some additional menus

2024
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
in the Mortal Kombat series.

2025
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
They were called EJB menus,

2026
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and they were rumored for a very long time,

2027
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
and these menus were... That's for Ed Boon's

2028
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
initials. That's right. They were finally found

2029
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
on arcade hardware

2030
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
of the first three Mortal Kombat games.

2031
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Thanks to

2032
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
ROM scrubbing, it was known that the menus were

2033
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
there for some time, but nobody really

2034
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
knew how to get there. It takes

2035
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
a lightning-quick input,

2036
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I guess some complicated button presses

2037
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
with a block, on

2038
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
both player one and player two sides

2039
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
to unlock.

2040
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
All the menus do, they have a

2041
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
special hello message, a shortcut

2042
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
to putting your initials at the top of the

2043
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
ranking board, a Galaga

2044
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
minigame in

2045
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and a gallery

2046
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
of all the characters' endings.

2047
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It's not

2048
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
anything that's going to change the game.

2049
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It's not like it's giving you, like, morphs

2050
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
as Kano or whatever, but

2051
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
it's just interesting that they were hidden for

2052
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
20 years and they were just found. And I

2053
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
guess what's interesting about it is that

2054
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
the patterns were there the whole time.

2055
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
They also work on ROM hacks.

2056
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
They do, and they work on the

2057
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Midway arcade treasures. So if you

2058
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
have, like, the Xbox version

2059
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
or anything

2060
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
that's basically emulating the game itself,

2061
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
it's in there. So that's pretty cool.

2062
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
There's also

2063
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
the Fatality Viewer

2064
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
in, I think, Ultimate

2065
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Mortal Kombat 3 was one of

2066
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
the menu items there that wasn't in the

2067
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
other two. It used

2068
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
to be that it was

2069
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
something that you could get as an unlock for, like,

2070
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
beating one of the hardest modes.

2071
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
And it's there as a...

2072
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It also has the hidden

2073
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
character unlock as well

2074
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
for one of the

2075
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
different builds, I think.

2076
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I remember watching the video of it. It was actually

2077
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
really cool.

2078
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Well, Twitch

2079
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
also announcing this week that they are

2080
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
now archiving streams

2081
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
with

2082
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
chat. So you

2083
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
can now get chat replay alongside the

2084
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
streams, which is, I think, great because

2085
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
when you're trying to

2086
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
create content that is going

2087
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
to last longer and

2088
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
work on demand and not just be live,

2089
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
you have to be able to

2090
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
see the chat. Like, what we try to do

2091
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
here at OLR, if we're going to respond to

2092
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
something in chat, we do try to read that

2093
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
comment before just saying, oh, ha

2094
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
ha, that was really funny, DarkTetsuya.

2095
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
You know, like, you have to be able to read

2096
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
the comment in order to respond to it.

2097
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
So I think it's really good that Twitch will have

2098
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
this on their replay. So that's

2099
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
pretty cool. I guess

2100
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
a user actually helped created that.

2101
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Oh, neat.

2102
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Also, in sort of

2103
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
video game news, like, really distant,

2104
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
like, super removed, but

2105
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I'm going to mention this anyway.

2106
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Kanye West has apparently announced on Twitter that

2107
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
his next album will be called

2108
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Turbografx-16, named

2109
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
after one of the most favorite gaming systems

2110
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
from his childhood. He said

2111
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
in a series of tweets, my next album

2112
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
is titled Turbografx-16 as of

2113
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
now, just on some super nerd vibes.

2114
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
One of my favorite gaming systems when I was

2115
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
a kid. Blazing Lasers is probably my favorite

2116
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
game on that console. My boy

2117
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Molly that I spoke about on the song

2118
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Drive Slow actually had an EOGO in real

2119
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
life, bro. We actually played Spy

2120
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Hunter at my mom's house. Hey, how about that?

2121
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Bringing it all together. You know, it's funny.

2122
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I've got both of those.

2123
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Yeah, so, you know,

2124
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Kanye West has a tendency to just tweet

2125
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
kind of, he kind of lets his butt do

2126
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
the tweeting, so I don't know if that

2127
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
will actually end up happening, but

2128
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
cool to know that he was a gaming nerd

2129
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
at one point like a lot of the rest of us, so

2130
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
neat.

2131
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Moving on. Dark Soccer, excuse me.

2132
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Well, one of the writers

2133
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
for, um, who's working on

2134
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Mass Effect Andromeda

2135
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
left BioWare to go to Bungie.

2136
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
He was actually one of the

2137
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
writers for Dragon Age as well

2138
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
and that he thinks that Andromeda

2139
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
will blow people away and he couldn't be prouder to

2140
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
be a part of it, but he's

2141
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
also, um, left

2142
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Chris Schlerf, who

2143
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
was with BioWare Montreal.

2144
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
We already lost David Gator,

2145
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
so sad.

2146
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Also, and I was actually watching the trailer

2147
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
for this last night. Oh my god.

2148
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Raiden 5.

2149
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Coming out to Xbox

2150
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
1 in Japan.

2151
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I guess this would be the only

2152
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
reason to have an Xbox 1

2153
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
ever in Japan.

2154
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But Raiden 5, like,

2155
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
it looked pretty freaking amazing.

2156
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I was so happy. And it uses

2157
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
the power of the cloud to gather

2158
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
player data and it impacts your game

2159
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
in real time, so

2160
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
that's pretty exciting.

2161
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Maybe we'll get it on PC or something.

2162
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And then,

2163
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
last but not least, uh, character

2164
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
for Killer Instinct.

2165
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
The Arbiter from Halo

2166
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
is going to be there.

2167
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
And I watched the trailer for that

2168
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
too and I was like, that's kind of cool.

2169
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And then I went back and

2170
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
watched the rest of Hisako's story mode.

2171
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
There you go.

2172
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Alright. I need to, uh,

2173
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I need to play through the rest of the,

2174
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
uh, stories

2175
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
in Killer Instinct as well. I did do Hisako

2176
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
though. You're a fave.

2177
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Let's get to... I just have

2178
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
an odd obsession with Onryo.

2179
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So... Now I know,

2180
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
you have for a long time. Did you hear

2181
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
they're doing, uh,

2182
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
The Ring vs Juhon?

2183
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Yes, I have read that. I'm like, oh my god!

2184
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Yeah. Two of my favoritest ever

2185
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
movies in one. In Japan, right?

2186
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Except Sadako 3D was stupid.

2187
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Like, really stupid.

2188
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And I haven't seen the last

2189
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
two, uh, Juhon flicks.

2190
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
But the premise seemed really stupid for those two. So are they gonna, like,

2191
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
slap fight each other or something?

2192
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I mean, like... And then will they Americanize

2193
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
it and ruin it? I have no idea.

2194
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Well, The Grudge was okay for the US

2195
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
because it had the same director. It was all

2196
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
the subsequent sequels I refused to watch

2197
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
that were, as I understood,

2198
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
fairly shitty.

2199
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
But... Are they gonna call it,

2200
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
like, you know, The Ring?

2201
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Ring vs Grudge? The Grudge

2202
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
match? Enter The Ring!

2203
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It's the Grudge match!

2204
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
One can hope.

2205
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
What happens when you get

2206
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
two completely different vengeful

2207
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
ghosts in the same room?

2208
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I hope it's jumpscaring back and forth.

2209
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Like, they'll have a jumpscare off. You know how, like, the wizards

2210
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
can usually fight? And it's like that giant

2211
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
bolt of lightning or something that they go back and forth?

2212
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It says there's gonna be jumpscares

2213
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
going back and forth.

2214
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Only if at the end of it, one of them will go,

2215
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
you just got served. Would this be

2216
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
like...

2217
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
immortal

2218
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
combat?

2219
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Perhaps?

2220
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It'll be like... Next Mortal Kombat?

2221
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Jason vs Freddy or whatever.

2222
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
No, I don't think so.

2223
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
We need to get to the foogle question of the week,

2224
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
and quick.

2225
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Every week, you guys answer

2226
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
our question that we post on our Facebook

2227
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
and Google Plus communities. You take Facebook and Google

2228
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
and you slam those words together, you get

2229
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Google! And this week, of course,

2230
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
all about the Pokemons,

2231
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
since we did just have the big birthday we've been

2232
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
waiting for over the weekend.

2233
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Okay, one more Pokemon question

2234
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
for you all this week, since we did just have the big

2235
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
birthday. Have you already decided

2236
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
if you're getting Sun, Moon,

2237
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
or neither? And

2238
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
which Pokemon across the years is your

2239
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
favorite, and why?

2240
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
So, very similar to the questions I asked here at the studio

2241
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
at the beginning of the show. We'll start

2242
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
off at Google Plus, Prince

2243
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Peach Fuzz starting us off

2244
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
tonight, saying both.

2245
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Some people have to, when you say

2246
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
gotta catch them all, they actually have to have

2247
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
them all, which is why they will buy both games.

2248
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
So, Prince Peach Fuzz is gonna

2249
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
plan on getting both Sun and Moon.

2250
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
And favorite Pokemon, Snorlax.

2251
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
He's my spirit Pokemon.

2252
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
That's a good answer. That's a very good

2253
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
answer. I see a lot of myself in

2254
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Snorlax as well.

2255
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
ActDeaf responded on Google Plus

2256
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
saying, of course, yes, probably Moon.

2257
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
And I have a lot of favorites

2258
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
like Lucario and Ninetales,

2259
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
but I think Hawlucha

2260
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
is the Pokemon that I like the most.

2261
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I hope I didn't butcher that name.

2262
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
With 700 Pokemon, even I can't pronounce them all these days.

2263
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
So, there you go.

2264
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Going over to

2265
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Facebook,

2266
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
starting off with Haseo Sumeruagawa

2267
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
says, might check them out,

2268
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
and Rayquaza is the

2269
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
legendary for emerald is my

2270
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
favorite. Our first legendary Pokemon

2271
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
showing up in the favorites.

2272
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
AndyR says, at the moment, neither.

2273
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Since I didn't really enjoy the

2274
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
last two I played, White and Y.

2275
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
But I said I wasn't gonna get Y

2276
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
either, and the zeitgeist that launched got me.

2277
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Do you mean game or monster?

2278
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
If former, gold. If latter,

2279
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
far-fetched. Yeah, I know.

2280
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
He's just a lame duck, but for some reason

2281
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I just really liked him as a kid.

2282
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Hey, you know what another one of my favorite Pokemon is?

2283
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Psyduck. You wanna know what's funny?

2284
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Ages and ages

2285
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
ago, in fact

2286
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I think it was the same night that we picked up my Togepi

2287
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
which I also still super love Togepi.

2288
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
We found a Psyduck,

2289
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
a little Psyduck and we bought it.

2290
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And he's been our family Psyduck.

2291
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
We've had him ever since, like first

2292
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
gen Psyduck toy.

2293
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I used to have a little keychain that would light up that was a

2294
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Psyduck. You turn the little thing and it would just

2295
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
light up. I found my Togepi

2296
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
keychain that you push in the stomach

2297
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
and he goes, tippy tippy!

2298
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Adorable!

2299
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Bryce H. responded

2300
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and said, I'm definitely getting Sun or Moon.

2301
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I won't choose which one until I see the legendary

2302
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Pokemon for each. And my favorite

2303
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Pokemon is Ditto because Ditto

2304
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
can be any Pokemon.

2305
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
That was a good episode of the show too with

2306
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Duplica. My friend witnessed

2307
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Duplica one Halloween. We all witnessed Pokemon

2308
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
characters and I witnessed Ash and I

2309
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
had a life-sized Pikachu.

2310
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
My friends, you've met Billy, right? Billy was

2311
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Team Rocket.

2312
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
He was Team Rocket. He was James

2313
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
and our other friend was Jessie. It was

2314
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
adorable. And then

2315
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
our friend was Duplica. We had a good

2316
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
time. It was silly. I loved it.

2317
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I think we had a friend that was Misty too.

2318
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I can't remember. Anyway.

2319
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Bryce H. continued, oh sorry. I already

2320
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
read that answer. How about Cial who says

2321
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I'm getting one of them. I don't know which yet.

2322
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Favorite Pokemon over the years?

2323
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Kabutops because Horseshoe Crabs

2324
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
are cool.

2325
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Fifth Dream says, I already pre-ordered

2326
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Pokemon Moon today. I'm so excited

2327
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
for it. And I love Pikachu.

2328
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Maybe I'm just a sucker for the way they

2329
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
marketed him. But he's just too cute.

2330
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I liked him since the very beginning of the anime. I just

2331
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
bought another t-shirt with him on it

2332
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
to celebrate Pokemon Day yesterday.

2333
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Pika Pika.

2334
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Degenerate Johnny says, as a Dark Souls fan

2335
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I have three words. Praise

2336
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
the sun. As far as my

2337
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
favorite Pokemon of all time, it will have to

2338
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
be Ditto because he, she

2339
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
it makes my Pokemon shiny.

2340
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
That's a good reason to get

2341
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Sun. I'm thinking Wii Fit Trainer.

2342
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Salute the Sun.

2343
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Redtertainment says, I've never got any

2344
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I'm sorry, excuse me, I've never really gotten into

2345
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
any of the Pokemon games, but Red speaks

2346
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
to me for some reason.

2347
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Never answered about Sun,

2348
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Moon or any of the other Pokemon, but Red.

2349
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Veronica Isabel replied

2350
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and said, I'm getting Moon. My

2351
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
favorite Pokemon is Mewtwo who

2352
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I always nickname Frieza

2353
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
because of Dragon Ball Z.

2354
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I almost read that as

2355
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Franzia because I had something else on my mind.

2356
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
It involves a box.

2357
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Red the Haze

2358
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
replied over on Facebook and said

2359
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I'll wait for the available Pokemon list

2360
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
and the versions before I choose though.

2361
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I haven't played a Pokemon game since Platinum.

2362
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Pokemon Ekans

2363
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
because it's Snake backwards.

2364
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
It is, it's a very

2365
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
creative name, isn't it?

2366
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And lastly, Kareem

2367
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Jay responded and said, my

2368
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
favorite Pokemon is Meowth.

2369
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Instead of reminding viewers what his name

2370
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
is, he can actually talk.

2371
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Well, one Meowth

2372
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
can actually talk. I believe not all

2373
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
the Meowths could talk, just that particular one.

2374
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
No, just that one.

2375
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I have a Pokemon CD.

2376
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
In fact, I don't know if you remember when

2377
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I got it, I think you were there when I did.

2378
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
But I have one of those little singles and it has the

2379
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Miyasu song on it.

2380
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And

2381
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
it's basically him singing

2382
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
about all of the other Pokemon.

2383
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
So it was cute.

2384
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
S2100 Matt says,

2385
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
wow, I never knew that. Mind blown.

2386
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I'm assuming that's about the Ekans. Is Snake

2387
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
spelled backwards?

2388
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
There's all sorts of weird stuff you see in the

2389
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
games and then you're like, oh my god,

2390
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
how did I never see that before?

2391
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
My god.

2392
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Alright, anyway.

2393
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Let's move on. That was it for the Fugu

2394
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Question of the Week, so let's get back into

2395
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
some gaming news. Loki.

2396
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Sorry,

2397
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I was checking up on your friends.

2398
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Oh yeah, our village

2399
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
is being raided right now, isn't it?

2400
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Yes,

2401
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
anyways,

2402
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
never

2403
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
really had a favorite Pokemon.

2404
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
But,

2405
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I don't know.

2406
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
So, this is kind of

2407
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
cool. They're going to take their time

2408
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
on HoloLens, which is good because

2409
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
HoloLens as it is right now kind of sucks.

2410
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But Microsoft isn't looking

2411
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
to rush it out like they did

2412
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
with, well, not really rushed it out, but

2413
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
they didn't want to put it out like Connect.

2414
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Basically, they didn't want it to be

2415
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
not adapted

2416
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
as widely as the

2417
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Connect was. So, for example, they were

2418
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
describing the Connect as not really a pleasant

2419
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
experience. It just wasn't ready.

2420
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
They were saying that the consumer bought a

2421
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
HoloLens today. They would have like 12 things to

2422
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
do with it. And they would say, cool, I

2423
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
bought a $3,000 product. Well,

2424
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
first off, you know, that is the

2425
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
price of the development kit, not the actual

2426
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
MSRP, because if it was $3,000,

2427
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I'd be like, fuck you. No

2428
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
way that this is going to happen.

2429
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
But, you know,

2430
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
after you've done those 12 things, it's going to be collecting

2431
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
dust. So,

2432
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
right now, this just,

2433
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
you know, going to release it when it's

2434
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
ready.

2435
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So, we'll have to see when that's ready.

2436
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Hopefully soon, and hopefully

2437
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
they fix all the problems with it. Maybe they can

2438
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
just do an entirely internal first

2439
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
generation, so that way we're not subjected

2440
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
to it until they get a lot of the kinks worked out.

2441
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I hope so.

2442
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
It looks interesting, it's just

2443
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
it's not good the way it

2444
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
is right now. It needs, like,

2445
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
if it were to perform

2446
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
like they show it often, like,

2447
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
you know, during their press conferences

2448
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
and stuff with the special cameras and shit,

2449
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
if it actually worked like that,

2450
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
then yes, it would be pretty badass.

2451
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
But it's not. It

2452
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
doesn't look anything like that, so

2453
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
that's the problem.

2454
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Alright,

2455
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
well, let's talk about an

2456
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
exciting partnership, at least I'm really excited

2457
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
about this. Silicon Studio

2458
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
and Mistwalker are apparently joining

2459
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
together to develop a new game.

2460
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
If you've not heard of Silicon Studio, well,

2461
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
they're the makers of Bravely Default.

2462
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So, that's the makers of

2463
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Bravely Default and the makers of

2464
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Lost Odyssey coming together to make a

2465
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
game. We don't know what it's called,

2466
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
what it looks like, or when it comes out, but

2467
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
of course, more info

2468
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
to come soon, whenever that is.

2469
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I'm very excited to hear about

2470
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
this. I wonder

2471
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
if this ties to, we saw

2472
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Mistwalker, the guy from Mistwalker

2473
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
did a little talk, and he teased

2474
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
some art, so I wonder if this could be

2475
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
something about it, who knows.

2476
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Apparently there was an image that did come out

2477
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
with the announcement as well, so

2478
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
we'll see. Maybe

2479
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
E3 this year is when we'll hear more about it

2480
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and what system it might be on.

2481
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Maybe it's an

2482
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
NX game, maybe it's another DS game.

2483
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Who knows? We'll find out.

2484
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Moving on,

2485
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
DarkSakura. Sorry, I'm having a very, very

2486
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
important conversation. I bet.

2487
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I bet. About what's

2488
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
worse, Sadako or

2489
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Kayako. The Ring

2490
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
versus Ju-on.

2491
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Anyway.

2492
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
So, Disney's

2493
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
up to some shystey

2494
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
crap. They

2495
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
are wanting to lobby in favor

2496
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
of the TPP,

2497
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
the

2498
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Trans-Pacific Partnership,

2499
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
big trade thing that's

2500
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
wanting to send our more jobs

2501
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
overseas, and blah, blah, blah.

2502
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
So, the Disney CEO

2503
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Bob Iger has

2504
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
encouraged employees to enroll in a program

2505
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
that would deduct part of their

2506
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
check, so that it would

2507
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
go into the Disney PAC,

2508
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
the Political Action Committee,

2509
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
and wanting to

2510
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
basically influence

2511
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
the language of the

2512
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
TPP.

2513
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
There's a lot

2514
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
of

2515
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
a lot of

2516
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
scrutiny on this law. I mean, the big

2517
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
thing about it is that

2518
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
big

2519
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
corporations are really in favor of it.

2520
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
It's supposed to make trade a lot easier for

2521
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
them, make things a lot more affordable

2522
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
for them to operate. However,

2523
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
it's pretty much going to screw the local

2524
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
economies of, you know,

2525
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
just about everybody

2526
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
involved. So, the fact

2527
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
that Disney is behind this,

2528
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I mean, I'm not surprised

2529
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
because they are a big corporation.

2530
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
At the same time, though, they're wanting

2531
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
their employees

2532
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
to contribute

2533
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
to this, too.

2534
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
It just seems a little bit

2535
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
no bueno.

2536
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I mean, I don't

2537
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
like to talk about my day job a lot

2538
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
on the show, but I will just say

2539
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
in very general terms, for the past

2540
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
15 years, I've worked in the

2541
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
healthcare industry, which is a very

2542
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
controversial thing here in the United States,

2543
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
and I've never been

2544
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
asked to give money

2545
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
to a political cause

2546
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
like this through

2547
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
work. It's very surprising

2548
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
to me. With as

2549
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
high visibility

2550
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
and how politically charged

2551
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
healthcare has been over the past

2552
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
15 years, I'm really

2553
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
surprised. I'm seeing it here

2554
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
and I've never been asked to do it

2555
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
in my industry.

2556
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I worked for one company for 14 years.

2557
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I'm really surprised. I was never asked to do that.

2558
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I work in

2559
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
the tech industry.

2560
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I've been very careful to say, to not

2561
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
say who I work for. Only a few people know.

2562
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
It's nobody's business. Exactly.

2563
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
We are happy to spend our nights with you,

2564
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
but our days are private. But my company

2565
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
has never asked us.

2566
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
We've just been asked to

2567
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I guess

2568
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
show integrity in our

2569
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
you know, how we handle ourselves, but we've

2570
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
never been asked specifically

2571
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
to support this cause, to support this cause,

2572
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
to support this cause. So,

2573
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
this is just really

2574
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I don't know. It's just

2575
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
really stinks

2576
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
to me. Yeah. It's interesting.

2577
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Alright, well

2578
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
let's move on with some more news. We'll see

2579
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
what comes of all that. Loki.

2580
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Alright, so to kind of help

2581
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
push the whole

2582
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
VR thing. As I mentioned, I was almost going to

2583
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
get a Gear VR, but I kind of decided not to.

2584
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
If you

2585
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
pre-order a

2586
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Samsung Galaxy S7

2587
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
or S7 Edge,

2588
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I guess starting February

2589
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
23rd, they're also going to

2590
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
kind of sweeten the pot by including a

2591
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Gear VR.

2592
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
And along

2593
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
with that, I guess they're throwing in

2594
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
six VR games

2595
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
and it depends on which

2596
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
provider you purchased it from.

2597
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
But they include such games

2598
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
like Eve Gunjack, Esper 2,

2599
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Dead Secret, Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes,

2600
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Start Chart,

2601
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
and Hero Bound for one of them.

2602
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Ashar 2,

2603
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Darknet Drift, Keep Talking, Nobody

2604
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Explodes, Start Chart, and Hero

2605
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Bound for another one, and Lands' Ed

2606
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Mortal Blitz VR, Deer Hunter VR,

2607
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes,

2608
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Ocean Rift, and Hero Bound

2609
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
for the third one.

2610
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
It's kind of neat, I mean, I just

2611
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I don't know. I mean, if I was going to

2612
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
purchase a new phone, I'd love to get, you know, that

2613
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
shit free, but

2614
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I just bought a phone, so I don't think I'll

2615
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
be upgrading anytime soon to the

2616
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
to the brand new S7

2617
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
because I have an S6.

2618
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Don't you hate that when you buy the hardware

2619
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
and then the very next week, oh, now the hardware comes

2620
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
with games. Well, you know, it's free stuff.

2621
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Yeah, and I don't know, I don't know how to see how much

2622
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
the S7 is and what's so cool about

2623
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
it, I mean. Well, they want

2624
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
to move these units, so they have to put

2625
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
in something, you know, it's like, it's the whole

2626
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Nintendo sold the Wii through

2627
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Wii Sports, and I'm not saying any of these games

2628
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
are necessarily at the level of Wii Sports, but you have

2629
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
to have those games that are gonna, you know,

2630
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
make people want to buy the hardware, really.

2631
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
That's why I think it's really rough

2632
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
when you release your hardware with no

2633
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
pack-in games. What they need to do is just

2634
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
include a fucking, a three month

2635
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
subscription, the virtual real porn,

2636
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
and there you go. That'll

2637
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
sell tons of those units.

2638
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Alright.

2639
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I didn't talk a lot about this game this week

2640
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
because I didn't play it myself,

2641
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
but Alan has been playing a lot of,

2642
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
and you'll be proud to hear this, Loki, he's been playing a lot of

2643
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Fallout 4, in fact, I think he's in there playing it right now,

2644
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
but he's off work tonight because

2645
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
they, with that whole little

2646
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
gold statue show that's going on right now,

2647
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
there's not a lot of people answering polls,

2648
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
so he's in there playing Fallout 4

2649
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
right now, so I watched him play some of it,

2650
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
and I was like, show me killing mobs,

2651
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
and he got

2652
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
his butt kicked.

2653
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It was funny. But anyway,

2654
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
talking about Fallout 4, I guess

2655
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
there's a new survival mode

2656
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
that is gonna be coming out for Fallout 4, and Bethesda

2657
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
actually confirmed it. Some of the details

2658
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
had leaked on, I guess, Reddit

2659
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
somewhere, and the publisher came out and

2660
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
confirmed it. Basically, you'll

2661
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
be able to enable this with a menu swipe,

2662
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
and you'll be able to do more

2663
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and take more damage.

2664
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Manual and quick save options will be disabled,

2665
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
you have to sleep at least an hour

2666
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
to save, and there is no

2667
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
fast travel.

2668
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Enemies won't show up on your compass, and fatigue

2669
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
will matter. So,

2670
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
yeah, sounds like it's

2671
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
gonna be a little bit more of a hardcore mode,

2672
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
but we'll probably make for some good

2673
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
livestream feeds and all that stuff, those people

2674
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
like to play hardcore and show off and all that

2675
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
stuff. By the way, if you've been

2676
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
eagerly anticipating a mod

2677
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
support on the various platforms,

2678
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
we now have some time frames

2679
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
as to when that mod support is finally

2680
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
going to come out, and that was via an

2681
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
interview with Game Informer, where

2682
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
the PC will be getting its official

2683
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
mod support in April. I say official

2684
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
because you know the mods are already out there.

2685
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
They're already out there. They're just not official, but

2686
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
official modding comes in April.

2687
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Xbox One will start getting the mods in

2688
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
May, and PlayStation 4 in

2689
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
June. I'm pretty excited about that.

2690
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Yeah, that'll be pretty awesome.

2691
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
He did say the full quote,

2692
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
our goal is between the first two DLCs.

2693
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
It'll be up at that time on PC

2694
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
in April. All that stuff will go

2695
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
up on PC. People are beta testing it.

2696
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
There will be a lag on consoles.

2697
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
We want to get it up and have it work. It'll

2698
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
probably be a good month before it hits

2699
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Xbox One, and another month for

2700
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
PlayStation 4. So notice how

2701
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
he didn't really quote June. He said

2702
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
about a month, so it could take

2703
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
a little longer if you're on PlayStation 4.

2704
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Yeah, I was going to say one of the things

2705
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
that they did announce while we were out

2706
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
was the actual Fallout 4 DLCs,

2707
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
or at least the first bit of it.

2708
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
They're saying they're adding more on top of that, but this

2709
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
is what you get for your season pass right

2710
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
now, which it will be going up to $60

2711
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
in March, so if you were interested

2712
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
to purchase it now. But the first

2713
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
three pieces of DLC, they've got the Automatron,

2714
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
which is coming out for $9.99

2715
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
in March, and that adds

2716
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
some new robots. You can create your own

2717
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
robots, that type of stuff.

2718
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
You mix limbs and stuff together.

2719
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Then in April, Wasteland

2720
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Workshop, where you can create your own fighting

2721
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
pits, as well as some new

2722
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
settlement things, and then finally

2723
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
kind of the actual big

2724
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
expansion, which is in May, called Far Harbor,

2725
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
which is going to be $24.99

2726
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
separately, but it's all included

2727
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
in the season pass, plus

2728
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
other things that they haven't announced yet,

2729
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
so definitely check it out.

2730
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Alright, it's time

2731
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
to get to the mailbag! Hey, what do you know,

2732
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
DarkSakura, you're here to do it after all.

2733
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Sorry, give me a second.

2734
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
That's okay, you thought you'd be gone, but

2735
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
No, I think you should open it and read it.

2736
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I'm actually feeling a little under the weather

2737
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
still, so I'd really prefer it if you could do it.

2738
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I'm the one that has had a headache

2739
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
since Thursday. Maybe we'll make Loki do it.

2740
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Hold on. Loki should read the email.

2741
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I don't even know if he knows how to log in.

2742
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I don't even know how to read!

2743
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I can maybe do one if you really

2744
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
want me to, just my voice is

2745
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
hurting tonight.

2746
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
You can always email us.

2747
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2748
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
is the place to send us emails.

2749
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
And we will happily

2750
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
read your emails every week here at

2751
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Orange Lounge Radio, and respond to them

2752
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
in kind.

2753
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Come on, Hoback, log me in.

2754
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
There we go.

2755
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Alright, okay, you ready?

2756
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Yes.

2757
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
This one's

2758
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
labeled color from last week.

2759
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Hey, OLR family, please don't

2760
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
take this the wrong way, but when Derek

2761
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
called in last week, I thought it was

2762
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Latrice Royale from RuPaul's Drag Race, LOL.

2763
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Wouldn't it be cool to interview

2764
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
one of the drag queens that play video games?

2765
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Long time podcast listener, DJIQ.

2766
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I will tell you this.

2767
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I have

2768
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
done an interview

2769
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
with one of the drag queens from RuPaul's Drag Race.

2770
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
You did? I did Tatiana

2771
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
from season two.

2772
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Back when I was writing

2773
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
for Tiara's

2774
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
website thing that she was doing before.

2775
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
The Geek Life, or whatever it's called, right?

2776
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Yeah, Geek Life.

2777
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm laughing because I'm not

2778
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
sure Derek will see the

2779
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
great compliment that

2780
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
is in your comparison there,

2781
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
but in all seriousness,

2782
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
I actually don't

2783
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
think I hear it at all.

2784
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
When I think of Latrice Royale,

2785
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I think of the laugh. Latrice Royale has a

2786
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
very epic laugh. Have you ever heard

2787
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Latrice Royale's laugh, Dark Sakura?

2788
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
No, I haven't listened to Latrice Royale

2789
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
at all.

2790
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
You don't know what you've been missing.

2791
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
She's very large and in charge

2792
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
and she says that herself.

2793
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Drag queen, and she has a

2794
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
laugh that you will remember through the ages.

2795
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
In fact,

2796
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I'm trying to find the one...

2797
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Okay, here's her laugh.

2798
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
There was one that was set to death metal.

2799
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I can't find it though.

2800
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
See, it's always like a scream, right?

2801
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
That's it. But here's the thing.

2802
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I think you know who sounds like that.

2803
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
It's Captain Spike from GameBooey.org.

2804
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
If you ever get him to laugh,

2805
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
listen to it, because he'll do that same thing

2806
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
where he goes,

2807
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
he'll kind of do that same little scream.

2808
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
When I think of

2809
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Latrice Royale laughing,

2810
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I think of Captain Spike from GameBooey.org.

2811
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
There's a clip out there

2812
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
where it's mixed to death metal, and it's so

2813
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
funny. I wish I could find it.

2814
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
How about I go to the next email? How about it?

2815
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Okay, this is from Raginator.

2816
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Yes, I'm reading your email.

2817
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Even after I said I wasn't, because I'm here.

2818
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
We got to the mailbag early tonight.

2819
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2820
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Hi everyone, it's Raginator yet again.

2821
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I appreciate that there won't be a show

2822
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
on Sunday 2-21, and odds are

2823
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
this email may be slightly out of date by then,

2824
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
but I wanted to update everyone real quick,

2825
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
and if need be, supplement this email with

2826
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
a quick, short email in the days

2827
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
to come. Last weekend I received

2828
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
my, um,

2829
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
one check for a computer,

2830
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
and I had the usable funds in my bank

2831
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
account by the 16th.

2832
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Unfortunately, the one PC that I was

2833
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
initially eyeing was out of stock by the time

2834
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I had the opportunity to order it.

2835
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
That being said, I ordered this one.

2836
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
It's a different one. I'm not going to go about

2837
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
the specs on it.

2838
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I also ordered extra

2839
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
RAM, a webcam, an additional Blu-ray

2840
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
drive. Earlier today I received the PC

2841
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
itself, and I'm still waiting on the

2842
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
other three items.

2843
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
All that being said, it will still be a little while

2844
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
yet before I have my internet and whatnot

2845
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
turned back on. I still need to

2846
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
save up for the two additional months so I can buy

2847
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
two more things, a cheapo barebones

2848
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
TV, and one of those fancy gaming headsets

2849
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
that's capable of surround sound.

2850
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
That being said, I anticipate my internet

2851
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
and whatnot being turned

2852
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
back on by May 1st.

2853
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Anyone talk to you soon?

2854
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
It's to me. Never mind.

2855
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
That's for Majornator. I read your email.

2856
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Mostly.

2857
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
And he's back.

2858
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Also in chat.

2859
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
He got that computer situation worked out.

2860
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Last email.

2861
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Last email.

2862
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Is long.

2863
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
This comes from

2864
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I don't have a name on it so I'm just going to say

2865
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
well, I have a full name on it but a new

2866
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
nickname, so I'll just say Delvin is who it's from.

2867
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Hey, OLR. Glad

2868
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
to have you guys back this week because I am

2869
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
upset about the launch of Street Fighter 5.

2870
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
It was kind of crap, wasn't it?

2871
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
The game launched with many features not present

2872
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
in the game.

2873
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
The store is not available. The online battle lounges

2874
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
only allow you to play with one other friend

2875
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
in an arcade mode. An empty

2876
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
story mode and extremely piss poor online

2877
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
at launch. Amen to that.

2878
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Oh my god, it was not great.

2879
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Now,

2880
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I fully understand that high demand of any

2881
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
new game will shut down the servers on launch

2882
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
day and a few days after

2883
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
that, so I'm willing to let that slide. However,

2884
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
they had many other

2885
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
issues once things stabilized.

2886
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Not being able to play with friends, which is

2887
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
one of the few things you can currently do in

2888
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
the game. Also,

2889
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
when the servers are not online, you don't get

2890
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
any in-game currency for things

2891
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
to purchase, such as new characters

2892
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
and costumes. This

2893
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
brings me to my next issue,

2894
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
being the lack of characters and high price

2895
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
tag of the game. 16 characters

2896
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
with more on the way at $6 each.

2897
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
You can purchase characters with

2898
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
in-game money at $100,000

2899
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
per character and you'll only

2900
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
earn $25 per loss and $50

2901
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
per win. To keep this short,

2902
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I'll get to my point here and say that this

2903
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
model concerns me

2904
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
and is a trend that I see starting to

2905
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
increase instead of decrease. Why do

2906
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
developers continue to launch games that are

2907
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
half done, collect our money, and then fix it

2908
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
later? When did this become acceptable?

2909
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I purchased the game under the pretense

2910
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
of it's done and we'll add more

2911
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
extra stuff later. Now, here's 50%

2912
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
of the game now and they give you

2913
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
25% in a month and the rest

2914
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
over the next couple of months at $6

2915
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
a pop. But give us full pop now.

2916
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
This is starting to make

2917
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
an extremely expensive, make gaming an

2918
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
extremely expensive hobby. Your $70 game

2919
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
just become over $100. Canadian

2920
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
dollars here, our dollar is poo right now.

2921
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
What are your guys' thoughts on all of this?

2922
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Love you guys, Delvin.

2923
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Yeah, I gave you my thoughts, I agree with everything

2924
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
you just said.

2925
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Cosigned.

2926
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I was like, they gave us

2927
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Karin and no Sakura.

2928
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
That was like

2929
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
nailed for me right there. Well, it's not even

2930
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
like necessarily who's in and who's out

2931
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
and the characters they picked and so forth, but it's

2932
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
just the fact that the game is only like

2933
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
half there, you know?

2934
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
There's this really disturbing trending

2935
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
by the way Delvin is from the podcast

2936
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Video Game Realness and is a pal

2937
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
of mine on Reading is Fundamental

2938
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
so if you, which I

2939
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
realise is a little

2940
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
separated because it's not exactly nerdy

2941
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
but it's nerdy of a different sort. But anyway

2942
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
so

2943
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
we have this disturbing

2944
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
trend going on in gaming where

2945
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
they want your money for

2946
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
less product up front

2947
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
and I think in a way

2948
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
we have Kickstarter to thank for some of

2949
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
that.

2950
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Because companies have seen that people

2951
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
will pay a lot of money

2952
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
in advance for a product that doesn't exist

2953
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
yet. And you know, I think

2954
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Kickstarter was really meant to do

2955
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
indie development and indie support but you see

2956
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
a lot of bigger developers are getting up on that.

2957
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I mean hell, Shenmue 3

2958
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
announced on the Sony stage

2959
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and how many people have given money to that

2960
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
for a product that's not even out and we don't

2961
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
know if it's going to necessarily be at the same

2962
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
quality as games 1 and 2. I mean

2963
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
it might be, I'm hoping it will be.

2964
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I'm having faith in the

2965
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
creators and so forth but the reality

2966
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
is it might not be. And

2967
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
now we have this case of Street Fighter 5

2968
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
where they're promising, well it'll all

2969
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
be there, just not right now

2970
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
and we had to get this out before the fiscal

2971
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
year is up so you know, just

2972
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
buy it, support it and have fun.

2973
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
All you fighting game players are really only interested

2974
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
in the versus mode anyway, right?

2975
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
And it's like, not me.

2976
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I prefer the casual stuff

2977
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I wanted a better story mode.

2978
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I mean seriously.

2979
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Or a story mode at all.

2980
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
It had this dinky version of a story mode

2981
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
and it was

2982
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
really very dinky. I mean

2983
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I was used to having, you play through

2984
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
all of this stuff and you

2985
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
get a real ending. There were no endings.

2986
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
It was just like,

2987
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
precursor story modes.

2988
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
It's like, what the hell Capcom? No,

2989
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
this isn't going to fly. You were only

2990
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
minorly forgiven because there's an U.S. Attorney

2991
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
on the way. But then, I mean

2992
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
this is a trend that's continuing.

2993
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Blizzard, now

2994
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
not even is there a pre-order

2995
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
for Overwatch.

2996
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
There's a pre-pay for

2997
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Overwatch. If you're willing to pay

2998
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
all 60 bucks up front or whatever

2999
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
it is, probably 70 for the collector's edition,

3000
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
you get a couple extra crappy skins

3001
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
in the game and so forth.

3002
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Are they even guaranteeing access to the beta

3003
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
if you pre-play? I don't think they are.

3004
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
And this is a really disturbing trend

3005
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
that's happening in gaming and it is imperative

3006
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
that we vote with our wallets.

3007
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
And I know it sucks

3008
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
for a game like Street Fighter V

3009
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
because it's

3010
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Street Fighter V. Any indication

3011
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
before that that this was going to be the case.

3012
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Yeah, I know. And this is one of those

3013
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
things where unfortunately now Street Fighter V

3014
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
this is going to have

3015
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
repercussions for a long time.

3016
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Because I think for a lot of us now

3017
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
it's lesson learned.

3018
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
And I don't know about you guys

3019
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
but I don't plan on buying a game that's

3020
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
not fucking done or that doesn't have

3021
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
the stuff that I want in it.

3022
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
You know, indie developers I'll probably

3023
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
cut a little more slack on things like

3024
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Kickstarter and so forth but you know

3025
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Street Fighter V, there's not

3026
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
a lot of excuse for this.

3027
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
You have to win 2,000 matches

3028
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
to unlock one character.

3029
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
It's a little silly.

3030
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Bob Coffee in chat

3031
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
says, Street Fighter V came out

3032
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
early mainly because of the Capcom Pro

3033
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Tour. And Act Def says

3034
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
and it's probably the best Street Fighter to date.

3035
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
But I just

3036
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
if you're

3037
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
into the certain you know

3038
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
player versus player

3039
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
and the tournament thing is what you're all about

3040
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
only. But I don't know. I didn't

3041
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
buy it. Just like I didn't buy Mortal Combat

3042
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
X which to be fair at least

3043
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Mortal Combat X wasn't

3044
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
fucking half finished. But I knew

3045
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
with Mortal Combat X they would

3046
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
release all these character packs and soon

3047
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
enough there'd be a game of the year edition

3048
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
and oh look what's happening.

3049
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Except

3050
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
now they're still not done.

3051
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Now there's a whole wave 2 of downloadable

3052
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
characters so there'll be like a second

3053
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
game of the year edition at some point.

3054
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I don't know. Rama in chat

3055
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
says, this half done game was released

3056
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
for those going to Evo to train.

3057
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Great. I hope only the people going to

3058
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Evo to train bought it.

3059
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Unfortunately we all know

3060
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
that's not the case. A lot of the rest of us

3061
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
got suckered into doing it. But now

3062
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
it's a question that

3063
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
game previewers and game reviewers

3064
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
and people will have to

3065
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
ask game makers as embarrassing

3066
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
as it is. Is your game done?

3067
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Will your game be fully featured

3068
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
at launch? And I can't

3069
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
wait to see what fucking

3070
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
dance around the issue answers we're going to get from that

3071
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
question. This is another minor thing too

3072
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
but they changed some of the characters moves.

3073
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
The way they control. Just saying.

3074
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Martin

3075
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
in chat says, who cares about

3076
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Street Fighter anyway? Where's my new Tekken

3077
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
at?

3078
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Bob Coffee in chat says,

3079
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
it's shitty but they did this for the hardcore

3080
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
target audience. I don't know. Like

3081
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
I respect your guys' opinion

3082
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
but I have to be completely honest

3083
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
and say, I feel like you guys are

3084
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
excusing this. And like

3085
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
if I'm not a part

3086
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
of that

3087
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
audience that is doing Evo or whatever

3088
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I don't see the excuse for this

3089
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
at all. There is no excuse.

3090
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Fuck Street Fighter, where's

3091
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
my Rival Schools 3?

3092
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
And it's not excusing when

3093
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
people are defending them. They're a fucking

3094
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
company. You don't need to defend them.

3095
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
They need to fucking put out a product that's working.

3096
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
If it's not ready in time for Evo

3097
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
boo fucking who? You should have worked

3098
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
harder on it then. It'll be there for

3099
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
next year's Evo. Exactly.

3100
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Oh poor baby. Your game's

3101
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
not out in time for the fighting tournament.

3102
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Well, too fucking bad.

3103
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
ActDevtonChat says, I get the complaints

3104
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
it's not excusable but the content is

3105
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
going to be there anyway. I mean

3106
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
to be fair, to give you guys

3107
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
some slack here because I want to

3108
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
respect all opinions and so forth.

3109
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I get the whole fact that at least they're presenting

3110
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
a roadmap on, okay

3111
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
this is where we want the game to be

3112
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
and this is how we're going to get there.

3113
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
But from my perspective

3114
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I'm like, okay great. I'll buy

3115
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
the game when it's done. Because that'll be

3116
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
about the time maybe it'll go on sale. I'll

3117
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
get an even better deal out of it. Hurray.

3118
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
So.

3119
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
ActDevtonChat says

3120
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
remember Splatoon? I

3121
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I still feel like Splatoon

3122
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
was a fully featured game when it was

3123
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
launched. They added stuff to it.

3124
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
It was a full game when it was done. Yeah, they added

3125
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
maps. The things that they added

3126
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
to Splatoon, I feel like

3127
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
other companies would have charged me money for

3128
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
to be quite honest. I mean did they

3129
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
add a lot to Splatoon? Yeah, they did.

3130
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
And I think Capcom would have charged you for it.

3131
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Or made you get a million

3132
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
billion splat points when you

3133
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
only get five in a match.

3134
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I think with Splatoon you at least had

3135
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
you had a fully functional single player

3136
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
mode in Splatoon.

3137
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
That's actually pretty darn

3138
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
good. It has boss fights that are fun and everything else.

3139
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
So.

3140
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I don't know. Alright.

3141
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Yes, but the voice chat thing

3142
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
is still an issue. I will say that.

3143
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Alright. Anyhow.

3144
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Thank you for doing the emails tonight

3145
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Dark Soccer. I appreciate it. But I understand

3146
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
you are going to head out and be on your way

3147
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
for the night. Yes.

3148
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Do you have any final thoughts for the audience? Actually

3149
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
we're getting to FUs. Do you want to quickly stick around

3150
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
and do your FUs? Sure, I'll stick around and do the FUs.

3151
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
As your final thought here. Alright, let's get to the FUs

3152
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
of the week. By the way, if you want to send us emails. Hey, if you

3153
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
want to talk the Street Fighter 5 thing, you know,

3154
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I realize people out there might disagree with me. Cool.

3155
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Just email us. Participate at

3156
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
orangeonsrader.com.

3157
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
See you next time.

3158
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I laid down at 10 AM.

3159
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I didn't get up until 5.

3160
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
And I still have the same damn headache.

3161
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So. I hate it.

3162
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
It needs to go away. And I'm going home. Bye.

3163
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Uh.

3164
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I will piggyback on that.

3165
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I'm going to cut Loki off and piggyback on that. Because FU

3166
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
to being sick. Because being sick has been the

3167
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
word. I have been. I have been like

3168
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Cootie Boy this year and I hate it. Like I

3169
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
just keep getting sick and I won't stop. And yes, I've been to

3170
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
a doctor and it's just kind of one of those.

3171
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
People get sick.

3172
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Nothing serious. Just ruined your day.

3173
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Ah. Loki.

3174
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Um. Just FU to

3175
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
not being able to concentrate on programming.

3176
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I try.

3177
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
But it's just not coming to me. I'm not in the groove

3178
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I guess.

3179
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Alright.

3180
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Let's move on and get

3181
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
to just a couple more stories for you guys.

3182
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877

3183
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Game OLR. username on Skype.

3184
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

3185
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Loki. Alright. So this is

3186
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
kind of cool. So apparently

3187
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
they're going to be

3188
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
kick starting a

3189
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Jay and Silent Bob game

3190
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
called Jay and Silent Bob

3191
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
The Chronic Blunt Punch.

3192
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
And it's a side scroller

3193
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
beat em up game.

3194
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
And it's I guess going to

3195
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Kickstarter.

3196
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
But they're doing some sort of crowd funding for that.

3197
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
And apparently if it's successful they're trying to seek

3198
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
a goal of $400,000.

3199
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
And apparently this is

3200
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
a little bit different. It's not

3201
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Kickstarter actually.

3202
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
So they're doing through

3203
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Fig. So they're doing

3204
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
it's where you can actually

3205
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
invest money and get a sort of return

3206
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
on that.

3207
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Why don't they do

3208
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
$420,000?

3209
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Because they're actually

3210
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
they're trying to get like

3211
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
more than $400,000.

3212
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Okay, but I still think my joke was funny.

3213
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I know. I understand the joke.

3214
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Yeah. That would have been pretty cool.

3215
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
But

3216
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
yeah. I actually haven't really looked too

3217
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
much of this platform though. I remember hearing

3218
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
about this a little bit where they were actually doing some

3219
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
of the crowd funding through that and it wasn't like

3220
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Kickstarter where you just get like the game you actually

3221
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
can get returns on it because you're an actual

3222
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
investor in that. So it would be kind of interesting

3223
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
to check it out.

3224
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
But $400,000 for

3225
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Jay and Silent Bob fighting game.

3226
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Or beat-em-up game.

3227
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I can see that.

3228
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
What I would love to invest money in

3229
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
is more

3230
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
episodes of the Jay and Silent Bob cartoon

3231
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
or the Clerks cartoon is

3232
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
what I want to invest money in.

3233
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
So can we put up like a crowd funding for that

3234
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
please?

3235
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Because it would be awesome.

3236
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Alright. Well

3237
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I don't know. Maybe this

3238
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
would be one of the few games that you could convince

3239
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
me to pay money for

3240
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
up front without seeing anything.

3241
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
But Kojima and Del Toro.

3242
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
That's right. Here we go again. Talking about

3243
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
this. But that is because there was a talk

3244
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
at DICE at 2016

3245
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
between Hideo Kojima and joining him on stage

3246
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Guillermo Del Toro. Even

3247
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
though Del Toro had said at one point I will never

3248
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
again get involved in video games.

3249
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
At DICE

3250
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
he had basically talked about how

3251
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
the whole video game thing came together and so forth.

3252
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
He said the creativity

3253
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
can be stifled by the

3254
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
bastards with money. But basically

3255
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
made it sound like if Kojima wants him to do

3256
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
something again, he'll do it.

3257
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Hmm. Very interesting.

3258
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
By the way, Del Toro also said

3259
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
that as far as what he's playing, he's playing Fallout 4.

3260
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
But he dies a lot.

3261
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
So

3262
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
that's pretty cool. I would

3263
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
definitely buy

3264
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I would throw money at whatever Kojima and

3265
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Del Toro would do without having seen

3266
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
it at first. It's one of the few

3267
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
things I'd break the rules for.

3268
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Alright.

3269
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
That's it. I know we're

3270
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
to it a little early, but

3271
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
we're to the Skype line at 1877 Game

3272
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
OLR or username on Skype, Orange

3273
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Lounge Radio. The Skype line is open now

3274
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
if you want to give us a call. 1877

3275
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange

3276
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Lounge Radio. All one word

3277
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
while we wait for some calls. I don't know if Loki has

3278
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
any last minute stories over there. Yes.

3279
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Apparently there is a patent

3280
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
from Sony for a new

3281
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
glove-like device.

3282
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
People are comparing it to a power

3283
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
glove for

3284
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
PlayStation VR at least. It looks like some

3285
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
sort of PlayStation move-like

3286
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
device that you would use like hand

3287
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
gestures with the glove

3288
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
to kind of control the game.

3289
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Cool.

3290
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Yeah, maybe they're

3291
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
going to do the power glove right or something like that.

3292
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
That'd be kind of cool if that was something that they announced at this

3293
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
VR thing. I'd be down with that. I wonder

3294
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
if it isn't something that goes along with the VR

3295
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
thing. It would be very interesting. The way the lights

3296
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
were on the hands, very much could be.

3297
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Anyway, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

3298
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3299
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Rama. Hey, Rama.

3300
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
How's it going? Good to hear from you.

3301
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Good, good. Things are going good. I actually have a day off

3302
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
today, so I had to run around and take care of some stuff.

3303
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Oh, rough day to have the day off.

3304
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I guess,

3305
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
but at least it gives me time to go to the gym, do you know?

3306
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Oh yeah, brah. You got to work out.

3307
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Seriously, man. Seriously.

3308
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
So you didn't go to Katsucon or

3309
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
MagFest this year, right? No,

3310
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
because my job has this rule

3311
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
where you have to request

3312
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
three weeks in advance. I'm so used

3313
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
to requesting a week

3314
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
to two weeks in advance, but not

3315
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
three weeks, so I kind of forgot, and I'm like,

3316
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
you know what? I'm kind of gearing up for

3317
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
another convention in April I'm looking forward to,

3318
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
so I'm just going to save money, pay

3319
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
bills, and play the adult game for a

3320
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
little bit. That's fair. I am going to really try

3321
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
to go back next year, so we'll see.

3322
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Definitely, definitely.

3323
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
And I will make my way out there next year.

3324
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Hooray, I would love to have a Rama buddy

3325
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
there with all my other buddies.

3326
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
What's on your mind? What do we owe the phone call tonight,

3327
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
OLR?

3328
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
So, in case you haven't

3329
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
heard, one of my favorite

3330
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
strategy RPG games, Project Cross Zone

3331
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
2, came out last Tuesday.

3332
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
And I've been in the middle of playing

3333
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
other games, so when this game

3334
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
came out, I stopped

3335
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
playing all my other games, and I've currently

3336
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
been playing through this for the last two weeks.

3337
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I just picked up Mega Man Legacy Collection,

3338
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
and it's actually sitting on my shelf

3339
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
on a pile of games to play

3340
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
when Project Cross Zone 2 is

3341
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
done. Did you get the gold amiibo and all that?

3342
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I was

3343
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
too lazy because

3344
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
there was a Target up in

3345
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Queens, and I'm like, I don't feel like traveling

3346
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
all the way up there just to get

3347
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
this. But I'm like,

3348
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
if I really wanted, I could probably contact

3349
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
a friend and who could get it for me, you know?

3350
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Yeah, I

3351
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
hear you, I hear you.

3352
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
So,

3353
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
besides the whole

3354
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
gold amiibo and Legacy Collection,

3355
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
here is my question for

3356
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
you and Logie.

3357
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
What is the last game

3358
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
that y'all have played where you just

3359
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
sat there and just played

3360
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
it through from start to finish because

3361
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
the game was that good? Actually,

3362
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I have an answer for this, and it

3363
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
is kind of in the week off that

3364
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
we weren't here. The week off,

3365
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I didn't really get a chance to talk about this game.

3366
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I think I talked about it a little bit

3367
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
in my gaming week

3368
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
the last episode because I just

3369
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
barely started the game. So,

3370
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I guess Rama really was split up amongst

3371
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
some sessions, but honestly, I played

3372
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
this game a little bit on the Sunday

3373
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
before OLR, and then I think I

3374
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
played it all Monday night until I beat it.

3375
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
And that was Firewatch.

3376
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
And that is a recent release that just came

3377
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
out on PlayStation 4 and

3378
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
PC. And some

3379
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
people kind of razzed

3380
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
it a little bit because it's a walking simulator.

3381
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
You can't really die or lose.

3382
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
But I thought the story was

3383
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
interesting enough

3384
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
that I wanted

3385
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
to know how it was going to end. I wanted to know

3386
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
how it all tied together. I do have to

3387
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
admit it became really predictable in

3388
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
the last hour. I was like, okay,

3389
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I know exactly how this is going to go down, and sure enough

3390
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
it's what happened. But

3391
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
it's still one of those things where it's like, well, now that I've

3392
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
made this commitment, might as well

3393
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
finish the damn game.

3394
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Sounds about right.

3395
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
But I thought that the dialogue in Firewatch

3396
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
was so good, and you know

3397
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
that most of the interactions in that game, it's all

3398
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
over the radio. So you never

3399
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
see the woman

3400
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
that you talk to through most of the game. And I think we

3401
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
talked about this a little bit on the last show.

3402
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
There's a lot of parallels. I can't remember

3403
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
if I talked about, unfortunately I'm getting to that point in my life,

3404
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I don't remember if I talked about it on this show,

3405
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
or on guys on the show, or if this was just a

3406
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
conversation I was having with my friends at MAGFest,

3407
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
because it might have been all three.

3408
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
But there's so many

3409
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
parallels to things that happen

3410
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
in Firewatch to, I think, the way

3411
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
we've developed relationships

3412
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
in the internet age, where

3413
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
we have these deep friendships

3414
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
with people we've never met, or never even

3415
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
seen. And

3416
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Firewatch is interesting because it's set in the

3417
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
80s, yet it has a very similar

3418
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
type of relationship, and it kind of shows

3419
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
that those types of mysterious

3420
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
relationships have always existed, if

3421
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
that makes sense. So I just,

3422
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I really like that kind of twist

3423
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
in the story, and what

3424
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
that story did. So, even

3425
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
though I don't know if at the end of the year I'll

3426
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
sit here and say, wow, Firewatch was one of the best

3427
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
games I played of the year. I thought Firewatch

3428
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
was a good story, it was like watching

3429
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
a good movie, but you're

3430
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
driving it.

3431
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
So that was me, and thank

3432
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
you for asking that this week, and not a couple

3433
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
weeks before, because I don't know what the last one would have

3434
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
been before Firewatch, because most of my

3435
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
marathon sessions are thanks to MMOs.

3436
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Loki, do you remember

3437
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
the last game you sat down and you had to play start

3438
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
to finish because it was so damn good? Let me guess,

3439
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Grand Theft Auto 5.

3440
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I played a lot of that, I don't think I played

3441
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
start to finish the whole time, but

3442
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I don't know.

3443
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
I don't have an answer, I don't know.

3444
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
No other better answer? What about

3445
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
you, Rama? Is it

3446
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Project Cross Zone 2? Yeah,

3447
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
before that,

3448
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
it was The Legend of Zelda A Link

3449
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Between Worlds.

3450
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Ah,

3451
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
that was a good one on 3DS.

3452
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Yes it was, and there were

3453
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
times I had to stop playing the game

3454
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
because I'm in the ice temple

3455
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
sliding around, and I'm riding

3456
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
the subway back and forth, I'm like,

3457
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
no.

3458
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
No. It's just too much.

3459
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Yes.

3460
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
That's great, I got you.

3461
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
That's a great question, Rama, I appreciate

3462
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
it. I'll be curious with

3463
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
some of the listeners might have to say for that in our chat room.

3464
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
But I'm going to go ahead

3465
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
and wrap up so we can get another call, but anything

3466
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
else you want to get out there for our listeners tonight?

3467
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Ah, no, that's it.

3468
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Alright, take care my friend.

3469
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
YouTube, brother. Good to hear from you, bye.

3470
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Bye. Alright, 1877 Game

3471
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
OLR, our username on Skype, Orange

3472
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Lounge Radio. ActDeft in chat says

3473
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Undertale. Yeah, of course, I'm not

3474
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
too surprised to hear that. SSJ

3475
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
in chat saying, I really need to play

3476
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Firewatch. Yes, I think you do.

3477
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I do think you do. Alright, our phones

3478
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
are lighting up tonight, so I'm going to try to get to another

3479
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
call here, and

3480
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3481
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Hi, it's Embryon. Hey, how you doing

3482
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Embryon? I am okay.

3483
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I am also getting over being sick

3484
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
just like you. You may have

3485
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
gotten sick because I was patient zero

3486
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
at MAGFest. Embryon hung out with me

3487
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
lots and lots at MAGFest, so it was

3488
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
great to hear from you. Yay, it was

3489
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
the best. I have to go to that every year

3490
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
from now on. I'm really, if I have the money

3491
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I would love to. Then that was your

3492
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
first MAGFest as well, right? Yeah, it was.

3493
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
What did you think from your perspective? I don't know if you were

3494
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
here when I was talking about it earlier in the show, but what was

3495
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
your impressions of MAGFest the first time?

3496
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
It was just, I've been to a couple

3497
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
of cons, not a ton,

3498
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
but especially compared to E3,

3499
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
it's like, it's just such a different

3500
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
energy, because at E3

3501
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
a lot of the people who are there are strictly

3502
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
there for business, and I mean, a lot

3503
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
of the people you see walking around are kind of like execs

3504
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
or whatever. And there's certainly some

3505
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
energy amongst the

3506
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
journalists and people who are really excited, but

3507
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
at MAGFest it's just like nothing

3508
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
but positivity, and everybody is having

3509
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
a good time, laughing, smiling.

3510
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I mean, the concerts that we went to

3511
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
were amazing. It was, it was

3512
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
amazing. I didn't expect to

3513
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
like it as much as I did, and now it's like

3514
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
probably the best con I've been to, and I want to go every

3515
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
year. Well, in E3, E3

3516
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
isn't really a con. It's technically a

3517
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
trade show, and it's work. Of course. I mean,

3518
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
it's work. It's fun work, and

3519
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
you know, but there's a script

3520
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
that people stick to, whereas MAGFest

3521
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
was more, it's a celebration of gaming

3522
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
culture, and there was no new things

3523
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
to announce. There's no work to be done.

3524
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
We're just going to have fun.

3525
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Yeah, and I think that's kind of the charm of it, really. It's not

3526
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
like you're waiting for the next

3527
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
big story to break. It's just you're enjoying

3528
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
your time in the moment with people who

3529
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
are awesome around you.

3530
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I'm even looking into

3531
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
trying to do Rockage here, even though it's just

3532
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
in a couple weeks. They didn't give a lot of

3533
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
notice this year on that, but I'm going to really try to make it over

3534
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
there, a very similar vibe out

3535
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
there. Where's that? San Jose.

3536
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
So it's not far from me at all. Oh, no.

3537
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
It's pretty close. But it's a much smaller

3538
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
scale. It's not quite on the scale of MAGFest.

3539
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I think they have it spread out through various venues

3540
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
in San Jose this year, so it'll be interesting.

3541
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Well, to

3542
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
what did you, I made you talk about MAGFest,

3543
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
but what did you want to call in to talk about tonight, Emran?

3544
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Just to say, hey, Ranma just

3545
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
asked about what games we were playing, and I know that you guys always

3546
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
talk about it anyway, but I don't know about you,

3547
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Rob, but I have been going so hard on

3548
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Final Fantasy XIV since the patch dropped last

3549
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
week. The patch is

3550
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
really good. The patch was the kick in the ass

3551
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
this game so desperately needed.

3552
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Yeah, it's a good patch. I was a little bit worried

3553
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
before it released that it seemed a little

3554
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
light to me because they were focusing so heavily on

3555
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
the new beginner stuff, like the

3556
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Hall of the Mentor, sorry, the Hall of the

3557
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Novice and the Mentor system.

3558
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
But no, there's so much to do, and everything that there is

3559
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
is so high quality, like this, I

3560
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
won't give spoilers, of course, but the story, this

3561
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
patch, I thought was really good. Big step

3562
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
up from the last patch of the story.

3563
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
The new fights are fantastic. Yeah, I've

3564
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
capped my lore tome stones for the week, and I'm

3565
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
just kind of like... Oh my god, I have halfway to

3566
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
go. I so wish we were on the same server.

3567
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I still have half my tomes to get, because there was so

3568
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
much maintenance going on this week. But

3569
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
for those that don't know, and I think this is

3570
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
worth pointing out about the new dungeons, is that

3571
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
there are some great references

3572
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
to older Final Fantasy games, especially

3573
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
in this dungeon called the Anti-Tower,

3574
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
which is like an upside down castle that you go through.

3575
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
The final boss of the Anti-Tower,

3576
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
well, actually, the next

3577
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
to last boss of the Anti-Tower is

3578
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Ziggy, a little,

3579
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
what do they call those things, the little...

3580
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Spriggans. Spriggans, thank you. Ziggy,

3581
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
and Ziggy summons stardust

3582
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
that you have to kill. I just like to add, so

3583
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
there was a cute little tribute there to David Bowie,

3584
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
obviously. So cute. It was very adorable.

3585
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
But the last boss

3586
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
of the Anti-Tower is

3587
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Calcabrena, which, if you

3588
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
ever played Final Fantasy IV,

3589
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
that was an epic memorable fight in Final Fantasy IV

3590
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
because the dolls are

3591
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
really creepy, they do this little

3592
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
dance, and then

3593
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
you have to fight the six dolls,

3594
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
and they combine into one large doll, and

3595
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
then it becomes an endurance fight.

3596
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
And, you know, spoilers for an almost

3597
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
30 year old game here at this point, but that is

3598
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
the fight where Rydia makes her triumphant

3599
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
return to the story, is she saves you from

3600
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Calcabrena, right? So they've

3601
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
translated elements of this fight into

3602
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Final Fantasy XIV, and

3603
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
the dolls, when you go into the room, they

3604
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
do the dance, and they do the little jumps and

3605
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
twirls, just like they did in IV, and then you

3606
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
begin fighting all of them, and they transform into

3607
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
one giant doll, and it's awesome.

3608
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Oh yeah, and the whole music, everything is there.

3609
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
It's fantastic. I love it.

3610
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Boss is freaky as shit. He is very

3611
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
freaky. And in case it doesn't haunt your

3612
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
nightmares enough, just from seeing the boss, you

3613
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
can get a minion of the dolls. Yes.

3614
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I don't know why you would.

3615
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
When the Calcabrena

3616
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
doll dies at the end, because hopefully

3617
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
you beat her, or you wasted your time in the dungeon,

3618
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
it looks like one of those animatronics from Five

3619
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Nights at Freddy's, it really does.

3620
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
It's so creepy, I hate it. Super creepy.

3621
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
But the dungeon's awesome, and so is the

3622
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
other new one. It's a really, really good patch, though.

3623
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I can't stop playing, and I wish that

3624
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I wasn't capped on lore tombstones so I could keep

3625
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
doing stuff. Well, the good news

3626
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
is the reset is on Tuesday, and I think

3627
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
is the new PVP going at the

3628
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
feast, is that in on this Tuesday, or is that next

3629
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Tuesday? It's a week from Tuesday.

3630
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
So we still have another week before the feast, but

3631
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
PVP is another great way to get tomes, if

3632
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
you can get in there.

3633
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I was surprised that I enjoyed

3634
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Frontline as much as I did. I'm going to check this

3635
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
one out for sure, especially because I'm pretty sure

3636
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
you don't have to group with people from the

3637
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
same grand company this time. Oh, thank

3638
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
God. So you can just make friends and

3639
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
do it that way. Oh, thank God. That was the

3640
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
worst, that you had to be in the same free company.

3641
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Yeah, I hope I'm not lying to

3642
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
you on that. I think that's the case.

3643
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
That's okay. If you're lying to me on that,

3644
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I'll only hold it against you forever.

3645
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Okay. Alright, awesome.

3646
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Anyway, Embryon, anything else you want to

3647
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
share with our listeners tonight before I let you go?

3648
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
No, that's it. I just wanted to say hey, and

3649
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
glad you're getting better, and please

3650
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
send some of your magic my way.

3651
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I will. I'm rubbing my computer

3652
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
monitor with magic right now.

3653
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Fancy. Alright.

3654
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Alright, we'll talk to you later on. Take care.

3655
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Thanks. Bye. Bye.

3656
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
1-877-GAMO-LR or

3657
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

3658
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
if you want to give us a call.

3659
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Well, it's lighting up tonight. You guys are

3660
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
not disappointing on calls tonight.

3661
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

3662
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Hey, this is Jeff. Hey, buddy. How you doing?

3663
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Pretty great.

3664
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
What's on your mind? Watching the Oscars

3665
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
and listening to OR. I suppose

3666
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I can permiss that, as long as you're paying attention

3667
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
to us most.

3668
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Yeah, mostly. That's alright.

3669
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
I'm just teasing. What's on your mind?

3670
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Anyways, I wanted to talk about

3671
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Street Fighter V. Ah, yes, please.

3672
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Anyways, uh,

3673
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
you were talking about how

3674
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
the game is incomplete

3675
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
and all the complaints that

3676
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
like I said in chat,

3677
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
they're valid. They're not

3678
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
bad complaints. They're good.

3679
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
They're totally bad, but

3680
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
at the same time,

3681
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
it's not like the

3682
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
game is going to be incomplete forever.

3683
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
They promise, and

3684
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I'm pretty sure

3685
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
they said that

3686
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Capcom was going to

3687
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
add more stuff

3688
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
or at least

3689
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
the stuff missing from the game

3690
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
at a later point.

3691
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
I don't know.

3692
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
My biggest problem with this whole thing,

3693
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
again, I'm okay with the fact

3694
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
that Capcom puts out a roadmap to say

3695
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
at least, you know, here's when the features are coming

3696
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
in, so at least people know, like,

3697
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
oh, okay, well, what I want

3698
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
or what I'm looking for in the game is put in there, then maybe

3699
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I'll buy it. But it just, I don't know, I can't

3700
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
help but feel a little bit of that situation

3701
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
where it's like, how far are

3702
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
we going to let AAA game companies

3703
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
go with this, you know?

3704
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Like, it's getting really bad

3705
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
where now they want more and more of

3706
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
your money for no product.

3707
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
And it's just, I just,

3708
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I don't know, like, I just worry

3709
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
it sets a bad precedent.

3710
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
And that's what I

3711
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
don't understand completely of the complaints

3712
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
because we're going to get that

3713
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
for free. So

3714
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
even though you're paying, like, $60

3715
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
right now for the game,

3716
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
it's not like you're

3717
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
paying more for it.

3718
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Like, for example,

3719
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
and I'm going to say this example

3720
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
that I've heard a lot this past

3721
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
year, Battlefront

3722
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Star Wars. The game,

3723
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
most of the

3724
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
complaints I've heard of it, it's that it's incomplete.

3725
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
That it lacks

3726
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
game modes and it isn't

3727
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
that fun.

3728
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
And you have to pay another $50

3729
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
up front for the season

3730
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
path that will add more stuff

3731
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
to the game.

3732
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
In this case, and I

3733
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
also made the comparison in chat,

3734
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Splatoon.

3735
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Splatoon, one of the complaints aside the

3736
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
voice chat at the beginning

3737
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
was the lack of maps, the lack of

3738
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
variety in weapons.

3739
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
A lot of stuff was missing in Splatoon

3740
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
but they added

3741
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
at a later date and a constant rate

3742
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
also.

3743
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
I get what you're saying with the Splatoon

3744
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
thing but I just feel like it's almost

3745
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
an off comparison to me because I still feel like

3746
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
okay, even though maybe there weren't

3747
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
as many maps, Splatoon still

3748
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
felt like a fully featured

3749
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
game when it was released. And I think maybe

3750
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
part of the reason where I struggle with

3751
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
the whole Street Fighter 5 and the fact that

3752
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
all this stuff is coming later, it's like, well, I

3753
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
didn't have to wait in Street Fighter 4

3754
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
or 3 or pretty much any other fighting

3755
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
game. Like Tekken, when Tekken 3

3756
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
was out on the Playstation 1,

3757
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
you know I realized that was a long time ago, but

3758
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
think of all those awesome features that

3759
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
were there on the disc and all you had to do was unlock

3760
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
it. And it was a lot different than

3761
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
having to wait till, oh please wait till

3762
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
June for more

3763
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
characters and other

3764
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
stuff. It's just, I don't know, I just

3765
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
don't like this trend.

3766
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
That's what worries me more than anything

3767
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Akdeft, it's the trend of

3768
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
well, we want you to pay $60

3769
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
when the game's not

3770
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
like totally done. But we're gonna

3771
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
give it to you, but we just, we need your

3772
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
money up front to finish

3773
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
financing the rest of the game.

3774
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
But it isn't like the game isn't

3775
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
completely

3776
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
like lacking

3777
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
or, well the point I'm going to

3778
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
trying to get, the game

3779
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
works perfectly.

3780
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
If you see the reviews for

3781
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Street Fighter 5 and even

3782
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
some people I know that

3783
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
are like

3784
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
really into Street Fighter say

3785
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
it's probably the best in

3786
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
like since June.

3787
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Like it's one of the

3788
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
it is the best

3789
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Street Fighter ever.

3790
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
And that's the thing.

3791
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
The game works.

3792
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
The game isn't incomplete at

3793
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
least in that sense.

3794
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
So you can still play it.

3795
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
I get that, yeah,

3796
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
and also in comparison to

3797
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Splatoon, Splatoon had a complete

3798
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
story mode.

3799
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Street Fighter 5 doesn't, at least from

3800
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
what I understand.

3801
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
But it isn't like, again,

3802
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
it's not going to be there.

3803
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
It is there and it will be complete

3804
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
at a later date for free.

3805
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
They're not adding

3806
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
or they're not making

3807
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
you pay another $20

3808
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
$40 or another $60

3809
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
for all that content.

3810
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Which also happened in the

3811
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
past. That's one

3812
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
of the complaints a lot of people had

3813
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
with Capcom and

3814
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Street Fighter mostly

3815
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
that they really

3816
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
released a new version of the game

3817
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
and

3818
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
we saw it with 4.

3819
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4

3820
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Street Fighter 4

3821
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Arcade Edition

3822
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Ultra Street Fighter 4. We had

3823
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
4 or 5

3824
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
editions of Street Fighter 4

3825
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
and we had to pay for each one

3826
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
of them.

3827
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
When this one, we won't have to pay another

3828
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
$20, $40

3829
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
to get the game.

3830
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I'll give you that, but at the same time I feel like

3831
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
they kind of shifted that into

3832
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
well, now they just piecemeal the extra

3833
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
characters and that's how they're going to make their expansion

3834
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
money. I just kind of feel like that's shifted.

3835
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I'm not, you know, okay at least there's a

3836
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
baseline game that will work for everyone

3837
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
and I kind of get that end of things but

3838
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I'll give you that, that at least there's not

3839
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
going to be like an Ultra Street Fighter 5 and another

3840
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
one and another one. He's not going to keep going but

3841
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I don't know, it's still

3842
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
it just doesn't sit right with me and I don't feel

3843
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
right paying all the money up front for it.

3844
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
And I just, again, it's one of those things

3845
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
where it's like, how long is this

3846
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
going to go? And let me just ask one more

3847
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
tricky question here.

3848
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
You know, this probably

3849
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
wouldn't happen. But what if

3850
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Capcom went bankrupt tomorrow and shut down

3851
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
operations? You'll never get those

3852
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
features that you paid $60 for.

3853
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
And, you know, I know

3854
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
it seems far-fetched but we've heard of

3855
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
games like, what was that one that the

3856
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
two, not two worlds,

3857
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
what the hell was that game that the baseball

3858
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
player did

3859
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
and it was an EA

3860
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
thing and then the studio closed, there was

3861
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
all this legal drama.

3862
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I know what you're thinking of,

3863
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
it's the EA game. Right? It came

3864
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
out and then like that was it. What

3865
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
if that game, you know, that's

3866
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
the only thing I'm saying is that there's no guarantee,

3867
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
there's no

3868
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
absolute guarantee that they're going to meet that

3869
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
roadmap. We are putting faith in, well

3870
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Capcom's been around a while so

3871
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
you know, hopefully they're going to do it but

3872
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
you know,

3873
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
maybe one day we're going to put

3874
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
down the money for a game and then we don't get it.

3875
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Yeah, I understand

3876
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
that concern but like you said,

3877
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
it's Capcom. I don't

3878
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
think Capcom is going to disappear

3879
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
one day

3880
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
to another so I'm

3881
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
pretty sure we can expect it and it's

3882
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
not going to be that far

3883
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
down the road, it's not going to be another year.

3884
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
It's going to be just a couple of months

3885
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
mostly.

3886
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Sorry, thank you Dungeon Buster,

3887
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Kingdoms of Amalur, that was the name of the game, thank you.

3888
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
But yeah, it's not, like

3889
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I said, the lack of

3890
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
continent, yeah, I understand

3891
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
the complaint but

3892
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
if you don't want to

3893
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
pay $60 up front for the game,

3894
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
you don't have to.

3895
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
And everybody has said it,

3896
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
you have said it a lot of times in the show,

3897
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
it's your money, you can

3898
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
do whatever you want or you can buy

3899
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
whatever you want with it. That's absolutely right

3900
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
and if you are happy with Street Fighter V the way it is

3901
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
right now, or you're happy with

3902
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
the roadmap that Capcom has presented, you know what,

3903
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
more power to you, have a blast.

3904
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Just for me, somebody

3905
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
who's sitting on the fence a little bit, that I'm not

3906
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
like super into fighting games but I

3907
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
can be sometimes, it's just

3908
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
not enough for me. But granted, maybe

3909
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
there will be an RPG later

3910
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
on, or something that I will want to buy

3911
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
and the rest of you will think I'm crazy and that's

3912
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
just the thing about gamers,

3913
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
we're a diverse bunch.

3914
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
ActDeaf, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so

3915
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
much for the call, okay?

3916
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Thanks very much. I appreciate your perspective, I always

3917
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
love when people will call in and at least, you know,

3918
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
stick up for another perspective, so

3919
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
I appreciate it. Take care.

3920
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
You too, thanks for having me. Yep, bye.

3921
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Alright, sadly I am going to call the

3922
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
or close the Skype line at this time and I'm really

3923
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
sorry because I know more of you are trying to get through,

3924
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
but please consider sending an email or participate

3925
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
at orangeloungeradio.com

3926
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Also, I'm just, I'm

3927
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
straining my voice a little bit, I need to wrap

3928
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
up and stop, so.

3929
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
But that is about going to do it

3930
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
for another week here at Orange Lounge

3931
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Radio. Dark Soccer's already left

3932
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
the building, but Loki's

3933
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
here helping me close things out. I want to

3934
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
thank you guys for tuning in and downloading

3935
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
the show. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

3936
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
hey, tell a friend or two about the show, that's

3937
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
all we ask. Help spread the word about the show

3938
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
where every gamer has a voice because

3939
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
you know, that's the only way

3940
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
that we can get the word out there, is

3941
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
to tell a friend, or several

3942
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
about the show. I appreciate

3943
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
all the word of mouth support.

3944
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
That's going to do it.

3945
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Five star review on iTunes

3946
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
or wherever it is that you found

3947
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
this show, tune in, that stuff goes a long way as well.

3948
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Loki, your final thought

3949
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
for our audience tonight? I have 13 minutes

3950
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
to go knock down all the stuff that they put up in just a second.

3951
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
You can do it! Go!

3952
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I have one that I'm going to hit, and that should

3953
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
take down most of it. Alright, good luck buddy.

3954
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Alright, that is going to do it for me

3955
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
as well. Thank you

3956
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
guys again. We'll be back in seven days.

3957
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
My final thought tonight is I really just want

3958
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
to be done with being sick for the

3959
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
rest of 2016. Darn it.

3960
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Alright, have a good one everybody. Have a great

3961
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
night. We'll see you in seven days. Bye.

3962
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
