Visual Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:28.000
Club Nintendo Returns! My Nintendo debuts for many countries next month. Along with rewards, My Nintendo also marks Nintendo's expansion into social and gaming apps for phones and tablets. There's plenty to explain, along with some changes of heart and so much more, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Tonight, February the 7th of 2016, episode number 630 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
My name is Rob Roberts, also on Twitter at Skie, joining you in Sacramento, California Studio N7 with my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello and welcome back. You were absent last week. I know you had some other stuff coming up last minute, but we're glad to have you back.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
So how you doing?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Alright.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
It's been a little while since you've been here because I was sick like two weeks ago.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, way to go Rob.

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm sorry, we've been Jamie-less for a little while. I did tell the listeners that even though you missed last week, you were the one host that was good to go two weeks ago. And it was almost the Jamie Summers show for three hours.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Dude, that used to happen.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
What would happen on the Jamie Summers show for three hours?

01:25.000 --> 01:39.000
Oh, I know, I know. You said it earlier when you came into the studio that yesterday you were having a bunch of sweet food. Today you're having a bunch of savory food. The three hour Jamie Summers experience would be salty.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
So...

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
You like that?

01:41.000 --> 01:55.000
No, I honestly don't know what the Jamie show would be. It's basically just me going, screw the format. I'm going to talk about, let me explain you a thing. That'll be my show. Let me explain you a thing.

01:55.000 --> 02:07.000
It's hard to do a show by yourself. Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, we are on of course 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern every Sunday night live at the Voicy Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com, immediately after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:07.000 --> 02:22.000
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, he does do the solo thing and it's not easy. It's not. He does calls, so at least he has that at the end of the show, but he does a good 40 minutes or so by himself. So it's something that takes time to develop, I'm sure.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
See, I miss my music streaming show.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Because then I could just play whatever the weirdness I had in my directory was.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Oh, I miss the day when the legal legalities were much more blurred than they are today.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
You know what I could do is I could do nothing but playing turntable.fm and stream it.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh my gosh, I miss that site. Turntable.fm was awesome. Did they ever get like a suitable replacement for that site? I don't remember what happened.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I thought it was still going.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
No, turntable.fm shut down some time ago.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh, that sucks.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Because then they were going through SoundCloud and then things happened and yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Oh well. Anyway, also joining us in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Hello.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
When OLR was a network, he actually had a show that was like turntables. It was two turntables and a microphone with Loki. So that wasn't the name of the show.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
What was it, Friday Night Live?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
It was Livewire.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Livewire. Oh, that's it because the Mountain Dew joke.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yep.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good times. So have you mixed anything lately?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
No.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
No, DJ Loki's gone.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
No, it's just having felt like it.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Sure, I understand. Replaced with an indie game developer, Loki, which he also has.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
Which he also hasn't really felt like doing. No, actually, funny enough, this week actually, I was super excited about it on Twitter.

03:45.000 --> 03:58.000
Like, I have been having the hardest time getting Unity 5 to work on my PC. It just, for whatever fucking reason, it would just crash whenever I would try to change the color of a texture or whatever.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Whenever I go to that color picker, just the whole thing crashes. And I can never get it to work.

04:02.000 --> 04:16.000
And it's fucking Windows 8's fault. Like, way back when I had Windows 8, it was that fault because, for whatever reason, that version of Windows I had kept having problems where it would take off file ownership.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
So, like, you'd create a file or something and all of a sudden you can't read it, can't write to it because just all the owner properties are gone.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
And you just randomly do that with pretty much anything that's being created.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
So, apparently, there was a file or a settings file that was hidden deep within the computer for Unity that still had that problem.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
I, just out of a whim, I was like, you know, I was gonna install virtual machine to get it installed on there and see if that would work.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
And I was like, you know, I should see about actually uninstalling it properly. Let me make sure I'm doing this right.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
And it's like, oh, yeah, check in this folder, delete all this stuff. I'm like, I've done that. And I went into this other folder. I'm like, oh, hey, there's stuff still there.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm sorry, but this sounds like when I had that Skype debacle a week, like a month ago on the show. Remember that?

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
Where the missing piece was, I needed Internet Explorer 8. Not 11. I needed Internet Explorer 8 specifically.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
There was a file that was sitting in, like, one of the Unity 5 setting things that I went and deleted.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
And then it wouldn't delete. I'm like, why is this not deleting? And sure enough, the file was called, like, color setting something something.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm like, oh, son of a bitch. And so I deleted it, uninstalled it, reinstalled it. Oh, hey, it works now.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
But that's great, though. So now I have Unity 5 working and I can make my game look much better.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
And, yeah, all the fun bells and whistles I couldn't access with Unity 4 without Pro.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Alright, we do tape live, of course, at the Voice Geeks Network on Sunday nights, like I said earlier.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
But if you are listening live, and thank you, by the way, if you are live tonight. I mean, we love the podcast people as well. Don't get me wrong.

05:40.000 --> 05:50.000
We do the podcast because we love you guys, too. But I know, especially today, there's a little football game going on about a two-hour drive from here that has everybody going crazy.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
So thank you, guys, for choosing OLR tonight. I very well realize some of you have OLR in the left ear and, like, the TV on speaker.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
So you can kind of do both. Hey, that's okay. If you can multitask, you're still okay by me.

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
But if you are listening live, join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com. VX JasonXVR, our pal that does the voiceovers here on the show, says,

06:11.000 --> 06:20.000
dubtrack.fm is the standing site of the turntable or plug DJ ilk, though there is no dance floor or user representation.

06:20.000 --> 06:31.000
So, and that, you know, that was part of the best thing about turntable and why I love that site, which I can't believe we're doing, like, the retro thing for something that really was, well, it was only about two or three years ago that was the thing.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
But I really discovered a lot of great music through that. And that was even, like, we used to do, like, the post-OLR. We would kind of go on turntable for a little bit.

06:39.000 --> 06:48.000
And, like, you would have five people on the stage and, like, I'd play a song, then Jamie would play a song, then whatever random listener got up there, like, Dark Tetsuya or Misty or something would play a song.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
And, yeah, it was just, that was a lot of fun. So I missed that. I understand legally it's probably a bitch, but that was a great music discovery site.

06:56.000 --> 07:07.000
So, anyhow, joining us in studio tonight, welcome back this week, someone else who I think joined us on many of those turntable nights, but is joining us here in studio for yet another bottle of wine.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Say hello to Shane.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I said it early.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
How are you? Yes, you did. You're going to town on that wine early, aren't you?

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Well, from earlier, too, but no, I haven't, I'm taking this at a decent rate.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
I think we had wine here in the studio, and today, Shane was like, I want more, so we need to go to the winery.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
It tastes like juice.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
What wine?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, and Dark Sakura just finished her glass, by the way.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, I'm, like, losing right now, but there's plenty of night left.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Did you have fun at the wineries today?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yes, I did.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Good times.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And one tasted like Frutopia.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
And you said it, right?

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
And I said that to the wine people, because what are they going to do? Be horrified that I said that? It was a compliment.

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
I just, I don't know if, do we have any winemakers out there who listen? Would you enjoy having your drink compared to something you could get at McDonald's in the 90s?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Okay, but it was good.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Mmm, this tastes like Dippin' Dots.

08:02.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, that was good, too. So, yeah, you should take that and be proud that I said that, and I didn't say it tasted like a shoe like most wine does.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
You just don't like reds. You like whites.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, no, they also had that red that was good, too.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Because it was a sweet red. Anyway.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
In our chat room, we have Agent Pothead, who says, first time listening live ever for me. Well, you picked a heck of a night to do it. Thank you for being here. Appreciate that.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
And anybody else who might be listening to OLR for the very first time.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
Shane, I would ask what's new with you, but we just really got all that out of the way last week.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Because nothing happens in the span of a week.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, do you want to talk about this new little toy you're playing with right now?

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, I finally got my Apple Pencil for my iPad Pro, and it's freaking amazing.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
And I don't even want to touch my screen anymore. I'm just going to touch it with the pencil.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
You're the only person I know, first off, with an iPad Pro, which is the gigantic one.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
It's not even that big after you play with it for a while. Like, I need a Pro Pro now.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
But you said something to me. Speaking of gaming and all this stuff, you said something to me earlier today. Like, how much are those things retail? Those Pros? Like $1,000?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
The one I got retail normally is like $1,100.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh, my God. All right.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
But I did not pay that, nor nearly that much.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay, all right. We won't get into that.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Exactly.

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
Okay, so these things are usually about $1,100, but you have one. And you said something earlier that, what was it? DJ Max Technica.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Oh, yeah, Technica. Yeah, what about it?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Like, justified your purchase.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh, yeah, because I can't quit playing it. I absolutely love it. It's my Technica iPad. That's all it is.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
But now with your pen...

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Now it's my drawing slash Technica iPad. But Technica's probably still a little higher on the list.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
And I didn't even know you did art for yourself.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yep. There you go.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
Because I would think if you were an art guy, you would have done the album art for your show yourself.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I didn't have anything to even do that with, though, until now.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Gotcha. Well, thank God Cody helped you out, huh?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Yes, and his album art is fantastic.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
Quick plug for your show. Since we at least have one person who's listening for the first time tonight. Quick plug for your show.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't know how to do that right now because I'm drinking.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You say the name of the show.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Ranger Pride.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
And what it's about.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Power Rangers and Super Sentai.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
And where they can find it.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
On the Internet.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Very good. Very good.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
And iTunes.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Just say available, just like on RuPaul's Drag Race, your favorite show.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I will not. That is not my favorite show.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Available on iTunes. Wink. That's how you do it.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
That is not something I'm going to say like that.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
All right. All right.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Agent Pothead is pointing out, I've been a listener for about six years. Just my first time in chat.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, welcome all the same.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
That's a heck of a long time to be listening before you do the live thing.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
You know what? I actually, I hear that quite a bit from some of the live people.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
It's like, you know, I've been listening to this show for years and I just, it just occurred to me you guys are live right now.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And I'm not doing anything for a change on Sunday night.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
So, no, we welcome everybody who likes to participate.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
So, anyhow, we're going to get into some gaming news for the week, of course.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
And there's a lot of it going on, despite, you know, whatever football game's on the TV right now.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
But I didn't want to get into a kickoff topic tonight, which, you know, there is a game on TV.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
But there's some people that instead of watching the game that's on TV, well, they'll watch the game on TV,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
but they want to watch it for the commercials.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
And, you know, Super Bowl commercials are pretty legendary.

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
I'm hearing this year's, I mean, of Twitter, I don't know how much I trust Twitter to be the gauge of everything social in the world.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And especially if they're going to fuck up the timeline order, which I've heard is a thing.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I don't know if that's Opt-In or whatever.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Apparently it's supposed to be Opt-In, but hopefully they don't go the route of Facebook.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
But anyway, I digress.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Twitter is, you know, sometimes my gauge, that sort of thing.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
And I'm hearing the commercials this year are not that great.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
But some of the commercials in the past have been amazing.

11:46.000 --> 11:54.000
For example, the year Betty White did the Snickers ad, I think that kind of put her back into the mainstream.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
And let's all be thankful for that, because Betty White should have never really left the mainstream.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
And if you saw a movie called Lake Placid where she had amazing cameo, she never left the mainstream.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
But anyway, I want to talk about commercials, and specifically a little bit about video game commercials.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Because, say what you will about the commercials that are on during the Super Bowl this year.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
But we know that there's a big one for the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
We already talked about that a little bit on last week's show, I think, because the commercial was already out on the internet.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I don't think we talked about that last week at all.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Did we? I thought we did.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Nope.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
We talked about it. I haven't seen it.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
You haven't seen it?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
That's what I would have said. No, I have not seen it.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
You still haven't seen it now?

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
No, I heard about it. It's got Generation 1 Pokemon and Lucario.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
And that's all I heard about it.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
Well, it's got this really weird intermix, real life stuff.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
It even shows a guy at a football game getting prepped, ready to go out on the field.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
And as he walks out, you know how football players will tap the ceiling type thing?

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
The ceiling says, I want to be the very best.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
There's a whole bunch of little Easter eggs in that commercial.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Exactly.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
But then the other part is that a lot of the Pokemon that are in it just look like they're fucking real.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Like there's a Pikachu chilling out in somebody's living room that just looks like it's the family cat.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
And everybody, of course, is going, this is what Pokemon Go is going to be like with stars in their eyes.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
And it's like, no, if you've ever played Ingress, Pokemon Go will be nothing like what you think it's going to be.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Just like the trailers for Ingress, it's like this big epic thing.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
It's like, dude, this is going to be so awesome.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
You'll be sitting there on my cell phone and saying, no, it's not awesome. There's nothing.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
I love Ingress. I've met many amazing people playing Ingress.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
It's a great game, but it's nothing like the trailer.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
The trailer, it's not any more close to that. People do not do that at all.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
I encourage you to watch the Ingress trailer and then watch the Pokemon Go trailer and look at the fast one they're pulling on you.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
And again, that's not a slam on Pokemon Go. I can't wait to play it.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I think it's going to be the MMO that everybody's been waiting for.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
But anyway, so this Pokemon commercial has been on TV and I know a lot of people are talking about that.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
But how about video game commercials in general?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I personally don't see as many of them as I used to.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
And that's probably because, well, I don't watch as many TV shows in general.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Or if I do, it's on Netflix, so there are no commercials.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Or I think a lot of people have the power to fast forward commercials.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
But I certainly know that video game commercials were a huge part of my youth.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
And I want to know from the crew in here, and for those of you in chat,

14:30.000 --> 14:40.000
if you remember any epic video game commercials and how it might have sold you on the game or maybe made you want the game even more.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
So, video game commercials. Anybody? Want to start us off, Loki?

14:46.000 --> 14:54.000
Video game commercials? I don't know. I think a lot of the ones for Grand Theft Auto were pretty cool.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Just they set them to music and stuff. Like, I remember San Andreas, you know, that was pretty awesome.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
Even Grand Theft Auto 5. But Grand Theft Auto 5, I just watched the trailers like crazy anyways before the game came out.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
I can't really think of any 80s commercials or anything for video games that just kind of got me hyped up about them or anything. I don't know.

15:14.000 --> 15:22.000
In chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, I still see Call of Duty commercials and they show review scores from all these tiny sites that gave them great marks.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
Which is the exact same thing that happens with movies. And they'll cut things completely out of context and all this other stuff too, right?

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Bobby says, we could get into a Call of Duty commercial if VOG wants to give Call of Duty a high rating and submit it to them.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
We're not going to sell out like that. If somebody on our staff happens to truly enjoy a Call of Duty game, then so be it.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
We'll give it a 10. A 10 out of 1.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
You want to be a 10 out of 100?

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
It would just be like, you know, we'll just reverse the order. 10 higher the number, worse the game is.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
10 out of 10. It's okay.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
It's a 10th place position.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
And he's the one person not drinking wine. Just, you know, Dark Sakura.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Four words. Your vision is our vision.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
What was? I don't remember that.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
ColecoVision.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Oh! I'm too young for that.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
Was that weird baby commercial in the Super Bowl at all?

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
Like for the Playstation 3, did they start doing that around that time? Or was that way...

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
So it was ColecoVision for you, Dark Sakura?

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
I just remember that being the first video game commercial I have a memory of.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Sure.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
And it was only 1982, which I think you existed.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I did exist. I'm just giving you crap.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
I remember the Atari 2600 kiosks at Thrifty's Payless or whatever.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I think it was just Payless at the time.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
The item that Dan and I sat and cleaned up on the kitchen table a few days ago was the same ColecoVision I owned as a kid.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Wow. And it still works?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Still works.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
That's amazing.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
On top of that, it still had the little technical advice safety sticker on the top of it.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
With adhesive that never died or something.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
So we actually did save the sticker and put it in the bottom of our Frogger box full of annuals.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
That's awesome.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Yeah.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
So, we've got pictures of it. I'll post it somewhere.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
The one that always comes to mind wasn't necessarily the video game commercial, but it was the Nintendo cereal commercial.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Because Nintendo is for breakfast.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Now, who doesn't remember that song?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Well, it's our age. That's our age.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Okay. I was like, I don't remember.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Did you ever have Nintendo cereal?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I'm pretty sure I did, but I don't remember having a commercial for it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
It wasn't terrible, but it was pure sugar.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
It was pure sugar.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
It was awful.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
That sounds really good.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I ate as a kid was like grape nuts and total.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I hated kid cereals.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I like that.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Except for Rice Krispies.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I didn't like total, but I like Chex.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
That's what I like.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Chex is the bomb.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
That's why they still make mix out of it.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Don't they still sell Chex?

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah, but you take Chex and you just cover it in cinnamon.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Sounds good to me.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
And then you add this stuff to it.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Like real cinnamon and not that fake cinnamon crap they put on.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
Chex, I was going to say, Chex was cinnamon. Isn't that just Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Because the Cinnamon Toast Crunch was not good or real cinnamon.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Cinnamon Toast Crunch is also not good if you put it in milk.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Nasty, nasty, nasty crap.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Golden Grahams is like crack.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
That was awful too.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Instead of Cheerios.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
As soon as they eat one, I'm like, I got to consume the entire box.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
I am actually one of the crazy people that hates the taste of Cheerios.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
I like Honey Nut Cheerios, but not...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
The sweetest thing that I liked as a kid was Frosted Mini-Wheats.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Wait a minute.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
The kick off topic was supposed to be...

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Cereal.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Commercials, not breakfast, cereal.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
We can do that another time.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Shane, okay, so you're a whopping five years younger than me.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So what do you remember?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I can't remember any commercials.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Like I'm literally racking my brain.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
But they still show them today.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I know, but I don't...

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
The last time I remember seeing one was during South Park.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I'm sure there's like...

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I've seen like Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty commercials.

18:58.000 --> 19:07.000
But I can't think of a single commercial right now that I've seen at all.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I don't know why.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
I remember a commercial for Link's...

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
The Link game that was on Super Nintendo that was...

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Link to the Past?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah, Link to the Past.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
It was pretty amazing.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
I don't know.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I have nothing.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Absolutely nothing for commercials.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I had that when it came out.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
No, it was good.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
So I just don't think they ever existed at this point, because I can't remember it.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Did you watch TV as a kid?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I feel like I probably did.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
What shows were you watching, though?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Because if you were watching like adult shows...

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Like adult shows.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Let's say when you were 10.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Power Rangers.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Okay, will you show...

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
And X-Files.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
What?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
It's just a funny combination.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Power Rangers and X-Files.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I remember.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
That's like two of my favorite shows when I was a kid.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
That commercial was lame.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh, the Pokemon one?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
You just watched it?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, I just watched it.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Which thing is lame?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Why was it lame?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
It's just stupid.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
It's just like, oh, I can do that.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
I can do that.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
And then they're training to be the best, I guess, in whatever crap that they're doing.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And then it's just some random Pokemon shit.

20:12.000 --> 20:21.000
I never got my video game desiring stuff from commercials.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Because I had subscriptions to Nintendo Power and GamePro, so I saw print ads.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
And I never really saw TV ads for games.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
There were a lot of legendary print ads, though.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I can't even remember those, but I have no idea.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Genesis does what Nintendo does.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
That was epic.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I had GamePro, and that was all just one ad.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
That was a TV commercial, right?

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
The Dark Side was just seeing the little jingle over there.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
That's how they showed off that Street Fighter Championship Edition was going to be a thing

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
on Genesis, right?

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
And having the long-term argument over which version of Samurai Shodown was better.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Which, by the way, was the SNES version.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Alan Alchemy is off work tonight and wanted to make a quick cameo on the show to talk

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
on this topic.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
If you guys mentioned this previously, I apologize.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I'm going to look really stupid.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
But who remembers the Legend of Zelda commercial that had nothing to do with Legend of Zelda?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It was a guy in the turtleneck in a maze.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Zelda!

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
He was like, Octorot!

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
And he's shouting the names of the monsters, and then they showed a little gameplay footage.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
And you had no idea.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It was the weirdest commercial.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
You can probably find it on YouTube.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
I feel like that commercial came up on the show not even a month ago.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I mean, yes, that was an epic commercial.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
But yeah, I think we played it.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Epicly stupid.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
It was pretty stupid.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
I think we watched it going, what does this actually have to do with the game whatsoever?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Okay, I thought of one for Shane.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Because I know when I was young.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Here's the thing.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Maybe it wasn't video game commercials.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And we'll end on this, and we'll go into our gaming week.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Maybe it wasn't video game commercials.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
But it was product placement for video games that was a big seller.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
And what I'm talking about is, when I was young, and when Jamie was young,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
they had a show on TV called Starcade.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
And that's where...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Starcade was great.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah, they would play the actual 80s arcade games.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
And GameProTV.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Like Kongo Bongo and shit.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
And trying to set the high scores.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
But now, five years later, probably when you were younger, around that 10 age,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Nick Arcade was the thing that was on TV.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
Now, do you remember seeing stuff on Nick Arcade going, I want to get that?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
No.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Really?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
No, I didn't.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Well, that was anticlimactic, wasn't it?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
You want to know what's great, though, is that I remember on GameProTV,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
they had that one kid who was...

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
It was hosted by J.D. Roth.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
No, no, no, no.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Funhaus?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, who was the Funhaus guy.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
But no, J.D. Roth didn't do this one.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
He's the producer of The Biggest Loser.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Fun fact. Anyway.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
But, well, it was when they showed the Neo Geo.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Ah.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And had the cards and everything.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And I was like, I need this in my life.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
And I made it my dream goal as a gamer to own a Neo Geo.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And then when you got an income...

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
No.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
You bought a Neo Geo, right?

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
When I got with Dan, he had a Neo Geo.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
And I knew he was a keeper.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
Some women, they want some flowers.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
They want a diamond ring.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Dark Sakura wants her man to have a Neo Geo.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I love it.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
Well, and I honestly, I kind of put the goal off for a while because I worked at an arcade

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
and we had all kinds of Neo Geo cabs and everything.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
And it were all the games that I wanted to play.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
We had a Metal Slug.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
We had the widescreen Samurai Shodown 4 and everything.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And I was happy.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
And then I moved out here and Dan had a Neo Geo and a Sega CD.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
And I was like...

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I'm moving in.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Well, and the thing is, when I shipped my stuff ahead of time so that when I...

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
The day I arrived, actually my big thing of luggage arrived.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
And in it was my Super Nintendo and Dan knew I was a keeper.

24:02.000 --> 24:09.000
You know, Nintendo did a great job of advertising kind of by using commercials in a way.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
It was like, if you had Nintendo Power, sometimes they would send you video tapes, VCR tapes

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
of upcoming games.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
And I got one for like...

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Videos.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I got one for Donkey Kong.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I remember that.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Donkey Kong Country.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
I believe I got one for Killer Instinct.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
There was one for Killer Instinct.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Because didn't it also come with the Killer Cuts album?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
No.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
That was when you bought the Super Nintendo game.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Okay.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Which I got mine at Montgomery Wards.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
I got several games from there too.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
That's right.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
My Nintendo came from Sears.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I paid 60 bucks for it.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Back when Sears was a major player in gaming.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
And I still have my Killer Cuts.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
I got Einhander from Montgomery Wards.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Remember when we were all kids, there was no GameStop.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
There was a...

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Funkoland was in a magazine.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I remember that.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I didn't have Funkoland.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
But that was KB Toys.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah, it was like KB Toys and Toys R Us.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
I had Electronics Boutique and software, et cetera.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Remember when we went to the Toys R Us and Chico and they still had the pull caps?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
That was so cool.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
That was so cool.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Oh my God.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
It's like a Toys R Us of the 90s with the pull slip.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Yes.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Babbages.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
And our Babbages was, we had a Babbages in the mall and we had a software, et cetera,

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
that was part of Barnes and Noble, like in the back.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And that was also the first Starbucks I ever went to.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I used to get all my stuff for half price there.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Dungeon Buster says, if I recall correctly, there was a Neo Geo ad comparing itself as

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
a fully loaded hot dog versus a plain boring one, all the other consoles.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I remember that actually.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
I, that is true.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
That was a, that was a real thing.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
This hot dog costs $500.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
This hot dog, not $500.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
But the $500 one is fully loaded.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
It better be for $500.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
All right.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Well, uh, let's see.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
NSJ100Matt says Toys R Us and Sears were my local game stores as a kid.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So, um, I used to go to Fry's.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
I remember like, uh, Street Fighter II came from a software, et cetera, but that was,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
mine came from a pawn shop.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
I used to pre-order my games at both software, et cetera, and Electronics Boutique in the

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
same mall.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And then just like decide later which one I wanted to go to.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Cause I could never remember which one was upstairs or downstairs.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
So I was just like, I'll call in and do it over the phone.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Wow.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Wow.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
It didn't matter.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
It didn't matter.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
All right, let's get into our gaming week.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
So we've had a fun walk down memory lane, but let's talk about the types of video games

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
that we have been playing a little more recently, such as this week.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Uh, Dark Sakura, you got a couple of weeks to catch us up on.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
How was your gaming week?

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
It was actually kind of eventful because I was sitting down to play Dragon Age Inquisition

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
today and I just got this random thing.

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
I was looking at different mods and decided that, um, these screenshots that someone posted

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
of Dragon's Dogma actually looked kind of cool.

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
And so I, you know, it was on sale for that, whatever Steam thing sale they're doing is.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
Um, and so I decided that I was going to buy it and I started playing it and it was

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
actually super, super nice.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
And I see Shane's iPad, so I'm going to airdrop him a picture of a Cliccovision.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I had a Cliccovision.

27:19.000 --> 27:26.000
I, um, before I left Kansas, I found it and tried to turn it on and the only game I could

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
find the scary cat in the hat mix up game that just, I hate so much and it wouldn't

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
work.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
So I was okay.

27:33.000 --> 27:40.000
Well, we also had Tecmo Bowl going on today because Dan wanted to see which team Tecmo

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
Bowl would pick and they picked the Panthers.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
Um, uh, but Dragon's Dogma is pretty neat so far, but it really felt like a knockoff

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
of Origins at first.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
And then, um, it actually got better after character creation.

27:55.000 --> 28:03.000
It, it, the story definitely veered, but I forgot that it was, um, uh, Capcom that was

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
the, uh, uh, producer.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
So I was a little surprised and kind of dismayed with myself for giving Capcom money, but oh

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
well.

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
Um, and then, um, I've been playing some more, um, Animal Crossing, Happy Home Designer,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
which that game makes me happy in my heart.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Does it make you a home designer in your heart too?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
I guess.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
A virtual home designer.

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
You know, I, I, I broke out my, um, amiibo, uh, the, the, the amiibo and, uh, made Cyrus

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
a home today.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
I love Cyrus.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
I figured if I do kicks, it's just going to be nothing but like shoes all over the place.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
And I'm going to put a big sign in front of his house that says OMG shoes.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Um, uh, Shane sent me a dog.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
I, well, you sent me a picture, so I was like, I need to return the favor.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
So here's a puppy.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Nice.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
We're air dropping here in studio.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
Um, I also cleaned out a bunch of games out of my steam library that I'm not playing because

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
I'm going to be changing out my hard drive in my PC for a terabyte hard drive soon.

29:09.000 --> 29:16.000
And, um, Dan and I are actually going to be doing the full home rig switch over to max

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
after, uh, income tax comes back in depending, depending cause we also wanted, you know,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
actually clean up the game room and do stuff to it.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
We're also going to be selling off some of the vault.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
You've been threatening to do this for a while.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
No, it's starting.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
We've actually gone to see how many duplicates of things we have.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Do you know that we own six Nintendos?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Wow.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
I think six.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Well, one of them's loaned out.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
One of them is the really crappy one.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Two of them are fine decks.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
Two of them are in the box and one of them's a top loader.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I love that you have it all detailed that much.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
That's what you said.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
One of them's the crappy one.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Like it's broken.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Oh, it's broke.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Okay.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
This still, it still works cause it's Nintendo.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
I mean, um, we also were probably going to be selling off my super Nintendo cause it's,

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
it's got, it was, it's got the stain on it and we've got, you know, one that's really

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
pretty.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And then we have, uh, the new style, one of those as well.

30:11.000 --> 30:18.000
Um, so anyone out there interested in buying a piece of the vault, let me know cause I

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
will give OLR people first crack.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Um, other than that, um, haven't really been, oh yeah.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Heroes of Dragon Age.

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
This is my, my drug now because I want Cullen and the stupid game won't give, give me, it'll

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
give me a million reanimated Leandras, but no Cullen.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
Although I do now have a King Galister and that makes me happy too because he's precious

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
King cinnamon roll and now I'm done.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
All right.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Let's go over to Loki.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
How was your gaming week?

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
Um, my gaming week was pretty much consisted of, uh, Lego Marvel Avengers.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
I played through the rest of the mission.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I think it's all story missions now.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I have to go back and check.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
Um, but basically the main game, the main portion of that is just the first two Avenger

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
movies and they have three separate missions that cover the other movies that are kind

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
of in between Avengers and Avengers two.

31:11.000 --> 31:18.000
So there is Thor Dark World, Captain America, Winter Soldier and Iron Man three, all of

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
which I've not seen the movies yet for those, but it played through all the levels for me.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Kind of a gist of what kind of happens now on this.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
So I finished all those and unlocked a bunch of characters and all that fun stuff.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
Still really frustrates me that the cars drive like shit and also that the, um, map

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
for whatever reason, they got rid of the map and it's this really small radar screen that

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
they have now that makes it fucking impossible to find anything you're looking for in the

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
game is super easy.

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
Like in the old game to kind of eliminate, okay, here's all the different things I've

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
already unlocked.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Um, you know, I need to figure out which character I'm missing.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Oh, okay.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
He's up here in the corner of the screen or something like that.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Now you can't.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
You just have to run around randomly to all these colored dots and hopefully one of them

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
is the same is what you're looking for.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
It's just really frustrating the way they decided to do that and for no apparent reason,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
because all that they did was like the, the button that was the map before, which was

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
like the touch pad on the PlayStation four now is a go to space button, which actually

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
they have that in the pause menu as well.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
So it's stupid that they got rid of it.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
Uh, that being said, also played, um, what was it?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
My son played a little bit of Lego, Marvel, um, superheroes.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
So I played a little bit of that as well.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
I'm very bored of that game since we've over 200 and like 30 hours into it.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
I will play that game with your son because they put Wiccan in it now.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Yes.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Yes.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
We have Wiccan already from a Lego vendors, so that's pretty cool.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Um, still disappointed.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Spiderman's not in it though.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
Um, they have all the other ones from ultimate Spiderman, but not Spiderman.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
And then what else did I play?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I also played ingress.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm about 500,000 away from level 11.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
So, so just kind of playing it on my compute and commutes and stuff.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
And also, you know, on my way to the show today, I knocked down two big fields and stuff.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
So did that.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
And then what else?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
What else did I play?

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
Um, I know there's something else I played.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
I bought some more games, I thought, on the PlayStation four because they were having

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
some sales and everything.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
So I want to say I was playing one of those, but yeah, apparently it was so awesome that

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I completely forgot about it.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
So I think maybe some follow up.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
That's it.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
I did disconnect myself from the internet though, because they're going to patch out

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
one of the glitches I've been using and I don't want that to happen.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Like, no.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
All right.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
Um, my gaming week was, um, pretty, uh, I really only played Diablo three.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
I've been playing a lot of Diablo three seasons and I'm sure this made up the bulk of Shane's

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
week as well.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
Uh, but it's kind of like a thing like now, like, cause Diablo three, I feel like spoilers

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
for my week.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Well, I feel like we've played a lot.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Like last night we played a ton and then like there was another day this week we played

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
some, but it's like me, you, our friend Dom, and then Alan will all play online.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
So it's like a perfect, like a little four player set up and we're all different classes

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
in the season.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So, uh, that's been kind of fun to progress in the rifts and all that.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
So I'm having a great time with Diablo three.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
I, a little, I still been dabbling a little bit in fall of SE 14.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
I did sign on enough to do the holiday event cause they have the Valentine's, but they

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
call it Valentine or something.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
They call it something different in the game.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
Um, and I did that event real quick just to do that.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
Uh, I'm more kind of waiting for the content patch though, which I think is while I'm at

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
magfest is when, or like right when I get back, it was in that content patch comes out.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So, um, there's that to look forward to.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Otherwise I, I honestly didn't play a lot of stuff.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm sorry guys.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
A little bit of fall of SE explorers, but, um, I, I kind of slacked off on gaming this

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
week.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Uh, Shane, how was your gaming week?

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Um, so I played a little bit of Diablo.

34:54.000 --> 35:00.000
I didn't, I don't think it's as much as you are kind of exclaiming, but mostly I played

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
more than you because Alan and I will play without you and without Dom.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
So there, there is more that I played a bit of explorers.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Explorers still really love that game.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
Mostly, mostly DJ Max Technica on my iPad.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Like I can't get enough of it.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
It's so good.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
I wish they would update it, but it hasn't been updated in over a year, but I want more

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
songs even though like technically I think it has like a hundred, but you have to pay

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
for them.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
So I'm not going to get most of them, but it's really fun.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
I love it.

35:31.000 --> 35:38.000
I also, um, got a fan translation for the second Ace Attorney Investigations game.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
And so I started playing that cause I love the Ace Attorney games, but I didn't even

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
make it past like the first examining stage before I was like, I'm too tired to keep playing.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
It's a lot of reading, but it's good.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I like, I like the music a lot.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
So, um, that's all the games I played.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Technica, some Cytus.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
That's it.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
All right.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
Uh, before we get into tonight's gaming news, I want to just do some quick housekeeping.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
Uh, we will be here live next week in seven days, but we will not be here live in two

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
weeks.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
That is because I'm going to be in the Washington DC area at MagFest.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm very excited to be there.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Um, OLR and VOG Network, we're not really doing anything in an official capacity.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
We're just going because honestly, um, a lot of our listeners have been saying you should

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
go.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
And, um, after last year when I, I wasn't really, I'm in all honesty and transparency,

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
I wasn't really feeling PAX East and I'm sorry to all the fans there.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
And, and I know there's some great people that still go and so forth, but I just, I

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
wasn't feeling it quite the same way and I wanted to try some different shows.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
So, um, a lot of folks were like, you should try MagFest.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
So I said, okay, so we're going to do MagFest this year.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
So I'm really excited to go and check that out.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Um, so I will be there in two weeks.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
So that is very exciting.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Bobby Blackwell from the Voice of Geeks Network also going to be there.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I know some of our listeners are coming as well.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
Um, and, uh, my buddy who is on the Koopa Club podcast is going to be there.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
So, uh, I'm sure there will be no shortage.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I saw some podcast panel.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
We have nothing to do with it, but there was some gaming podcast and I apologize.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
I forget the name of the moment of who you were, but, um, there, there's, there will

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
be no shortage of podcasters I'm sure at, uh, MagFest.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
So I'm looking forward to having a very good time there.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
Uh, stay tuned to our forums for more information on any, uh, potential meetup at the show.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Uh, we're hoping to do like an unofficial type of meetup there, but I'll be really easy

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
to find.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Just, uh, look for like, look, look for a Tron machine.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
Uh, look for Dig Dug cause I'm really, you know, I play that and I'm, I like that game

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
a lot.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Uh, or look for, um, like a classic Star Wars.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
If they have like one of those Star Wars caps, especially if you can sit in it, like they

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
have at, um, California Extreme, I will definitely be playing that.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
So, all right.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Uh, so I'm excited about MagFest.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
SSG100Matt says, I'm getting really hyped for MagFest.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I mentally packed this week.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
Hey, when I saw that schedule come out and I saw that they are actually screening a Clue

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
VCR game documentary, that's when my hype began because that, that was like my childhood

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
right there.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
That's, that's why I didn't see commercials cause I was watching that damn Clue VCR game

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
and that's in addition to the movie from 85, like over and over and over again on my beta.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
Um, anyway, so, uh, another big, uh, thing to mention here on OLR, we mentioned this

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
on Bobby's show before we started tonight, but I think it's appropriate to mention here

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
too.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
Uh, this affects the voice of geeks network, uh, in seven days.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
So next Sunday at six o'clock right in between Bobby's show and our show, we're going to

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
be doing a special, uh, quick little state of the station update where we are going to

38:34.000 --> 38:41.000
be announcing not one new show, not two new shows, three new shows joining the voice of

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
geeks network, uh, effective next week.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
And you'll get to hear a preview of at least one of them, if not more right after OLR next

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
week.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Um, so I'm very excited about that.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
We're going to be making that announcement, um, next week.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
So stay tuned.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
Uh, meanwhile, we're going to get into some gaming news.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I think it's that time.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Let's talk about what happened to video games this week, much more than football, right

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Loki?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Uh, yes.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
So there's a rumor.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
Well, I should say there's always a rumor about this, but hopefully a little bit more

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
to it, uh, that Nintendo is going to be finally localizing mother three.

39:15.000 --> 39:21.000
And this is coming from Emily Rogers, um, who is, I guess, a Nintendo focused writer

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
who's made different predictions in the past.

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
It basically has a source that has come forward, adding, um, some more evidence to this, basically

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
saying that, you know, the 10th anniversary of the game, um, on, since it's launching

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Game Boy Advance in Japan is coming up soon.

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
And they're saying that it's probably going to be released as like a virtual console game.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
So that'd be interesting.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Well, it took them long enough.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Jesus.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Um, it's about to, I hope, I hope this is true.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Um, it makes a lot of sense though.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Um, I can't, okay.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
Again, I can't imagine the virtual console thing really costs him a lot of money.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
Um, especially that they could just take the ROM from Europe and put it out here.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
I mean, yes, I know that there was different, actually, no, cause it was a handheld game.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I don't think the resolutions would have been any different.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
I know for some older games, you have different resolutions on that games.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
You literally, well, Game Boy Advance is a region free.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
I think you can just pop one in.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
So, there's no reason why this game shouldn't make a virtual console.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
I don't know if they did.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
They actually have a ROM though in Europe for that.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
It was released in Europe.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Yeah.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I don't think it was it.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
I'm, I'm almost positive.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
It was three.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
No, you're up.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Didn't get it.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
I know nobody's got happen.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Yeah.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
They had a, an English translated one already in Europe.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
I don't think people would give a shit because they would just be importing that.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
But this is, no, they don't have an English version of this aside from the one that has

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
been fan made.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
Well, but it's not, okay, so clearly I'm crazy, which is fine.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
But, um, the, it's not completely crazy that they would have like a prototype that they

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
could just like finish up with minimal resources because that's what happened to Earthbound

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Zero.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
And my assumption is they made a good chunk of change from Earthbound Zero, um, or Mother

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
One as the case may be that they were, uh, able to justify doing this.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Now it'll be interesting to see what they sell it as.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
Are they going to put it out as Earthbound Two and really confuse people?

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Are they just going to put it out as Earthbound Lucas's story or something?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Earthbound The Final.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Earthbound The Final.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I don't know.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
Call it Mother Three or Earthbound Mother Three or something like that.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Yeah, maybe Earthbound Mother.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
I don't know.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
We don't know what it really was called.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Now it's kind of like it's square eventually.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Yeah.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
With, you know, Final Fantasy.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Exactly.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
Square eventually kind of said, all right, we, everybody knows what's going on, but there

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
still is a part of me that will call Final Fantasy Four, I guess.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
I will still call it Final Fantasy Two, but when I am specific, specifically speaking

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
about the US version, which was kind of different, it was dumbed down, right?

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
I can't think of it that way because I've spent a lot of time playing the Japanese Two

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
and Three.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Yeah, I know.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
And I love Three with the job system in it and everything.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
I know.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
I usually mention what system, like if I'm saying Final Fantasy Two on the Game Boy Advance,

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
that's one game.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But if I say Final Fantasy Two on the Super Nintendo, that's another.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
He goes, I don't know.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
That's just how I tend to label things.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
I've never played any of the Earthbound games, so.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
They're good.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
I mean, as far as RPGs go, I mean, you might have a hard-

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Be the game with prayer.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
You might have a hard time going back now, like, and this happens a lot with retro games,

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
right?

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
You kind of go back and you're like, what did I really see in this as a kid?

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Well, one of two things can happen.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You can kind of have that approach.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Or sometimes you really, like when I go back and play an old Mario game, like especially

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
like Mario Two, I'm right back to being, you know, ten years old.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah, like I think like when you go back and play like Final Fantasy, like the Super Nintendo

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
games, they still hold up for me, but like going back and playing Final Fantasy Seven,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I was like, uh.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
It's a little rough.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
It's a little rough.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
This isn't quite as good as I remembered it.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
That shit was, uh, that was like cutting edge at the time.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Like, yeah, I was like super hyped about it because I love, like before that was, you

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
know, Final Fantasy Three.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I was like, dude, all this is so awesome.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
And then even still, I kind of remember how I felt playing it for the first time.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
It was just super, like, I love that whole just kind of, you know, futuristic tech and

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
kind of that fantasy world type setting.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
I really liked that about six and seven had that all over the place.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
And so I was really hyped up about that.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
All right.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Well, moving on to where, where this could possibly be announced.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
I mean, Earthbound Zero was an E3 thing last year, so why not Mother 3 for E3?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
If not sooner, maybe they'll do a direct.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
I mean, June is a long time to wait after all, and June will probably be dominated with

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
NX conversation.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
But anyhow, let's talk about Bethesda and what they are planning for E3.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
You might remember last year, Bethesda actually cut into our show and we, like for the first

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
time ever, we had to be like, all right, well, we know how it really goes.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
I mean, as far as gamers go, a press conference is bigger than the Super Bowl, right?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Some people even call E3 the Super Bowl for gamers, right?

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
So whereas I think there's plenty of you that will listen to this show as opposed to the

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Super Bowl, I don't know if there's people that are willing to miss press conferences

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
to listen to this show.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Although I know there's a few of you that would say I would.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
Depends if it's that PC gaming centric one from last year.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
Yes, I'm willing to miss that for the show because that was really lame last year.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Yeah, but who knows?

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
Maybe this will be the Skyrim HD year or I was hoping it would be the, you know, the

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Half-Life 3 here.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
But no, no, no, no.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Or it'll be a new Elder Scrolls one these days.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Gaben's going to be on the stage and everyone's going to lose their shit.

44:42.000 --> 44:49.000
It's going to be rolled down as life support Iron Lung, but it goes half life and die.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
But here's the thing.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Bethesda, it is confirmed it is happening again this year.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
And it is on Sunday and it's going to be seven o'clock the same time.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
The save the dates went out and they did have the characters from Skyrim, Doom, Dishonored

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
all showing up there.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
So I'm sure Dishonored 2 is a part of, you know, what they're going to be talking about.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Skyrim HD! Skyrim HD!

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
Maybe Fallout DLC, wherever that is at that point.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
We'll probably hear more about that.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
What's interesting though is that this year they're not going to be the first because

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
as you remember us talking about last week with the whole E3 has just decided to literally

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
do their own thing.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
They're not going to participate in E3.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
Instead they're going to be across the street and they're going to do their own conference.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Well, I mean, they always did their own conference, but now they have to fire the first shot because

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
their thing is opening a day earlier.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
So they're going to go Sunday at 4 Eastern.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
So they're not even going to be first.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Sorry, EA is going to be first.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Bethesda will not be.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
So when's Bethesda 7 PM?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I believe Pacific.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Alright.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
So there's a big gap between them, but still.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
You know, now E3 has spilled into Sunday because you're going to have those guys on Sunday.

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
Presumably you're going to have Microsoft and Sony again on Monday.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
And then you'll have Nintendo Tuesday morning, unless now that there's a gap with EA,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
somebody may fill in that gap.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I don't know if that will be Nintendo.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
It's going to be Konami.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
They're going to have so many things to not talk about.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Could be Square Enix.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
Remember Square Enix did their own thing last year, but it was kind of a, it was a direct like Nintendo.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
And I should say, even though I'm saying Nintendo conference, we all know they switched to the direct style.

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
Although, I mean, if a console is showing up, this might be the year to go back to the old school way.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
I don't think a direct is necessarily a given.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
We'll see.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
I think a direct would still be nicer just in general.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Nintendo's directs are always really straight to the point.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
And you can't have, you know, errors that happen on stage.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
Like when they were trying to target with Link and the Wii remote for Skyward Sword.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
They can cut all that out and just show what they want to show.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Yeah.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Not worry about that stuff.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
But you know, it does, it does lose a little something.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
I mean, I, you know, and I.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Well, it'd be on the show floor.

47:07.000 --> 47:13.000
So why do we need to show it in front of an audience in an auditorium when people can just go see it on the floor?

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
Why do people go to see artists live when you can listen to the CD?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
No, no, no.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
That's what I wondered to myself.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Because going to.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
I understand what you're saying, Shane.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
He's basically saying that, you know, why bother just demonstrating it live in front of an audience when.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
When that same audience would be on the floor.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Yeah, they're going to be seeing it live anyway.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Do it there.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
There's something about it.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Don't get me wrong.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
I'm not saying I'm like anti direct or anything.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm not.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
No, there is something about like losing out on that essence of Nintendo.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
Like when they're demonstrating Wii music and having a guy drum.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
But you guys are fixating on their shittier years.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
No, no, no.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
No, I remember the year they opened.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
That was the year I met Koji Kondo and that was great.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
Remember the year they opened with the Zelda Symphony and all that.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
I mean, like I was.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Reaction from the audience.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
I was.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Wasn't that the year I was actually at their press conference?

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
That was the Wii U demo on the screens and stuff.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
And then you could go play it on the show floor.

48:06.000 --> 48:13.000
I still think even being at a good Nintendo press conference that getting all the good

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
information out in a direct is better than having an auditorium full of people who in

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
like 10 minutes after that thing ends are just going to go play it anyway.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
So it makes no sense to me.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
All right.

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
Well, that's the 100 Matt with a good tinfoil hat theory in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
You have to think Square Enix is doing something unannounced with Nintendo.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
They seem to be buddy-buddy lately.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
Oh, remember those rumors from about a month ago that Nintendo is in bed with some particular

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
company for NX and through the process of elimination.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
It seems like Square Enix is a very likely candidate for Nintendo to be in bed with.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Although we don't know.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
It could be nothing.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
We'll see.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
It could be Sega.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Maybe Phantasy Star Online 2 will be on the NX.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Maybe that's what they've been waiting for this whole time.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Maybe not.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
All right.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Anyhow, we'll see what happens as the other pieces fall into place.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
I imagine we're going to hear more save the dates in the coming days.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
As far as this show, I don't know what we're going to do yet.

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
So don't ask because I'm saying save the date like it's going to be a wedding.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
I know.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Right.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
I don't know.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
I think it wasn't Shane.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
Last I checked, Shane was going to try to convince me to go to the EA thing to play

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Mass Effect.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Oh yeah, because I want to go play Mass Effect.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
I wouldn't go to that.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
See, two people will convince you.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Have fun.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
I can't take all that time off work.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
That's my problem.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
It's like two days because we don't have to go every day.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Do you just want to just drive down there and hang out at EA and come back?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
That is exactly what I would like to do.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Have a great date.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
With a stop at Disneyland and then come back.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Take pictures.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
As long as I still have time for Power Morphicon, yes.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Alright, priorities.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Priorities.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Well, those tickets are already gone.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
I have a priority.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Alright.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
What is your priority, Darcyra?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
My priority is...

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Disneyland?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah, actually.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Tea cups?

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
You know, I took a video just for you.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Shedding a single tear at the former site of Bucket of Meat?

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
I actually did cry a little bit into my stolen bucket.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Aw, had you been drinking, though?

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
No.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VoGnetwork.com,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
use the passphrase, sing.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Alright, moving on.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
Next story, Darcyra.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Okay.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
So, I know that you talked about the Fine Brothers last week.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah, we talked a little bit about this, but...

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
About the whole trademarking the React thing.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
And actually, Dan and I watched their response video about that.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
It was pretty...

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
I didn't see it.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
I only heard about it.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
But the response hadn't happened last week, because it wasn't just that.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
We talked about another trademark thing that was going on.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I don't know if it was the Sony Let's Play thing.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Yeah, it was.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Yeah, so...

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Which has already been determined that it couldn't be trademarked.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Yeah, it was that.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
It's, yeah, so it's like something in the common vernacular, so...

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
Well, anyway, so the Fine Brothers, they had a lot of backlash.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
They lost like a million subscribers.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Wow.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
And tons of dislikes on videos related to that whole thing.

51:12.000 --> 51:19.000
And so they finally, I guess, realizing that people do not like this course of action,

51:19.000 --> 51:26.000
no matter what they may think of it, decided to go back on it and say that they weren't

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
gonna do it.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
In fact, they released a statement saying...

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I'm just gonna read this.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
We realized we built a system that could easily be used for wrong.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
We are fixing that.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
The reality that trademarks like these could be used to theoretically give companies the

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
power to police and control online video is a valid concern.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
And though we can assert our intentions are pure, there's no way to prove them.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
So, yeah, they pulled it back.

51:57.000 --> 52:04.000
They are actually going to rescind the trademark filing, discontinue the licensing and tools

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
plan, which they were calling the React World program, and release all past content ID claims

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
on YouTube.

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
Can I say something about this that might be a little bit unexpected and maybe, I guess,

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
a little tinfoil haddish, but maybe like a moral of this story, perhaps?

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Because I kind of feel like...

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
And I could be wrong.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
And I realized I was critical of this whole thing last week, as we all were.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
But kind of hearing about this and thinking about how did we get from point A to B and

52:32.000 --> 52:39.000
all that, do I really think the Fine brothers themselves, those two guys that do this whole

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
thing, do I think that this was actually their idea?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I kind of don't think it was.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
And so I think the moral of the story is you need to watch the people that represent you.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
And I think this goes true for a lot of people that are looking at developing indie games

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
and trying to get that out there and hooking up with publishers and all this stuff.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
I think you really need to watch the people that represent you because I have this weird

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
feeling that the lawyers for the Fine brothers, I mean, they probably had to sign off on it.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
They probably like, uh-huh, yeah, good idea.

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
But I had this weird feeling that somebody planted the seed in their head that they just

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
kind of went along with.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
I'm not trying to absolve them of guilt or whatever, any of the fallout.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
I'm just trying to say I had this feeling this was not their idea, but they're the ones

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
on video now having to apologize for it.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Does that make sense?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I don't think it was.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
I think that it's something that they had to have had quite a bit of a hand in, even

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
if it wasn't their idea to begin with.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
It just seems like it's too common an occurrence trying to...

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Sure.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
...trademark things on.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Yeah, I'm not absolving them of all guilt, but I'm just saying, like, you know, maybe

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
if somebody different was directing them, this wouldn't have happened.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Does that make sense?

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
I mean, if they were trying to do trademarks for, like, elders react to as their statement

53:55.000 --> 54:00.000
or kids react to as their statement, you know, the actual phrase.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Right.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Narrow to YouTube usage or whatever.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
That can be branding right there.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
And then in that case, it would be protecting their brand.

54:08.000 --> 54:15.000
However, just the word react, it's like just the word crush, you know.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Or saga.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
Or saga or candy.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I think it would be very hard to trademark candy.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
I think Hershey's and Mars, I think Cadbury, they'd all have some problems with that.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
You mean all of this...

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Willy Wonka would fuck you up if you tried to trademark candy.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
Well, that's okay, because Nestle is evil anyway.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
I forgot.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
I didn't know those two companies were connected.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
No, it's Nestle, Mars.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
There's a few other companies that participate in using underage child labor.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
And you have to be careful who is representing you.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
Because, again, these are probably suppliers that they have no idea.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
They don't know how the sausage is made.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Nestle knows.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Oh, that's too bad.

54:57.000 --> 55:03.000
Yeah, the people who say that water isn't a right, it's a marketable thing.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
On the contrary, though, I think they're fully to blame.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I'm sorry.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
There's nothing that was all...

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
And here's why.

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
Just the way they've reacted to other people doing similar react-type videos, not even calling it that.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
And they're fucking like coming out saying, oh, everybody better gang up against these guys,

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
because they didn't even ask our permission to do this sort of thing.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Fuck them, seriously.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
This entire thing just...

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
They had content claims on them.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
Well, I'm talking about like Ellen and fucking Jimmy Kimmel do similar type of things.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
And he's having like...

55:32.000 --> 55:39.000
They go out on their social media pages and tell everybody to go let them know how dare they use it without our permission.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
But the two of them are sitting there filing all these content claims?

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
That's my whole thing.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
No, they're not filing those content claims.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
Their company that they work for or whatever is...

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
Or they have people that go out and file those type of claims.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
But it's their intent.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
They thought what they were doing was actually helping everybody.

55:59.000 --> 56:06.000
They thought that this was the greatest thing for these people to get a piece of this react market

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
and get a piece of their content, because damn, look at what they're doing to the internet.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
I mean, that's why they came out with a fucking video that said, in 100 years from now,

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
people are going to look at this and they're going to be like, whoa, what did people think about this?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
And they'll be able to find out because of these react videos.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
They literally thought that.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
They thought that they were such hot shit with this.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
So that's why they thought that, well, why is everybody reacting this way to this?

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
What the hell? We're doing you guys a favor.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
To be fair, they probably only show you extremes.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
Whereas the majority of people probably don't react in such an extreme manner.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
When you edit it down to a 10-minute video, it's any reality TV.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
You show the extremes.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
You show all the fights that happen on Survivor.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
You don't show the boring stuff about day-to-day surviving. Does that make sense?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Sometimes they do on Survivor.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Do they actually show somebody pooping in the woods?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Because I would think that would be kind of boring.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
More interesting if someone didn't survive on that show.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
There's lots of downtime they show on that show.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
You should watch Survivor again. You would know.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
I know. It's been a while. I'm waiting to be honest.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
I'm sorry. And here's the thing, too, about it, too.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
They went ahead and rescinded all these things.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
Not to say that the next time they go to attempt this,

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
they just won't tell anybody that they're doing it beforehand.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
All right. A couple more comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
SS 2100 Matt says, Blaming in on lawyers would certainly attempt to fix their image.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Still, though, trademark filing is a douchebag move all around.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
Dark Tetsuya brings up the whole Tim Langdell had a little trouble getting edge,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
although things may be different now.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
That was another one along that whole saga and all that stuff.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
Dungeon Buster says, It sounds like the Fine Brothers were given bad advice.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
If they didn't make such a huge announcement,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
they probably would have gotten the mark without anyone knowing

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
because they had already gotten a few.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
Then it would have been harder to challenge the mark if it were given.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
That's another interesting perspective on

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
maybe if the people who were represented them had been a little smoother,

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
they could have been absolutely evil.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
I also consider that trademark filing is public.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
So anyone can find that information.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
And SS 2100 Matt points out, fact of the matter is that trademark laws suck and need to be changed.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
That is probably also true.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
But the public part is important.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
All right, let's move on.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
We have plenty more to cover about games.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Loki.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
All right, so speaking of kind of douchebaggery,

58:25.000 --> 58:33.000
22Cans, they have decided to finally remove microtransactions from Godus Wars.

58:33.000 --> 58:40.000
And I guess this is launched as a single player version of Godus on Steam Early Access.

58:41.000 --> 58:49.000
And I guess because of that, you had to actually pay for microtransactions for different things.

58:49.000 --> 58:57.000
Like, for example, there's a $4.99 microtransaction to add a whole new continent with 40 missions to the game.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
And it's just, I don't know, people didn't like it.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
Well, I think it's mainly because the game was early access also.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
Because of that, though, they have decided to remove the microtransactions.

59:11.000 --> 59:17.000
And they're going to have the extra content that you would normally pay $4.99 for as free.

59:17.000 --> 59:26.000
So basically it said, in the meantime, it's been brought to our attention that the extra content being premium add-on isn't really a popular choice.

59:26.000 --> 59:34.000
While we think it does represent good value, especially considering that Godus Wars has been delivered as a free update to hundreds of thousands of users.

59:35.000 --> 59:42.000
And the lower price of the main game, we understand the previous Godus owner's frustration with this.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
Yeah, trying to nickel and dime your earliest adopters may not always be the best idea.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
DungeonBuster bringing up an interesting point.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I think you were talking about this a little bit before the show, Loki.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It's interesting to note that with Godus included in Godus Wars, they're retiring the store page for Godus and essentially wiping the negative reviews that were there.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And I really think it's pronounced Godus, but I always think of the showgirls.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Well, and you pronounce a lot of things wrong, so it's okay.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I do. So why not? I'll just stick with Godus.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But I think it's supposed to be God, us.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
You should ask PewDiePie what he thinks about Godus.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Shut up.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Anyway, I just like emphasizing the die in his name. Is there anything so wrong with that?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
You just can't read. I need to hold up a sign.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Cat. Cat. Cat. Cat.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Not enough spit is coming out of your mouth right now.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And I'm reenacting a scene from Strangers with Candy. If anybody thinks I'm being insensitive, it's actually that show that's insensitive.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Oh, it's so good.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It's so good. Alright, anyway.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
There's something that needs to come back.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I think Stephen Colbert might be a little busy now.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I don't care.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
He's gonna get cancelled soon enough.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
He's not gonna get cancelled. Don't say that.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Not doing well.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
If you put it as a sketch on your show, it's perfectly fine.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Mr. Jelly Nick and Jerry were on an episode of that not great show, Difficult People.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Oh, that Hulu one that I never finished.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Yeah, I don't like that show.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I watched like half of it.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Didn't you like it?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You were trying to tell me it was good.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Like the first episode was good and then the rest of it was not.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I tried. I really tried to like it, but I couldn't.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It's just not great.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I couldn't deal with, and this isn't video game, but let's be real. It's probably more interesting than Godus.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Godus.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Now I'm going to say it wrong on purpose.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
This made me think of goat.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It's spelled like POTUS, so it's go to.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I know this is a bad tangent.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
No, because if it had a T in it, it would be go to us.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
All right. I've been drinking and I'm trying to say something, so I'm going to get real belligerent here.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
You have something to say?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I got something to say.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Girl, say it.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Now I forgot what I was going to say.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You're dumb and drunk.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Hey, Shane. Hey, Shane.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Do you remember that party like back, back, back in the day when-

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
The dunk.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
The dunk thing.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Yeah.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
We were trying to say drunk and nothing but dunk would happen, so dunk means drunk.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Oh, I was going to tell you why I didn't like Difficult People.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Because although the plot lines would be kind of funny and-

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I don't get any of the jokes.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
What's Her Name That Played Precious was hilarious in that show.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah, she was really good in that.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And it was great to see her in there.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And I like the two actors that are in it. They're funny. What's his name? Billy-

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Billy Eichner.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
He's funny. But the thing is, they would just be talking and there would be this random obscure-

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000
It was like the Family Guy, but instead of a cutaway that's funny and animated, it would be this random obscure pop culture reference.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Yeah, I understood the Family Guy references more even if they didn't show me the clips.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
But Difficult People is like, what? I just don't understand anything.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Yeah.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Dark Tetsuya is saying, has Rob been hitting the wine again?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah, did you miss the- Dark Tetsuya, did you miss the beginning of the show? Were you tardy tonight?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Yes. Shane only shows up to the show now when he hears that wine is involved.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
So if you hear Shane's voice, there's probably a bottle of wine open somewhere.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And yes, we're having the same wine that we had last week because Shane is incapable of trying new things.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Yep. It's true.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Why do you think I have had Taco Bells for so many years?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, the creator of the GIF format- I'm not going to say it the other way.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
So again, you're saying it wrong.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Wants to know why you suddenly care about proper pronunciation.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Well, when you start saying giraffics, I'll start saying GIF.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
What's a giraffic?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Exactly.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
No, is that like giraffics?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Are you saying giraffics wrong?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
That's how they draw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It's just like when you pronounce, you don't pronounce it guy-ant, you pronounce it giant because it's GI.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
But English is a stupid language, period.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
But it stands for graphic interface.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Thank you! GIF. It's GIF. It's one letter short of a GIF.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
It's fucking grammar. Learn to speak your own language.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Moving on. Next story. God, this shows a hot mess. Oh, it's my turn. I got to do the next story.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Hot mess.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Let's talk about Nintendo.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Of course, I'm over here looking to see who the what lady is.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Why don't we just call them just GIFs then, because it's just a fucking acronym anyways.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It doesn't fucking matter how we pronounce it.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
No, because then like ABC will come and be like, you know, we had TGIF, so you can't have GIF.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
That's what they used to have.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Oh my god, they found the what lady.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Did she die?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
No, no, there's a picture of her right here.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's the what lady with her granddaughter.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Is that really the what lady?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
That's the what lady.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Can we force that in chat?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Sure.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I think this is a...

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It's the what lady.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It is her.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And if someone made a meme out of that picture that says what lady is not amused.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Is this from Reddit or something?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Yeah, Bee found her.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Of course they did.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
All right, can we move on?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Nintendo!

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
It's for breakfast!

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I remember the fruit snacks commercials, but that's only because of Power Fest.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I'm disabling everybody's mics.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Do you know what's funny is that I've got to like leave in 45 minutes.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
No, I don't.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
My Nintendo is going to be kicking off next month in 39 countries.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Let me name them all for you right now, starting off with the United States, Canada.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I don't know the rest.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's 39 countries.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
You can't read again apparently.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It's not listed.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I'm just guessing those are two of the countries.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Australia?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I can guess.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Anyway, Nintendo's first goal for the program is to get at least 100 million people registered.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
That's a lot of people.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Isn't that like a tenth of Facebook?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
How many people are on Facebook?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
A lot.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
My Nintendo is going to have a points program, coupons for downloads, emails.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I bet you can't wait for all those sweet emails you're going to get from my Nintendo.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I get a lot from the Japanese.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Can I send emails to other people?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Can I get Princess Peach to send Shane an email that says,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
you a bitch, sign Princess Peach.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I don't think that's going to work.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Because that I will pay points for.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I don't want your goddamn emails, Nintendo.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
All right, digital content and more.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Platinum points get original goods.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Gold points get coupons.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So there you go.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Whoo, coupons.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Hey, you know what?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Considering Nintendo games never go on sale, although there is an eShop sale,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
but it's like January, right?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But it's usually not the games you want.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah, and it's not the games you want either.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It's not much of a sale.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
1% discount.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
All right, so hey, I'll take it.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It's something.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So there is that coming.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I noticed, though, physical goods kind of went away in that whole thing.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Not sure what that's all about.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But anyway, I'll still sign up for it because, I mean,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
say what you will about Nintendo, but their games are so fucking good,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'm going to buy them anyway.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Mario Kart 9, sign me up.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Zelda Wii U, I'll get that.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Whatever Mario stars in.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Mario saves this world.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I'm down with that too.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So whatever.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
You're making a face, Shane.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Why are you making a face?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I have all these things to say, but not on this show.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Because it doesn't matter for the show.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
What kinds of things?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
There's like breaking Super Sentai news that's freaking me out right now that I love.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Well, nothing else has been on topic.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Is the ship real?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
You want to blurt it out?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Did Chylee finally get married?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
No, no, no.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That's Power Rangers.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
This is Super Sentai.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Oh.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So the new one that's coming out.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
That's the one Spike watches.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You watch Power Rangers.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
No, I watch Super Sentai too.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Oh, okay.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Only when it's a good season, I think.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I got it.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
But the one that's coming out with all the animals and Minecraft looking stuff,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
they just leaked the sixth ranger.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And for one thing, he's not named, you know, it's Red Ranger or stuff like that.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
In this one, it's called Jew-o-ger.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
So it's like Jew-o-shark is the blue one.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Did you say his name is Jew Shark?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Jew-o-ger.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Yes.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Okay.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I was going to say, that might be insensitive.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
But this one's called Jew-o-the-world.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I don't know why that's just the name of the guy, but he's so cool looking,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
and I want all his toys now.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Like all of his toys.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Jew-o-the-world?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
That's Dark Sakura.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
She just wanted it to be so hard.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Well, maybe if you hold your microphone up to your eyes,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
they can hear your eye roll right now because it's pretty much like the loudest thing in this room.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
He has three different colors.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
He has three different animals.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
He has three different helmets.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I am excited.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And three new shows coming to VOG next week.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Does he wear all the three helmets at the same time?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Yes, he actually does.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
He just slides different pieces.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Is it like the manticore ranger?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
No, it's alligator rhino wolf.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Man bear pig?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
They really are under the mask.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It's another mask.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It just keeps sliding up like that.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Back to video games.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited right now.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I'll give you this.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
At least the Super Sentai has the Minecraft-y tie-in.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I just, because of how excited I am,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I just went to this import site and put the megazords that they have coming out in my cart to get later.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
How much money in the past 12 months have you spent on Power Rangers toys?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I don't know.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
70,000.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
You don't even make that much money.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Come on.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I don't know.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Oh, it's just Power Ranger toys.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Oh, it's so hot in here.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Dark Sakura, you want to get to another story?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I guess.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Well, we have a reunion of sorts with Kojima and Del Toro.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Yay!

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But they're not doing a game, boo.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
They're keynote speakers at the Dice Summit.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:03.000
This is confirmed by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences that they're going to be there this year.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And that Kojima will be inducted into the Academy's Hall of Fame.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.000
So they are both there to offer their insight into creative vision and artistic pursuits.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Can they stealth announce something at Dice? Is it possible? Have they done that before?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Can we really just hope something gets announced like TP or something?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
TP? It's the toilet paper ghost.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
She died in the toilet. No immortal's revenge.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Well, that thing in the sink looks like it may have came from the toilet, so...

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
TP. It'll scare you shitless.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
There you go. Tagline right there.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It did come from someone's neither regions.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
What if you had a spinoff of that game where you're just taking care of the poor sink baby or something?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Like a Tamagotchi thing.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Meanwhile, it talks to you in a radio announcer voice the entire time.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
A Canadian radio announcer voice?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Are we disturbed or what?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
We just missed PT.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
We're going to go to the US first. Sorry, we won't be going to Canada, but we'll go to the US first.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
We actually do have a few things coming out this week.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Naruto is shipping in Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 coming out on PlayStation 4 and I believe Xbox One.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And we also have Unravel coming out, also PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And let's see what else here.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Arslan, The Warrior's Legend. That's on PlayStation 4 as well.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Assassin's Creed Chronicles. That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Also, it looks like Arslan, The Warrior's Legend, also on Xbox One.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And The Dying Light, the following, coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One as well.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And...

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That's it.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Alright, going over to Japan.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And on the PlayStation 4 on the 12th of February, Senjou no Valkyria remaster.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Is that Valkyria Chronicles? I think it is.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I didn't even realize they were remastering that for the PlayStation 4. I think that's what that is.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And that's really exciting. Yeah, that's it. This is...

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Do you not hear gaming news ever? Because that's been announced for a while.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Well, you know, I have the PC one, so...

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Anyway, going to the Wii U and this week.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Nothing. It is still another slow week on the Wii U. You get a lot of those, actually.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:41.000
On the Vita, however, you have this week Eikoku Tantei Mysteria The Crown in regular and limited edition.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
That comes out on the 11th.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And on the 3DS, Eterion... Oops, sorry, that's not this continent.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Shin Megami Tensei IV The Final comes out in a regular and Famitsu pack this week.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
So there's that to look forward to.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
But that's really it in Japan this week.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
In our chat, Bob Coffee says, yes, it's Valkyria and we are getting it in America also.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Yes, Shane, in his usual manner, decided to correct me at as soon as possible opportunity.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Yeah, well, no, I'm just saying, you would have known that there's a PS4 version had you been following the news.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I didn't say it wasn't coming here. I was just saying, learn to read.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Whatever. Dark Sakura, how about Europe?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Yeah, some stuff's coming out.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000
On the 9th, we have Arslan the Warriors of Legend for PC.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia for PC, Xbox One and PS4.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime for PlayStation 4.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
The series that will never die.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000
On the 10th, we have Gravity Rush Remastered and on the 12th, Eterion Odyssey 2.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And that's it.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And then the classic game of the week, but first, Loki.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Alright, so there's been some reports coming out that people are able to play certain games on the Xbox One backwards compatibility that quite haven't been announced yet.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And some pretty big titles among that as well.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Red Dead Redemption, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Halo Wars and Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
To download those games right now, it's a little bit difficult.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
You actually have to have a digital version of the game.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And it won't work with a physical disc for it.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And then basically, you'd have to download it if you have a digital version of the game.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And you have to specifically go to download that.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But nothing's been announced so far.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Maybe we'll get an announcement soon, but Red Dead Redemption is pretty awesome.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Go play it.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Awesome game.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Alright, and lastly, let's talk a little more about Pokemon Go.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Because I don't know about you guys, I'm really excited about that, to try that.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And how did Pokemon Go come to be anyway?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Well, you guys remember a few years ago, there was the April Fool's Day joke where you could actually see the Pokemon on Google Maps.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Guess what?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
That was part of the reason why we're getting Pokemon Go.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:24.000
This was an interview that happened in Famitsu Magazine in Japan with the president of Niantic Japan and Kento Suga, who's the marketing manager of Niantic Japan.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
So in this interview, they actually set us apart of it.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
That Pokemon challenge was a chance for us to be able to build relations with people at Pokemon.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:40.000
And then, Pokemon president Suenaku Ishihara and John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, were able to meet and talk.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
At that time, both of their thoughts and visions were also very close.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And as a union of their spirit, the talk became, let's do something together in the future.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And then they talked about, in Google, there's a culture where the staff releases ideas for April Fools, then they make their own teams to realize those.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But for the Pokemon challenge, it was a staff member named Tatsuo Nojima who pulled out that idea, and he became the center of development.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:10.000
So, you never know, if a Google April Fools joke is loved well enough, it just might come true someday.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
As Pokemon Go is apparently coming true.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Even though that will be on your smartphones and not Google Maps, but hey, still pretty cool.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Well, let's go to the classic game of the week and take a step into the vault.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And find a game where DarkSakura says, hey, you know what, get off your April Fools Day jokes on the interwebs.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Because this is a game that existed before any of that stuff became games. This is a simpler time.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
DarkSakura is going to step in the vault and find a game she thinks you guys should be playing this week.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I have no idea why I've never done this one before.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Me neither, to be honest.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Lunar the Silver Star. It was a role play game that came out by Game Arts and Studio Alex.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It was released on the Sega CD, or as it was in other countries, the Mega CD.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And the first publishing was by Game Arts in Japan in 1992.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And then it was translated and localized for the US by Working Designs.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And it had that crazy ass rock opening song.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000
The re-release didn't have this, but the soundtrack that came with it had this on it.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:37.000
So it is one of the greatest RPGs of all time with little argument.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And I'm saying one up.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I disagree.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
One up.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And of course it's also one of the games that really cemented things for Working Designs.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.000
As far as being known for its high quality localization of top rate games.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000
So it had a sequel. It was Lunar Eternal Blue that came out in 1994.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And there have been three enhanced remakes.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000
There's Lunar Silver Star Story Complete, Lunar Legend, and Lunar Silver Star Harmony.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
So all of those versions have been out.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
So basically, it's a traditional top down role playing game.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
You have the 2D characters and environments.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You have the towns, fields, different places.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And you have NPCs and you do quests and do things.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
However, because it was on the Sega CD, you actually had short videos.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
You actually had different really good audio segments.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Really great music on top of it too.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And you saved your game to the Sega CD's internal RAM.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Or you could use the RAM cartridge that came with it that you could choose.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
So that's pretty good.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It was definitely one of those games that made having the RAM cartridge worthwhile.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Because those lithium batteries, they kind of went after a bit.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:06.000
So anyway, you also have turn based combat based on which has the higher speed rating.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And then you give them commands.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I mean it's RPG stuff.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But the thing that's about this that was pretty cool is that the characters were designed by a manga artist, Toshiki Kabuka.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And it was really, I think, the stuff that, in fact I'm pulling up the list of some of the other things he's done.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Because looking at the art style, you can probably tell he did, as far as anime, he did Nadia, The Secret of Blue Water, Giant Robo, Time Jam, Berserk, The Golden Age Arc.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
For other games he did, he did The Idolmaster.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Of course, Albert Odyssey.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
So that's all stuff that sounds familiar, right?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
So, um, but moving on, you know you had all of your characters, they're all classic.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
But this was the other thing that was really neat about this.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Is that the plot, well most of the plot, was written by a novelist named Kei Shigema.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Who did, um, it was meant to have a different story for high fantasy.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Something a little bit more unique.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And it was such a really rich story, you know, you can really see a lot of the amazing writing that went into it.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And the whole point was that they wanted a role playing game that would focus on having good animation and really good storytelling.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:51.000
So, um, they didn't want it to be just a hack and slash, they wanted it to have something immersive.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
But also, um, really just be something that would keep the characters going on this.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And of course, the Lunar English version was done by Working Designs.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Um, and it was at the time their biggest project.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.000
The whole thing was headed by Victor Ireland, which for the record, we own his Twilight Zone.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Um, we actually bought one of our pinball tables for him.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Um, but yeah, it was just pretty epic. Pretty, pretty epic.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.000
The English script was one of the biggest ones that, you know, had been provided for games at the time.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Um, the music was pretty amazing. Of course, it was CDDA on the desk.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And, um, there was a soundtrack that was released in 1992 that came out two months before the game did.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Which was, of course, all the Japanese versions and karaoke arrangements.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Um, and then with the Lunar Silver Star story complete, it came with that soundtrack.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000
So, um, it's pretty, pretty amazing.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Yeah, the game itself in Japan sold 100,000 copies in its entire production run.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Which was, uh, pretty, pretty good.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And then the US version, it sold about as well and got pretty excellent ratings across the board.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000
So, um, of course, it spawned a sequel which gave us Lunar Eternal Blue.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And then there were follow-ups. Like, there was Lunar Walking School and Lunar Dragon Song that were prequels to the game.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:42.000
So, of course, we also had the remakes Lunar Silver Star story complete, uh, Lunar Legend and Lunar Silver Star Harmony.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
So, there you go.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
There it is. I'm listening to a little harmony right now.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Lunar the Silver Star.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
There it is. Your classic game of the week, Lunar the Silver Star.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Which, I admit, I just never played it. Never got around to playing it.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Sorry. I can't play all the games.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I might loan you a Sega CD. We've got a couple.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Yay, that'll be fine. Do you have six of those, too?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
No. No, I do not. So, you'll have to just, I guess, live in the vault for a weekend.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I'm moving in. I'm moving in.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Alright, uh, we're gonna move on to the second half of our show.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
My understanding is that the little game that's on TV is now over.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
So, we might have some more people start showing up live, which is great.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Apparently, some donkeys won.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Apparently, a bunch of asses won.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
But, anyway, you can-

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Although, I will say, just because I think it's his retiring year, is Peyton Manning.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It was, like, his last game.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Who?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Big sportsball guy.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Oh, okay.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I know of him just because I know people who have followed-

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
You heard stories.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
His career.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
There's folklore.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I'd say winning a Super Bowl right before you retire is pretty remarkable.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Oh, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that, but mine will be in Tecmo Bowl.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Yeah.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Alright.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Uh, you can give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, the old-fashioned way.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Uh, we're gonna take some calls when we come back, but we also have more news to get to.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Rapid Fire News, Fugu Question of the Week, your emails.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
There is plenty more show to come, so don't go anywhere.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
We'll be right back, right after this, with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And yes, maybe some more wine, too. Oh, God.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode 630 of our show, already in progress.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And, uh, having a good time here tonight with our pal, Shane Alinko, joining us in studio.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And, uh, of course, the, uh, regular cast all assembled tonight.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
We're all here, and plus one, we're having a good time.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And, uh, I may have been having a little bit to drink with Shane Alinko.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
For some reason, it's hitting me harder.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
But probably because I see that Shane still has a full second glass.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I've already drank two glasses.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Well, I had an emergency, so I couldn't drink so much of it right now.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Okay.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
My emergency has to do with pre-ordering toys.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Very important. Sorry, I forgot. I forgot.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Toys takes precedence on that whole thing.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Alright, uh, let's get into some rapid-fire news.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And then now we'll get to the FUGL Question of the Week over on Facebook and Google.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Uh, Loki.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So this is sort of back in August, where you can vote on which game you want to be included in the PlayStation Plus lineup as one of the free games.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And now they're doing it again.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So you can vote for three different games to be free among PlayStation Plus for March.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Um, the ones that don't get picked get put on sale.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
So that's pretty nice.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And actually, the choices aren't too bad either.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So we've got to choose from, um, Action Henk, which is a racing game.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And then we have Assault Android Cactus, which is a twin-six shooter.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And of course, Broforce, which is just like an all-out side-scroller shooter that's pretty awesome.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So, um, I know at least two of the three of those I want to get.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Um, I will say that, uh, Extifer is a big fan of the Assault Android Cactus.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
He'll probably cut somebody that he knows if they don't vote for that one.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Exactly.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So I have to vote for that one.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000
In full disclosure, I think I have a guy on Twitter who either worked on that game or has a relative who made it or something.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So, um, but I have checked out.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I played that game at last E3. They had it.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
So it's been a while.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
It's another Unity game.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Yeah, so, um, I hope that one wins, personally.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I would vote for either Broforce or Assault Android Cactus.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I kind of think Broforce has it.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Broforce is pretty awesome.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
But either one. Whatever one doesn't win, I'll end up buying the other one.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So that's both winning in my book, I guess.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Speaking of winning, one game that I was super hyped about and for some damn reason still haven't played in a very long time.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I do need to fix that maybe this week.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 has sold 60 million copies.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
That's ridiculous, the amount of copies that they've sold.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Um, apparently that's down a little bit, though.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
It's exceeded expectations, but the revenue has dropped a little bit.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
22% in the last quarter.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So, basically, 414.2 million.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And then, of course, they're confirming that Mafia 3 is going to be coming out in 2016.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And, of course, that Battleborn will be launching May 3rd.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000
So, that's all coming from Take-Two's report earnings meeting that they've got.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Um, I would love some DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
That would definitely get me back into playing that game.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Please.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And then, finally, Titanfall 2 is going to have a single player campaign, which probably means I'm going to have to buy it.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Because that's one of the reasons I didn't buy the first one.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But that game was pretty awesome, even though it did melt my last laptop.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
But that's just how awesome it is, because it melted my laptop.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And then, on top of that, they're also going to be getting some sort of TV spinoff to that as well.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
So, that looks pretty exciting.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000
If it's anything like the little live action trailer commercial thing that they did, I'd be down to watch that.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And, um, yeah.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
So, no set date yet when we can expect it.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Hopefully in some time...

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Oh, no, it looks like March 2017.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Sometime before that.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So, before the end of the next fiscal year.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Hopefully holiday.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
But maybe not.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I'm sure that'll be a holiday release for sure.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And it's tough, because, you know, they're going to have Battlefield, probably.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
So, Titanfall, it's kind of weird.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
It's... not sure where that would fall in.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Unless they want to directly compete with Call of Duty.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
One will be September, and the other November.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I think they could do it, since Call of Duty had to totally crib a bunch of stuff from Titanfall anyways.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Alright, let's talk a little bit about Guitar Hero.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And one of the most epic songs that was ever in Guitar Hero is coming back for Guitar Hero Live.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And that is Dragon Forces Through the Fire and the Flames.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I think all of us music game people remember playing that song for the first time in Guitar Hero.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
No, because I didn't play Guitar Hero.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Really? That song was awesome, though.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
It is an awesome song, but yes, I'm with you on that. I never played that song.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Ugh, you guys.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Alright, well anyway, it is coming back to Guitar Hero.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And it's going to be part of a five-track celebration event for the Guitar Hero TV.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Because, you know, it's different than Rock Band.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
You don't just download songs, you have this whole kind of, like, live TV element.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
So, Through the Fire and the Flames from Dragon Force is going to be part of this.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But then, after this event is over, where some other hard songs will be featured as well.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
They're going to put it into the normal rotation on Guitar Hero TV.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
But it should be noted that, you know, now the Guitar Heroes are different guitars.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000
So, they have to basically go back and redo all the key patterns.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Because now you have the whole, like, three up and three down.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
It's a little different now than it used to be.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So, I don't own Guitar Hero yet, but I did think it was pretty cool, the little snippet I've played.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
So, I really need to get on buying that.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I would like to get it, too, just to support the developers, because it's a DJ Hero developers.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
So, I love them. They're so good.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I feel like the public shits on them constantly, too.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Because DJ Hero deserved to do way better than it did.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
DJ Hero is goddamn amazing.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Yeah. I'll support that.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Like, immediately it will pre-order DJ Hero 2. Or 3, the amount.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
The next DJ Hero game.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
If they ever do another one.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Whenever, you know, that happens. If ever.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
You know, I'd be totally down for that.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Well, a new trailer was released for Mirror's Edge Catalyst this week.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It's a little story trailer for the game.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But it also, in addition to EA saying they will talk a little more about Faith's story and the world and so forth.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
They are saying that a closed beta is going to be coming.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And it will be available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and of course, via Origin on PC.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.000
The dates are not announced yet, but they do say you will need an EA Origin account in order to participate.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And I imagine this is true on console as well, because...

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Yeah, you have to sign in on games like we did for Mass Effect.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And Dragon Age.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Dragon Age, yeah.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Inquisition, anyway.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And again, Origin, not bad anymore. It's a good service.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Mirror's Edge Catalyst, by the way, this is not something you're waiting for the holidays for.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
It is supposed to come out on May 24th.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
So, this is a little...

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
The day after my birthday.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
So, if you thought, well, what a great...

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
No, I don't care about Mirror's Edge. I want Power Rangers stuff.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So, don't pay attention to Mirror's Edge at that time.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
All right, well, what about Dark Souls 3? Do you care about that?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Nope.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
All right, then plug your ears.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Because our next little snippet here is about Dark Souls 3.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
And apparently there was a livestream that From Software did recently about this.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
But for some reason, the stream was private.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
So, people didn't even really know it was going.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
So, I don't know if that was intentional, like maybe it was like a media only.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
But it didn't seem to have that type of vibe to it.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Well, of course, you put something on the internet, it's never gonna go away.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So, there was a YouTuber out there who was able to make an archive

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
of several minutes of the gameplay from Dark Souls 3.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And I gotta say, it looks really good.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Although, I really tried with Bloodborne, you guys.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I tried and it's just...

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
It's too much. I can't.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So, we'll see. I don't know.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Maybe Dark Souls 3 will do something different to the formula, like make it a little easier.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Something I feel like I actually progress in.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
I don't know. I guess I'm that wimp.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
That ruined all video games.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Because they're too hard.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Well, for fans of Pokemon, you can get the original Pokemon Red and Blue music on vinyl.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.000
There's a record album that is being published with 500 copies.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And it looks like everyone signed up, but you can register to let them know you're interested to see if they'll print more.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
But it's about 50 bucks.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I don't really understand the whole...

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
As a collectible thing, I think that's cool.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But I don't understand releasing records with things anymore.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
That's cool. I like Pokemon.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It's got a nice cover.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Yeah, that's awesome. But are you gonna listen to it?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
That's not probably what it's for.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I guess. But with Super Beat Zonic, the collector's edition came with two records.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I'm like, cool. Won't be able to do anything with those now.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
But thank you for the records.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Well, you can get digital albums.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Sorry, digital record players.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Oh, I think I've seen those at Fry's.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Yeah.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I just even have those at Hot Topic sometimes.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Really?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
No, seriously. I've seen USB record players there.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
That's hilarious.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Interesting.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Well, my eyes were just open to something I had no idea about.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I'm assuming that's all for mixing, though.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I think the USB ones were mainly for ripping vinyl to digital formats, I guess.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That makes sense. Fair enough.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Also, there is going to be a new arcade game coming out that will be between Nintendo and Capcom.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:30.000
That will be Mario Party Arcade so you can have your hissy fit in front of everybody.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
You can actually punch a kid in the face at the arcade.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
I don't know if that would work well as an arcade game.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
You'd have to kind of go around to punch them, though.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
It looks awesome. Just the setup looks really nice.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I would rather play Animal Crossing, Amiibo Festival, than Mario Party any day.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Oh, those are strong words.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Those are very strong words.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I think if you want a good arcade game experience, Smash Bros. arcade would be perfect and throw more Capcom characters in there.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Nintendo needs to sell more Wii's.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Wii U's. They don't need to sell Wii U's.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Wii U's.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And then last, and definitely the least awesome news ever, is that Warner Bros. actually cancelled the Mac and Linux ports of Batman Arkham Knight.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Is that awful news, though? Because look what happened to the PC one.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
It wasn't crap.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I mean, maybe they're just sparing the rest of us from, you know...

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I think it was a mercy killing.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I guess so. I mean, dear people on Unix-based systems, we will not subject you to this terror.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
You mean we have to actually go through the even worse terror of playing it in boot camp?

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Well, there's VMware. Ugh! And that's what every Mac user and Linux user said ever.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Well, thank you for that perspective.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Unfortunately, they just figured how many people game on Mac and Linux, and they're just like, eh, it's not worth it.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Which is actually a pretty big number of people.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Not worth it? You mean by putting it out, then pulling it, and then re-releasing it again?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Yes, in that sense, because they're gonna half-ass put it out, and it's still gonna be all fucked up, and they're like, eh, fuck it.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:16.000
You guys are funny. Alright, let's move on and get to the FUGL question of the week.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the show.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Or we'll read them all, as I think I'm gonna... I'm feeling nice, I'm gonna do that tonight.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000
And this week, we decided to ask in honor of Superb Owl Sunday, we're gonna talk a little bit about...

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Well, because most people right now, they're not talking about the game anymore.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000
They're talking about that halftime show, for better or for worse, with Coldplay, Beyonce, Bruno Mars, right?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:52.000
So that had us thinking about breaks, because every year when the Superb Owl comes up, we ask a sports game thing.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
That sounds like you're saying Super Bowl.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Super Bowl, I kinda like that though, the Super Bowl.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000
But you know, that's what people say to get around the trademark on Super Bowl, and that the NFL will come after you.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I had no idea.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Yeah, you can't, like if you're a pizza place, you can't have like a Super Bowl discount thing.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
That's why everybody does the big game, or...

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Oh.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Yeah. Anyway.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Let's talk about breaks.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So we wanted to know, do you regularly take breaks when gaming, or have you ever binged to the point where you ever thought, maybe this is dangerous.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
So taking a break from the game, as they do in sports, we need to do it with video games as well.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:36.000
You know, it is recommended, what, for every two hours of games, you take a fifteen minute break, something like that?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So, let's get to some answers over on Facebook.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Jose Osumuwagawa says, I usually have to, because I'm a smoker, and there's no smoking in the apartment I live in.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Well, that's, I guess, a way to force yourself to take a break, I guess.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Fabrice A says, I once played Sega Rally for twenty-four hours straight.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Other than that, I do take regular breaks, if only to rest my eyes.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Whenever I feel I'm going in the red, I just stop altogether.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.000
William Murderface says, I've played for eight to twelve hours straight a few times, like Final Fantasy 14 around Reborn.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
But my eyes usually start bugging me after a few hours, and I have to get up and take a walk.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Generally speaking, I try to get up once an hour and take at least a five minute break.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Retertainment says, I rarely do anything straight, though.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.000
At the very least, I like to get myself another bottle of Heineken about every hour or so while I'm playing Fallout.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Degenerate Johnny says, my gaming sessions end when either I empty the bottle of wine I started with, or when I pass out, whichever comes first.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Winston H says, usually I don't do too many binges of gaming, but when I do, I would take a break to either go to the washroom,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
eat, or drink something in two to three hours.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Andy R says, I don't actively seek to take breaks, but usually the bathroom snack breaks do serve some of that role.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I don't think I've ever made it to the dangerous point.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Dark Tetsuya says, depends on the game, of course.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Obviously, I've got to mention the DDR games.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Now, taking breaks is pretty much mandatory, as with any workout, you don't want to over-exert yourself, or you'll be in serious trouble.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Though, usually my breaks come when I've hit a wall in a particular RPG or something, and I don't know what to do or how to beat a particular enemy.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
It's nice to walk away and come back refreshed.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Fifth Dream says, I don't specifically take time out for breaks when I game,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.000
but I am such an unintentional multitasker that the amount of time I get up for a drink or something to eat, check email or instant messages,

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000
or generally get distracted by something else, probably adds up to way more than 15 minutes per hour anyway.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000
But the day I got Skies of Arcadia on Dreamcast, I played it 15 hours straight,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
and I probably ate once and took a couple of bathroom breaks.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
That was a great day.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Chad B says, I have some problems with one of my legs, so I generally can't sit comfortably for a long period of time anyway,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
but instead of a 15 minute break every few hours, it's more like a few minutes of getting up two to three times per hour.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
As a kid, however, I never had an issue playing games for hours on end.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And just, I think, one or two more on Google+, just one on Google+.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Act Def says, the longest I played a game was Super Smash Brothers Melee.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
My brother, my nephews, and some friends played for like 12 hours straight.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
We unlocked all the characters and stuff.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
After that, the GameCube got busted and had to be replaced.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Good thing it still had warranty. Not too tiring though.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
My second longest was playing the endless set list on Rock Band 2 on Expert.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Now that was tiring as hell.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Those are some good answers. What about you guys?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Do you take breaks when you game?

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And has there maybe been a point in the past where maybe you did a little too much binging on a game?

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Dark Sakura?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I take a break when I gotta pee.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And your watch pokes you and tells you to get up, doesn't it?

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Yeah, now it does. I mean, if it hits like the 50 minute mark and I haven't stood up,

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
then I get that little tap on the wrist. It's time to stand up.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Shut up, watch. Don't tell me how to live my life.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Actually, I do say that at my desk and Shane can attest to that, I'm sure.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Don't tell me what to do.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I play, you know, I pass out asleep.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I remember though when Final Fantasy III on Super Nintendo, Rob, came out.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I had the quote flew, quote, for a week until I beat it.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000
So I didn't go to school. I just stayed home and played Final Fantasy the entire time.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I've heard you tell that story before, the binge on Final Fantasy that you had.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I had to re-rent it at the time. I didn't own the copy.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Nice.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:40.000
I was gonna say I completed Grand Theft Auto 4 100% to try to get the keys of the city

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
when I first came out and then required me staying up very late at night for a few days.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
My friend and I, when I was younger, we stayed up all night beating.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
We did it once with Super Mario 3 without warping and we did it again with Star Tropics.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
We played Star Tropics like almost all in one sitting.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
But as far as, again, I can't do those types of binge sessions.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Maybe I'm just old or whatever and I gotta pee a lot or I gotta eat.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I think the fact that I really like food makes me stop and get up and be like,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
ooh, I'm gonna raid the fridge. I want a cookie.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So that helps with those breaks.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Shane?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I'm sure I did it for various MMOs but the one game I remember not getting up until I beat it

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
was Portal 2 when that came out.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Oh yeah.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Got that on PS3 and at the time I would play in the living room and I'd just lay down on the floor

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.000
and look up at the TV and I just kept playing until it was done because it was so good.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And at least that's something you can kind of feasibly, it's like what, a five hour game?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
That's like watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I did the same with, oh god, Bioshock Infinite too.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Oh wow.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
And Heavy Rain. I did not stop playing Heavy Rain until I finished it.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Alright, there you go.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Some of our answers there over at our Facebook and our Google Plus pages.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And let's see, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf with a great answer here.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Civilization always makes me play for a binge which is why I never play it often

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
because I never have binge time anymore.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Oh god, that's so true.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I remember playing online matches in Civ Net which was the online Civ one

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
that would go like all fucking night.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And I think we did this with Civ 4 once too.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Like the Civilization is some serious like, yeah, there's just one more turn.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
There would be the hours of me playing Dr. Mario.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
No, seriously.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I could play Dr. Mario from level one to whatever level.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Those puzzle games were especially something, especially when they were first coming out

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
because Dr. Mario was kind of like in a way was the follow up to Tetris and that whole craze.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Except Dr. Mario to me was much easier than Tetris.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Yeah.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Because I mean I don't know what it was but my, I guess my reaction time was a lot faster on Dr. Mario than it was with Tetris.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Sure, but you've heard those stories of people that would play Tetris that usually don't play games.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Like back in that day, right?

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Like, oh my gosh, the mom who doesn't play games, I'm being extremely stereotypical of what we saw on the news back then,

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
is binge playing Tetris and can't put the Game Boy Advance down.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Do you know the first place I ever learned about Pokemon, by the way, on a tangent,

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:36.000
was from a bunch of like mother types at work who got this game for their kids and they couldn't stop playing it.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I just thought, just kind of like a funny aside, that like one of them would talk about Pokemon like non-stop

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
and she was playing it on her breaks. She had her Game Boy at work and I kind of thought it was cool.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And that, you know, it wasn't really until the anime when I got into it but it was interesting.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I would only play Pokemon at the gym.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Alright. Anyhow, let's see, let's get on to some more gaming news. Loki!

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
So this is kind of disappointing because I actually follow this guy on YouTube a bit.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:12.000
So Eric, I'm going to try to not butcher his last name, Tarasinski.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:19.000
He goes by Etitski, I guess, on YouTube.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
He did like a bunch of Unity tutorials and that type of thing.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
One of the things he was working on was actually a game called Ant Simulator.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.000
And I believe it had been Kickstarted and he's been working on it for a while now.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Apparently he just put up a YouTube video saying that the game has been cancelled.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:46.000
And this is because, as he puts it, that his two business partners that he was with have spent the money that was from the backers

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.000
to fund the game and they spent it on bar tabs and hookers.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Hookers? Oh for real?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Or not hookers, but strippers and food and that type of stuff.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And so because of this, he's trying to find a way to refund everybody and basically just trying to salvage everything.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It wasn't too much that he had raised, it was $4,459 from 149 backers.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.000
And apparently of that, it's been spent now.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Although, his two business partners also came out to defend themselves and basically saying that,

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:41.000
no, we didn't spend this on unnecessary things, that this was all approved business transactions,

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:48.000
and that actually the developer was separating from the company and actually took control of the funds

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
and has moved those all into a personal account type of thing.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
So a lot of drama, but it kind of sucks to see this guy's hard work.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Basically he's not allowed to release the game now without these guys and he doesn't have the money to release it

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
because they've used it all. And if he tries to release it without them, they will sue him.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
So yeah, that kind of sucks.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
What a mess.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000
But whenever I think of Ant Simulator, I think of SimAnt. That game was so awesome.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Yeah, and the game does look pretty awesome.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I mean, I've seen videos on his channel for a while now regarding that,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
and I didn't realize he'd actually had a Kickstarter for it.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I thought it was just kind of like a little project he was working on.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.000
But it looked pretty cool, and fortunately now there's not really much he can do with it.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:45.000
All right. Well, moving on to, I guess, a bit of an OLR dream game-esque sort of thing,

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
perhaps being realized a little bit. I don't know.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000
But you know we've talked about, and it's been a little bit of a long-running joke here on OLR,

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
that they really should make a video game out of Battle Royale.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
That's not what's happening. I'm not trying to get your hopes up,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
and it's not that they're making one out of Hunger Games either,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
but the whole concept of the fact that 16 people enter one survives.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Now, to be fair, I believe H1Z1, there's a mode like this in that game,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
but there's not really been a game where, at least that I can think of,

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000
where that's really kind of been the focus is that sort of storytelling

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000
that you see in a survivor-esque type of narrative.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Anyhow, there is a new game, though, that has come out on Steam Early Access,

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
or I'm sorry, will be on Steam Early Access early next month called The Culling,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
and you're going to be participating as one of 16 contestants,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000
and you have 20 minutes to explore the surrounding, craft weapons,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000
and kill the other players. You can scavenge various items, build traps,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
and that will allow you to kill the other contestants

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.000
and win the right to live before the next round of play begins.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000
The Culling is going to be a standalone experience with 16-player Battle Royale modes.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
March 8th is when the game comes out on Steam Early Access.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Oh, I'm sure there's other games like this that kind of already exist,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
but I don't know. When I heard about this, I was like,

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.000
oh, remember when we had the Battle Royale live on OLR

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
and somebody got cut with a paper plate or something? I don't remember.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I was the victor of that one. That was great.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Russ sort of reminds me of DayZ.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
It's more of where you just get plopped down into the middle of everything

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
and you have to survive against other players.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:28.000
This almost sounds like the Hunger Game mods that they do for Minecraft and stuff

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
where you basically have a certain set time limit and you have to survive and that type of thing.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
But hey, whatever. That's cool. All those concepts are fun.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Dart Tetsuya says, in the description, they do specifically say Battle Royale multiple times,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
so it was probably a heavy influence.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And obviously, for obvious reasons, they can't exactly release their game as Battle Royale,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
but it probably is where most of their inspiration comes from.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Very cool. I'll have to see if that game looks like something I could actually play

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
or if it's going to be yet another first-person shooter I'm going to be awful at.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Well, you know, I love my Neo Geo Pocket color, and this makes me think of it.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
It's another early access game called Pocket Rumble,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
and basically it looks like old Neo Geo Pocket fighting games,

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
like Gals Fighters and the KOF games.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I think I have both of the Last Blade games, so it's pretty fun.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
This looks very interesting. I watched the trailer for it,

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
and right now I think they've only got two characters right now,

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
and they're supposed to be releasing more characters as it goes out,

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.000
but it's $9.99, and there is a preview of the upcoming games on their Kickstarter page,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000
and I'm going to have to go pick this up when I get home.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Yeah, when I heard about that, I definitely thought of you,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
because you have a lot of love for those pocket fighting games.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
That's pretty cool somebody's making a tribute.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I love the Last Blade ones. Those were always fun.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Yeah. All right, just a couple more stories, and then we'll get to tonight's mailbag,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
which DarkSakura may be able to attend to tonight, it looks like.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
She won't have to leave studio before then.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Logie.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
So Cartoon Network is kind of expanding beyond just cartoons.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
They're actually going to get into the...

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
They've been sort of working on different video games and stuff,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
but they're actually creating their own video games now,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
aside from just kind of doing licensed stuff.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:31.000
So one of the first original games that they're putting out is called OK KO, Lakewood Plaza Turbo,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
and it's, I guess, some brand new game.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
It looks pretty cool. It's kind of a brawler game that's basically an anime world.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:46.000
So their quote from Chief Content Officer Rob Scorcher, or Sorcher,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
is, we're no longer just about creating TV series.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
We're really about creating animated worlds,

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000
and we really want the ability to unfold those worlds into any platform,

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:06.000
and ultimately all platforms, including TV and mobile, console, that type of thing.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000
It looks interesting. I mean, I like the style of it.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
All right. Sorry, I got distracted for a minute there.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
For our live listeners, it looks like we had a little hiccup in studio,

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
so we may have lost audio. I got kicked from IRC. I don't know if you guys did.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I was still on, but I got the ops are warning.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Oh, so something weird happened there, so unfortunately...

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000
IP conflict?

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Yeah, I think what happened is we all reconnected,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000
and now it thinks there's too many of us on the net or something, so hopefully...

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I didn't get any kind of disconnect notice.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I'm actually showing that our live stream just dropped again, and it's trying to reconnect.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
So it looks like we are having some internet issues.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000
So for the sake of the show, I am going to keep rolling tape.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
The show must go on.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Let me try to get to the next story here.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I'm just going to hope that the stream reconnects for our live folks,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
but in the interest of the recording, I'm going to keep moving.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Hopefully it was just a little hiccup.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Hopefully everybody can kind of curb their internet activity here in the...

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I'm not using the internet.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I know you're not.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I was just looking at pictures of cows.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I'm playing Final Fantasy Explorer.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I'm not sure that Alan is not running any torrents or anything like that.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I don't know.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Anyhow...

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
That's not what you say on the air, Rab.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Sorry.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
All right, moving on.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Let's talk about Star Wars The Force Awakens.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:28.000
There is going to be a Lego game coming out for Star Wars The Force Awakens,

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:34.000
and there was a teaser that happened with the Lego folks that came out earlier this week,

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
and it said that, yeah, they're going to be coming together,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
which makes sense because there's already Lego Star Wars games.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
So we kind of knew a Star Wars Force Awakens was kind of a given,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.000
but it had actually been leaked previously due to an Xbox Store product page

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
that actually came out a little earlier than it was supposed to.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
So, yep.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens will have new gameplay mechanics,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
building, battling, and flying through the galaxy.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Interesting that they are making a whole separate game for this

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.000
and not just adding it into Lego Dimensions,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
but at the same time, it's not like they don't make stand-alone Lego games still.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Well, yeah, Dimensions, I don't think they would do that because it's a...

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000
But I would think that, you know, I'm surprised that they're putting it out now

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
because with the original trilogy and everything,

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000
they had kind of like three games in one or three movies.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I just hope that there's enough content in The Force Awakens to make a game out of,

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
which I don't know if it might be.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
The trailer was super adorable.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Like, even I kind of want to play it just by watching that trailer.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I'll have to check it out whenever, you know, we actually have a game.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Maybe that's a holiday release, I imagine.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000
June, actually.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Oh, wow.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Oh, maybe timed for the release of, like, the Blu-ray.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Maybe. I don't know.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I don't remember when the Blu-ray's coming out, but, yeah,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
June is when it's supposed to be coming out.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Cool.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
All right, let's get into the mailbag.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and find some emails

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
that she thinks, hey, these are worthy of reading on the show.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Although I believe there's only one email one night, right?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Unless the late one's here.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
It's a big one.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
One email.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
One. One email.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
One email.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Ah, ah, ah.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
DarkSakura.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
This comes from...

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
He put his full name on there.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I'm just going to say Andrew.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Very interesting discussion last week about how Shane hates E3,

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
and I thought I would chime in since I went in 2015.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I don't think Shane's the only one that...

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Yeah.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Hate's a strong word.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
But, anyway, go ahead.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I get a lot of the complaints Shane and Sky had.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Activision was still a lot of closed-door stuff,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
though I recall Skylanders being playable on the floor

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
with a several-hour wait because they were giving out

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
an exclusive Skylander.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Konami's presence was a huge boost just for two screens,

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
one Metal Gear Solid and the other for...

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
PES?

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Pro Evolution Soccer.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Okay.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Game I don't care about.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
And nothing playable on the floor.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Plus several games I saw were just demoed to me

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
in a theater setting as Sky complained about.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
For example, I saw Dark Souls 3 but didn't even end up

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
writing an article about it because by the time

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I would have done so, most of what I had seen

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
was already online.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
However, there was also a huge indie presence.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Last year was my first year, so I didn't know how it compares,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
but both Sony and Microsoft were lined with demo stations

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
for all the indies they'd been courting,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
and many of the devs were on hand to talk to people

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
playing their game.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
It was easy to simply walk up and start playing

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Rocket League or Cuphead.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Oh, man, I want to play Cuphead.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Oh, yeah.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I watched the little gameplay trailer of that recently.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
They were showing that.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
That looks fantastic.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
And several times I had the developer come

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
and chat me up while I was playing.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
On to the news about EA.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I do like that they are opening up of their stuff

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
to the public.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Like Shane, I really enjoyed the PSX I went to

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
as a fan and not media.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000
But as someone who may be going to E3 again this year

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
as media, can I say fuck you EA for putting their thing

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
across the street?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
It's already a, it's already a betch, B-E-T-C-H,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
but when you've got five minutes between appointments

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
and they're in opposite halls,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
but now there's also this to contend with.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
That's my F-you of the week.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Wink.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
You know, back in my day at E3,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
the only thing across the street were like hot dog vendors

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
and balls.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And balls.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
That was what my E3 was like, too.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.000
And then, of course, you had the EEE booth

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
where you got root beer balls.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I remember the one year I went and I didn't see anything

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
but the Ouya thing.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I think I was picking up Bobby Black Wolf

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
and we went to Disneyland.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Oh, and they had the one year where, um,

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
what's the game called now?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Um, the Rez spiritual successor.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I don't remember what it's called now.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Oh, Child of Light?

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
No, that's the Ubisoft game, isn't it?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Yeah, but it was by Mizuguchi.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Oh, no, no, no.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
You're right.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000
No, no, no.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
It was something like that, yeah.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Yeah, because I was going to say Child of Light,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
but it's not that.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Child of Eden.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Child of Eden, yes.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
That was across the street one year, too,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
and I played that.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I was like, ooh, interesting.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
And Bobby is pointing out, though,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
that EA is not going to be across the street for media

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
because the meeting rooms, they will still have upstairs

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
at the LA Convention Center.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000
And a lot of people who've even been to E3

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
don't ever think to walk upstairs,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000
and that's because I think you actually,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I don't think a general badge gets you up there.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I think you have to have a media badge to get up there.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
But we actually, I went up there

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
when I had some appointments a couple years ago

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.000
the last time I was there, and I was like,

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000
wow, there's a lot more you don't even see that's up here

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
because that's how I played.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I want to say how I played a lot of the Bandai Namco stuff

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
was actually upstairs.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It wasn't even on the show floor,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
but we had an appointment to see the Tails game

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
that was coming out that year,

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
and we got to play some of the other stuff.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
My first year, I just managed to piggyback into media events,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
remember?

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
And then my second year, I managed to, again,

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
piggyback into media events and convince the people

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
at Capcom to let me in

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
because that's when they were being really rude to people.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Yeah.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But I got into something.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
The best badge you can have was the one year

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I had the exhibitor badge,

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
and I just went everywhere whenever I wanted.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I went there a day early, and it was just playing games

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
that were already on the floor.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000
It was so good.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000
The third year is when we had media passes,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
and that was pretty fun.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I just remember hanging out in the Bethesda room for a while

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
with that Call of Cthulhu game

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.000
that I wanted to play so badly.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
The reality is times have changed,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.000
and it's a new media now than it was ten years ago

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
when we were all first going,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.000
so we'll see what happens and what changes in the future.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
All right, that is it for our mailbag tonight.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
All right, participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
if you want to send an email for a future week.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000
In the meantime, let's get into the FUs of the week

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
because we get angsty here on the show once in a while,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
and so we're going to take it out on all of you.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:50.000
This is FU2, and it's not like anyone's fault or anything,

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
so I'll say FU that my friend's cat got out

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
and has now lost everything.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Poor baby, I hope you can find your baby.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
There's a poor little hurt cat too.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
There's cold, poor baby.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
I hope they come back soon.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.000
And also FU2 having migraines at work.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Um, Loki.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
I'm FU2 myself for twisting my ankle

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
while playing Ingress this week.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
It's a dangerous sport.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Yes, dangerous, no, it's more like me being a dumbass

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
and walking along the edge of a road and stepping on it.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Was it even a dangerous portal?

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Were you going into the ditch by the movie theaters?

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
It wasn't that, or it was just like over?

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.000
No, it was the entrance to a park,

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
and there's no place to park right there by the portal,

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
so I had to park and walk to it, and I did, and I hit it.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
So you tripped over your own two feet?

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
No, I didn't trip over my own two feet.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
I tripped off the curb funny and twisted my ankle,

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
and I looked like a dumbass because I fell on the ground,

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
and then had to hobble around for a couple days.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Alright.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
My FU of the Week goes to, oh my god,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
the sickness that would not go away.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I was waking up for like two weeks.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
You remember when I missed a show a couple weeks ago?

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Like, I think today is the first day that I woke up feeling symptom-free.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Knock on wood, cross my fingers, all that stuff.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
FU did the sickness that would not go away. It was awful.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And FU did the fact that I walked six miles yesterday,

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
but that's actually a good thing. I needed the exercise.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But I walked six miles for Ingress First Saturday,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000
and I came in sixth place, but that was out of 72 people,

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
so it's not too bad actually, so I'm happy.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I really wanted to go to that. I wish I could.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It was fun. There was a lot of people there.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
It's fun to meet the people that you only talk to online usually.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
So were there a lot of people from the other faction there?

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Yeah, but I don't want to say it gets high school,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
but people definitely kind of hang with their crew,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
and I didn't meet a lot of people. I'm always nice.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
There's a couple, but usually they're out of area.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
You know, so there was a couple that I met that were nice.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Was Pepper there?

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
No, she wasn't. I like her. I would have said hi to her if she was there.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.000
See, my thought was if I had been able to go to a park or something like that,

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
I was like, well, everybody's going into this thing.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000
I'm just going to go hack your crap while you're away.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Yeah, right, so it was fun, but I did a lot of walking.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000
It was like I got to come home and take a nap because that was too much walking.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
All right, moving on. Shane, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:37.000
FU2, deciding I wanted that Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comic book way too late

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
because now you can't find it.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I guess I'll have to wait for the third reprint that comes out in March,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.000
but I really wanted the Blue Ranger cover, and I won't be able to find that.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Well, maybe there's a listener that can save the day and cross our fingers and our toes.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Let Shane know. Reach out to him on Twitter.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Yes, I just want the Blue Ranger cover.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
If you have one in your area that's not the Blue Ranger,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.000
I'll just get it off of the Internet version or something.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000
All right.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
But thank you in advance.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Tigerclaw in chat wants to know, specifically for you, Shane,

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:14.000
speaking of Power Rangers, what are his thoughts on Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa?

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
You could go listen to Ranger Pride and find out, but spoiler.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
That's how you plug a show. Good job, but spoiler.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I love Elizabeth Banks.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
All right.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
So that might give you a clue as to how I feel.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.000
All right. Let's do a couple more stories here, and then we're going to open up the phone line.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Gosh, we're running a little ahead of schedule tonight.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
It's weird, but I guess when there's less people because the whole football game and so forth,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
some nights we're done early, some nights we're not.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Loki, what do you got for us?

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
All right.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:55.000
So there was going to be an iOS version of binding of Isaac Rebirth,

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:00.000
but now it's not going to happen because it's been rejected from the App Store.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:09.000
And I guess this was due to an issue of depictions of violence towards or abuse of children,

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
which is pretty much the foundation of this game.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000
And so it's going to be kind of hard to fix that.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I love the response by the actual developer, Tyrone Rotter.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:27.000
It's like he posted the whole, what was it, the rejection notice thing,

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
and then he's like, come on, what the fuck, Apple?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So that was very funny.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.000
But yes, usually he's, I guess, had the problems with other games in the past,

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:45.000
but it's going to be hard to kind of censor that to where it'd be acceptable on the store, I guess,

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
because, I mean, it's the whole foundation of the game.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It is a little dark, let's just put it like that.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I can see when I kind of heard this, I was like, well, it is a bit much,

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
and it didn't get on Nintendo's platform.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
But it's not necessarily, I mean...

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
It is on Nintendo's platform.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Is it? I thought they ended up...

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
No, it's on, you have to, you can only play it on new 3DS.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
That's right, that's right.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I mean, it's not a realistic depiction of a child.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
I mean, it's just a cartoon character.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I mean, come on.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
It's hard to just say he's 18.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Just change the graphics.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Alright, well, you know, one game that people would love to see on a Nintendo platform is Undertale.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
You know, this game has been a runaway indie success,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:41.000
and apparently, developer support at Nintendo of America has reached out to Toby Fox,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
who is the creator of Undertale.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
That's what some outlets are reporting this week.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
And this is all through Twitter, for what it's worth.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.000
So, you know, that's why people can see those tweets.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
And the tweet actually said,

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Hey, are you available for me to reach out to you when you get a chance?

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Let me know if that's cool.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
So now a lot of people are saying like,

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Oh, is Nintendo trying to chase down Undertale for their platforms?

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
They'll buy it and call it Earthbound 4.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Anything's possible.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
But, you know, Undertale isn't on consoles,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
and I bet Nintendo would love to have that under their belt.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000
You know, I don't see why they wouldn't go for that.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
So we'll see what happens with that.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
I still need to play my copy.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000
It was, I believe Dar Sakura bought that for me for the holidays,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
and I still haven't played it yet, because I'm a bad person.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
I've only played the demo partially.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Yeah, I need to get into that.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
But what bugs me is that I've already had,

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I don't want to say the whole thing's spoiled,

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:38.000
but I kind of know that you're supposed to play a certain way the first time.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000
And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that that got ruined for me.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
But, oh well.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Anyhow, sg100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I have to play Undertale at some point.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Sounds like I'm not the only one who's behind,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
but that happens with games sometimes.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.000
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line right now for you to call in.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the old school phone number,

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000
but you can also call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Skype, of course, is something you can get on your PC,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
or it's an app on pretty much every smartphone that's out there.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:14.000
And you can just call us all one word on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Bob Coffey says, oh shit, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 is going to have the Technodrome?

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
And Krang.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Yeah, it sounds like the second movie gives us a lot of the stuff we remember from the 90s cartoon.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
It looks pretty awesome.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Yeah, was the new trailer released today?

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Yeah, Super Bowl.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I figured. A lot of movies. Didn't Independence Day get one too, or the new Independence Day?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
X-Men Apocalypse.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
I don't know, but I'm going to have to go look for those now.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I think there was a new Independence Day one too.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
So there's a lot of movie stuff today.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I'm sure YouTube will blow up with all that stuff later.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Don't they compile all the official Super Bowl stuff into one YouTube playlist?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Maybe.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.000
You don't even have to really watch the game, you can just watch the YouTube playlist two hours after the game is over.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I don't know.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Speaking of movies, I do want to give a quick plug to Flaco Jones.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Because his winter movie preview just went up over at vognetwork.com.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
And you can check that out and tell us what winter movies you're looking forward to.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 not on that list because it's not a winter movie.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000
But a little movie, I think it's called Skull Poople or something?

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Is coming out next week and has a lot of people very excited about that.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000
What?

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Skull Poople.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
What are you trying to say? I don't understand.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Have you heard about the Deadpool movie marketing campaign?

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Where they used the emojis and the emojis were the skull, the poop, and the letter L.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Because it's dead poo-le.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000
But a lot of people were like, what's Skull Poople?

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And so they kind of like ran with it.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.000
And I think Ryan Reynolds actually did an interview where he's promoting Skull Poople.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
So, I think that's funny.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Obviously, Ryan Reynolds is a great fit for that character.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:55.000
He's apparently great for that role and just hearing one of the reviews for it today.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
It's getting a lot of positive press from what I'm hearing.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Yeah, I'm totally down to see this.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Yeah, I'll see that too.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Dark Soccer though, you're usually the one that jumps at the Deadpool stuff.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Are you going to be seeing Skull Poople or no?

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Probably.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Yeah?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I mean, it kind of goes without saying.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Yeah.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I rarely make it out to movies anymore.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Remember, Shane, when we said we were going to go see one movie a week?

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
You wanted to do that.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
How long did that last?

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
No, because you said you were going to do it too, but then you changed mine.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
But it wasn't on me to do it.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
It was on you to say something.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
And it happened one time.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
We went and saw one movie.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Now, granted, we saw Star Wars, which is pretty awesome.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
But it happened one time.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.000
I just want to point that out.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Again, that was on you though, not me.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Alright, another plug for calls.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Orange Launch Radio.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Although, again, our live turnout is a little less.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I'm thankful to you guys for being here live, but there are less than there usually are.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Orange Launch Radio on Skype, all one word.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
One eight seven seven game over.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Well, this stream did crash, and I think a few people crashed with it.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
The stream did crash, and some people probably thought we were done or something.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
So, I hate that, but some things you can't control, and that's one of them.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
They apparently had a new TV spot for 10 Cloverfield Lane.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
What was that?

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000
There was a TV spot for what?

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Ten Cloverfield Lane.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Oh, yeah, the whole...

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I'm so excited for that movie.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I kind of thought the original movie was super overrated, but...

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I loved it.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Yeah, of course you did.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Let's see, in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Xanos in chat says, and I hope I'm saying that right, sorry if I'm not,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
says, looking forward to Deadpool Thursday night on DLX.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Tiger call asking if we've seen the new Jason Bourne spot.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Is that the one where they don't have Matt Damon doing it anymore,

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
but now it's what, Jeremy Renner?

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
No, I think Matt Damon's back.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Oh, he's back? Oh, good for him.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000
I saw, like, the first one of those movies, and never...

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.000
We also had the anniversary of Street Fighter II a few days ago.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
That did happen this week, didn't it?

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
It did.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Street Fighter, quickly, since we're not getting any calls,

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
favorite Street Fighter II memory?

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
It wasn't Street Fighter II,

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
but it was X-Men vs. Street Fighter,

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.000
of beating Dan's ass with Kami and having him yell about how much he hates Kami.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
That was great.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Mine was being at a tournament at Blockbuster,

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000
when they were doing tournaments.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Awesome.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
And a guy saying he wanted to pick Guile,

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
and I was like, who's Guile?

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
One of the people who is Callum Cooley.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Is he the guy that does the Sanic Boom?

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Sanic Bam!

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Sanic Bam?

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Let's see, my favorite memory was...

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I was on a bus trip from...

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
It's a button willow.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Well, funny enough, it was California to the United Nations in New York City.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
I probably told this story on the show at some point.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
It was something I did through, like, a youth...

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Well, it was actually...

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Do you know what the Independent Order Odd Fellows is?

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
It's kind of like Masons, like one of those types of organizations.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.000
They used to sponsor...

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Sounds like a cult.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
It's not a cult.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
It's an old people organization.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
They're all very nice people,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
and they paid for me to go to New York City,

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
so there's not possibly a negative thing I could say.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
But I won the speech contest,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
so they did this thing where we went on a bus to the United Nations.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
The point of the story is, coming back,

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
our last stop was in...

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I want to say it was Ontario.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
That's where the airport is, down south, right?

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
We stopped there the very last night,

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:17.000
and there was some arcade next door to the hotel we were all staying at.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
So we went into this little arcade,

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
and there was a bunch of people playing Street Fighter II,

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
and I just was like,

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Oh, yeah, Street Fighter II, I want to play,

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
and I got on, and I was playing as Chun-Li,

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
and that made all the bros who were playing the game

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
kind of laugh like,

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Oh, it's a guy playing Chun-Li or whatever.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I whooped them all.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I was on that machine.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
I shit you not for an hour straight,

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
just playing Chun-Li, kicking all their asses.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
That's my favorite Street Fighter II memory.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
So thank you, Chun-Li, for showing...

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
for helping me out.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I had a moment like that with Tekken 3 back in the day.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Oh, yeah?

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Playing, uh...

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Weren't you kind of known locally as that girl who plays Tekken?

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Who plays Tekken, yeah.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Well, the story is that I had gone back into the cyber station

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
that I used to work at,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
because they had the deluxe Tekken 3 cab, so...

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Nice.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Well, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Who's this?

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Hello, Rob.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Is this Marissa?

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Yes, it is.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Yay, these are my favorite moments.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Hello, everybody.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
How are you, Marissa?

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Marissa, come on in.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I tried to go outside to talk on the phone,

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
because I live in a very small space,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
and my boyfriend now has to listen to me talk.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
There is a wind tunnel outside.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Anyway...

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
We don't hear it, for what it's worth,

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
but I'm sorry you're having to put up with it,

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
but we can hear you just fine.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
What's on your mind tonight, hun?

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Calling to say hi.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000
I noticed, you know, you're having a Super Bowl lag, right?

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Yeah, I think a lot of people are feeling it.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Like, what can you do?

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.000
This is the day where Bravo just plays Real Housewives all day long,

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
because what can you do?

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
They already do that.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Yeah, that's a good point.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Chris just said to me, he's like,

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
you can't say Super Bowl, it's the big game.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
We can say it's streaming, honey.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I think, technically, we're talking news,

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and Super Bowl is news.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000
We're not...

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
If we had promoted tonight's show

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
as the Super Bowl edition of Orange on Radio,

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
then that's a problem.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I didn't even know anybody excited about this game in particular,

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
but we went to the supermarket,

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
and they were completely out of all chips and beer,

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
so I guess it was just like, hey, let's eat and drink day.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Yeah, people, even if their teams aren't in it,

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
people still watch it and get into it.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Like, well, usually, like our pal Bobby,

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000
he's not usually on Super Bowl Sunday,

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
because it was like the one time a year

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
he would see a certain group of friends,

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000
and they would hang out.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And for whatever sad reason, unfortunately,

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
that didn't happen this year, so Bobby was here tonight.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000
But, you know, it's like one of those cultural things.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Some people do it for the Oscars, right?

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000
You might have a friend that has an Oscar party every year,

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
and then suddenly one year they'll stop.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000
They'll get sick of doing it.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
That's true.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Well, you know, if I'm down here in L.A., though,

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
and like we only care, well, we don't have a football team right now,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
but we only care if our team is winning anyway.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Well, you're getting a team next year, from what I understand,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
so that's going to change a little bit.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Yeah.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Well, even then, the thing is, that's always funny.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
It's like, you know, we'll be bagging on,

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
like we're never like, this is our hometown.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
We like support our home team.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
You know, it's like Dodgers suck, and then they win.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
We love the Dodgers, so that's it.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000
You know, we never support them unless they're winners,

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
but we always have our Oscar parties.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:22.000
And actually, Dark Soccer, I see you asking in chat,

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
does anyone in here live in or near Denver?

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I believe Jason.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Okay, just because my friend's kitten,

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
she's actually put out a call for him.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
He's got a blue cast on.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:35.000
He's a black kitten, and his name is Logie.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000
And I don't think, oh, is Denver where the kitty disappeared?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Yeah.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Oh, I don't think Jason is in Denver.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I think he's in like, Colorado Springs,

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
or like, kind of out, like a suburb.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.000
It'll be easy to see.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000
He's got like a light blue cast on his back leg.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
I'm sure if Jason is still listening to the show,

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
he's probably had to board up all the windows and doors at this point

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.000
from all the rioting that is going on a mile high right now, so stay safe.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
You're gonna look up to a scared Tiny Tim of cats.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I hope he gets recovered.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Any gaming going on for you, Marissa?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I don't know if there's anything you're playing?

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Not right now.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000
I actually went through Fallout again.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Oh, nice.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I can't wait to actually play Fallout 4.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
We still have a 360.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000
We're gonna upgrade eventually, but in celebration of that,

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I went through Fallout 4.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I mean, through the two previous games,

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
and it's funny, you were talking about taking breaks in gaming.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
When I really get into a game,

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
my break is finding up with some sort of lame save point excuse,

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
even when you can save anywhere,

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
to stall my boyfriend so I can continue to play.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
That's my break.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:56.000
It's like, honey, finish mission two hours later.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Oh, it's really tough.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
I'm in a cut scene.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
It's still going.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
That's my break.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Get a drink.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Make an excuse.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000
That's a good story.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Use the bathroom.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.000
You know what?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000
You bring up a really good point, too,

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
and something that came up this week

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
when I was talking to somebody else,

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
unaffiliated with the show or the network,

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
but I was talking about, you know, like,

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
oh, yeah, I play a lot of video games,

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
and I do this podcast, and I'm a big gamer,

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
and this friend I was talking to said,

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
well, I'm a gamer, too,

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.000
but I don't really own any of the news systems,

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
so I don't know if you would really consider me a gamer,

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
and I felt really bad because I was like,

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
of course you're still a gamer.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
There's a lot of people.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I mean, PlayStation 4's only been out, like, two years, right?

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Same thing with Xbox One.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Like, if you don't have the cutting-edge stuff, it's okay.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
People got their priorities,

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.000
and there's a lot of people still loving their 360s

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000
and their PlayStation 3s,

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.000
and there's a huge library on both those consoles

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
to catch up on and the Nintendo Wii, to be fair.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
You can't get a lot of games for cheap now, yeah.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Yeah, exactly, and you can get them secondhand,

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
and they're cheap.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000
So I absolutely still consider everybody playing,

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
even if you're a generation behind,

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
or even two generations behind, screw it.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I want to say, when Raginator was first listening to OLR,

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.000
he was like, can I talk about Nintendo 64 games?

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Because I'm, like, really behind,

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
and I'm like, of course you can,

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
because some people love retro stuff.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Why not?

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000
That's true.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Like, if you get, like, you know,

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.000
a Jamie level, you know, massive room of games

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
and, like, museum type, then you're like,

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
to music, like, what the vinyl collector is, you know?

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000
But, you know, I still think it's a conspiracy, though,

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:34.000
because my, um, I'm not the only one,

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
but, you know, our disk drive is starting to go.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
I'm like, I swear to God, it's a conspiracy

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
to make a spot on Xbox One.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Isn't?

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Yeah.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
All of a sudden, now, it's starting to grind,

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
and we might go in there and mess with the belt, but, yeah.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
And now they're coming out with all this new stuff, too,

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
where, oh, more games are backwards compatible.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Now the secret backwards compatibility is being added,

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000
and I kind of can't wait

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
for the Castlevania Symphony of the Night myself,

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
because I would love to revisit that game again, but, yeah.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Funny.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Talking about cut scenes, I have to say this from chat.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Bobby in our chat room says,

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
I'm in a cut scene.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Oh, it's still going.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
No, it's not.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Yes, it is.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:11.000
This is Xenosaga.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Yeah, some games really do have, like, two hour cut scenes.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I would say Xenoblade Chronicles almost in that category

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000
with some of those cut scenes.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Good lord.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.000
No.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
I tried to, I was like, can I save the game now?

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Jesus.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Anyway.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
That game is so good.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Yeah, it was pretty fun.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I was giving it a lot of shit in the beginning,

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
and rightfully so, but once you stick with it,

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000
it gets pretty good.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Anyway, Marisa, always so lovely to hear from you.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Anything else you want to mention

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
before we let you go tonight?

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I don't know if you guys covered the Annie's,

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
but, you know, that was more animation oriented.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
But that's an interesting thing to check out.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000
That was last night.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Was it last night?

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
I wonder if our pals at Anime Jam Session

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
know about that, because that would be

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
a little probably more up their alley,

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
even though if it's more, if it's like,

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
but they talk, they get into the other stuff

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
just like we do here, too.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Especially since everyone is, you know, involved.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Especially, you know, the actors do both.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Yeah, true.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000
That's true.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Anybody you know win anything?

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Oh, well, I don't have any updates on any of our buddies,

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
except I think you need to take classes, you know,

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:16.000
with Greg and David, and Greg is a sweetheart.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000
The most recent game that I know that he's done,

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
although I do know that he's done things since,

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:23.000
you know, is that he was in one of the loudspeakers

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
in Dishonored.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000
But there, you know, that's the luck of being where I live.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
You know, I've taken classes with Charlie Adler,

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
so people could know his work from gaming,

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.000
but in animation he's huge, and he's amazing.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.000
So, although I do welcome you to reach out to Andrew

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
at any time, too, if you ever want to have him

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.000
on the show again, or any guests.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Yeah, get some updates, figure out what's going on.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Yeah.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Absolutely.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
All right.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Well, Marissa, I'm going to let you go

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
so we can see if we get any other callers tonight,

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
but thank you so much.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Always a pleasure to hear from you,

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
and I really, really hope to make it to L.A. soon.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
There's still time.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000
All right.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Take care, my dear.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.000
My best.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Bye.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000
All right.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000
And there goes Marissa.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.000
We love hearing from her, though.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I am going to bow out.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:08.000
That's right.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.000
It is about that time.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000
It is.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Have a wonderful week.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
How was I going to say?

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Rest of your weekend, but there's not much left.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Enjoy the hour or two that's left.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:20.000
You mean like the 45 minutes I have left before I have to go to bed?

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight before you go?

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I wish I could sleep in tomorrow.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.000
That's really my final thought.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Me too.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.000
My strongest desire is to no longer be on morning shift.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Ah.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Well, hopefully you'll get to switcheroo it up soon.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:37.000
All right.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Well.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Mid next month.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
We will see you next week.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Maybe.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000
All right.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000
If I'm not dead.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Next week is a three-day weekend for me.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Lucky you.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I know.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Next Sunday is Valentine's day.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Oh, shit.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Oh, it's Valentine's day.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Are we doing a show?

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I guess we're going to have to.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Well, I'll be here.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
You'll be here.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
I guess.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Will you be here, Loki?

02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Is life going to let you do a show on Valentine's day?

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Probably.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.000
All right.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Cool.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Good.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.000
All right.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Well, because Alan and I always have the perspective of the restaurants are going to be a shit show

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
on Valentine's day.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000
So we'll go.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I took the day after off, so I can actually do the whole show.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Exactly.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:18.000
We'll go the day before two days before two, like we'll do a dinner and call it our Valentine's

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
dinner.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
We are just fine with that.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
So that's what we do.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.000
So rock on.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
All right.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Well, thank you, dark soccer.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
We'll see you in a week.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000
All right.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Bye.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.000
All right.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000
And Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, yeah, I'll be here next week.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:33.000
My girlfriend and I will do stuff Friday and Saturday, and then we're going up to mag fest.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.000
So he's actually, I don't, have you mentioned that you're bringing your, your gal pal?

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Uh, but yeah, they're, uh, they're going to be, uh, uh, at mag fest.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.000
So, um, that'll be a, a really fun trip for them.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Sadly, Alan cannot come to mag fest cause it's an election year and his industry involves

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:51.000
selections and he's gonna be very, very, very busy.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
So very cool.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Uh, one more shout out for calls.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.000
One eight seven seven game of LR, excuse me, or I use him on Skype, orange lounge radio,

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
checking in with Loki for any last minute stories possibly while we wait for calls.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Sure thing.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Um, track media turbo has a release date.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Now it's going to be coming out March 22nd on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
And I just caught up on the trailer cause I completely forgot about this game.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And Holy shit.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Does that look amazing?

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000
So I'm going to have to probably pick that up when it comes out.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Um, GameStop is publishing a game.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
That's kind of scary.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Um, yes, apparently, um, they're going to be publishing song of the deep.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.000
It's a 2d underwater Metrovania game and it's going to be out on PC, PlayStation four and

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Xbox one.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
And you saw who it's made by ratchet and clank people.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Yep.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Insomniac.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Um, not so excited about GameStop being a publisher, but we'll see how that works out.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:54.000
And last but not least humble, but humble monthly bundle has 70,000 subscribers.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I didn't think there'd be that many people picking random games that are going to be,

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000
you know, in a bundle without being announced prior to that.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.000
But apparently people are excited about that.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And I guess the, let's see, which games do they have actually as part of the bundles?

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:20.000
For example, February, they had alien isolation, Titan souls, broken age volume, um, Panaria

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:26.000
dropsy and elephant in the room, I guess, which is a humble original.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000
That's kind of cool.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Actually, I'm, I, if I was a fan of alien isolation, that'd be kind of worth it.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.000
But that's it.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Sorry, buy me a little time.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
All right.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Um, I'm one of the reasons I was getting unity kind of up and running again was I was going

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000
to be working on another concept game.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Cause like I said, I want to get done with just the whole, it's on the car thing and

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
it's not quite to the level that I want it to be.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Maybe I might have to redo it in unity five, but I just kind of just want to get something

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000
done at this point so I can move on to something else.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I'm back.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Sorry.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Business things I got to do while the show's going on.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.000
I'm multitasking.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Unfortunately, one of those things is no more calls coming in.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.000
So sadly, uh, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Uh, but if you, uh, heard this, you know, later, you think of something later on, don't

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
forget, you can always email us, participate at orange launch radio.com.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
You can always send us a tweet as well at OLR.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000
I do read them all, even if I don't respond to each and every one here on air.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Um, that is going to do it though.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
For another episode of orange Laundrio, we say here every week, thank you for checking

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
out the show.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
We really do appreciate you checking it out.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.000
All we ask, tell a friend about the show, help spread the word because that's all we

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000
have is word of mouth.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Um, you know, tell a friend or two about the show that's going to help us get our name

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
out there and expand our family even more.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
We really appreciate it.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000
A five star review on a site where you found this show, perhaps iTunes or stitcher radio.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Those go a long way as well.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
So we really appreciate those.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Um, anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Hey Shane, thanks for being here two weeks in a row.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Appreciate it.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Hope you enjoyed the wine.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I'm starting.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
I'm still finish it.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000
No, I'm still working on it.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I'm grateful.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000
You're just waiting for spaghetti.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Yeah.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
All right.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Alan's making spaghetti tonight.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
A late dinner.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
So it's exciting.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
All right.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Um, like your final thought though, Shane, while you're still here.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Two things.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:27.240
One, Diablos and Bahamut are jerks in explorers because they're not giving me the ability

02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:29.420
to make my scythe in this game.

02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:31.480
And two, forget Valentine's day.

02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.880
That day is also the premiere of the new Super Sentai Ju-o-ger.

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.000
There's just too much going on on Valentine's day.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Yes.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000
New OLR.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Yeah.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Mostly Ju-o-ger.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.540
Which I guess also means, I didn't even think about this, that means the, uh, the three

02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:47.220
shows announcements is going to be on Valentine's day, but that's all right.

02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:49.820
We'll, we'll have more people there next week than we did tonight.

02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:52.980
So, uh, anyway, uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:56.980
Um, I got a lot of time to ingress now.

02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:57.980
Good.

02:27:57.980 --> 02:27:59.660
Clean up the neighborhood.

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:00.660
There's still some blue.

02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:03.180
Uh, I'll get you some, clean up my neighborhood.

02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:04.180
I'll get you some bursters.

02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:05.180
All right.

02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:07.620
Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:10.860
Thank you guys so much for downloading the show or listening to it live or however you

02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:11.860
consumed it.

02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:14.060
Uh, be nice to each other while you play online.

02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:15.100
Don't be a jerk.

02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:16.540
It's re you're all nerds.

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:18.300
Be nice to the people you're playing with.

02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:23.420
We're gonna, uh, see you in seven days and, uh, have a happy and safe Valentine's day.

02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:24.420
We'll talk to you though.

02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:27.820
And if you're one of those, you know, people that are like, well, I celebrate singles awareness

02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:28.820
day.

02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:29.820
That's okay.

02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:30.820
We'll have a party for you too.

02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:31.820
Next week.

02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:32.820
Seven days.

02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:33.820
See you then.

02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:34.820
