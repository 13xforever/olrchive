7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week, Pokemon Turn 20, showing no signs of slowing down, the cycle of releases continues as the next Pokemon games have already been announced.
20000	27000	We'll bring you the details on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 632 for this February the 28th of 2016.
44000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining you here live from lovely Studio N7 in Sacramento, California,
54000	59000	where we are live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG Network.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
59000	64000	And joining me on this adventure is my co-pilot, DarkSakura, or Jamie Sommers.
64000	65000	Hi.
65000	67000	Hi. She's the femme chef of this show.
67000	70000	And she has some hair to kind of match right now, a little bit.
70000	72000	This is my favorite chair in the studio.
72000	75000	She's enjoying her recliner over there. How are you, DarkSakura?
75000	76000	I'm alright.
76000	83000	We are back after a week off. I was out in the Washington, D.C. area last week for MAGFest, which I'll talk about here shortly.
83000	86000	But did you enjoy a week off from OLR, DarkSakura?
86000	87000	I sure did.
87000	88000	Yeah? What'd you do?
88000	90000	I did jack shit.
90000	94000	You said you and the hubby were cleaning the vault a little bit.
94000	95000	Well, that was today.
95000	96000	Oh, that was today.
96000	100000	And it was mostly him and me just kind of watching and taking pictures and putting them on Instagram.
100000	103000	As the supervisor should do, directing and watching.
103000	105000	Well, the cat was being the supervisor, really.
105000	108000	She's just like, I'm supervising you, but you're not putting food in my mouth.
108000	111000	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
111000	113000	And then she's like, she's like been doing this thing lately.
113000	119000	We're like, I'll sit down. And it used to be she'd just sit on my lap and purr, purr, purr, get up when she's done.
119000	121000	You know, she just fucks off into the night.
121000	125000	Now she sits on my lap angrily.
125000	128000	She thrashes around and then tries to bite my hand when I pet her.
128000	130000	But she won't get up.
130000	135000	I'm like, cat, if you don't want to be on my lap, why are you on my lap?
135000	138000	The joys of owning a cat or the joys of a cat owning you.
138000	139000	Whatever.
139000	140000	She's a brat.
140000	142000	Wait, back to the vault thing for a minute here.
142000	146000	So you were mentioning, you are going to be, and for those that might be newer to OLR,
146000	151000	Dark Soccer and The Hubby have a stash of classic modern game stuff called The Vault.
151000	155000	It's an entire room. At one point it was an entire room in their house of just,
155000	160000	I would call it crap, but it's awesome crap because it's like gaming.
160000	161000	It's a lot of stuff.
161000	163000	Yeah. But so you're finally trimming it down a little bit.
163000	166000	But you said you're getting rid of like duplicates. Like you have four Coleco Visions.
166000	167000	No, I have two Coleco Visions.
167000	168000	Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.
168000	170000	One of them is the same one I had as a kid.
170000	175000	The other one is one that we bought later when I was working at the former money store.
175000	177000	Which is amazing that they still work.
177000	180000	Well, yeah. I mean, well, they, they built them kind of,
180000	187000	the less complicated the mechanics are, the longer it stands to reason it's going to work, you know.
189000	197000	But we're thinking about like getting together, like whole sets and eBaying them.
197000	201000	Or making them available to listeners if they want to, to buy them from us.
201000	202000	Buy my crap.
202000	207000	Seriously. Cause I mean like, cause then, you know, we can put it in the, into the,
207000	211000	send Jamie to X convention fund.
211000	213000	Dragon Con girl, you got to go sometime.
213000	218000	They would, they would love you at Dragon Con. I'm telling you, love you.
218000	220000	I might, that might be a thing.
220000	222000	Maybe I'll have to break out the Grey Warden for that.
222000	225000	I like that. There you go. Now you're talking. Now you're talking.
225000	230000	Also joining us also here with me every week on this lovely show, Sunday nights.
230000	232000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
232000	233000	Hello.
233000	234000	How are you doing, Loki?
234000	235000	Fine.
235000	236000	How was your week off from the show?
236000	237000	I went and saw Deadpool.
237000	238000	Did you?
238000	239000	Yes.
239000	241000	Alan's been begging me to go take him to see you at night.
241000	244000	I was going to take him yesterday morning, but I was like,
244000	248000	I want to go in the morning for a matinee and there's less teenagers there.
248000	252000	And then what happened? I slept for 14 hours Friday night.
252000	255000	14 hours. Loki, have you ever slept for 14 hours?
255000	256000	Nope.
256000	260000	Especially since the kids came around.
260000	261000	14 minutes. Yes.
261000	266000	14 hours because I was, I was sick at magfest and just,
266000	270000	I honestly think that was the first full night sleep I'd gotten in like two weeks.
270000	273000	Maybe 14 hours in a week.
273000	275000	Sorry to rub it in, but yeah.
275000	278000	So we didn't end up seeing Deadpool because I slept for 14 hours.
278000	279000	But how was Deadpool?
279000	280000	It was excellent.
280000	281000	Yeah.
281000	282000	I loved it.
282000	286000	I'm such a uncool kid. I'm like the only one who hasn't seen it yet, but soon, soon.
286000	287000	I still never saw it.
287000	290000	I love James Bond movies and I never went to go see Spectre.
290000	293000	I just out of it. Isn't it all blue right now?
293000	294000	I think so.
294000	296000	Jeez. I'm behind the times. I need to get with it.
296000	297000	And with it.
297000	300000	Uh, so, uh, so you went and saw Deadpool with your night off?
300000	301000	Yeah.
301000	303000	You didn't go out and make triangles and ingress? I would have figured that.
303000	304000	No, I did both.
304000	305000	Oh, you did both. Of course. Of course.
305000	307000	At the movie theater, you had to hack.
307000	308000	Yeah.
308000	310000	Awesome.
311000	318000	We are going to be at the Sacramento Indie Game Arcade show that's coming up on April 9th, I believe is the day.
318000	321000	It's a Saturday. I think it's like the second weekend in April.
321000	326000	We're going to be there at the Indie Arcade. We did this last year. We're going to do it again this year.
326000	332000	Although I know they've been kind of trying to convince Loki to be a part of it and showing a game is time to card.
332000	333000	You think you might make it?
333000	335000	I'm not working on that anymore.
335000	336000	Oh, oh.
336000	337000	At least not right now.
337000	338000	Excuse me.
338000	344000	I was trying to work on something else, but I don't think mentally I'm just not capable of doing it right now.
344000	351000	Like, I think yesterday, it's just too distracting. My environment, I'm too tired to do it.
351000	356000	Like, I was trying to program while the wife was watching Fuller House.
356000	359000	Which is awesome, by the way.
359000	360000	It's pretty good.
361000	368000	If you're expecting a fucking Emmy-worthy TV series, you're not going to get it.
368000	373000	It is just as bad as it was in 1990. That's what's awesome about it. It's so bad it's good.
373000	380000	It's alright. We were almost done with everything. We've watched 12 of the 13 episodes. I'm sure she'll be finishing it tonight.
381000	393000	Dude, I'm sorry. Stephanie is just exposed in a lot of that show to a distracting mirror.
393000	398000	Like, the first episode, I can't even tell you what happened in it because it was just her fucking tits the entire time.
398000	399000	It was ridiculous.
399000	403000	It's a little weird because it's like, I grew up with you.
404000	411000	But it's funny though because they poke fun at themselves in the show and they also poke fun at stuff like that.
411000	420000	I was impressed at what a good comedic actress Jodie Sweetin turned out to be because she didn't really do anything after Full House except a lot of drugs.
420000	425000	But, thankfully, she's cleaned up and she's got a great recovery story, wrote a book about it and all that stuff.
425000	431000	She's really done a lot. So, it's really cool that people can see she's actually, I would say, she's kind of one of the better people on the show.
431000	438000	That and, what is it, Kimmy's husband or ex-husband or separated husband. He's hilarious.
438000	440000	Oh, Fernando or something?
440000	441000	Fernando, yes.
441000	443000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, okay.
443000	449000	My wife couldn't stop laughing at, like, who gives stationery for a birthday gift?
449000	455000	That is my mother. It's her go-to gift since she got fired from the stationery store for stealing all the stationery.
455000	458000	And for some reason, she thought that was hilarious.
458000	467000	Now, I never in a million years thought that OLR would start off one week with Loki and I sitting here discussing the finer points of the Full House sequel.
467000	470000	But, here we are.
470000	481000	It's not bad. It was, like, the first episode, like, if I was to judge it on the first episode alone, I was like, holy shit, this is way, way too cringy.
481000	483000	It was, like, it was incredibly cringy.
484000	492000	You have to stick with it until, like, the third episode when it's, like, random 90s singer who disappeared forever cameo. And it's like, the fuck is this? But this is awesome.
492000	493000	What, Millie Vanilli shows up?
493000	497000	No, minor spoiler alert, Macy Gray.
497000	498000	Oh my god.
498000	499000	Right?
499000	504000	And just, like, it just gets, the whole show just keeps getting weirder. Like, they...
504000	506000	Isn't that the I'm Like a Bird?
506000	508000	No, that was Nellie Furtado, dear.
508000	514000	Macy Gray was a, I try to say goodbye and not choke. Remember?
514000	515000	Yeah.
515000	525000	She got the very distinctive voice. She's awesome, though. And it was, it was kind of awesome to see her in the show being just as big of a cornball as everybody else. I don't know, it was awesome.
525000	527000	Maybe I'll watch it.
527000	529000	It's on Netflix. Why not?
530000	545000	Let's see. And of course, Dark Soccer and Loki join myself, Rob Roberts, here in studio every single week. But you guys join us in the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live at the Voice Geeks Network Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
545000	558000	If you are listening live, join us and chat live.vognetwork.com where Eric RPG was referring to Loki's review of Fuller House as Titty House. That's apparently what it is.
558000	562000	Like that first episode, and she also ends up naked in another episode as well.
562000	564000	She's not naked!
564000	570000	She is in a tub of tomato juice, not wearing any clothes.
570000	585000	DungeonBuster in chat says, waiting for Netflix to resurrect Airwolf and turn the helicopter into a drone. You know what, that seems to be the thing to do now is that 90 shows are like, they're not just being rebooted, they're just fucking coming back for a new season.
586000	588000	You know, Full House, you call these new seasons.
588000	589000	The X-Files?
589000	599000	X-Files was a thing, and by the way, if you've been watching X-Files, you gotta check out the TV reviews at vognetwork.com. Critical Myth and his team have been breaking down all those episodes.
599000	603000	Nice, cheap plug, right?
603000	611000	And Twin Peaks, which I'm so fucking excited about, is coming back. I'm so excited about the new Twin Peaks.
611000	614000	But yeah, what other shows would come back? How about Baywatch?
614000	617000	No, Northern Exposure should come back.
617000	622000	Okay, now did you catch this? I caught this when I was watching, it was actually one of the last episodes.
622000	625000	I'm only on like episode 3 of Full House.
625000	637000	Oh, okay, well, there's a part where they're talking about, like, it's Steve and DJ, they're going out on a date or something like that, and so he's like, yeah, I've got Atlantis playing in the car.
637000	644000	He's like, you'll never believe what that song is about. You know, it's hilarious, you know, in the context of the shows.
644000	645000	Yes.
645000	653000	Let's see, go into the chat, live.vognetwork.com, s2100matt says they are bringing back Baywatch. Get out, really?
653000	657000	But the Hoff's not gonna be in it. Pamela Anderson won't be in it, it won't be the same.
657000	665000	See, at least Twin Peaks actually has, you know, what's his name, I can't remember in the moment, Kyle McLaughlin. Thank you, Cooper.
665000	672000	Kyle McLaughlin's gonna be back in that. Full House has the original actors and actresses for better and for worse.
672000	680000	It's pretty, I don't know, it's pretty awesome. Anyway, I know you guys are here to hear us talk about video games, so we are gonna get into some game discussion tonight.
680000	686000	I do want to talk briefly, though, about the week off. We weren't here last week because I was in Washington, D.C.
686000	691000	I was at a convention that I think a lot of you on the East Coast know, but maybe not as many of you on the West Coast are aware of.
691000	697000	MagFest, a music and games fest, which took place in National Harbor, Maryland, over last weekend.
697000	702000	It was on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but Sunday was, like, done by two.
702000	708000	I have to be honest, I'm not sure why they bothered with Sunday, because there was very little that happened on Sunday, but I digress.
708000	715000	Overall, I had a great time at the convention. It was truly one of my favorite conventions that I've been to.
715000	719000	And Bobby and I talked about this a little bit on the throw call at the end of his episode.
719000	723000	He called it a festival. I call it a convention. I really don't...
723000	725000	It's a ConVestable.
725000	727000	It's a tomato, tomato thing to me.
727000	728000	ConVestable.
728000	732000	Yeah. My thing is, do people convene there? Yes, it's a convention.
732000	742000	But anyway, whatever you want to call it, it's a lot like Penny Arcade Expo without the commercialism that it's turned into and the exhibitors.
742000	750000	MAGFest is a celebration of games and the music that gaming has inspired, essentially.
750000	756000	You're not going to get cutting edge, like, you're not going to have Nintendo there announcing things.
756000	759000	You're not going to have Blizzard with a newly playable game.
759000	768000	About the newest thing that was there was Street Fighter V, because it had come out that Tuesday, so it was already in the console room for people to play against each other.
768000	771000	That's really it. But it was really otherwise a celebration of gaming.
771000	782000	They have a huge arcade room, and growing up on music games, being that this is what this show was started on all these years ago, I have to say, I was impressed.
782000	789000	I have never, and keep in mind, we used to drive to Los Angeles to go to Arcade Infinity back in the day.
789000	792000	I have never seen so many music games in one place.
792000	804000	That was very impressive. Just like 10 different DDR machines, Para Para, whatever the Dance Masters Connect thing that turned into in the arcade, that was there.
804000	810000	Neon FM, which I was like, oh my god, it is a real machine. I'd never seen one. There was Neon FM there.
810000	811000	Did you play it?
811000	818000	No, here's the weird thing. I didn't play a lot in the arcade, all things considered. I was busy doing other stuff.
818000	820000	I just thought you would play Neon FM just to try it.
820000	829000	There was a big line. There was a lot of lines for stuff. Really, I played the new DDR, but I just played an old song on it because I was so overwhelmed with the new song choices.
829000	836000	I was just like, well, I'm going to pick one I know. So I played Ecstasy, and I was like, I remember this song being a 7-footer, and now it's a 10?
836000	845000	I was like, alright, and I played it, and it was the same step chart, but adjusted for age because I was having an asthma attack practically by the end of it, but it was still a lot of fun.
845000	850000	Somebody snapped a picture of myself and Jonko from Koopa Club playing DDR, so that was that.
850000	857000	But then they had Killer Queen, which just always was swamped. They had some classic machines, too.
857000	862000	I couldn't get the Tron to work, though, which was kind of a bummer. I don't know what was going on with that, but they had a lot of classic games, too.
862000	871000	The arcade was very impressive, I will say that. But it's weird, even admittedly, that I didn't spend a lot of time in the arcade.
871000	877000	They had a great indie showcase. They had a ton of indie developers that were there showing off their game.
877000	885000	Our buddy YYR did end up with a space at the last minute. Somebody didn't show up. They were there on Friday, and then they didn't show up on Saturday, so he got the space.
885000	893000	I was kind of surprised, like, why wouldn't you come back? But, I don't know, for whatever the reason, hey, I'm happy for YYR, so he took that space and was showing some games the rest of the weekend.
893000	899000	But there was a lot of great indie stuff, and I got to play some things that I probably wouldn't have been aware of otherwise.
899000	901000	Did you just play multitasking?
901000	908000	I did play multitasking, and it is a lot of fun. It's on 360, and I'm going to give YYR this shout-out, because he's always been very supportive of OLR.
908000	919000	Multitasking is on Greenlight, and I really would love to see this get support. So please, we never ask for your money here at OLR, except to enlist in a charity thing or something.
919000	928000	But go to Greenlight, search for multitasking, and give it your vote so that YYR can get his game on Steam, because this game is really a lot of fun.
928000	934000	And I want to see him encouraged to keep developing it, and come up with more mini-games for it, and so forth.
934000	939000	So I know it got a really good response at MAGFest, so I really want to see him succeed.
939000	944000	So please take a moment to go to Greenlight, and just search for multitasking, and get that voted on there.
944000	950000	Somebody will have the link in chat shortly, I'm sure. Oh, thank you, S. Jonah. Already ahead of me, putting that link there.
951000	960000	Excellent. I did some panels, which were some good, some not so good, which you're going to come into at any convention.
960000	967000	You know I was really excited about the Clue VCR game thing, right? Because I remember that from the 80s, growing up and playing that.
967000	974000	I think the person running the tournament had never actually played the game, so that did feel a little bit disorganized, disjointed.
974000	980000	But, you know what, it takes a lot of guts to get up there in front of people and run something for prizes like that.
980000	986000	So I don't want to throw too much shade, but maybe two people could have done it next time, or I don't know.
986000	990000	And then the documentary about that was pretty good, too.
990000	999000	I did see a couple other panels. I saw the panel, it escapes me in the moment.
999000	1008000	There was another panel I saw that wasn't so good, and I'm not going to say what it was, but it was a topic that I was hoping to be more encouraged about.
1008000	1016000	But it was just a lot of in-jokes and things that felt a little bit stale to me. So I was just, I don't know, I was a little let down by that.
1016000	1024000	But yeah, I sound negative, but I'm really not. I actually had a really great time. A lot of great people, I met so many good people.
1024000	1031000	The music, what they had going on with the music was phenomenal. It was a great setup in the ballroom.
1031000	1039000	They had a stage A and a stage B, so that way while people were performing on one stage, the other stage could set up so they could keep going back and forth.
1039000	1050000	Like there was no break like you would expect at a concert. And I will say, the concert that really was just above and beyond amazing was Journey Live.
1050000	1058000	Austin Wintory was there actually directing an orchestra of people that were playing the soundtrack to Journey as somebody was playing Journey.
1058000	1068000	So what they did, they disabled the music and just had the sound effects in the game. And it was amazing. I maybe shed a manly tear or two.
1068000	1079000	I just thought it was so amazingly well done. That made the whole trip worth it, if nothing else. I thought Journey Live was worth the whole thing right there.
1079000	1088000	I was very pleasantly surprised when somebody showed up in the game. Apparently the Playstation 4 they were playing on was connected.
1088000	1093000	We all had a good laugh when a trophy was earned in the game. Everybody laughed because you don't expect that.
1093000	1099000	But then another player showed up. And it was not until the last chapter when another player showed up.
1099000	1112000	And it was just another moment of like, oh my gosh, they're online. And this person has no idea that they are playing Journey for the guy that wrote the music and a room of thousands of people.
1112000	1118000	I wonder how many Playstation messages that guy got when it was over. Or girl, who knows.
1119000	1128000	But I loved the Journey Live thing. That was awesome. I saw a couple other bands too. I saw the 1Ups, a little bit of that.
1128000	1137000	I saw I Fight Dragons was good. That was a fun show. But I was sick through a lot of the convention.
1137000	1141000	So it kind of killed my mood to like, oh, I want to jump around and be with a bunch of other people.
1141000	1150000	I had some sinus-y, gross, sore throat thing going on. Lucky me, I was sick. So if you got sick at MAGFest, sorry, it was probably me. I'm patient zero.
1150000	1158000	I really tried my best to not touch a lot of things and be sanitizer and all that stuff. But I didn't really want to totally ruin my convention either.
1158000	1167000	But I had a really good time. I will definitely try to go again next year. I hear the timing may be different next year. So we'll have to see how that all plays out.
1167000	1173000	But I had a really good time. I do hope though, I hope they are able to solve, I guess they had some major parking issues.
1173000	1180000	Since I flew in and took Lyft, it didn't really matter to me. I didn't notice any of the parking issues. But I guess they had some really bad parking issues.
1180000	1189000	And I do sort of think for a convention, okay, the hotel, gorgeous, gorgeous hotel. One of the best I've ever seen for a convention, period.
1189000	1198000	But not a lot of food options around. And I have a feeling because the hotel is so nice and has such expensive restaurants in it, they probably put the kibosh on a lot of the cheaper options.
1198000	1205000	But I really think that needs to be loosened up a little bit. Especially if you're going to get many more people at that convention.
1205000	1214000	Because you really have to either bring in your own food or buy something at CVS Pharmacy when they're open and make it last the day.
1215000	1221000	Because a lot of the places around there, they're good, but they're expensive. It's just not the type of thing you'd expect to eat at a convention.
1221000	1230000	Imagine if the only place you could eat was Ruth Chris Steakhouse. It's good, but you can't really eat every meal there.
1230000	1238000	So I hope they do have some more options. Maybe a few more food trucks and all that in the future. We'll see what happens with that.
1238000	1248000	I just found something on Steam, by the way. I went to go look up to vote on YYR's game. I found Bear Simulator.
1248000	1249000	Did you?
1249000	1254000	It's a game where you're a bear. That's it.
1254000	1255000	Why not?
1255000	1259000	I can't. I'm done.
1260000	1264000	Some folks in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com were talking about the Clue VCR game thing.
1264000	1268000	And SG100Matt pointing out, Rob yelled during the Clue VCR tournament,
1268000	1270000	Just accuse YOLO!
1270000	1274000	That did happen. Because it wasn't going to end.
1274000	1276000	And they were like, should we accuse? Should we accuse?
1276000	1279000	And I was like, just accuse, YOLO!
1279000	1283000	I was proud of myself. And Bobby and I were totally quoting the lines.
1283000	1287000	Keep in mind, the Clue VCR game, not the same thing as Clue the movie.
1288000	1291000	I am your singing telegram. Nope, that's the movie.
1291000	1294000	Which is phenomenal in itself, but that's not what this was.
1294000	1296000	This is the Clue VCR game.
1296000	1299000	I was never in Sumatra.
1299000	1301000	That whole type of thing.
1301000	1304000	Clue VCR game is quotable in its own cheesy way.
1304000	1307000	Raginator in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,
1307000	1310000	How did you like the East Coast winter weather while at MAGFest?
1310000	1313000	It was fine. I've had colder days in Sacramento.
1313000	1316000	I guess the weather treated me pretty good out there while I was there.
1316000	1321000	There was still some snow on the ground, but not just clumpy snow in different places.
1321000	1323000	Ermagerd snur.
1323000	1325000	Yeah, pretty much.
1325000	1327000	So, there you go. I had a good time at MAGFest.
1327000	1329000	Kudos to the organizers.
1329000	1332000	I heard there were some bumps in the roads with things like autographs and things like that.
1332000	1334000	But I honestly didn't notice any of it.
1334000	1336000	I had a really good time at the con.
1336000	1339000	I think as far as celebrating games, that is what happened.
1339000	1343000	And there was just a lot to see and do and a great crowd.
1343000	1346000	But really, the Colossus yell might be kind of done.
1346000	1350000	It's time for a new thing, I think.
1350000	1352000	That's the only negative thing I can say about the crowd.
1352000	1354000	What's the Colossus yell?
1354000	1356000	It's from the old X-Men game.
1356000	1360000	Like it just gets louder and louder as everybody in the room does it.
1360000	1362000	And I'm just like, OK, stop.
1362000	1366000	It was funny the first night. Please stop it.
1366000	1369000	So, there you go.
1369000	1371000	Alright, that was MAGFest.
1371000	1373000	So, we're going to talk about our gaming weeks.
1373000	1378000	But real quick, I wanted to talk about the Pokemon birthday that happened over the weekend.
1378000	1382000	Pokemon turned 20 years old over the weekend, you guys.
1382000	1385000	I don't know if that makes you feel old. It makes me feel a little old.
1385000	1390000	Because I remember when the Pokemon anime was first coming stateside and watching all those.
1390000	1394000	I was more into the anime than the video game, which is a weird thing for me to say.
1394000	1396000	That never happens, but it did with Pokemon.
1396000	1398000	We went to the theater to see the movie.
1398000	1400000	Me too. We were the only people in the theater.
1400000	1401000	You and I went.
1401000	1404000	Not for the first movie. That was me and Precious.
1404000	1406000	We went and saw the second or third one together.
1406000	1408000	Yeah, it was one of the other ones, but you and I went.
1408000	1410000	We did. I think we saw the third one together.
1410000	1412000	Yeah.
1412000	1414000	But, yeah.
1414000	1415000	I don't remember what happened in it.
1415000	1416000	How do you feel? Neither do I.
1416000	1418000	Apparently, they were all streaming on Twitch yesterday.
1418000	1423000	They had like, instead of Twitch Plays Pokemon, they had a Twitch Watches Pokemon.
1423000	1425000	And so, it was kind of like the Bob Ross thing.
1425000	1428000	It was just, we're going to have a marathon with the chat.
1428000	1431000	And so, I only caught it at the tail end.
1431000	1433000	So, unfortunately, you get to watch a lot of it.
1433000	1435000	But, I guess they did like all the movies back to back to back.
1435000	1438000	And I was kind of surprised that they had the rights to do that.
1438000	1442000	But, at the same time, you know, those movies are very old at this point.
1442000	1444000	So, I guess it's no big deal.
1444000	1448000	I still like Digimon better to this day.
1448000	1450000	Yeah.
1450000	1454000	Well, I mean, as far as anime goes, I think Digimon had a better plot.
1455000	1458000	I just want to quickly mention here in the chat because
1458000	1461000	S.G.O. and Hunter Matt is trying to explain the whole Colossus yell.
1461000	1466000	The story is that one of the original Magfests, the arcade room, had four X-Men arcade machines.
1466000	1469000	That was a huge thing at the time and the audio was pumped up.
1469000	1472000	So, whenever Colossus used his super, you would get the roar.
1472000	1474000	It happened so much, it became a thing.
1474000	1478000	Alright, well, we have new arcade games to make things of.
1478000	1479000	I'm just saying. I'm just saying.
1479000	1481000	Maybe I'm old. Get off my lawn. I don't know.
1481000	1483000	Anyway, Pokemon.
1483000	1488000	Dark Star, do you have a favorite Pokemon out of the, what, 700 that there are now?
1488000	1490000	Do you have a favorite out of all the Pokemon?
1494000	1497000	It's a toss-up because I really like Raichu.
1497000	1499000	But, I'd probably say Eevee.
1499000	1502000	Actually, no, no, no. What's the one?
1502000	1504000	Ninetales.
1504000	1506000	Vulpix?
1506000	1508000	Whichever one has the Ninetales.
1508000	1509000	I think that's Vulpix.
1509000	1511000	No, I think there is one called Ninetales.
1511000	1512000	Is there one called Ninetales? Okay.
1512000	1515000	Because, oh, hold on. Now I have to look.
1515000	1518000	Just because it's adorable? That's the reason why I like it the most?
1518000	1519000	No, because I love Kitsune.
1519000	1522000	Oh, no, Act F does say there is one named Ninetales.
1522000	1525000	Yeah, which is based off of Kitsune.
1525000	1526000	Okay.
1526000	1528000	Which is a fox with Ninetales.
1528000	1529000	Alright.
1529000	1530000	And I like mythology.
1530000	1533000	I'll have to Google the picture because I'm not thinking it off the top of my head.
1533000	1534000	I'll find it for you.
1534000	1537000	My favorite Pokemon, I'm going to go with a classic.
1537000	1541000	I'm going to go with one that's kind of mainstream, but I don't give a shit because she's my favorite.
1541000	1543000	Jigglypuff is my favorite Pokemon.
1543000	1547000	And that all is about the anime and how when people fell asleep she would draw on their face with a marker
1547000	1551000	because she would sing, they'd fall asleep, she'd get really pissed off that people were sleeping,
1551000	1553000	so she'd draw on their face with a marker.
1553000	1554000	I always love that.
1554000	1557000	So Jigglypuff is by far my favorite Pokemon.
1557000	1559000	But there's other ones I love too.
1559000	1561000	What about you, Loki? Favorite Pokemon?
1561000	1563000	Come on, I'm dying to know.
1563000	1566000	I don't watch Pokemon, but my favorite Pokemon has to be Gendo.
1566000	1567000	Gendo.
1569000	1570000	I like that.
1570000	1571000	It's Gendo.
1573000	1578000	Have you ever seen the Evangelion parody that came from?
1578000	1580000	Yes, that's where I referenced that from.
1580000	1582000	Oh, that's right. I freaking love that whole thing.
1582000	1587000	Act F is pointing out that Ninetales is a Vulpix evolution, so I was close.
1587000	1588000	I was very close.
1588000	1590000	Here's your dang picture, Rab.
1591000	1594000	What was the first Pokemon game you ever played, Darcyra?
1595000	1596000	Red?
1596000	1597000	Red.
1597000	1599000	Dan played red, I played blue.
1599000	1602000	Mine was actually yellow. I didn't get into it until after the anime.
1602000	1609000	And I had the little Game Boy color that was a little cheek for Pikachu.
1609000	1613000	So when you turned it on, the little cheek lit up red. It was adorable.
1613000	1614000	I'm just saying.
1614000	1616000	I had the little Pikachu walker.
1616000	1622000	The yellow one where he'd bop around on the screen and you could feed him.
1622000	1625000	And he was like the Digimon Tamagotchi knockoff.
1625000	1629000	Because Digimon and Tamagotchi came out first.
1629000	1631000	So are they coming up with any new Pokemon?
1631000	1634000	Because it seems like they only come up with a couple new ones each time a new game comes out.
1634000	1636000	Like actual new Pokemon?
1636000	1637000	Yeah.
1637000	1640000	Well, I think we're going to get into the games they announced this week in a little bit here.
1640000	1643000	And I'm pretty sure that's going to come with a new series of Pokemon.
1643000	1645000	Like when X and Y came out, they had new Pokemon in them.
1645000	1648000	So each new generation does have new ones in it.
1649000	1652000	So I'm sure whatever comes with the new generation will have stuff too.
1652000	1654000	And don't forget, we have Pokemon Go coming up soon.
1654000	1658000	Dear Tigerclaw, Digimon is not a clone of Pokemon.
1658000	1661000	Digimon came out. No, no. Here's your thing.
1661000	1664000	Tamagotchi led to Digimon come out.
1664000	1667000	Because it's made by the same company.
1667000	1671000	Digimon was a versus version of Tamagotchi.
1671000	1674000	And the anime came out after all that came out.
1674000	1678000	So learn your history when it comes to Digimon.
1678000	1680000	Mic drop.
1682000	1683000	Isn't that interesting?
1683000	1690000	You know, that's almost like a moment of Beatmania 2DX just ripped off Guitar Hero.
1690000	1694000	Remember that whole review that was on, what, X-Play or something?
1694000	1697000	And where all of us that knew better about what had happened in Japan are sitting here going,
1697000	1699000	Fuck off!
1699000	1700000	You know, and that whole thing.
1700000	1703000	So people here in the States probably didn't know any better.
1703000	1709000	Do you think it's possible that maybe Digimon was brought over here to the US because of Pokemon's success?
1709000	1711000	I mean, would maybe that be a fair thing to say?
1711000	1713000	No, because we had Tamagotchi.
1713000	1714000	Yeah, that's true.
1714000	1722000	I mean, think about it. The whole Digimon anime might have come about because of the Pokemon anime.
1722000	1727000	But Digimon was a completely different thing.
1728000	1733000	It never existed as a game until much later, until after the anime had been out.
1733000	1734000	I see.
1734000	1736000	As if memory serves me right.
1736000	1741000	And on top of that, I've got one of the WonderSwan games and a couple of the PlayStation ones.
1741000	1746000	And I liked the PlayStation one because it was actually a full battler and everything, a couple of them.
1748000	1752000	But no, they had completely different evolutions.
1752000	1754000	The movie was pretty terrible though.
1754000	1758000	It actually was really good if you watched the Japanese one.
1758000	1761000	No, I only saw the US movie.
1761000	1764000	I've actually got both of the movies. They're really good.
1766000	1768000	Rama in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,
1768000	1770000	In Before Monster Rancher.
1772000	1777000	Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of things we have been playing this week.
1777000	1779000	Pokemon or no? Who knows? We're going to see.
1779000	1781000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1782000	1785000	Come to think of it, I never did see the US one.
1785000	1787000	I don't think.
1787000	1789000	You're probably better off, let's be real.
1789000	1792000	Yeah, because I imported them. Never mind.
1792000	1797000	Anyway, my gaming week. I got Danganronpa, finally.
1797000	1802000	Which I can play on my Mac. I'm happy because then I can take it to work and look at the weirdness.
1802000	1804000	God, that game is freaky.
1804000	1809000	And I love it. I love it so much because it's so fucked up.
1809000	1815000	It's like someone took the formula for Phoenix Wright and made a really fucked up story.
1815000	1817000	And I love it. It's great.
1817000	1822000	Also, I want a plushie of Monokuma. So, end of story.
1822000	1825000	I also played some Dragon Age Inquisition.
1825000	1828000	I haven't touched any more Dragon's Dogma.
1828000	1831000	I played some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.
1831000	1835000	A crapload of Heroes of Dragon Age.
1835000	1841000	And Neko Atsume. Which isn't really a game so much as just collecting cats.
1841000	1844000	But I got Guy Furi today.
1844000	1847000	And I got, like, the Cat Maid Girl.
1847000	1850000	I have not played that game. It's on my phone, ready to go.
1850000	1851000	Rob!
1851000	1852000	I know, I haven't played it. I'm so uncool.
1852000	1853000	Rob!
1853000	1854000	What?
1854000	1856000	But there's so many kitties.
1856000	1857000	Yeah, I know.
1857000	1858000	And you see their little buttholes.
1858000	1860000	Yes, I'm aware.
1860000	1863000	I know it's called Neko Atsume or whatever, but it's really kitty butthole.
1863000	1864000	It's really cat butthole.
1864000	1866000	It's really cat butthole simulator. That's what it is.
1866000	1869000	It should be called, what, Nekoshiri.
1871000	1875000	So, cat butt. There you go. Cat butts the game.
1875000	1878000	Alright. Is that it for your gaming week? Cat butts?
1878000	1879000	Cat butts.
1879000	1881000	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
1881000	1882000	I mainly just...
1882000	1883000	Ingress.
1883000	1884000	Ingress.
1884000	1885000	That's a good one.
1885000	1886000	I guess that's what I'm saying.
1886000	1887000	That's alright.
1887000	1891000	I mainly just played Lego Avengers.
1891000	1897000	Just to unlock more stuff than that because my son keeps bitching about how he doesn't have enough characters to play.
1897000	1900000	Most of them are just kind of repeats of each other, but whatever.
1900000	1903000	So I'm almost done with that.
1903000	1910000	I've unlocked all the characters that are in all the other hub worlds except for Manhattan because that's the largest one.
1910000	1914000	And then I've gone through most of the levels as well.
1914000	1917000	So that's just a matter of just finishing it.
1917000	1924000	I bought the season pass for Fallout 4 because that's going to be going up in price here pretty soon and the DLC looks pretty awesome.
1924000	1930000	So hopefully they'll check out in a few weeks. I think it's when the next piece of DLC comes out.
1930000	1946000	And then, aside from that, I've been trying to program stuff and using Unity 5 and liking that it's using Microsoft Visual Studio instead of stupid other programs.
1946000	1951000	Yeah, I think I've known that in Ingress a little bit.
1951000	1954000	I've been mainly just to and from work, but I haven't really had a lot of time.
1954000	1957000	I played a little bit on the way here though.
1957000	1959000	There wasn't much for me to do though.
1959000	1964000	I was going to take down a few fields and one of them I got to, someone already beat me to it by a few seconds.
1964000	1969000	And then the other one I took down, but it's not anywhere near me.
1969000	1970000	But whatever, I did it.
1970000	1973000	And that was it. I'm running out of gear again.
1974000	1979000	Alright, we'll get our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1979000	1984000	Act F is calling Nico Atsume the take pics of cat butts the game.
1984000	1985000	Here it is.
1985000	1989000	Seattle in chat is wondering what the fuck ever happened to Monster Rancher. That's a good question.
1989000	1992000	I don't know, it was pretty awesome though.
1992000	1995000	Pokemon killed them all. That was it, the end.
1995000	1997000	My gaming week.
1997000	1999000	Well, since I had a flight I got to do some handheld gaming.
1999000	2005000	So I played some more Final Fantasy Monster Rancher basically and played that.
2005000	2010000	And that was good. I finally got the stupid Summoning Case.
2010000	2013000	That mission is the hardest because it's half luck based.
2013000	2016000	But finally once I got past that I was able to do some more missions.
2016000	2017000	That was fun.
2017000	2020000	At MAGFest I did some local co-op with some friends.
2020000	2022000	That was really fun that we got to do that.
2022000	2023000	So yeah, that was fun.
2023000	2025000	So I got to explore that a little bit.
2025000	2026000	Pun intended.
2026000	2027000	A little more this week.
2027000	2032000	Also, I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV because there was a patch this week.
2032000	2037000	So a pretty major patch hit Final Fantasy XIV and it adds more story.
2037000	2039000	There's two more dungeons.
2039000	2040000	There's a new raid.
2040000	2041000	There's a new Primal fight.
2041000	2046000	So there's really a lot of content that was sort of badly needed.
2046000	2049000	So I'm really glad that they've been addressing the content drought.
2049000	2053000	So I'm hoping they can keep the inertia going into their inevitable next expansion.
2053000	2057000	Since we know that Square is doing another Fan Fest this year for Final Fantasy XIV,
2057000	2061000	we know there's going to be expansion at some point probably in the next year.
2061000	2066000	So hopefully they can keep the inertia going because there's a lot of great stuff in XIV still.
2066000	2073000	It's just people that were playing it aggressively had a long time to wait for anything new.
2073000	2076000	So I'm glad that they're finally on top of that again.
2076000	2078000	And they're shutting down 11 for consoles next month.
2078000	2079000	They are.
2079000	2081000	I got the email about that and the little reminder.
2081000	2082000	It made me a little sad.
2082000	2083000	I was like, oh, good times.
2083000	2087000	So yeah, Final Fantasy XI no longer on consoles as of next month.
2087000	2089000	Don't they still be bringing up the phones or something at some point?
2089000	2093000	That's supposed to be the thing is that somehow it's going to be on phones, but it'll still be on PC.
2093000	2095000	The game is not shutting down.
2095000	2096000	PC will still be out there.
2096000	2104000	And honestly, hopefully that will be better for the game because maybe they can do some graphic upgrades and release that on PC.
2104000	2107000	But then again, supposedly development has stopped on 11.
2107000	2110000	They're not going to do more expansions or anything like that.
2110000	2111000	So I don't know.
2111000	2114000	Well, you know, with the phone market being largely free to play.
2114000	2116000	Yeah, good luck with that.
2116000	2117000	Good luck with that.
2117000	2118000	Dream on.
2118000	2119000	We'll see.
2119000	2130000	Speaking of Final Fantasy XIV in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, please no read in chat says that reminds me of Final Fantasy XIV and the Power Man 5000 controversy.
2130000	2136000	Yeah, I haven't done the new fight myself, but I did watch a YouTube that has the music in it.
2137000	2139000	Okay, so the music in XIV is badass.
2139000	2143000	And a lot of it is very themed for different fights.
2143000	2146000	Like the Titan song is this rock song.
2146000	2147000	Get it, rock?
2147000	2152000	But it's like an awesome little rock song that plays really fast.
2152000	2155000	It kind of goes like that.
2155000	2156000	It's great.
2156000	2162000	And then when you fight Ravana, which is one of the newer bosses, it's like a Russian waltz that plays during it.
2162000	2163000	It's really cool.
2163000	2171000	Well, for this new one, Separat, not Separat, Separat is the new primal or whatever that they have in it.
2171000	2173000	And it has nothing to do with Separat.
2173000	2175000	It's like a world tree or something as you fight.
2175000	2177000	I believe Separat was an Esper in VI.
2177000	2179000	I could be wrong, but I think that was the thing.
2179000	2183000	But anyway, the music during the second phase of the fight is industrial.
2183000	2188000	So it's like a Nine Inch Nails sounding song or like, you know, stabbing westward in the 90s or whatever.
2188000	2201000	Or I guess if you're the lead singer of Power Man 5000, you kind of think, you know, the first minute of the song sounds an awful like When Worlds Collide, which was their one hit they had in the 90s.
2201000	2203000	So I don't know.
2203000	2205000	I mean, I don't know.
2205000	2210000	I guess they're a little similar, but a lot of industrial music has similar openings.
2210000	2211000	I don't know.
2211000	2213000	I think it was a big mountain out of a molehill.
2213000	2215000	And that guy posted that thing.
2215000	2220000	And then, of course, the Final Fantasy fandom attacked his Facebook like, you ignorant bastard, blah, blah, blah.
2220000	2222000	And then, you know, I don't know.
2222000	2224000	So it was a little weird.
2224000	2229000	SG100Matt says, wow, didn't think Power Man 5000 would be mentioned in the news.
2229000	2231000	Yep, that was a thing that happened this week.
2231000	2232000	Go check that.
2232000	2233000	Check out his Facebook page.
2233000	2234000	It happened.
2234000	2235000	Anyway.
2235000	2238000	So also, one other thing.
2238000	2239000	This is very important.
2239000	2241000	A lot of you have been waiting for this.
2241000	2244000	So there was some maintenance on 14.
2244000	2248000	I couldn't play every day this week because, you know, when there's new patches, there's always going to be some maintenance.
2248000	2250000	So I was like, what do I play tonight?
2250000	2251000	I need to find a game to play.
2251000	2253000	So I was like, let's catch up on the Steam backlog.
2253000	2257000	So I finally played Undertale.
2257000	2258000	That's right.
2258000	2261000	Finally, after all this time, I finally installed and played Undertale.
2261000	2265000	Boy, did it take me a minute to figure out why the fucking thing wouldn't launch.
2265000	2268000	I had the big, like, I kept launching it and it was just automatically closed.
2268000	2269000	Launch, closed.
2269000	2270000	Launch, closed.
2270000	2271000	I was like, what the hell?
2271000	2273000	Like, I'm not able to play this game.
2273000	2274000	I don't understand.
2274000	2279000	Well, apparently, you cannot use the Steam beta and play Undertale.
2279000	2283000	You have to drop out of the beta, install the regular client, and then you can play Undertale.
2283000	2284000	Really?
2284000	2285000	Yeah, that was weird.
2285000	2287000	I'm running the beta and I've been playing it.
2287000	2289000	Maybe it depends on your system or something.
2289000	2290000	But that was the trick.
2290000	2293000	Once I dropped out of the beta, it worked fine.
2293000	2294000	Weird, right?
2294000	2295000	Very weird.
2295000	2299000	But finally, once I figured that out, I'm not going to totally hold that against the game.
2299000	2301000	It was just a weird, frustrating thing.
2301000	2307000	But once I got into the game, I played through the prologue and a little past that, right?
2307000	2310000	You know, there's a whole, like, for those that play the game, there's a whole little opening sequence.
2310000	2313000	And then you get the official Undertale.
2313000	2315000	And then there's a little more that happens after that.
2315000	2322000	I can really best define my reaction to Undertale with a classic meme.
2322000	2324000	And that would be the What Lady.
2324000	2331000	Yes, that's the, if you just put what, w-a-t lady into Google, that was me playing Undertale.
2331000	2340000	And that's the infamous older lady that may or may not have teeth looking into the lens who's wearing some big blue muumuu and it just says what underneath it.
2340000	2342000	And that was me playing Undertale.
2342000	2347000	That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the whole time I was like, what?
2347000	2350000	But I can see why this game has its fans.
2350000	2357000	Right from the very beginning, there's a little scene with a flower and it's like, I'm a happy flower that's gonna help you on your adventure.
2357000	2362000	And then the flower goes, and I want you to die! Die, die, die!
2362000	2366000	And all this crazy stuff and it turns into a mean face and so forth.
2366000	2369000	I will say, the writing is pretty witty.
2369000	2381000	And there's just, like, it's got this very ironically underbelly of this really dark stuff on top of the fluffy surface.
2381000	2386000	Like, what do I mean by that? The big character that's with you in the prologue, what's her name?
2386000	2388000	The character that is just like a mother?
2388000	2389000	Toriel.
2389000	2390000	Toriel?
2390000	2391000	Toriel.
2391000	2395000	Toriel. You can even call her mom if you want.
2395000	2397000	You can also kill her.
2397000	2401000	You can! But that's the one thing about Undertale that's been spoiled for me.
2401000	2406000	And if you want zero spoilers, mute real quick, give me 30 seconds.
2406000	2415000	Okay, the one thing that's been spoiled for me is the fact that you can play completely passively or you can play kill everything, basically.
2415000	2416000	Or you can play middle of the road.
2416000	2417000	Or you can play middle of the road.
2417000	2420000	Which is always recommended, play middle of the road to start.
2420000	2425000	But knowing in the back of my mind that passive is a thing that you can do, that's how I've been playing it so far.
2425000	2428000	So I've been trying to chat everything to death, basically.
2428000	2439000	Which is interesting. I will say, to Undertale's credit, I like that the battle system is something a little different than just fight, run, walk, that whole thing.
2439000	2441000	Yet it still feels old school.
2442000	2451000	You have this little dot and you want to avoid all the other dots.
2451000	2456000	What do you call that in gaming? It's just collision detection, basically.
2456000	2458000	The whole battle system is collision detection.
2458000	2462000	You might be fighting a boss and all these pickles or something fly at you.
2462000	2466000	But the green one will restore health if you can grab it, but all the others are bad.
2466000	2470000	I thought it was a neat little twist on the classic RPG engine.
2470000	2476000	Yeah, I understand why people are super into Undertale.
2476000	2478000	Because it's kind of fucked up.
2478000	2481000	But like, you know, in a fun way.
2481000	2482000	So, there you go.
2482000	2485000	Act F'ed is explaining the joke that I didn't catch.
2485000	2489000	Her name is Toriel because, get it, two Toriel.
2493000	2496000	And that sums up Undertale perfectly.
2496000	2499000	That joke sums up the Undertale experience perfectly.
2499000	2501000	But I had fun with it.
2502000	2504000	Let's see. PleaseNoReadInChat says,
2504000	2508000	I hit on Toriel first, then did the ass to call her mom.
2508000	2510000	She thinks I'm weird.
2512000	2513000	I wonder why.
2513000	2519000	I'm just irritated that two of my favorite characters so far in Danganronpa,
2519000	2521000	their fates aren't even spoiled for me.
2521000	2522000	Aww.
2522000	2526000	Which is fine because I kind of expected it because I don't take anything for granted.
2526000	2531000	But still, I actually liked Sakura in that game, and I like Mondo.
2532000	2533000	Pissed off.
2533000	2534000	No spoilers.
2534000	2536000	No spoilers. People already know anyway.
2536000	2538000	Alright. Anyway, so that was my gaming week.
2538000	2542000	I played mostly Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy Explorers while traveling,
2542000	2545000	and then a little bit of Undertale just to finally be like,
2545000	2547000	okay, I did it. You can stop sending the emails.
2547000	2551000	But I enjoyed Undertale enough that I definitely want to play more.
2551000	2553000	So, yeah.
2553000	2556000	But even if my expression the whole time was,
2556000	2558000	what in the hell?
2560000	2562000	Loki, do you think you're going to play Undertale at some point?
2562000	2563000	Eh, probably not.
2563000	2566000	That's like asking if I'm going to play any of my scene backlog.
2568000	2569000	Eh, probably not.
2569000	2571000	Does it mean I'm going to stop playing games?
2571000	2573000	No, it doesn't.
2573000	2576000	Alright, so some quick housekeeping here real quick.
2576000	2578000	Hey, speaking of Magfest, I gotta pimp this.
2578000	2581000	So even though I was sick as a dog on Saturday at Magfest,
2581000	2584000	we did some videos in the Indie Hall,
2584000	2586000	and the first two are up on our YouTube channel.
2586000	2588000	Just look for VOG Network on YouTube,
2588000	2591000	and you can actually see some interviews that we did at Magfest.
2591000	2596000	We did an interview with YYR about the games he's making like multitasking.
2596000	2600000	We also just completely discovered this game we thought was kind of cool
2600000	2602000	called That Rock Paper Scissors Game,
2602000	2604000	where it's a three-player game,
2604000	2606000	and one person plays rock, another paper, another scissors,
2606000	2608000	and you chase each other basically around a big map.
2608000	2610000	It's kind of a silly, simple concept, but it works really well.
2610000	2613000	Like, who doesn't like those types of multiplayer or living room games?
2613000	2615000	So we interviewed those guys as well.
2615000	2616000	Bobby talked to them.
2616000	2618000	Those videos are up on YouTube, and I just gotta give props to Bobby.
2618000	2622000	Like, he edited those videos, and he put them together really slick.
2622000	2625000	I was like, wow, this looks like something that...
2625000	2627000	This looks like...
2627000	2629000	Legit!
2629000	2631000	Sounds silly to be saying that, but it's how I felt.
2631000	2634000	So check those videos out over at the VOG Network YouTube.
2635000	2637000	I know we were not here last week,
2637000	2640000	and so I hate to say that we're going to be having another missing show,
2640000	2645000	but, you know, I have a life and things that I like to do too.
2645000	2647000	So we do have our next no-show weekend.
2647000	2649000	It's going to be April 3rd.
2649000	2651000	I will not be here on April 3rd.
2651000	2653000	Sorry, Loki, I'm probably surprising you with this.
2653000	2655000	I told her earlier, but I will not be here April 3rd,
2655000	2657000	but get this.
2657000	2659000	You'll get a kick out of this, Loki.
2659000	2661000	Do you know why I won't be here?
2661000	2663000	And I'm not coming back.
2663000	2665000	I'm going to Tucson, the first, second, and third.
2667000	2669000	You're going to laugh.
2669000	2671000	Disneyland?
2671000	2673000	No, I'm not going to Disneyland.
2673000	2675000	I'm going to Tucson.
2675000	2677000	You know what's in Tucson?
2677000	2679000	Racist!
2679000	2681000	Well, every city has those, but...
2681000	2683000	Well, I have friends that live in Tucson.
2683000	2685000	That's very important.
2685000	2687000	I have some friends in Tucson that I'm going to go visit and say hello to,
2687000	2690000	but then I'm also going to do an Ingress anomaly that's on that Saturday,
2690000	2692000	the second in Tucson.
2692000	2694000	Go to the Special K's.
2694000	2695000	What?
2695000	2697000	Go to the Special K's.
2697000	2699000	Is that close to the Phoenix area?
2699000	2701000	Oh, the Circle K's or whatever?
2701000	2703000	Yeah, it's like two hours outside Phoenix.
2703000	2705000	I'll get the codes or whatever.
2705000	2707000	I don't have to do that. It'll be fun.
2707000	2709000	Our Circle K's gave out codes.
2709000	2711000	I'm going to actually go shop there.
2711000	2713000	I'm going to be going to Tucson in a few weeks
2713000	2715000	and visiting some friends that are there
2715000	2717000	and doing the Ingress anomaly, and I'm looking forward to that,
2717000	2719000	so that'll be fun.
2719000	2721000	I'm allowed to take a vacation once in a while,
2721000	2723000	such as life.
2723000	2725000	I don't think you just had an anomaly there.
2725000	2727000	In Tucson? No, I don't think so.
2727000	2729000	Maybe it was in Phoenix, I'm thinking.
2729000	2731000	I thought they just did that because that's why they have the codes there now.
2731000	2733000	No, I don't know.
2733000	2735000	I don't think it was there. Maybe it was in Phoenix.
2735000	2737000	Bobby Blackwolf is asking,
2737000	2739000	Tucson, like an Earthbound convention?
2739000	2741000	They do have that.
2741000	2743000	Earthbound convention is in Tucson,
2743000	2745000	but sadly, I think that's in the summer
2745000	2747000	and I'm not going the right weekend to see that.
2747000	2749000	So, there you go.
2750000	2752000	Alright.
2752000	2754000	Let's move on
2754000	2756000	and get into this week's news.
2756000	2758000	I think it's time. You guys have been waiting for it. Loki.
2758000	2760000	Holy crap, they announced
2760000	2762000	Pokemon Sun and Moon, and it's coming
2762000	2764000	this holiday, and I cannot be more excited
2764000	2766000	about this.
2766000	2768000	Actually, I'm not, because I don't play Pokemon, but
2768000	2770000	it's pretty exciting for everybody else that plays
2770000	2772000	Pokemon, and this is part of their
2772000	2774000	Pokemon Nintendo Direct,
2774000	2776000	and of course,
2776000	2778000	you know, showing off that there's going to be
2778000	2780000	some more products based off that coming out,
2780000	2782000	as well as like trading cards, plus toys, all that
2782000	2784000	fun stuff. You know, the usual
2784000	2786000	marketing stuff, and
2786000	2788000	yeah. So,
2788000	2790000	it'll be coming out, not really sure yet,
2790000	2792000	but holiday sometime.
2794000	2796000	And that would be on the 3DS.
2796000	2798000	Are you
2798000	2800000	pre-ordering Sun and Moon,
2800000	2802000	Loki? Yes, I'll pre-order
2802000	2804000	that for my 3DS I don't have.
2804000	2806000	That sounds like a perfect idea. Hey, that'd be totally
2806000	2808000	awesome. Let me invest the money in a 3DS
2808000	2810000	for them to, you know, put out the
2810000	2812000	NX, which will totally,
2812000	2814000	you know, just like, hey, it's cool, we
2814000	2816000	got a Wii U now, we can get the new Zelda game,
2816000	2818000	except that they're maybe
2818000	2820000	putting out another system. To Nintendo's
2820000	2822000	credit, they're pretty good about the
2822000	2824000	backwards compatible thing, though. If they do put out a
2824000	2826000	new handheld, it'll probably play the 3DS
2826000	2828000	games. I don't think they would put
2828000	2830000	all this effort into a new Pokemon game,
2830000	2832000	just to instantly antiquate it,
2832000	2834000	you know, the same season, if NX
2834000	2836000	is out this holiday. Now, that's the thing, is this
2836000	2838000	a game that only runs on the new 3DS,
2838000	2840000	or is this just, like, 3DS?
2840000	2842000	They haven't said, which is, um,
2842000	2844000	that could be peculiar, we'll see.
2844000	2846000	I hope they don't limit it to the new 3DS,
2846000	2848000	because that'll lock
2848000	2850000	me out, because... Sorry, you can only get 10
2850000	2852000	Pokemon on the 3DS versions of the game.
2852000	2854000	I'm not gonna buy a new 3DS if a
2854000	2856000	NX is just around the corner.
2856000	2858000	I'm gonna wait till after 3DS.
2858000	2860000	The new 3DS seems like the DSI to me.
2860000	2862000	It's, like, kind of unnecessary.
2862000	2864000	Which is, I mean, it's fine, they can do
2864000	2866000	an upgrade of the system for the people that still haven't come on
2866000	2868000	board or whatever, or the real diehards
2868000	2870000	who must have the new technology, but I don't,
2870000	2872000	you know, there's no game on
2872000	2874000	the new 3DS that I want to play
2874000	2876000	that's exclusive to that. They have,
2876000	2878000	yes, I know there's Xenoblade, but I can play that on Wii.
2878000	2880000	And there was, what, one other game, I think?
2880000	2882000	So, there's really
2882000	2884000	nothing that I need the new 3DS for.
2884000	2886000	Let me just drop some of the prices of the first-party Wii U
2886000	2888000	games. Please.
2888000	2890000	Anyway,
2890000	2892000	I'll check out
2892000	2894000	Pokemon Moon. I like Pokemon Moon
2894000	2896000	because it makes me think of butts. So, there you go.
2896000	2898000	Darsakha, would you play
2898000	2900000	Pokemon Moon because butts?
2900000	2902000	Probably not.
2902000	2904000	I haven't played, honestly,
2904000	2906000	to be serious, I haven't played any
2906000	2908000	Pokemon games in ages.
2908000	2910000	I didn't think X and Y were that bad.
2910000	2912000	It was a very different, like, look for the series,
2912000	2914000	but I thought the battles were kind of interesting.
2914000	2916000	The fact that they were able to
2916000	2918000	modernize it a bit. So, I'm curious how they might take that
2918000	2920000	a step further for Sun and Moon. So, we'll see.
2920000	2922000	Anyhow, Nintendo
2922000	2924000	also this week
2924000	2926000	released a fiscal year update
2926000	2928000	revising their
2928000	2930000	fiscal year projections for the year
2930000	2932000	ending March 31st.
2932000	2934000	Because, you know, fiscal years run like
2934000	2936000	April to April. They don't start
2936000	2938000	like the way the calendar does.
2938000	2940000	They have scaled back the sales and profit
2940000	2942000	expectations, as well as
2942000	2944000	projections for 3DS sales.
2944000	2946000	This is because the holiday quarter had
2946000	2948000	a drop in profits.
2948000	2950000	They fell short of their 3DS
2950000	2952000	goal of 7.6 million units
2952000	2954000	sold by 1 million.
2954000	2956000	It also says the
2956000	2958000	software shortfall of 9 million
2958000	2960000	down to 47 million units.
2960000	2962000	So, unfortunately, the
2962000	2964000	DS projections, it didn't go
2964000	2966000	as good as they'd hoped.
2966000	2968000	They did, though, admittedly
2968000	2970000	highballed. I seem to remember discussing this when it first
2970000	2972000	came out, and I remember thinking, like,
2972000	2974000	the DS projections were kind of highballed
2974000	2976000	to begin with. Interestingly enough,
2976000	2978000	though, Wii U projections were
2978000	2980000	unchanged. So,
2980000	2982000	that's, you know, the Wii U,
2982000	2984000	you know, didn't underperform
2984000	2986000	or anything like that.
2986000	2988000	Amiibo sales were still strong, however,
2988000	2990000	but the operating income and profit
2990000	2992000	projections did have to be lowered.
2992000	2994000	The upcoming fiscal year will
2994000	2996000	include things like Star Fox Zero,
2996000	2998000	The Legend of Zelda for Wii U, Bravely
2998000	3000000	Second, and two Dragon Quest ports.
3000000	3002000	Of course, this could also mean
3002000	3004000	the NX,
3004000	3006000	but we won't know any of that
3006000	3008000	details until after E3.
3008000	3010000	So, alright.
3010000	3012000	Let's move on. DarkSakura.
3012000	3014000	Well,
3014000	3016000	Ubisoft has taken
3016000	3018000	some crap
3018000	3020000	for reasons. However, now
3020000	3022000	they are looking to be acquired by
3022000	3024000	Vivendi, I'm sure.
3024000	3026000	Yeah, I know.
3026000	3028000	I kind of laugh, too.
3028000	3030000	So, basically,
3030000	3032000	what happened is that Vivendi purchased
3032000	3034000	140 million euros
3034000	3036000	worth of shares in Ubisoft,
3036000	3038000	which brings their stake in the company
3038000	3040000	up to 10.39%,
3040000	3042000	and so the CEO
3042000	3044000	of Ubisoft calls this an unwelcome
3044000	3046000	move, and wants
3046000	3048000	to retain its independence from
3048000	3050000	what could be a hostile takeover.
3050000	3052000	So, they have
3052000	3054000	approached
3054000	3056000	different investors,
3056000	3058000	shareholders in Canada,
3058000	3060000	to see if they can invest more
3060000	3062000	so that they can maintain
3062000	3064000	ownership of the company.
3064000	3066000	So, right now,
3066000	3068000	and the
3068000	3070000	CEO is Yves Guillemot,
3070000	3072000	and his family
3072000	3074000	owns 9% of the Ubisoft
3074000	3076000	stock, and then
3076000	3078000	two of the major shareholders,
3078000	3080000	which are BlackRock and Fidelity,
3080000	3082000	own 15% together,
3082000	3084000	and they're on his side, but he needs
3084000	3086000	50% of the
3086000	3088000	vote to block Vivendi.
3088000	3090000	So, he's really pushing
3090000	3092000	for it, and
3092000	3094000	basically,
3094000	3096000	his whole thing is that, you know,
3096000	3098000	if Vivendi takes over,
3098000	3100000	then the most loyal
3100000	3102000	employees to the company
3102000	3104000	are going to be leaving the company, which would
3104000	3106000	leave them with nothing
3106000	3108000	major. So,
3108000	3110000	they're hoping to keep it
3110000	3112000	out of Vivendi's hands.
3112000	3114000	So, strange that Vivendi
3114000	3116000	kind of got out of the business
3116000	3118000	with the whole Activision stuff,
3118000	3120000	just to be wanting to get right back in. That's very
3120000	3122000	strange to me. They acquired
3122000	3124000	Gameloft
3124000	3126000	earlier this week, and
3126000	3128000	bought more shares. So,
3128000	3130000	yeah, they're not out. Curious
3130000	3132000	what their long-term plan is over
3132000	3134000	there, but of course, when you're trying to take over
3134000	3136000	companies, you don't really make a lot of comments on that.
3136000	3138000	So, we'll see.
3138000	3140000	Moving on, Loki.
3140000	3142000	Alright, so,
3142000	3144000	PlayStation TV,
3144000	3146000	unfortunately, is going to be discontinued
3146000	3148000	in Japan.
3148000	3150000	Just didn't quite hit it off as
3150000	3152000	well as they thought it would. I mean,
3152000	3154000	it's dropped in in price
3154000	3156000	very low. In fact,
3156000	3158000	it originally started off at
3158000	3160000	around $100. Now, it's around
3160000	3162000	$40, probably even cheaper. I know I got mine for
3162000	3164000	$30.
3164000	3166000	Just, you know,
3166000	3168000	unfortunately, it didn't
3168000	3170000	seem to
3170000	3172000	do well with consumers.
3172000	3174000	They didn't really know why.
3174000	3176000	Basically saying you could use it as
3176000	3178000	a video streaming device.
3178000	3180000	It's like a mini-console, almost.
3180000	3182000	But,
3182000	3184000	unfortunately, there's not a lot of people
3184000	3186000	using them.
3186000	3188000	So, it's too bad. I don't use mine either, unfortunately.
3188000	3190000	Yeah, interesting, because the
3190000	3192000	Vita seems to show more strength
3192000	3194000	in Japan. You know, we actually
3194000	3196000	have Japanese Vita release dates,
3196000	3198000	which kind of disappeared
3198000	3200000	and died here in the States.
3200000	3202000	And maybe that's why those people take the Vita
3202000	3204000	and they're purchasing the Vita and not the
3204000	3206000	PlayStation TV.
3206000	3208000	That's true, because, well,
3208000	3210000	Japan is a more handheld-driven
3210000	3212000	industry. We got a lot
3212000	3214000	more people to play on transportation
3214000	3216000	and so forth, so maybe the TV thing
3216000	3218000	was just kind of a
3218000	3220000	not-so-great idea. But I'm still
3220000	3222000	a little surprised to hear that.
3222000	3224000	Hmm.
3224000	3226000	Alright, let's see.
3226000	3228000	Going to Brad from
3228000	3230000	PodCulture in our chatroom over at
3230000	3232000	live.vognetwork.com, says, you can play Vita games.
3232000	3234000	That is why I got one. You can play most
3234000	3236000	Vita games, right? Some of them are still locked out on the
3236000	3238000	TV for some weird reason. And then there was
3238000	3240000	that whole thing with the workaround
3240000	3242000	and all this. PleaseNoRead
3242000	3244000	in our chat says, good, I bought my
3244000	3246000	PSTV for 20 bucks and it's got to be the worst
3246000	3248000	console ever made.
3248000	3250000	It's not the worst, but it's not...
3250000	3252000	I don't know about the worst, but...
3252000	3254000	Let's put it this way. For the price that I paid,
3254000	3256000	it's way
3256000	3258000	better than the Ouya was, and it's way more
3258000	3260000	functional than it was, so
3260000	3262000	I would say it is a pretty decent
3262000	3264000	console. And what I was planning on using
3264000	3266000	it for is mainly just playing
3266000	3268000	classic PlayStation
3268000	3270000	games, that type of thing on there.
3270000	3272000	PS1 games. PS1 games, also
3272000	3274000	Vita games that I
3274000	3276000	have in my library, because I don't really have a
3276000	3278000	Vita anymore, so I have a bunch of
3278000	3280000	games in my library that I wanted to check out,
3280000	3282000	but the problem is, I don't play a lot of them
3282000	3284000	because I have a lot of them.
3284000	3286000	They're like multi-console games.
3286000	3288000	Some of them are on PlayStation 4 and
3288000	3290000	Vita, so it's like, well, why am I going to play
3290000	3292000	the Vita version when I have the PlayStation 4 version?
3292000	3294000	Right. Well, more news out of
3294000	3296000	Sony, going from
3296000	3298000	basically what is the past now to the
3298000	3300000	future. Sony has sent out
3300000	3302000	invitations to a special press event
3302000	3304000	that will be occurring in San Francisco on
3304000	3306000	March 15th, and it is going
3306000	3308000	to be all about PlayStation
3308000	3310000	VR, and funny
3310000	3312000	enough, this is timed quite appropriately
3312000	3314000	with Game Developers Conference,
3314000	3316000	so I think this is our big
3316000	3318000	event that we've been waiting for.
3318000	3320000	Was it the rumor that we were supposed to find out about the pricing
3320000	3322000	stuff around that time period?
3322000	3324000	I don't know if it was the rumor so much as
3324000	3326000	the expectation is that if Sony
3326000	3328000	is going to put this out in the first half of the year
3328000	3330000	still, which may or may not be true,
3330000	3332000	but it does seem like if they're going to say
3332000	3334000	it now, then it's before the holiday
3334000	3336000	period, because if they were going to wait until the
3336000	3338000	holiday period, they would have just
3338000	3340000	waited until E3, I think, but I
3340000	3342000	do think this gives a good
3342000	3344000	precedent that it'll
3344000	3346000	probably be out in the summer.
3346000	3348000	I don't know still about the whole first half
3348000	3350000	of the year, but maybe like summer, maybe
3350000	3352000	June, if June counts as first half of the year,
3352000	3354000	then maybe it'll make that, which
3354000	3356000	I guess it would, wouldn't it, because it is the sixth month.
3356000	3358000	But I'm like, if it's like
3358000	3360000	late July, cut them a little
3360000	3362000	slack, it's not the end of the world.
3362000	3364000	So yeah, the
3364000	3366000	event will be on March 15th, and
3366000	3368000	we are expecting to hear the price,
3368000	3370000	the date, and
3370000	3372000	the launch lineup. So, you know, when you're
3372000	3374000	rolling out a new piece of hardware like that, that's going to
3374000	3376000	be a pretty lengthy conference.
3376000	3378000	I'm pretty excited about it, I'm thinking about picking that up.
3378000	3380000	I mean, I almost bought a
3380000	3382000	Gear VR today, but then I was like kind of
3382000	3384000	reading some reviews on it, and it's just,
3384000	3386000	it doesn't seem like it'd be that interesting.
3386000	3388000	For me, it's really about the software.
3388000	3390000	What are the games going to be? And I've got
3390000	3392000	to be honest, Res alone,
3392000	3394000	even though, you know, that game is years
3394000	3396000	old, it's still, I'm like, ooh, that is an
3396000	3398000	experience I really want to try, and that's
3398000	3400000	in the PlayStation VR.
3400000	3402000	Res would be pretty amazing, actually.
3402000	3404000	You know, like most consoles,
3404000	3406000	I've got to have three. I'm going to have to have
3406000	3408000	like the three must-have games before I'm
3408000	3410000	finally going to break and buy the console.
3410000	3412000	Because I'm treating PlayStation VR
3412000	3414000	as a console at this point because I expect
3414000	3416000	it's going to be priced like one.
3416000	3418000	I would expect it's going to be
3418000	3422000	I really think
3422000	3424000	I'm going to say
3424000	3426000	$5.99
3426000	3428000	just because that way if it's $4.99
3428000	3430000	I'll be pleasantly surprised.
3430000	3432000	I think $5.99
3432000	3434000	is going to be too expensive.
3434000	3436000	The hopefulist in me says $4.99, the realist
3436000	3438000	in me says $5.99. I would think $4.99
3438000	3440000	at the highest. I would hope
3440000	3442000	it's $3.99, but
3442000	3444000	I don't know if it's,
3444000	3446000	I don't think it would be. But I mean
3446000	3448000	it's just going to be a hard sell if it's
3448000	3450000	$4.99, I think. Because you're talking about
3450000	3452000	it's way more than the actual console.
3452000	3454000	This is going to be a blue chip piece technology.
3454000	3456000	This is not going to be for everybody. This is going to be
3456000	3458000	for a very select audience
3458000	3460000	of gamers. So
3460000	3462000	this is aimed at 30-somethings
3462000	3464000	with disposable income.
3464000	3466000	I think it's what a 20 and 30-somethings
3466000	3468000	would have to be. We'll see how much it is because
3468000	3470000	if it's too expensive, I'll just pass on that too.
3470000	3472000	Bobby Blackwolf
3472000	3474000	pointing out if it was going to be cheaper than the
3474000	3476000	X5, they would have announced that by now.
3476000	3478000	Not necessarily.
3478000	3480000	Not necessarily. Maybe they want to
3480000	3482000	strike while the iron is hot,
3482000	3484000	get the pre-orders, and maybe the console
3484000	3486000	will be coming right out. Who knows?
3486000	3488000	But I think it's a fair
3488000	3490000	counterpoint.
3490000	3492000	Alright, let's move on
3492000	3494000	while we wait for March 15th.
3494000	3496000	Dark Sakura.
3496000	3498000	Well, we've off and on talked about
3498000	3500000	Leland E. And for those who
3500000	3502000	don't know, he was the
3502000	3504000	Democratic Senator for
3504000	3506000	California for San Francisco.
3506000	3508000	He's finally been
3508000	3510000	sentenced
3510000	3512000	for five years in prison
3512000	3514000	and a $20,000 fine.
3514000	3516000	He actually did
3516000	3518000	plead to the racketeering charge.
3518000	3520000	So for his plea deal, he
3520000	3522000	also admitted to
3522000	3524000	exchanging
3524000	3526000	official acts for
3526000	3528000	money conspiring to traffic
3528000	3530000	and weapons and money laundering.
3530000	3532000	And so his lawyer
3532000	3534000	said that he is
3534000	3536000	a 67-year-old man who has
3536000	3538000	accepted his responsibility
3538000	3540000	for his conduct. That he's led an otherwise
3540000	3542000	exemplary life as a family man
3542000	3544000	and an active voice for the betterment of society.
3544000	3546000	Yeah, while he's exchanging
3546000	3548000	political favors for
3548000	3550000	weapons.
3550000	3552000	Bye, Felicia.
3552000	3554000	He also agreed to
3554000	3556000	forfeit $33,000 in campaign
3556000	3558000	contributions that were part
3558000	3560000	of his fund to run
3560000	3562000	for Secretary of State for California.
3564000	3566000	And he also,
3566000	3568000	his anti-video game
3568000	3570000	law was, of course, struck
3570000	3572000	down as unconstitutional
3572000	3574000	that it violated the First Amendment.
3574000	3576000	Which is why we bring him up now.
3576000	3578000	You know, if in case you forgot,
3578000	3580000	he was the big driving
3580000	3582000	force behind trying to
3582000	3584000	basically censor video
3584000	3586000	games at the retail level.
3586000	3588000	And all this time,
3588000	3590000	I mean, the irony of the fact that he was living
3590000	3592000	a Grand Theft Auto life while he
3592000	3594000	was trying to get Grand Theft Auto banned.
3594000	3596000	Well, let's not also forget.
3596000	3598000	His bill
3598000	3600000	was signed into law
3600000	3602000	by Schwarzenegger.
3602000	3604000	And it would have
3604000	3606000	fined retailers $2,000
3606000	3608000	per instance of selling
3608000	3610000	M-rated games to minors.
3610000	3612000	And would have also required
3612000	3614000	additional warning labels
3614000	3616000	of what a mature
3616000	3618000	game entails.
3618000	3620000	So, yeah.
3620000	3622000	Bye, Felicia.
3624000	3626000	Do not pass Go.
3626000	3628000	Do not collect $200.
3628000	3630000	That's the last time we'll ever have to bring him up on the show.
3630000	3632000	I hope.
3632000	3634000	Unless we're here in five
3634000	3636000	years talking about his parole.
3636000	3638000	But I figured it was at least worth mentioning.
3638000	3640000	It is worth mentioning.
3640000	3642000	Closing the book on that whole thing.
3642000	3644000	Anyway.
3644000	3646000	Let's try and talk about some
3646000	3648000	release dates. We're gonna travel around the world and check out some
3648000	3650000	games that you will be able to walk
3650000	3652000	into a store and buy without question.
3652000	3654000	And without getting carded and all that stuff.
3654000	3656000	So, Loki, starting us off in the US.
3656000	3658000	Alright, so we've got
3658000	3660000	Elekhine's Gun
3660000	3662000	on PlayStation 4
3662000	3664000	and Xbox One.
3664000	3666000	Return to Popolo Cross, a story
3666000	3668000	of seasons fairytale on
3668000	3670000	3DS.
3670000	3672000	Darkrai Primal coming out on
3672000	3674000	PC.
3674000	3676000	Mortal Kombat XL edition.
3676000	3678000	The one that has the DLC included
3678000	3680000	with it. That is coming out on
3680000	3682000	Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
3684000	3686000	Let's see.
3686000	3688000	And then finally,
3688000	3690000	Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess HD.
3690000	3692000	That's coming out on Wii U
3692000	3694000	this week.
3694000	3696000	That's it. Let's go to Japan.
3696000	3698000	Right now. And check out some release dates
3698000	3700000	over there. Some price reductions on the PlayStation 4
3700000	3702000	for Assassin's Creed Unity and
3702000	3704000	Far Cry 4 as they move into the best series
3704000	3706000	on March 3rd. But as far as new games
3706000	3708000	go, Gundam Breaker 3 and Life
3708000	3710000	is Strange gets its Japanese version
3710000	3712000	on March 3rd. Those on
3712000	3714000	the PlayStation 4.
3714000	3716000	On the PlayStation 3,
3716000	3718000	no new games, but you get that same price reduction
3718000	3720000	on Assassin's Creed Rogue and Far Cry
3720000	3722000	4. Nothing of note on the
3722000	3724000	Wii U, although we do have
3724000	3726000	Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess HD
3726000	3728000	coming out on March 10th.
3728000	3730000	So we're getting very, very close
3730000	3732000	to that. On the PlayStation Vita,
3732000	3734000	which you can, you know, not play on your TV
3734000	3736000	anymore, I suppose. Gundam Breaker 3
3736000	3738000	is out there as well. There's also a brand
3738000	3740000	new Vita starter kit in Aqua
3740000	3742000	Blue and Glacier White.
3742000	3744000	And then there's a new game on the Vita.
3744000	3746000	Chalet no Atelier Plus,
3746000	3748000	Kukon no Ume no Renken Jutsu
3748000	3750000	comes out on the PlayStation Vita.
3750000	3752000	Lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS
3752000	3754000	this week in Japan, Haiku
3754000	3756000	cross team match
3756000	3758000	regular and cross game box.
3758000	3760000	I'm not sure what that all entails. Must be like
3760000	3762000	a limited edition type thing.
3762000	3764000	And just for you, Dark Sakura,
3764000	3766000	Doraemon!
3766000	3768000	Shin no Bita no Nippon Tanjuu
3768000	3770000	comes out. I'm not really a big fan of Doraemon.
3770000	3772000	Really? I always thought that was something you were into.
3772000	3774000	I think he's cute.
3774000	3776000	You know, a cat with no ears.
3776000	3778000	So I looked up that Haiku cross
3778000	3780000	team match and the special kit that it comes with.
3780000	3782000	It's like a little, like the game comes in a
3782000	3784000	tin. And by the way, this is like a little
3784000	3786000	fighting game. It looks like an old school Street Fighter 2
3786000	3788000	type of game. So I think this is just supposed to be
3788000	3790000	like a, I don't know, just a little
3790000	3792000	cute little
3792000	3794000	extras that come with it. Cause you know they love
3794000	3796000	collector's editions of Japan. They really do.
3796000	3798000	You thought we have a lot here.
3798000	3800000	Check there. Dark Sakura, how about the
3800000	3802000	UK? On March 1st we have
3802000	3804000	Deponia Doomsday for Mac and PC.
3804000	3806000	Screen cheat for
3806000	3808000	Xbox One. X-Blaze code embryo
3808000	3810000	for PC.
3810000	3812000	Let me move on to the next days. On the
3812000	3814000	second, Bus Simulator 16
3814000	3816000	for Mac and PC.
3816000	3818000	Bus Simulator? Is it a school bus?
3818000	3820000	School bus.
3820000	3822000	By the way, I found that album
3822000	3824000	is on iTunes.
3824000	3826000	Is it really? I was listening to school.
3826000	3828000	I added it to all my Apple music. Of course you did.
3828000	3830000	Cause whatever.
3830000	3832000	And then on March 3rd is
3832000	3834000	Black Desert Online
3834000	3836000	for PC.
3836000	3838000	I think it's in
3838000	3840000	I can't see the label on the thing.
3840000	3842000	I'm trying to pull it up.
3842000	3844000	But at a distance, or in the little tiny
3844000	3846000	characters. Yeah, it's in Korean.
3846000	3848000	Act F'd
3848000	3850000	in chat says Magic School Bus Simulator?
3850000	3852000	You know this whole thing does
3852000	3854000	remind me though, I need American Truck Simulator.
3854000	3856000	That came out not that long ago on Steam.
3856000	3858000	I need to get that.
3858000	3860000	Those games are actually
3860000	3862000	really fun. I don't know if you play them.
3862000	3864000	It's very zen.
3864000	3866000	Like I imagine driving cross country probably
3866000	3868000	is. More like
3868000	3870000	how many caffeine pills can you take before
3870000	3872000	you pass out
3872000	3874000	and crash your bus
3874000	3876000	or your truck
3876000	3878000	into the ravine
3878000	3880000	where you die.
3880000	3882000	Did you see, this is going to be totally random
3882000	3884000	but I don't even care. That's what we do on this show.
3884000	3886000	Did you see that series of tweets that was on
3886000	3888000	Twitter about the mega bus
3888000	3890000	this week where the person tweeted
3890000	3892000	like, they're pulling over
3892000	3894000	the mega bus. Something's wrong with the mega bus.
3894000	3896000	And then the next tweet was a picture
3896000	3898000	and it goes, mega bus is on fire.
3898000	3900000	What?
3900000	3902000	The next tweet was update, mega bus
3902000	3904000	exploded. And there was a big
3904000	3906000	picture of the exploded mega bus.
3906000	3908000	It was kind of sad. Mega bus.
3908000	3910000	It was like life on Twitter.
3910000	3912000	Mega bus?
3912000	3914000	You never heard of mega bus? No.
3914000	3916000	It's like a Greyhound alternative.
3916000	3918000	Apparently they're extremely terrible.
3918000	3920000	Are they? I haven't heard horrible things about them.
3920000	3922000	They'll remind me never to be on one.
3922000	3924000	Moving on.
3924000	3926000	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
3926000	3928000	And then hopefully this show won't blow up
3928000	3930000	and we can get to the classic game of the week.
3930000	3932000	But first, Dark Sakura with news.
3932000	3934000	I have news?
3934000	3936000	Oh no, I'm just kidding. It's Loki, not Dark Sakura.
3936000	3938000	I was going to say, um,
3938000	3940000	so EA has abandoned their
3940000	3942000	trademark filing for ghosts.
3942000	3944000	There will be no ghost games coming from
3944000	3946000	EA anymore.
3946000	3948000	So, sorry.
3948000	3950000	I know you guys were all looking forward to
3950000	3952000	Battlefield 5, really
3952000	3954000	spooky ghost edition, but
3954000	3956000	not going to be happening.
3956000	3958000	Instead, this was originally
3958000	3960000	Ubisoft, I guess, was objecting to
3960000	3962000	EA's attempt to trademark ghosts since
3962000	3964000	they have ghost recon and a lot of the
3964000	3966000	other Tom Clancy games and that type of stuff.
3966000	3968000	So now
3968000	3970000	they've just decided not to do it.
3970000	3972000	And no idea what it was
3972000	3974000	supposed to be intended for, but
3974000	3976000	they've dropped it.
3976000	3978000	So we'll never know
3978000	3980000	what the ghost game was from EA.
3980000	3982000	Nope.
3982000	3984000	We won't, and nor will we care.
3984000	3986000	But we can still get, you know,
3986000	3988000	what was it, Tom Clancy ghost recon?
3988000	3990000	That's still okay, though, right?
3990000	3992000	Yep, we should have Tom Clancy's Ghost
3992000	3994000	Hunters. That would be awesome,
3994000	3996000	actually. Where they just go, like,
3996000	3998000	search for
3998000	4000000	EMF Fields.
4000000	4002000	Hey, it's a...
4002000	4004000	Try to record, was it white noise?
4004000	4006000	Or not white noise, uh...
4006000	4008000	I forget what they call those.
4008000	4010000	The Supernatural Ghost Hunters?
4010000	4012000	Not the white noise, I forget, like, I used to be real into
4012000	4014000	that shit, and I can't remember what the fuck they call
4014000	4016000	that shit, um...
4016000	4018000	It's not white noise, it's, uh...
4018000	4020000	Fuck, I can't remember. Eh, who cares?
4020000	4022000	It, um...
4022000	4024000	Ghost voices or whatever, it's something.
4024000	4026000	Alright, I'm gonna move on.
4026000	4028000	Another week, another
4028000	4030000	Nintendo NX rumor, that's right.
4030000	4032000	It seems like these are a dime a dozen, these
4032000	4034000	NX rumors. I don't know why we keep
4034000	4036000	reporting them here on OLR, but apparently
4036000	4038000	each one of these rumors, no, really,
4038000	4040000	I mean, this is from a trusted source.
4040000	4042000	This is, uh, this is it.
4042000	4044000	This is a trusted source, and, you know, you can
4044000	4046000	believe this. So, one of the big NX
4046000	4048000	rumors this week is that
4048000	4050000	the NX will officially launch
4050000	4052000	this year, and the Legend
4052000	4054000	of Zelda, the new one, is a
4054000	4056000	launch window game. So, we may be
4056000	4058000	in it, and this is something that people have been
4058000	4060000	speculating for a while, is that we may be in a similar
4060000	4062000	situation when we were
4062000	4064000	expecting the Legend of Zelda on the
4064000	4066000	GameCube, and it ended up also
4066000	4068000	being a launch title for the Wii.
4068000	4070000	We may be looking at a very similar situation
4070000	4072000	here with the new Legend of Zelda.
4072000	4074000	And then the same thing happened with
4074000	4076000	the Zelda on the Game Boy
4076000	4078000	Color that was on
4078000	4080000	the Advance. That was the Oracle of
4080000	4082000	Seasons and Ages, right? Where you had, like, the special
4082000	4084000	Advance
4084000	4086000	shop, I think, that you could get if
4086000	4088000	you played it on an Advance. So,
4088000	4090000	you know, Zelda
4090000	4092000	has done this before.
4092000	4094000	There is a precedent. But, anyway,
4094000	4096000	apparently this source is
4096000	4098000	someone who works directly at Nintendo,
4098000	4100000	and, you know,
4100000	4102000	it makes sense, though,
4102000	4104000	if the NX is coming out this year, and if Zelda Wii U
4104000	4106000	is coming out this year, it's
4106000	4108000	probably happening on the NX as well, but we'll see what
4108000	4110000	happens.
4110000	4112000	To register participation
4112000	4114000	for this week's episode of Orange Andredi
4114000	4116000	with VoGnetwork.com, use the past
4116000	4118000	phrase, DIRT.
4118000	4120000	Also, more
4120000	4122000	NX rumors, and this is something
4122000	4124000	from a rumor spiller
4124000	4126000	named Geno, who has
4126000	4128000	released other information in the past,
4128000	4130000	such as that Pokemon was going to be
4130000	4132000	in a 3D engine, and that it would have
4132000	4134000	a fairy type, that
4134000	4136000	PlayStation 4 was going to have modern day
4136000	4138000	graphics on a DirectX level like Unreal Engine
4138000	4140000	4 and Frostbite 2,
4140000	4142000	Microsoft's Omni Projection unit
4142000	4144000	that turned out to be the Illumeroom,
4144000	4146000	so here is some of the
4146000	4148000	juicy stuff he's saying about NX.
4148000	4150000	There will be a, oh, your favorite
4150000	4152000	word is coming up, DarkSagra.
4152000	4154000	There's going to be an HDMI
4154000	4156000	dongle that attaches
4156000	4158000	to the television. It uses
4158000	4160000	wireless HDMI technology.
4160000	4162000	It's a very similar
4162000	4164000	type of streaming thing that the
4164000	4166000	Wii U uses today, except
4166000	4168000	now it's evolved.
4168000	4170000	As speaking of Pokemon. Has the porn industry
4170000	4172000	created the dongle?
4172000	4174000	The dongle? I don't know,
4174000	4176000	you're asking the wrong guy.
4176000	4178000	This device will stream
4178000	4180000	via the HDMI dongle
4180000	4182000	to the TV, so you won't even need
4182000	4184000	an HDMI cable. That's kind of interesting,
4184000	4186000	actually. The analog
4186000	4188000	controls have motors for
4188000	4190000	haptic feedback, so if you hit
4190000	4192000	a wall, the sticks will move away
4192000	4194000	from the wall to simulate hitting it.
4194000	4196000	That seems kind of cool, and something
4196000	4198000	that I'm surprised we haven't seen before.
4198000	4200000	Supposedly there will be a Bluetooth
4200000	4202000	syncing with tons of
4202000	4204000	devices, smartphones,
4204000	4206000	tablets. I wonder if this is where
4206000	4208000	those earlier rumors about the
4208000	4210000	smartphones and the PS4s and all that came from
4210000	4212000	is through some type of Bluetooth integration.
4212000	4214000	That could be interesting. You can
4214000	4216000	answer phone calls and display
4216000	4218000	text messages from your phone
4218000	4220000	onto the NX. So
4220000	4222000	does that mean I could be playing a video
4222000	4224000	game and somebody could send me a text
4224000	4226000	message and it's going to display on the TV while I'm playing
4226000	4228000	the game? That could be interesting. Wait a second.
4228000	4230000	You're telling me that there's going to be some sort of
4230000	4232000	network integration with this system? I don't
4232000	4234000	believe it. You know what?
4234000	4236000	What? I have a phone
4236000	4238000	and it gets messages.
4238000	4240000	Can an Apple TV
4240000	4242000	display text messages like that?
4242000	4244000	I don't have an Apple TV. Why are you
4244000	4246000	looking at me? I thought
4246000	4248000	because you have an Apple Watch, I figured you
4248000	4250000	have the TV too. Silly me.
4250000	4252000	Alright. I
4252000	4254000	actually don't know if you can.
4254000	4256000	I can get text messages on my Mac though. How about this?
4256000	4258000	How about this Nintendo?
4258000	4260000	How about you focus on fucking making the
4260000	4262000	networking work correctly instead of trying to
4262000	4264000	integrate your fucking text messages from your
4264000	4266000	phone onto your TV because
4266000	4268000	guess what? If
4268000	4270000	my phone is fucking synced with the TV
4270000	4272000	anyways or whatever the system is,
4272000	4274000	I probably have my fucking phone in my hand
4274000	4276000	already. So what's the point of
4276000	4278000	needing that on the TV? Well,
4278000	4280000	the tech uses apparently the
4280000	4282000	same hardware layout as the PlayStation 4
4282000	4284000	and Xbox One and they're saying
4284000	4286000	a 130 party
4286000	4288000	developer said it's the easiest device we've
4288000	4290000	ever developed for you. Take your code, compile it
4290000	4292000	and it works.
4292000	4294000	And look to Pokemon Go
4294000	4296000	to get an idea of the
4296000	4298000	social features that will be in NX.
4298000	4300000	This will take multiplayer, AR,
4300000	4302000	and the StreetPass concept to a whole new
4302000	4304000	level. And they're saying the strengths of the device are
4304000	4306000	usability and ease of use.
4306000	4308000	Visually and functionally,
4308000	4310000	it is as if
4310000	4312000	the Samsung and the Nintendo 2DS
4312000	4314000	had a baby. The operating
4314000	4316000	system is Nintendos.
4316000	4318000	That's adorable, I'm sorry.
4318000	4320000	Nintendos is the operating
4320000	4322000	system. Even you're smiling, Loki.
4322000	4324000	It's kind of cute. It's cute. Shut up.
4324000	4326000	It's cheesy, whatever.
4326000	4328000	I love it. Nintendos
4328000	4330000	is the operating system and it has
4330000	4332000	a lot of the modern features of mobile
4332000	4334000	operating system. Nintendo is being
4334000	4336000	careful in showing it off because they're
4336000	4338000	afraid that it would be mistaken as
4338000	4340000	running Android, which was an
4340000	4342000	earlier rumor about this device,
4342000	4344000	interestingly enough. Remember that? That Nintendo was
4344000	4346000	supposedly running an Android thing on
4346000	4348000	its console. So maybe
4348000	4350000	those link together somehow. I don't
4350000	4352000	know. But anyway, again,
4352000	4354000	huge rumors. Get your
4354000	4356000	salt licks. We don't know any of this to be true.
4356000	4358000	But it's fun to speculate.
4358000	4360000	So, there you go.
4360000	4362000	I mean, there's nothing in
4362000	4364000	there that strikes me as
4364000	4366000	what a bunch of horseshit.
4366000	4368000	I actually think the idea of
4368000	4370000	playing a game and having
4370000	4372000	a text message come up on your screen
4372000	4374000	while you're playing the game is actually
4374000	4376000	kind of an interesting idea. That's
4376000	4378000	why I was asking if Apple
4378000	4380000	already had that built into their ecosystem.
4380000	4382000	I mean, whatever. That's fine if they want
4382000	4384000	to do that.
4384000	4386000	It's only
4386000	4388000	between the computers and the phones anyway.
4388000	4390000	And watch.
4390000	4392000	Dark Tetsuya in Chat says
4392000	4394000	I do agree Nintendos is
4394000	4396000	adorable. I hope that part is real
4396000	4398000	at least. Yeah, me too.
4398000	4400000	That's just as adorable as Glados was.
4400000	4402000	So, you know. Well, maybe
4402000	4404000	it'll offer you cake.
4404000	4406000	And then you find out there actually isn't
4406000	4408000	cake at the end.
4408000	4410000	It's kind of like how they offered me, you know,
4410000	4412000	DJ Hero and Fucking Saints
4412000	4414000	Row on the 3DS. And then there wasn't
4414000	4416000	a Fucking DJ Hero and Saints Row on
4416000	4418000	the 3DS. The broadband
4418000	4420000	adapter is a lie. But there was
4420000	4422000	Fucking Submarine Game that I didn't give a
4422000	4424000	shit about. That was on the 3DS.
4424000	4426000	Woo hoo! 3DS.
4426000	4428000	And Fucking Cubic Ninja or whatever the fuck that
4428000	4430000	was. It's like, woo. Like a Box Boy.
4430000	4432000	Box Boy or whatever. Yeah, it's like
4432000	4434000	It's like, I don't
4434000	4436000	I've made you a shirt. It has
4436000	4438000	two letters on it. QQ
4438000	4440000	Alright.
4440000	4442000	Let's
4442000	4444000	travel back. Let's travel back to a
4444000	4446000	simpler time when there was
4446000	4448000	no rumors on consoles. You
4448000	4450000	read about it in the magazine and
4450000	4452000	it was fucking fat. And then it didn't come out.
4452000	4454000	And then it never came out.
4454000	4456000	It's the classic game of the week.
4456000	4458000	Dark Soccer's gonna step into what's left of the vault
4458000	4460000	and find a game that she- The vault is
4460000	4462000	still there. We're just downsizing
4462000	4464000	the extra. We're cutting the
4464000	4466000	chaff. The downsized
4466000	4468000	and the outsourced vault.
4468000	4470000	We're sharing the vault. You are outsourcing
4470000	4472000	parts of it to other players. We're sharing the vault with
4472000	4474000	other people for money. Alright.
4474000	4476000	We'll rent a ColecoVision.
4476000	4478000	The classic game of the week.
4478000	4480000	Dark Soccer, what did you find in the vault that you think
4480000	4482000	Hey, Bratz
4482000	4484000	you should be playing this game. And actually, I gotta say
4484000	4486000	yet again, here's a game you picked this week
4486000	4488000	where I'm going, how has this never been
4488000	4490000	a game? How was this never
4490000	4492000	picked? This game is legendary.
4492000	4494000	How many
4494000	4496000	games are there in the world, Rob?
4496000	4498000	There's a lot, actually.
4498000	4500000	I know, right? There's a lot of games. And hey,
4500000	4502000	I picked crap last time, so I picked a good one
4502000	4504000	this time. Alright, so
4504000	4506000	here it is. What is your classic game of the week?
4506000	4508000	Spy Hunter.
4508000	4510000	You can hear it very
4510000	4512000	faintly.
4512000	4514000	Anyway,
4514000	4516000	Spy Hunter came out in 1983
4516000	4518000	by Valley Midway.
4518000	4520000	And it basically
4520000	4522000	was supposed to be
4522000	4524000	a James Bond game.
4524000	4526000	But they didn't get the license for it.
4526000	4528000	So basically, you're driving down roads
4528000	4530000	in what's called the interceptor
4530000	4532000	car, which can destroy other enemies
4532000	4534000	with different weapons, so it's like the James Bond
4534000	4536000	car, you know.
4536000	4538000	It had sit-down versions and stand-up
4538000	4540000	versions, which of course
4540000	4542000	the stand-up ones were more common because they could just be
4542000	4544000	integrated into any old cabinet design.
4544000	4546000	It had a steering wheel
4546000	4548000	that had the aircraft-style steering wheel.
4548000	4550000	And you also
4550000	4552000	had a stick shift for low and high
4552000	4554000	gears and a pedal.
4554000	4556000	There were many, many ports. There was even
4556000	4558000	a pinball version.
4558000	4560000	Sequels, a new
4560000	4562000	version of the game's everything.
4562000	4564000	And a movie that had
4564000	4566000	The Rock in it.
4566000	4568000	Oh, don't ask me.
4568000	4570000	I didn't see it.
4570000	4572000	So it is, you know, a scrolling
4572000	4574000	down,
4574000	4576000	vertical scrolling driving
4576000	4578000	game. You have a top-down perspective.
4578000	4580000	And you are driving
4580000	4582000	the G6155
4582000	4584000	interceptor.
4584000	4586000	Yeah, you just go around
4586000	4588000	shooting stuff and you can get like
4588000	4590000	augmented weapons
4590000	4592000	like different machine guns and things by
4592000	4594000	entering a weapons van.
4594000	4596000	And you can summon
4596000	4598000	your van by clicking
4598000	4600000	you press
4600000	4602000	a blinking
4602000	4604000	weapons van button that would show
4604000	4606000	up. And you get like oil slick
4606000	4608000	smokescreen, surface-to-air missiles,
4608000	4610000	stuff like that. And you have
4610000	4612000	limited ammo for those and you'll lose
4612000	4614000	them if the car is destroyed. You also have a little
4614000	4616000	dashboard that shows you what you've got
4616000	4618000	when. You can also
4618000	4620000	convert the car to
4620000	4622000	a go fast boat.
4622000	4624000	Vroom. By driving through
4624000	4626000	a boathouse that will appear from the side
4626000	4628000	of the road.
4628000	4630000	So it's kind
4630000	4632000	of an infinite game. It has no ending.
4632000	4634000	You play until you die. Until you run out of money.
4638000	4640000	So basically, the guy that
4640000	4642000	created
4642000	4644000	the game, George
4644000	4646000	Gomez, was inspired by audio
4646000	4648000	cassette tape music from
4648000	4650000	the James Bond movies. And he worked with Tom
4650000	4652000	Leon who
4652000	4654000	the two of them worked together on Tron.
4654000	4656000	So pretty cool. And of course
4656000	4658000	it plays the Peter Gunn theme in the background.
4658000	4660000	So they wanted to have
4660000	4662000	the James Bond theme. They were trying to get the
4662000	4664000	license. And like I said, they couldn't get it.
4664000	4666000	So Peter Gunn it is.
4666000	4668000	There was also a pinball version
4668000	4670000	that came out in 1984 by Bally.
4670000	4672000	Since it was Bally Midway that put
4672000	4674000	out the game. They had the license.
4674000	4676000	I don't think I've ever played a Spy Hunter table.
4676000	4678000	It's alright.
4678000	4680000	But Spy Hunter also had a sequel
4680000	4682000	Spy Hunter 2 in 1987.
4684000	4686000	And it had a co-op 2 player.
4686000	4688000	But instead of the
4688000	4690000	top down, it had the 3D perspective
4690000	4692000	from above and behind the car.
4694000	4696000	Excuse me. Also
4696000	4698000	Sunsoft in Japan had
4698000	4700000	reprogrammed the game for the
4700000	4702000	NES. And they also did
4702000	4704000	Battle Formula which was
4704000	4706000	kind of much like
4706000	4708000	it. But
4708000	4710000	they were trying to avoid copyright infringement
4710000	4712000	so they had
4712000	4714000	a different front cover and everything.
4714000	4716000	So crazy.
4716000	4718000	And outside of Japan
4718000	4720000	it was released as Super Spy Hunter.
4722000	4724000	Let's see what we had for other
4724000	4726000	releases.
4728000	4730000	Yeah, so
4730000	4732000	they were going to be doing
4732000	4734000	a movie that did
4734000	4736000	not go into production that had
4736000	4738000	The Rock.
4740000	4742000	All kinds of other stuff
4742000	4744000	going on with that one. Yeah, I didn't really pay
4744000	4746000	much attention to movie stuff when it was happening.
4746000	4748000	So
4748000	4750000	as far as different versions, we've
4750000	4752000	had
4752000	4754000	DOS, NES,
4754000	4756000	Atari 2600,
4756000	4758000	8-bit family computer,
4758000	4760000	well, the Atari 8-bit family computer.
4760000	4762000	The CPC, the ZX
4762000	4764000	Spectrum, Commodore 64,
4764000	4766000	Apple II, ColecoVision,
4766000	4768000	BBC Micro. There was a
4768000	4770000	clone called Major Motion that
4770000	4772000	came out by Microdeal on the
4772000	4774000	Atari ST and Amiga.
4774000	4776000	The Nintendo port was kind of crap because
4776000	4778000	it had really bad collision
4778000	4780000	detection.
4780000	4782000	The Commodore 64
4782000	4784000	and Atari 8-bit versions
4784000	4786000	had very similar bugs.
4786000	4788000	Like, the car
4788000	4790000	would drive on the side of the
4790000	4792000	road and enemy
4792000	4794000	cars couldn't touch it. There was just some weird
4794000	4796000	stuff that would go on. Also
4796000	4798000	there were re-releases for the Atari Greatest Hits
4798000	4800000	of
4800000	4802000	Midway's Greatest Arcade
4802000	4804000	Hits Volume 1 for N64,
4804000	4806000	Midway Arcade Treasures,
4806000	4808000	GameCube PS2, Xbox,
4808000	4810000	the Extend to Play versions
4810000	4812000	for PSP, and
4812000	4814000	Midway Arcade Origins
4814000	4816000	for PS3 and Xbox 360.
4816000	4818000	It was
4818000	4820000	funny.
4820000	4822000	Spy Hunter had actually
4822000	4824000	been incorporated into other
4824000	4826000	things in pop culture.
4826000	4828000	In Murder, She Wrote, do we remember
4828000	4830000	that show?
4830000	4832000	Hell yes, of course we do.
4832000	4834000	How could you forget the great Angela
4834000	4836000	Langbury? Well, there
4836000	4838000	was an episode called Hit, Run, and Homicide
4838000	4840000	where
4840000	4842000	her character realized
4842000	4844000	that the
4844000	4846000	solution to the case
4846000	4848000	was after she was playing
4848000	4850000	Spy Hunter, so
4850000	4852000	I thought that was kind of
4852000	4854000	a neat inclusion for inspiration.
4854000	4856000	Spy Hunter
4856000	4858000	there's an easter egg for it in Microsoft
4858000	4860000	Excel 2000 that requires
4860000	4862000	DirectX to work. I just wanted to say
4862000	4864000	real quick, since the Spy Hunter music
4864000	4866000	ran out, I thought maybe we could
4866000	4868000	use a little bit of this here
4868000	4870000	instead.
4870000	4872000	It's the Murder, She Wrote theme
4872000	4874000	song. Oh, Rob.
4886000	4888000	Did they ever make a game out of Murder, She Wrote?
4888000	4890000	Why the fuck not?
4890000	4892000	I'm pretty sure it was probably a PC game
4892000	4894000	from Murder, She Wrote.
4894000	4896000	Can I finish, Rob?
4896000	4898000	I suppose.
4898000	4900000	Okay.
4900000	4902000	In 2008, Pontiac had a commercial
4902000	4904000	that had
4904000	4906000	the Spy Hunter car being replaced
4906000	4908000	by the Pontiac G8 GT
4908000	4910000	after the original car was destroyed.
4910000	4912000	Zynga did
4912000	4914000	a game
4914000	4916000	it had in Mafia Wars
4916000	4918000	that was a car called The Hunter Spy
4918000	4920000	XS.
4920000	4922000	The Hunter arcade game was seen in Big.
4922000	4924000	And in Teen Titans Go, which
4924000	4926000	they had
4926000	4928000	an episode called Video Game References
4928000	4930000	Cyborg played a game called
4930000	4932000	Pie Hunter.
4932000	4934000	Several games, actually.
4934000	4936000	I was gonna say
4936000	4938000	that they'd made
4938000	4940000	Murder, She Wrote and Murder, She Wrote 2
4940000	4942000	returned to Cabot Cove.
4942000	4944000	They made a Murder, She Wrote game.
4944000	4946000	They're on iPhone. In 2009,
4946000	4948000	they made a Murder, She Wrote game.
4948000	4950000	Oh yes, Spy Hunter, though.
4950000	4952000	I'm done.
4952000	4954000	Fuck.
4954000	4956000	Just think, we're only a few more years away
4956000	4958000	from Classic Game of the Week that could be Murder, She Wrote.
4958000	4964000	I'll do a Murder, She Wrote game before I do Halo.
4964000	4966000	That's it.
4966000	4968000	We've got Doriaki
4968000	4970000	in the fridge and I'm gonna have some.
4970000	4972000	Alright, there it is. Your Classic Game of the Week.
4972000	4974000	Spy Hunter and a little bit of Murder, She Wrote.
4974000	4976000	But like,
4976000	4978000	Dark Soccer can't argue
4978000	4980000	because Murder, She Wrote is a true classic.
4980000	4982000	I mean, that's just how it is.
4982000	4984000	I can argue.
4984000	4986000	Alright.
4986000	4988000	We're gonna take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
4988000	4990000	We have plenty more to come
4990000	4992000	with the show, including
4992000	4994000	the Fugu Question of the Week.
4994000	4996000	We're gonna get to your calls as well.
4996000	4998000	1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
4998000	5000000	and emails.
5000000	5002000	Phone calls. You guys.
5002000	5004000	Plenty more when we come back right after this.
5004000	5014000	Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.
5014000	5016000	Live tonight with Episode 632
5016000	5018000	of our show,
5018000	5020000	February the 28th of 2016.
5020000	5022000	I apologize.
5022000	5024000	My voice is kind of going in and out.
5024000	5026000	I'm still trying to shake.
5026000	5028000	Remember I missed a show like a month ago because I was sick?
5028000	5030000	That came back in full force for
5030000	5032000	MagFest and I'm still trying to shake it.
5032000	5034000	I think I've probably had three different
5034000	5036000	colds all at once is what's happening.
5036000	5038000	This is what happens when you go to conventions
5038000	5040000	is everything tries to kill you.
5040000	5042000	It's called confunk.
5042000	5044000	Yeah, confunk. A little bit of that.
5044000	5046000	Not meaning the smell of confunk, but the feeling of confunk.
5046000	5048000	I will give props to MagFest.
5048000	5050000	It did not smell
5050000	5052000	like butt.
5052000	5054000	It actually was pretty respectable.
5054000	5056000	Maybe that's because it was so cold
5056000	5058000	and it was a big open space.
5058000	5060000	There was proper refrigeration and ventilation everywhere,
5060000	5062000	but I was very proud
5062000	5064000	of you MagFesters for not
5064000	5066000	smelling.
5066000	5068000	MagFest did not MagFester.
5068000	5070000	That's right. It did not MagFester.
5070000	5072000	Quick live programming note
5072000	5074000	for those of you guys that are listening live tonight
5074000	5076000	at The Voice of the Geek Network.
5076000	5078000	We're going to do a special encore presentation
5078000	5080000	of one of our new shows on the network, GameBui.
5080000	5082000	If you've never heard them,
5082000	5084000	GameBui.org did a great little
5084000	5086000	Zelda retrospective this past week.
5086000	5088000	We're going to replay that after tonight's episode of OLR.
5088000	5090000	We had some,
5090000	5092000	for lack of a better term, fuckery
5092000	5094000	go on with the station this week,
5094000	5096000	where I was not able to get new shows in
5096000	5098000	for a couple days, which was really irritating
5098000	5100000	the shit out of me, and unfortunately,
5100000	5102000	nobody got to hear the new GameBui because of it
5102000	5104000	on the feed.
5104000	5106000	So we're going to play it at a special time tonight
5106000	5108000	here after the show, so apologies to the boys
5108000	5110000	over there at GameBui.
5110000	5112000	And thanks for putting up with technical difficulties
5112000	5114000	that are out of our control.
5114000	5116000	It's frustrating in the slightest, but anyway.
5116000	5118000	Let's get to some rapid
5118000	5120000	fire news.
5120000	5122000	Loki.
5122000	5124000	So this is kind of a neat little
5124000	5126000	addition to the package for if you
5126000	5128000	purchase the Xbox One version of Doom.
5128000	5130000	Not only will you get Doom,
5130000	5132000	but you'll also get the original Doom and
5132000	5134000	Doom 2, which were re-released
5134000	5136000	on Xbox 360 via
5136000	5138000	Xbox Live Arcade. You will get
5138000	5140000	those since they will be backwards compatible with
5140000	5142000	the Xbox One.
5142000	5144000	So that's pretty sweet.
5144000	5146000	So yeah,
5146000	5148000	go check that out. It's kind of a nice little bonus
5148000	5150000	if you want to purchase that game on that platform.
5150000	5152000	Also, speaking of backwards
5152000	5154000	compatible games, there's been
5154000	5156000	some more added to the Xbox One,
5156000	5158000	including Geometry Wars,
5158000	5160000	Retro Evolved, Carcassonne,
5160000	5162000	and I think
5162000	5164000	a few others. Let's see.
5164000	5166000	Nope. Those are the only
5166000	5168000	two that they mentioned. Oh.
5168000	5170000	Yep. But Geometry
5170000	5172000	Wars. That's pretty awesome.
5172000	5174000	Never really got into Carcassonne, though.
5176000	5178000	And finally,
5178000	5180000	March is right around the corner here.
5180000	5182000	And with that, of course, you can expect some new games
5182000	5184000	that will be free on
5184000	5186000	Xbox and PlayStation
5186000	5188000	platforms, starting off with the Xbox
5188000	5190000	Games with Gold.
5190000	5192000	For Xbox One, you're going to have
5192000	5194000	Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment
5194000	5196000	from March 1st through March 31st,
5196000	5198000	and Lords of the Fallen
5198000	5200000	from March 16th through April 15th.
5200000	5202000	A little bit extra time on that one.
5202000	5204000	And then on Xbox 360,
5204000	5206000	Supreme Commander 2,
5206000	5208000	March 1st to March 15th,
5208000	5210000	and the original Borderlands
5210000	5212000	from March 16th to March 31st.
5212000	5214000	And of course, as usual,
5214000	5216000	the Xbox 360 games are backwards compatible
5216000	5218000	with the Xbox One.
5218000	5220000	And then on top of that,
5220000	5222000	we've also got
5222000	5224000	for
5224000	5226000	PlayStation 4, now you
5226000	5228000	may remember there was the whole vote to
5228000	5230000	see which game would be included
5230000	5232000	free for March. Well,
5232000	5234000	Broforce won, so you can expect
5234000	5236000	that on PlayStation 4,
5236000	5238000	as well as Galaxie, which
5238000	5240000	looks pretty awesome. It's kind of a
5240000	5242000	Saturday morning cartoon, anime
5242000	5244000	style
5244000	5246000	space shooter game that
5246000	5248000	looks pretty badass, actually.
5248000	5250000	So that'll be coming out on PlayStation 4.
5250000	5252000	Flame Over and Reality
5252000	5254000	Fighters on PlayStation Vita,
5254000	5256000	and Super Stardust HD
5256000	5258000	and the last guy on PlayStation
5258000	5260000	3.
5260000	5262000	So, I don't know.
5262000	5264000	Those two, though, on the
5264000	5266000	PlayStation 4, though, are pretty awesome. And of course,
5266000	5268000	I believe the other two titles that were not
5268000	5270000	part of the free selection there
5270000	5272000	will be discounted for the month of March.
5274000	5276000	And I believe that was Assault Android
5276000	5278000	Cactus is one of them.
5278000	5280000	Yes, I'll definitely be picking that up, but a lot
5280000	5282000	of good free stuff.
5282000	5284000	Yeah, that Galaxie looks
5284000	5286000	badass. I actually almost
5286000	5288000	purchased that, and now I
5288000	5290000	get it free.
5290000	5292000	It's always irritating when you get a game, and then
5292000	5294000	it goes free like the very next month, right?
5294000	5296000	But, you know, that's what
5296000	5298000	happens in this day and age sometimes.
5298000	5300000	Well, how cool is it that
5300000	5302000	hidden stuff is found in a video
5302000	5304000	game years and years later,
5304000	5306000	especially a game like
5306000	5308000	Mortal Kombat? That's right.
5308000	5310000	There are some additional menus
5310000	5312000	in the Mortal Kombat series.
5312000	5314000	They were called EJB menus,
5314000	5316000	and they were rumored for a very long time,
5316000	5318000	and these menus were... That's for Ed Boon's
5318000	5320000	initials. That's right. They were finally found
5320000	5322000	on arcade hardware
5322000	5324000	of the first three Mortal Kombat games.
5324000	5326000	Thanks to
5326000	5328000	ROM scrubbing, it was known that the menus were
5328000	5330000	there for some time, but nobody really
5330000	5332000	knew how to get there. It takes
5332000	5334000	a lightning-quick input,
5334000	5336000	I guess some complicated button presses
5336000	5338000	with a block, on
5338000	5340000	both player one and player two sides
5340000	5342000	to unlock.
5342000	5344000	All the menus do, they have a
5344000	5346000	special hello message, a shortcut
5346000	5348000	to putting your initials at the top of the
5348000	5350000	ranking board, a Galaga
5350000	5352000	minigame in
5352000	5354000	Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and a gallery
5354000	5356000	of all the characters' endings.
5356000	5358000	It's not
5358000	5360000	anything that's going to change the game.
5360000	5362000	It's not like it's giving you, like, morphs
5362000	5364000	as Kano or whatever, but
5364000	5366000	it's just interesting that they were hidden for
5366000	5368000	20 years and they were just found. And I
5368000	5370000	guess what's interesting about it is that
5370000	5372000	the patterns were there the whole time.
5372000	5374000	They also work on ROM hacks.
5374000	5376000	They do, and they work on the
5376000	5378000	Midway arcade treasures. So if you
5378000	5380000	have, like, the Xbox version
5380000	5382000	or anything
5382000	5384000	that's basically emulating the game itself,
5384000	5386000	it's in there. So that's pretty cool.
5386000	5388000	There's also
5388000	5390000	the Fatality Viewer
5390000	5392000	in, I think, Ultimate
5392000	5394000	Mortal Kombat 3 was one of
5394000	5396000	the menu items there that wasn't in the
5396000	5398000	other two. It used
5398000	5400000	to be that it was
5400000	5402000	something that you could get as an unlock for, like,
5402000	5404000	beating one of the hardest modes.
5404000	5406000	And it's there as a...
5406000	5408000	It also has the hidden
5408000	5410000	character unlock as well
5410000	5412000	for one of the
5412000	5414000	different builds, I think.
5414000	5416000	I remember watching the video of it. It was actually
5416000	5418000	really cool.
5418000	5420000	Well, Twitch
5420000	5422000	also announcing this week that they are
5422000	5424000	now archiving streams
5424000	5426000	with
5426000	5428000	chat. So you
5428000	5430000	can now get chat replay alongside the
5430000	5432000	streams, which is, I think, great because
5432000	5434000	when you're trying to
5434000	5436000	create content that is going
5436000	5438000	to last longer and
5438000	5440000	work on demand and not just be live,
5440000	5442000	you have to be able to
5442000	5444000	see the chat. Like, what we try to do
5444000	5446000	here at OLR, if we're going to respond to
5446000	5448000	something in chat, we do try to read that
5448000	5450000	comment before just saying, oh, ha
5450000	5452000	ha, that was really funny, DarkTetsuya.
5452000	5454000	You know, like, you have to be able to read
5454000	5456000	the comment in order to respond to it.
5456000	5458000	So I think it's really good that Twitch will have
5458000	5460000	this on their replay. So that's
5460000	5462000	pretty cool. I guess
5462000	5464000	a user actually helped created that.
5464000	5466000	Oh, neat.
5466000	5468000	Also, in sort of
5468000	5470000	video game news, like, really distant,
5470000	5472000	like, super removed, but
5472000	5474000	I'm going to mention this anyway.
5474000	5476000	Kanye West has apparently announced on Twitter that
5476000	5478000	his next album will be called
5478000	5480000	Turbografx-16, named
5480000	5482000	after one of the most favorite gaming systems
5482000	5484000	from his childhood. He said
5484000	5486000	in a series of tweets, my next album
5486000	5488000	is titled Turbografx-16 as of
5488000	5490000	now, just on some super nerd vibes.
5490000	5492000	One of my favorite gaming systems when I was
5492000	5494000	a kid. Blazing Lasers is probably my favorite
5494000	5496000	game on that console. My boy
5496000	5498000	Molly that I spoke about on the song
5498000	5500000	Drive Slow actually had an EOGO in real
5500000	5502000	life, bro. We actually played Spy
5502000	5504000	Hunter at my mom's house. Hey, how about that?
5504000	5506000	Bringing it all together. You know, it's funny.
5506000	5508000	I've got both of those.
5508000	5510000	Yeah, so, you know,
5510000	5512000	Kanye West has a tendency to just tweet
5512000	5514000	kind of, he kind of lets his butt do
5514000	5516000	the tweeting, so I don't know if that
5516000	5518000	will actually end up happening, but
5518000	5520000	cool to know that he was a gaming nerd
5520000	5522000	at one point like a lot of the rest of us, so
5522000	5524000	neat.
5524000	5526000	Moving on. Dark Soccer, excuse me.
5526000	5528000	Well, one of the writers
5528000	5530000	for, um, who's working on
5530000	5532000	Mass Effect Andromeda
5532000	5534000	left BioWare to go to Bungie.
5534000	5536000	He was actually one of the
5536000	5538000	writers for Dragon Age as well
5538000	5540000	and that he thinks that Andromeda
5540000	5542000	will blow people away and he couldn't be prouder to
5542000	5544000	be a part of it, but he's
5544000	5546000	also, um, left
5546000	5548000	Chris Schlerf, who
5548000	5550000	was with BioWare Montreal.
5550000	5552000	We already lost David Gator,
5552000	5554000	so sad.
5554000	5556000	Also, and I was actually watching the trailer
5556000	5558000	for this last night. Oh my god.
5558000	5560000	Raiden 5.
5560000	5562000	Coming out to Xbox
5562000	5564000	1 in Japan.
5564000	5566000	I guess this would be the only
5566000	5568000	reason to have an Xbox 1
5568000	5570000	ever in Japan.
5570000	5572000	But Raiden 5, like,
5572000	5574000	it looked pretty freaking amazing.
5574000	5576000	I was so happy. And it uses
5576000	5578000	the power of the cloud to gather
5578000	5580000	player data and it impacts your game
5580000	5582000	in real time, so
5582000	5584000	that's pretty exciting.
5584000	5586000	Maybe we'll get it on PC or something.
5586000	5588000	And then,
5588000	5590000	last but not least, uh, character
5590000	5592000	for Killer Instinct.
5592000	5594000	The Arbiter from Halo
5594000	5596000	is going to be there.
5596000	5598000	And I watched the trailer for that
5598000	5600000	too and I was like, that's kind of cool.
5600000	5602000	And then I went back and
5602000	5604000	watched the rest of Hisako's story mode.
5606000	5608000	There you go.
5608000	5610000	Alright. I need to, uh,
5610000	5612000	I need to play through the rest of the,
5612000	5614000	uh, stories
5614000	5616000	in Killer Instinct as well. I did do Hisako
5616000	5618000	though. You're a fave.
5618000	5620000	Let's get to... I just have
5620000	5622000	an odd obsession with Onryo.
5622000	5624000	So... Now I know,
5624000	5626000	you have for a long time. Did you hear
5626000	5628000	they're doing, uh,
5628000	5630000	The Ring vs Juhon?
5630000	5632000	Yes, I have read that. I'm like, oh my god!
5632000	5634000	Yeah. Two of my favoritest ever
5634000	5636000	movies in one. In Japan, right?
5636000	5638000	Except Sadako 3D was stupid.
5638000	5640000	Like, really stupid.
5640000	5642000	And I haven't seen the last
5642000	5644000	two, uh, Juhon flicks.
5644000	5646000	But the premise seemed really stupid for those two. So are they gonna, like,
5646000	5648000	slap fight each other or something?
5648000	5650000	I mean, like... And then will they Americanize
5650000	5652000	it and ruin it? I have no idea.
5652000	5654000	Well, The Grudge was okay for the US
5654000	5656000	because it had the same director. It was all
5656000	5658000	the subsequent sequels I refused to watch
5658000	5660000	that were, as I understood,
5660000	5662000	fairly shitty.
5662000	5664000	But... Are they gonna call it,
5664000	5666000	like, you know, The Ring?
5666000	5668000	Ring vs Grudge? The Grudge
5668000	5670000	match? Enter The Ring!
5670000	5672000	It's the Grudge match!
5672000	5674000	One can hope.
5674000	5676000	What happens when you get
5676000	5678000	two completely different vengeful
5678000	5680000	ghosts in the same room?
5680000	5682000	I hope it's jumpscaring back and forth.
5682000	5684000	Like, they'll have a jumpscare off. You know how, like, the wizards
5684000	5686000	can usually fight? And it's like that giant
5686000	5688000	bolt of lightning or something that they go back and forth?
5688000	5690000	It says there's gonna be jumpscares
5690000	5692000	going back and forth.
5692000	5694000	Only if at the end of it, one of them will go,
5694000	5696000	you just got served. Would this be
5696000	5698000	like...
5698000	5700000	immortal
5700000	5702000	combat?
5702000	5704000	Perhaps?
5704000	5706000	It'll be like... Next Mortal Kombat?
5706000	5708000	Jason vs Freddy or whatever.
5708000	5710000	No, I don't think so.
5710000	5712000	We need to get to the foogle question of the week,
5712000	5714000	and quick.
5720000	5722000	Every week, you guys answer
5722000	5724000	our question that we post on our Facebook
5724000	5726000	and Google Plus communities. You take Facebook and Google
5726000	5728000	and you slam those words together, you get
5728000	5730000	Google! And this week, of course,
5730000	5732000	all about the Pokemons,
5732000	5734000	since we did just have the big birthday we've been
5734000	5736000	waiting for over the weekend.
5736000	5738000	Okay, one more Pokemon question
5738000	5740000	for you all this week, since we did just have the big
5740000	5742000	birthday. Have you already decided
5742000	5744000	if you're getting Sun, Moon,
5744000	5746000	or neither? And
5746000	5748000	which Pokemon across the years is your
5748000	5750000	favorite, and why?
5750000	5752000	So, very similar to the questions I asked here at the studio
5752000	5754000	at the beginning of the show. We'll start
5754000	5756000	off at Google Plus, Prince
5756000	5758000	Peach Fuzz starting us off
5758000	5760000	tonight, saying both.
5760000	5762000	Some people have to, when you say
5762000	5764000	gotta catch them all, they actually have to have
5764000	5766000	them all, which is why they will buy both games.
5766000	5768000	So, Prince Peach Fuzz is gonna
5768000	5770000	plan on getting both Sun and Moon.
5770000	5772000	And favorite Pokemon, Snorlax.
5772000	5774000	He's my spirit Pokemon.
5774000	5776000	That's a good answer. That's a very good
5776000	5778000	answer. I see a lot of myself in
5778000	5780000	Snorlax as well.
5780000	5782000	ActDeaf responded on Google Plus
5782000	5784000	saying, of course, yes, probably Moon.
5784000	5786000	And I have a lot of favorites
5786000	5788000	like Lucario and Ninetales,
5788000	5790000	but I think Hawlucha
5790000	5792000	is the Pokemon that I like the most.
5792000	5794000	I hope I didn't butcher that name.
5794000	5796000	With 700 Pokemon, even I can't pronounce them all these days.
5796000	5798000	So, there you go.
5798000	5800000	Going over to
5800000	5802000	Facebook,
5802000	5804000	starting off with Haseo Sumeruagawa
5804000	5806000	says, might check them out,
5806000	5808000	and Rayquaza is the
5808000	5810000	legendary for emerald is my
5810000	5812000	favorite. Our first legendary Pokemon
5812000	5814000	showing up in the favorites.
5814000	5816000	AndyR says, at the moment, neither.
5816000	5818000	Since I didn't really enjoy the
5818000	5820000	last two I played, White and Y.
5820000	5822000	But I said I wasn't gonna get Y
5822000	5824000	either, and the zeitgeist that launched got me.
5824000	5826000	Do you mean game or monster?
5826000	5828000	If former, gold. If latter,
5828000	5830000	far-fetched. Yeah, I know.
5830000	5832000	He's just a lame duck, but for some reason
5832000	5834000	I just really liked him as a kid.
5834000	5836000	Hey, you know what another one of my favorite Pokemon is?
5836000	5838000	Psyduck. You wanna know what's funny?
5838000	5840000	Ages and ages
5840000	5842000	ago, in fact
5842000	5844000	I think it was the same night that we picked up my Togepi
5844000	5846000	which I also still super love Togepi.
5846000	5848000	We found a Psyduck,
5848000	5850000	a little Psyduck and we bought it.
5850000	5852000	And he's been our family Psyduck.
5852000	5854000	We've had him ever since, like first
5854000	5856000	gen Psyduck toy.
5856000	5858000	I used to have a little keychain that would light up that was a
5858000	5860000	Psyduck. You turn the little thing and it would just
5860000	5862000	light up. I found my Togepi
5862000	5864000	keychain that you push in the stomach
5864000	5866000	and he goes, tippy tippy!
5866000	5868000	Adorable!
5868000	5870000	Bryce H. responded
5870000	5872000	and said, I'm definitely getting Sun or Moon.
5872000	5874000	I won't choose which one until I see the legendary
5874000	5876000	Pokemon for each. And my favorite
5876000	5878000	Pokemon is Ditto because Ditto
5878000	5880000	can be any Pokemon.
5880000	5882000	That was a good episode of the show too with
5882000	5884000	Duplica. My friend witnessed
5884000	5886000	Duplica one Halloween. We all witnessed Pokemon
5886000	5888000	characters and I witnessed Ash and I
5888000	5890000	had a life-sized Pikachu.
5890000	5892000	My friends, you've met Billy, right? Billy was
5892000	5894000	Team Rocket.
5894000	5896000	He was Team Rocket. He was James
5896000	5898000	and our other friend was Jessie. It was
5898000	5900000	adorable. And then
5900000	5902000	our friend was Duplica. We had a good
5902000	5904000	time. It was silly. I loved it.
5904000	5906000	I think we had a friend that was Misty too.
5906000	5908000	I can't remember. Anyway.
5908000	5910000	Bryce H. continued, oh sorry. I already
5910000	5912000	read that answer. How about Cial who says
5912000	5914000	I'm getting one of them. I don't know which yet.
5914000	5916000	Favorite Pokemon over the years?
5916000	5918000	Kabutops because Horseshoe Crabs
5918000	5920000	are cool.
5920000	5922000	Fifth Dream says, I already pre-ordered
5922000	5924000	Pokemon Moon today. I'm so excited
5924000	5926000	for it. And I love Pikachu.
5926000	5928000	Maybe I'm just a sucker for the way they
5928000	5930000	marketed him. But he's just too cute.
5930000	5932000	I liked him since the very beginning of the anime. I just
5932000	5934000	bought another t-shirt with him on it
5934000	5936000	to celebrate Pokemon Day yesterday.
5936000	5938000	Pika Pika.
5938000	5940000	Degenerate Johnny says, as a Dark Souls fan
5940000	5942000	I have three words. Praise
5942000	5944000	the sun. As far as my
5944000	5946000	favorite Pokemon of all time, it will have to
5946000	5948000	be Ditto because he, she
5948000	5950000	it makes my Pokemon shiny.
5950000	5952000	That's a good reason to get
5952000	5954000	Sun. I'm thinking Wii Fit Trainer.
5954000	5956000	Salute the Sun.
5956000	5958000	Redtertainment says, I've never got any
5958000	5960000	I'm sorry, excuse me, I've never really gotten into
5960000	5962000	any of the Pokemon games, but Red speaks
5962000	5964000	to me for some reason.
5964000	5966000	Never answered about Sun,
5966000	5968000	Moon or any of the other Pokemon, but Red.
5968000	5970000	Veronica Isabel replied
5970000	5972000	and said, I'm getting Moon. My
5972000	5974000	favorite Pokemon is Mewtwo who
5974000	5976000	I always nickname Frieza
5976000	5978000	because of Dragon Ball Z.
5978000	5980000	I almost read that as
5980000	5982000	Franzia because I had something else on my mind.
5982000	5984000	It involves a box.
5984000	5986000	Red the Haze
5986000	5988000	replied over on Facebook and said
5988000	5990000	I'll wait for the available Pokemon list
5990000	5992000	and the versions before I choose though.
5992000	5994000	I haven't played a Pokemon game since Platinum.
5994000	5996000	Pokemon Ekans
5996000	5998000	because it's Snake backwards.
5998000	6000000	It is, it's a very
6000000	6002000	creative name, isn't it?
6002000	6004000	And lastly, Kareem
6004000	6006000	Jay responded and said, my
6006000	6008000	favorite Pokemon is Meowth.
6008000	6010000	Instead of reminding viewers what his name
6010000	6012000	is, he can actually talk.
6012000	6014000	Well, one Meowth
6014000	6016000	can actually talk. I believe not all
6016000	6018000	the Meowths could talk, just that particular one.
6018000	6020000	No, just that one.
6020000	6022000	I have a Pokemon CD.
6022000	6024000	In fact, I don't know if you remember when
6024000	6026000	I got it, I think you were there when I did.
6026000	6028000	But I have one of those little singles and it has the
6028000	6030000	Miyasu song on it.
6030000	6032000	And
6032000	6034000	it's basically him singing
6034000	6036000	about all of the other Pokemon.
6036000	6038000	So it was cute.
6038000	6040000	S2100 Matt says,
6040000	6042000	wow, I never knew that. Mind blown.
6042000	6044000	I'm assuming that's about the Ekans. Is Snake
6044000	6046000	spelled backwards?
6046000	6048000	There's all sorts of weird stuff you see in the
6048000	6050000	games and then you're like, oh my god,
6050000	6052000	how did I never see that before?
6052000	6054000	My god.
6054000	6056000	Alright, anyway.
6056000	6058000	Let's move on. That was it for the Fugu
6058000	6060000	Question of the Week, so let's get back into
6060000	6062000	some gaming news. Loki.
6062000	6064000	Sorry,
6064000	6066000	I was checking up on your friends.
6066000	6068000	Oh yeah, our village
6068000	6070000	is being raided right now, isn't it?
6070000	6072000	Yes,
6072000	6074000	anyways,
6074000	6076000	never
6076000	6078000	really had a favorite Pokemon.
6078000	6080000	But,
6080000	6082000	I don't know.
6082000	6084000	So, this is kind of
6084000	6086000	cool. They're going to take their time
6086000	6088000	on HoloLens, which is good because
6088000	6090000	HoloLens as it is right now kind of sucks.
6090000	6092000	But Microsoft isn't looking
6092000	6094000	to rush it out like they did
6094000	6096000	with, well, not really rushed it out, but
6096000	6098000	they didn't want to put it out like Connect.
6098000	6100000	Basically, they didn't want it to be
6100000	6102000	not adapted
6102000	6104000	as widely as the
6104000	6106000	Connect was. So, for example, they were
6106000	6108000	describing the Connect as not really a pleasant
6108000	6110000	experience. It just wasn't ready.
6110000	6112000	They were saying that the consumer bought a
6112000	6114000	HoloLens today. They would have like 12 things to
6114000	6116000	do with it. And they would say, cool, I
6116000	6118000	bought a $3,000 product. Well,
6118000	6120000	first off, you know, that is the
6120000	6122000	price of the development kit, not the actual
6122000	6124000	MSRP, because if it was $3,000,
6124000	6126000	I'd be like, fuck you. No
6126000	6128000	way that this is going to happen.
6128000	6130000	But, you know,
6130000	6132000	after you've done those 12 things, it's going to be collecting
6132000	6134000	dust. So,
6134000	6136000	right now, this just,
6136000	6138000	you know, going to release it when it's
6138000	6140000	ready.
6140000	6142000	So, we'll have to see when that's ready.
6142000	6144000	Hopefully soon, and hopefully
6144000	6146000	they fix all the problems with it. Maybe they can
6146000	6148000	just do an entirely internal first
6148000	6150000	generation, so that way we're not subjected
6150000	6152000	to it until they get a lot of the kinks worked out.
6152000	6154000	I hope so.
6154000	6156000	It looks interesting, it's just
6156000	6158000	it's not good the way it
6158000	6160000	is right now. It needs, like,
6160000	6162000	if it were to perform
6162000	6164000	like they show it often, like,
6164000	6166000	you know, during their press conferences
6166000	6168000	and stuff with the special cameras and shit,
6168000	6170000	if it actually worked like that,
6170000	6172000	then yes, it would be pretty badass.
6172000	6174000	But it's not. It
6174000	6176000	doesn't look anything like that, so
6176000	6178000	that's the problem.
6178000	6180000	Alright,
6180000	6182000	well, let's talk about an
6182000	6184000	exciting partnership, at least I'm really excited
6184000	6186000	about this. Silicon Studio
6186000	6188000	and Mistwalker are apparently joining
6188000	6190000	together to develop a new game.
6190000	6192000	If you've not heard of Silicon Studio, well,
6192000	6194000	they're the makers of Bravely Default.
6194000	6196000	So, that's the makers of
6196000	6198000	Bravely Default and the makers of
6198000	6200000	Lost Odyssey coming together to make a
6200000	6202000	game. We don't know what it's called,
6202000	6204000	what it looks like, or when it comes out, but
6204000	6206000	of course, more info
6206000	6208000	to come soon, whenever that is.
6208000	6210000	I'm very excited to hear about
6210000	6212000	this. I wonder
6212000	6214000	if this ties to, we saw
6214000	6216000	Mistwalker, the guy from Mistwalker
6216000	6218000	did a little talk, and he teased
6218000	6220000	some art, so I wonder if this could be
6220000	6222000	something about it, who knows.
6222000	6224000	Apparently there was an image that did come out
6224000	6226000	with the announcement as well, so
6226000	6228000	we'll see. Maybe
6228000	6230000	E3 this year is when we'll hear more about it
6230000	6232000	and what system it might be on.
6232000	6234000	Maybe it's an
6234000	6236000	NX game, maybe it's another DS game.
6236000	6238000	Who knows? We'll find out.
6238000	6240000	Moving on,
6240000	6242000	DarkSakura. Sorry, I'm having a very, very
6242000	6244000	important conversation. I bet.
6244000	6246000	I bet. About what's
6246000	6248000	worse, Sadako or
6248000	6250000	Kayako. The Ring
6250000	6252000	versus Ju-on.
6252000	6254000	Anyway.
6254000	6256000	So, Disney's
6256000	6258000	up to some shystey
6258000	6260000	crap. They
6260000	6262000	are wanting to lobby in favor
6262000	6264000	of the TPP,
6264000	6266000	the
6266000	6268000	Trans-Pacific Partnership,
6268000	6270000	big trade thing that's
6270000	6272000	wanting to send our more jobs
6272000	6274000	overseas, and blah, blah, blah.
6274000	6276000	So, the Disney CEO
6276000	6278000	Bob Iger has
6278000	6280000	encouraged employees to enroll in a program
6280000	6282000	that would deduct part of their
6282000	6284000	check, so that it would
6284000	6286000	go into the Disney PAC,
6286000	6288000	the Political Action Committee,
6288000	6290000	and wanting to
6290000	6292000	basically influence
6292000	6294000	the language of the
6294000	6296000	TPP.
6296000	6298000	There's a lot
6298000	6300000	of
6300000	6302000	a lot of
6302000	6304000	scrutiny on this law. I mean, the big
6304000	6306000	thing about it is that
6306000	6308000	big
6308000	6310000	corporations are really in favor of it.
6310000	6312000	It's supposed to make trade a lot easier for
6312000	6314000	them, make things a lot more affordable
6314000	6316000	for them to operate. However,
6316000	6318000	it's pretty much going to screw the local
6318000	6320000	economies of, you know,
6320000	6322000	just about everybody
6322000	6324000	involved. So, the fact
6324000	6326000	that Disney is behind this,
6326000	6328000	I mean, I'm not surprised
6328000	6330000	because they are a big corporation.
6330000	6332000	At the same time, though, they're wanting
6332000	6334000	their employees
6334000	6336000	to contribute
6336000	6338000	to this, too.
6338000	6340000	It just seems a little bit
6340000	6342000	no bueno.
6342000	6344000	I mean, I don't
6344000	6346000	like to talk about my day job a lot
6346000	6348000	on the show, but I will just say
6348000	6350000	in very general terms, for the past
6350000	6352000	15 years, I've worked in the
6352000	6354000	healthcare industry, which is a very
6354000	6356000	controversial thing here in the United States,
6356000	6358000	and I've never been
6358000	6360000	asked to give money
6360000	6362000	to a political cause
6362000	6364000	like this through
6364000	6366000	work. It's very surprising
6366000	6368000	to me. With as
6368000	6370000	high visibility
6370000	6372000	and how politically charged
6372000	6374000	healthcare has been over the past
6374000	6376000	15 years, I'm really
6376000	6378000	surprised. I'm seeing it here
6378000	6380000	and I've never been asked to do it
6380000	6382000	in my industry.
6382000	6384000	I worked for one company for 14 years.
6384000	6386000	I'm really surprised. I was never asked to do that.
6386000	6388000	I work in
6388000	6390000	the tech industry.
6390000	6392000	I've been very careful to say, to not
6392000	6394000	say who I work for. Only a few people know.
6394000	6396000	It's nobody's business. Exactly.
6396000	6398000	We are happy to spend our nights with you,
6398000	6400000	but our days are private. But my company
6400000	6402000	has never asked us.
6402000	6404000	We've just been asked to
6404000	6406000	I guess
6406000	6408000	show integrity in our
6408000	6410000	you know, how we handle ourselves, but we've
6410000	6412000	never been asked specifically
6412000	6414000	to support this cause, to support this cause,
6414000	6416000	to support this cause. So,
6416000	6418000	this is just really
6418000	6420000	I don't know. It's just
6420000	6422000	really stinks
6422000	6424000	to me. Yeah. It's interesting.
6424000	6426000	Alright, well
6426000	6428000	let's move on with some more news. We'll see
6428000	6430000	what comes of all that. Loki.
6430000	6432000	Alright, so to kind of help
6432000	6434000	push the whole
6434000	6436000	VR thing. As I mentioned, I was almost going to
6436000	6438000	get a Gear VR, but I kind of decided not to.
6438000	6440000	If you
6440000	6442000	pre-order a
6442000	6444000	Samsung Galaxy S7
6444000	6446000	or S7 Edge,
6446000	6448000	I guess starting February
6448000	6450000	23rd, they're also going to
6450000	6452000	kind of sweeten the pot by including a
6452000	6454000	Gear VR.
6454000	6456000	And along
6456000	6458000	with that, I guess they're throwing in
6458000	6460000	six VR games
6460000	6462000	and it depends on which
6462000	6464000	provider you purchased it from.
6464000	6466000	But they include such games
6466000	6468000	like Eve Gunjack, Esper 2,
6468000	6470000	Dead Secret, Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes,
6470000	6472000	Start Chart,
6472000	6474000	and Hero Bound for one of them.
6474000	6476000	Ashar 2,
6476000	6478000	Darknet Drift, Keep Talking, Nobody
6478000	6480000	Explodes, Start Chart, and Hero
6480000	6482000	Bound for another one, and Lands' Ed
6482000	6484000	Mortal Blitz VR, Deer Hunter VR,
6484000	6486000	Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes,
6486000	6488000	Ocean Rift, and Hero Bound
6488000	6490000	for the third one.
6490000	6492000	It's kind of neat, I mean, I just
6492000	6494000	I don't know. I mean, if I was going to
6494000	6496000	purchase a new phone, I'd love to get, you know, that
6496000	6498000	shit free, but
6498000	6500000	I just bought a phone, so I don't think I'll
6500000	6502000	be upgrading anytime soon to the
6502000	6504000	to the brand new S7
6504000	6506000	because I have an S6.
6506000	6508000	Don't you hate that when you buy the hardware
6508000	6510000	and then the very next week, oh, now the hardware comes
6510000	6512000	with games. Well, you know, it's free stuff.
6512000	6514000	Yeah, and I don't know, I don't know how to see how much
6514000	6516000	the S7 is and what's so cool about
6516000	6518000	it, I mean. Well, they want
6518000	6520000	to move these units, so they have to put
6520000	6522000	in something, you know, it's like, it's the whole
6522000	6524000	Nintendo sold the Wii through
6524000	6526000	Wii Sports, and I'm not saying any of these games
6526000	6528000	are necessarily at the level of Wii Sports, but you have
6528000	6530000	to have those games that are gonna, you know,
6530000	6532000	make people want to buy the hardware, really.
6532000	6534000	That's why I think it's really rough
6534000	6536000	when you release your hardware with no
6536000	6538000	pack-in games. What they need to do is just
6538000	6540000	include a fucking, a three month
6540000	6542000	subscription, the virtual real porn,
6542000	6544000	and there you go. That'll
6544000	6546000	sell tons of those units.
6546000	6548000	Alright.
6548000	6550000	I didn't talk a lot about this game this week
6550000	6552000	because I didn't play it myself,
6552000	6554000	but Alan has been playing a lot of,
6554000	6556000	and you'll be proud to hear this, Loki, he's been playing a lot of
6556000	6558000	Fallout 4, in fact, I think he's in there playing it right now,
6558000	6560000	but he's off work tonight because
6560000	6562000	they, with that whole little
6562000	6564000	gold statue show that's going on right now,
6564000	6566000	there's not a lot of people answering polls,
6566000	6568000	so he's in there playing Fallout 4
6568000	6570000	right now, so I watched him play some of it,
6570000	6572000	and I was like, show me killing mobs,
6572000	6574000	and he got
6574000	6576000	his butt kicked.
6576000	6578000	It was funny. But anyway,
6578000	6580000	talking about Fallout 4, I guess
6580000	6582000	there's a new survival mode
6582000	6584000	that is gonna be coming out for Fallout 4, and Bethesda
6584000	6586000	actually confirmed it. Some of the details
6586000	6588000	had leaked on, I guess, Reddit
6588000	6590000	somewhere, and the publisher came out and
6590000	6592000	confirmed it. Basically, you'll
6592000	6594000	be able to enable this with a menu swipe,
6594000	6596000	and you'll be able to do more
6596000	6598000	and take more damage.
6598000	6600000	Manual and quick save options will be disabled,
6600000	6602000	you have to sleep at least an hour
6602000	6604000	to save, and there is no
6604000	6606000	fast travel.
6606000	6608000	Enemies won't show up on your compass, and fatigue
6608000	6610000	will matter. So,
6610000	6612000	yeah, sounds like it's
6612000	6614000	gonna be a little bit more of a hardcore mode,
6614000	6616000	but we'll probably make for some good
6616000	6618000	livestream feeds and all that stuff, those people
6618000	6620000	like to play hardcore and show off and all that
6620000	6622000	stuff. By the way, if you've been
6622000	6624000	eagerly anticipating a mod
6624000	6626000	support on the various platforms,
6626000	6628000	we now have some time frames
6628000	6630000	as to when that mod support is finally
6630000	6632000	going to come out, and that was via an
6632000	6634000	interview with Game Informer, where
6634000	6636000	the PC will be getting its official
6636000	6638000	mod support in April. I say official
6638000	6640000	because you know the mods are already out there.
6640000	6642000	They're already out there. They're just not official, but
6642000	6644000	official modding comes in April.
6644000	6646000	Xbox One will start getting the mods in
6646000	6648000	May, and PlayStation 4 in
6648000	6650000	June. I'm pretty excited about that.
6650000	6652000	Yeah, that'll be pretty awesome.
6652000	6654000	He did say the full quote,
6654000	6656000	our goal is between the first two DLCs.
6656000	6658000	It'll be up at that time on PC
6658000	6660000	in April. All that stuff will go
6660000	6662000	up on PC. People are beta testing it.
6662000	6664000	There will be a lag on consoles.
6664000	6666000	We want to get it up and have it work. It'll
6666000	6668000	probably be a good month before it hits
6668000	6670000	Xbox One, and another month for
6670000	6672000	PlayStation 4. So notice how
6672000	6674000	he didn't really quote June. He said
6674000	6676000	about a month, so it could take
6676000	6678000	a little longer if you're on PlayStation 4.
6678000	6680000	Yeah, I was going to say one of the things
6680000	6682000	that they did announce while we were out
6682000	6684000	was the actual Fallout 4 DLCs,
6684000	6686000	or at least the first bit of it.
6686000	6688000	They're saying they're adding more on top of that, but this
6688000	6690000	is what you get for your season pass right
6690000	6692000	now, which it will be going up to $60
6692000	6694000	in March, so if you were interested
6694000	6696000	to purchase it now. But the first
6696000	6698000	three pieces of DLC, they've got the Automatron,
6698000	6700000	which is coming out for $9.99
6700000	6702000	in March, and that adds
6702000	6704000	some new robots. You can create your own
6704000	6706000	robots, that type of stuff.
6706000	6708000	You mix limbs and stuff together.
6708000	6710000	Then in April, Wasteland
6710000	6712000	Workshop, where you can create your own fighting
6712000	6714000	pits, as well as some new
6714000	6716000	settlement things, and then finally
6716000	6718000	kind of the actual big
6718000	6720000	expansion, which is in May, called Far Harbor,
6720000	6722000	which is going to be $24.99
6722000	6724000	separately, but it's all included
6724000	6726000	in the season pass, plus
6726000	6728000	other things that they haven't announced yet,
6728000	6730000	so definitely check it out.
6730000	6732000	Alright, it's time
6732000	6734000	to get to the mailbag! Hey, what do you know,
6734000	6736000	DarkSakura, you're here to do it after all.
6736000	6738000	Sorry, give me a second.
6738000	6740000	That's okay, you thought you'd be gone, but
6740000	6742000	No, I think you should open it and read it.
6742000	6744000	I'm actually feeling a little under the weather
6744000	6746000	still, so I'd really prefer it if you could do it.
6746000	6748000	I'm the one that has had a headache
6748000	6750000	since Thursday. Maybe we'll make Loki do it.
6750000	6752000	Hold on. Loki should read the email.
6752000	6754000	I don't even know if he knows how to log in.
6754000	6756000	I don't even know how to read!
6758000	6760000	I can maybe do one if you really
6760000	6762000	want me to, just my voice is
6762000	6764000	hurting tonight.
6764000	6766000	You can always email us.
6766000	6768000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6768000	6770000	is the place to send us emails.
6770000	6772000	And we will happily
6772000	6774000	read your emails every week here at
6774000	6776000	Orange Lounge Radio, and respond to them
6776000	6778000	in kind.
6780000	6782000	Come on, Hoback, log me in.
6782000	6784000	There we go.
6786000	6788000	Alright, okay, you ready?
6788000	6790000	Yes.
6790000	6792000	This one's
6792000	6794000	labeled color from last week.
6794000	6796000	Hey, OLR family, please don't
6796000	6798000	take this the wrong way, but when Derek
6798000	6800000	called in last week, I thought it was
6800000	6802000	Latrice Royale from RuPaul's Drag Race, LOL.
6802000	6804000	Wouldn't it be cool to interview
6804000	6806000	one of the drag queens that play video games?
6806000	6808000	Long time podcast listener, DJIQ.
6808000	6810000	I will tell you this.
6810000	6812000	I have
6812000	6814000	done an interview
6814000	6816000	with one of the drag queens from RuPaul's Drag Race.
6816000	6818000	You did? I did Tatiana
6818000	6820000	from season two.
6820000	6822000	Back when I was writing
6822000	6824000	for Tiara's
6824000	6826000	website thing that she was doing before.
6826000	6828000	The Geek Life, or whatever it's called, right?
6828000	6830000	Yeah, Geek Life.
6830000	6832000	I'm laughing because I'm not
6832000	6834000	sure Derek will see the
6834000	6836000	great compliment that
6836000	6838000	is in your comparison there,
6838000	6840000	but in all seriousness,
6840000	6842000	I actually don't
6842000	6844000	think I hear it at all.
6844000	6846000	When I think of Latrice Royale,
6846000	6848000	I think of the laugh. Latrice Royale has a
6848000	6850000	very epic laugh. Have you ever heard
6850000	6852000	Latrice Royale's laugh, Dark Sakura?
6852000	6854000	No, I haven't listened to Latrice Royale
6854000	6856000	at all.
6856000	6858000	You don't know what you've been missing.
6858000	6860000	She's very large and in charge
6860000	6862000	and she says that herself.
6862000	6864000	Drag queen, and she has a
6864000	6866000	laugh that you will remember through the ages.
6866000	6868000	In fact,
6868000	6870000	I'm trying to find the one...
6870000	6872000	Okay, here's her laugh.
6872000	6874000	There was one that was set to death metal.
6874000	6876000	I can't find it though.
6884000	6886000	See, it's always like a scream, right?
6886000	6888000	That's it. But here's the thing.
6888000	6890000	I think you know who sounds like that.
6890000	6892000	It's Captain Spike from GameBooey.org.
6892000	6894000	If you ever get him to laugh,
6894000	6896000	listen to it, because he'll do that same thing
6896000	6898000	where he goes,
6898000	6900000	he'll kind of do that same little scream.
6900000	6902000	When I think of
6902000	6904000	Latrice Royale laughing,
6904000	6906000	I think of Captain Spike from GameBooey.org.
6906000	6908000	There's a clip out there
6908000	6910000	where it's mixed to death metal, and it's so
6910000	6912000	funny. I wish I could find it.
6912000	6914000	How about I go to the next email? How about it?
6914000	6916000	Okay, this is from Raginator.
6916000	6918000	Yes, I'm reading your email.
6918000	6920000	Even after I said I wasn't, because I'm here.
6920000	6922000	We got to the mailbag early tonight.
6922000	6924000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6924000	6926000	Hi everyone, it's Raginator yet again.
6926000	6928000	I appreciate that there won't be a show
6928000	6930000	on Sunday 2-21, and odds are
6930000	6932000	this email may be slightly out of date by then,
6932000	6934000	but I wanted to update everyone real quick,
6934000	6936000	and if need be, supplement this email with
6936000	6938000	a quick, short email in the days
6938000	6940000	to come. Last weekend I received
6940000	6942000	my, um,
6942000	6944000	one check for a computer,
6944000	6946000	and I had the usable funds in my bank
6946000	6948000	account by the 16th.
6948000	6950000	Unfortunately, the one PC that I was
6950000	6952000	initially eyeing was out of stock by the time
6952000	6954000	I had the opportunity to order it.
6954000	6956000	That being said, I ordered this one.
6956000	6958000	It's a different one. I'm not going to go about
6958000	6960000	the specs on it.
6960000	6962000	I also ordered extra
6962000	6964000	RAM, a webcam, an additional Blu-ray
6964000	6966000	drive. Earlier today I received the PC
6966000	6968000	itself, and I'm still waiting on the
6968000	6970000	other three items.
6970000	6972000	All that being said, it will still be a little while
6972000	6974000	yet before I have my internet and whatnot
6974000	6976000	turned back on. I still need to
6976000	6978000	save up for the two additional months so I can buy
6978000	6980000	two more things, a cheapo barebones
6980000	6982000	TV, and one of those fancy gaming headsets
6982000	6984000	that's capable of surround sound.
6984000	6986000	That being said, I anticipate my internet
6986000	6988000	and whatnot being turned
6988000	6990000	back on by May 1st.
6990000	6992000	Anyone talk to you soon?
6992000	6994000	It's to me. Never mind.
6994000	6996000	That's for Majornator. I read your email.
6996000	6998000	Mostly.
6998000	7000000	And he's back.
7000000	7002000	Also in chat.
7002000	7004000	He got that computer situation worked out.
7004000	7006000	Last email.
7006000	7008000	Last email.
7008000	7010000	Is long.
7010000	7012000	This comes from
7012000	7014000	I don't have a name on it so I'm just going to say
7014000	7016000	well, I have a full name on it but a new
7016000	7018000	nickname, so I'll just say Delvin is who it's from.
7018000	7020000	Hey, OLR. Glad
7020000	7022000	to have you guys back this week because I am
7022000	7024000	upset about the launch of Street Fighter 5.
7024000	7026000	It was kind of crap, wasn't it?
7026000	7028000	The game launched with many features not present
7028000	7030000	in the game.
7030000	7032000	The store is not available. The online battle lounges
7032000	7034000	only allow you to play with one other friend
7034000	7036000	in an arcade mode. An empty
7036000	7038000	story mode and extremely piss poor online
7038000	7040000	at launch. Amen to that.
7040000	7042000	Oh my god, it was not great.
7042000	7044000	Now,
7044000	7046000	I fully understand that high demand of any
7046000	7048000	new game will shut down the servers on launch
7048000	7050000	day and a few days after
7050000	7052000	that, so I'm willing to let that slide. However,
7052000	7054000	they had many other
7054000	7056000	issues once things stabilized.
7056000	7058000	Not being able to play with friends, which is
7058000	7060000	one of the few things you can currently do in
7060000	7062000	the game. Also,
7062000	7064000	when the servers are not online, you don't get
7064000	7066000	any in-game currency for things
7066000	7068000	to purchase, such as new characters
7068000	7070000	and costumes. This
7070000	7072000	brings me to my next issue,
7072000	7074000	being the lack of characters and high price
7074000	7076000	tag of the game. 16 characters
7076000	7078000	with more on the way at $6 each.
7078000	7080000	You can purchase characters with
7080000	7082000	in-game money at $100,000
7082000	7084000	per character and you'll only
7084000	7086000	earn $25 per loss and $50
7086000	7088000	per win. To keep this short,
7088000	7090000	I'll get to my point here and say that this
7090000	7092000	model concerns me
7092000	7094000	and is a trend that I see starting to
7094000	7096000	increase instead of decrease. Why do
7096000	7098000	developers continue to launch games that are
7098000	7100000	half done, collect our money, and then fix it
7100000	7102000	later? When did this become acceptable?
7102000	7104000	I purchased the game under the pretense
7104000	7106000	of it's done and we'll add more
7106000	7108000	extra stuff later. Now, here's 50%
7108000	7110000	of the game now and they give you
7110000	7112000	25% in a month and the rest
7112000	7114000	over the next couple of months at $6
7114000	7116000	a pop. But give us full pop now.
7116000	7118000	This is starting to make
7118000	7120000	an extremely expensive, make gaming an
7120000	7122000	extremely expensive hobby. Your $70 game
7122000	7124000	just become over $100. Canadian
7124000	7126000	dollars here, our dollar is poo right now.
7126000	7128000	What are your guys' thoughts on all of this?
7128000	7130000	Love you guys, Delvin.
7130000	7132000	Yeah, I gave you my thoughts, I agree with everything
7132000	7134000	you just said.
7134000	7136000	Cosigned.
7136000	7138000	I was like, they gave us
7138000	7140000	Karin and no Sakura.
7140000	7142000	That was like
7142000	7144000	nailed for me right there. Well, it's not even
7144000	7146000	like necessarily who's in and who's out
7146000	7148000	and the characters they picked and so forth, but it's
7148000	7150000	just the fact that the game is only like
7150000	7152000	half there, you know?
7152000	7154000	There's this really disturbing trending
7154000	7156000	by the way Delvin is from the podcast
7156000	7158000	Video Game Realness and is a pal
7158000	7160000	of mine on Reading is Fundamental
7160000	7162000	so if you, which I
7162000	7164000	realise is a little
7164000	7166000	separated because it's not exactly nerdy
7166000	7168000	but it's nerdy of a different sort. But anyway
7168000	7170000	so
7170000	7172000	we have this disturbing
7172000	7174000	trend going on in gaming where
7174000	7176000	they want your money for
7176000	7178000	less product up front
7178000	7180000	and I think in a way
7180000	7182000	we have Kickstarter to thank for some of
7182000	7184000	that.
7184000	7186000	Because companies have seen that people
7186000	7188000	will pay a lot of money
7188000	7190000	in advance for a product that doesn't exist
7190000	7192000	yet. And you know, I think
7192000	7194000	Kickstarter was really meant to do
7194000	7196000	indie development and indie support but you see
7196000	7198000	a lot of bigger developers are getting up on that.
7198000	7200000	I mean hell, Shenmue 3
7200000	7202000	announced on the Sony stage
7202000	7204000	and how many people have given money to that
7204000	7206000	for a product that's not even out and we don't
7206000	7208000	know if it's going to necessarily be at the same
7208000	7210000	quality as games 1 and 2. I mean
7210000	7212000	it might be, I'm hoping it will be.
7212000	7214000	I'm having faith in the
7214000	7216000	creators and so forth but the reality
7216000	7218000	is it might not be. And
7218000	7220000	now we have this case of Street Fighter 5
7220000	7222000	where they're promising, well it'll all
7222000	7224000	be there, just not right now
7224000	7226000	and we had to get this out before the fiscal
7226000	7228000	year is up so you know, just
7228000	7230000	buy it, support it and have fun.
7230000	7232000	All you fighting game players are really only interested
7232000	7234000	in the versus mode anyway, right?
7234000	7236000	And it's like, not me.
7236000	7238000	I prefer the casual stuff
7238000	7240000	I wanted a better story mode.
7240000	7242000	I mean seriously.
7242000	7244000	Or a story mode at all.
7244000	7246000	It had this dinky version of a story mode
7246000	7248000	and it was
7248000	7250000	really very dinky. I mean
7250000	7252000	I was used to having, you play through
7252000	7254000	all of this stuff and you
7254000	7256000	get a real ending. There were no endings.
7256000	7258000	It was just like,
7258000	7260000	precursor story modes.
7260000	7262000	It's like, what the hell Capcom? No,
7262000	7264000	this isn't going to fly. You were only
7264000	7266000	minorly forgiven because there's an U.S. Attorney
7266000	7268000	on the way. But then, I mean
7268000	7270000	this is a trend that's continuing.
7270000	7272000	Blizzard, now
7272000	7274000	not even is there a pre-order
7274000	7276000	for Overwatch.
7276000	7278000	There's a pre-pay for
7278000	7280000	Overwatch. If you're willing to pay
7280000	7282000	all 60 bucks up front or whatever
7282000	7284000	it is, probably 70 for the collector's edition,
7284000	7286000	you get a couple extra crappy skins
7286000	7288000	in the game and so forth.
7288000	7290000	Are they even guaranteeing access to the beta
7290000	7292000	if you pre-play? I don't think they are.
7292000	7294000	And this is a really disturbing trend
7294000	7296000	that's happening in gaming and it is imperative
7296000	7298000	that we vote with our wallets.
7298000	7300000	And I know it sucks
7300000	7302000	for a game like Street Fighter V
7302000	7304000	because it's
7304000	7306000	Street Fighter V. Any indication
7306000	7308000	before that that this was going to be the case.
7308000	7310000	Yeah, I know. And this is one of those
7310000	7312000	things where unfortunately now Street Fighter V
7312000	7314000	this is going to have
7314000	7316000	repercussions for a long time.
7316000	7318000	Because I think for a lot of us now
7318000	7320000	it's lesson learned.
7320000	7322000	And I don't know about you guys
7322000	7324000	but I don't plan on buying a game that's
7324000	7326000	not fucking done or that doesn't have
7326000	7328000	the stuff that I want in it.
7328000	7330000	You know, indie developers I'll probably
7330000	7332000	cut a little more slack on things like
7332000	7334000	Kickstarter and so forth but you know
7334000	7336000	Street Fighter V, there's not
7336000	7338000	a lot of excuse for this.
7338000	7340000	You have to win 2,000 matches
7340000	7342000	to unlock one character.
7342000	7344000	It's a little silly.
7344000	7346000	Bob Coffee in chat
7346000	7348000	says, Street Fighter V came out
7348000	7350000	early mainly because of the Capcom Pro
7350000	7352000	Tour. And Act Def says
7352000	7354000	and it's probably the best Street Fighter to date.
7354000	7356000	But I just
7356000	7358000	if you're
7358000	7360000	into the certain you know
7360000	7362000	player versus player
7362000	7364000	and the tournament thing is what you're all about
7364000	7366000	only. But I don't know. I didn't
7366000	7368000	buy it. Just like I didn't buy Mortal Combat
7368000	7370000	X which to be fair at least
7370000	7372000	Mortal Combat X wasn't
7372000	7374000	fucking half finished. But I knew
7374000	7376000	with Mortal Combat X they would
7376000	7378000	release all these character packs and soon
7378000	7380000	enough there'd be a game of the year edition
7380000	7382000	and oh look what's happening.
7382000	7384000	Except
7384000	7386000	now they're still not done.
7386000	7388000	Now there's a whole wave 2 of downloadable
7388000	7390000	characters so there'll be like a second
7390000	7392000	game of the year edition at some point.
7392000	7394000	I don't know. Rama in chat
7394000	7396000	says, this half done game was released
7396000	7398000	for those going to Evo to train.
7398000	7400000	Great. I hope only the people going to
7400000	7402000	Evo to train bought it.
7402000	7404000	Unfortunately we all know
7404000	7406000	that's not the case. A lot of the rest of us
7406000	7408000	got suckered into doing it. But now
7408000	7410000	it's a question that
7410000	7412000	game previewers and game reviewers
7412000	7414000	and people will have to
7414000	7416000	ask game makers as embarrassing
7416000	7418000	as it is. Is your game done?
7418000	7420000	Will your game be fully featured
7420000	7422000	at launch? And I can't
7422000	7424000	wait to see what fucking
7424000	7426000	dance around the issue answers we're going to get from that
7426000	7428000	question. This is another minor thing too
7428000	7430000	but they changed some of the characters moves.
7430000	7432000	The way they control. Just saying.
7432000	7434000	Martin
7434000	7436000	in chat says, who cares about
7436000	7438000	Street Fighter anyway? Where's my new Tekken
7438000	7440000	at?
7440000	7442000	Bob Coffee in chat says,
7442000	7444000	it's shitty but they did this for the hardcore
7444000	7446000	target audience. I don't know. Like
7446000	7448000	I respect your guys' opinion
7448000	7450000	but I have to be completely honest
7450000	7452000	and say, I feel like you guys are
7452000	7454000	excusing this. And like
7454000	7456000	if I'm not a part
7456000	7458000	of that
7458000	7460000	audience that is doing Evo or whatever
7460000	7462000	I don't see the excuse for this
7462000	7464000	at all. There is no excuse.
7464000	7466000	Fuck Street Fighter, where's
7466000	7468000	my Rival Schools 3?
7468000	7470000	And it's not excusing when
7470000	7472000	people are defending them. They're a fucking
7472000	7474000	company. You don't need to defend them.
7474000	7476000	They need to fucking put out a product that's working.
7476000	7478000	If it's not ready in time for Evo
7478000	7480000	boo fucking who? You should have worked
7480000	7482000	harder on it then. It'll be there for
7482000	7484000	next year's Evo. Exactly.
7484000	7486000	Oh poor baby. Your game's
7486000	7488000	not out in time for the fighting tournament.
7488000	7490000	Well, too fucking bad.
7492000	7494000	ActDevtonChat says, I get the complaints
7494000	7496000	it's not excusable but the content is
7496000	7498000	going to be there anyway. I mean
7498000	7500000	to be fair, to give you guys
7500000	7502000	some slack here because I want to
7502000	7504000	respect all opinions and so forth.
7504000	7506000	I get the whole fact that at least they're presenting
7506000	7508000	a roadmap on, okay
7508000	7510000	this is where we want the game to be
7510000	7512000	and this is how we're going to get there.
7512000	7514000	But from my perspective
7514000	7516000	I'm like, okay great. I'll buy
7516000	7518000	the game when it's done. Because that'll be
7518000	7520000	about the time maybe it'll go on sale. I'll
7520000	7522000	get an even better deal out of it. Hurray.
7522000	7524000	So.
7524000	7526000	ActDevtonChat says
7526000	7528000	remember Splatoon? I
7528000	7530000	I still feel like Splatoon
7530000	7532000	was a fully featured game when it was
7532000	7534000	launched. They added stuff to it.
7534000	7536000	It was a full game when it was done. Yeah, they added
7536000	7538000	maps. The things that they added
7538000	7540000	to Splatoon, I feel like
7540000	7542000	other companies would have charged me money for
7542000	7544000	to be quite honest. I mean did they
7544000	7546000	add a lot to Splatoon? Yeah, they did.
7546000	7548000	And I think Capcom would have charged you for it.
7548000	7550000	Or made you get a million
7550000	7552000	billion splat points when you
7552000	7554000	only get five in a match.
7554000	7556000	I think with Splatoon you at least had
7556000	7558000	you had a fully functional single player
7558000	7560000	mode in Splatoon.
7560000	7562000	That's actually pretty darn
7562000	7564000	good. It has boss fights that are fun and everything else.
7564000	7566000	So.
7566000	7568000	I don't know. Alright.
7568000	7570000	Yes, but the voice chat thing
7570000	7572000	is still an issue. I will say that.
7572000	7574000	Alright. Anyhow.
7574000	7576000	Thank you for doing the emails tonight
7576000	7578000	Dark Soccer. I appreciate it. But I understand
7578000	7580000	you are going to head out and be on your way
7580000	7582000	for the night. Yes.
7582000	7584000	Do you have any final thoughts for the audience? Actually
7584000	7586000	we're getting to FUs. Do you want to quickly stick around
7586000	7588000	and do your FUs? Sure, I'll stick around and do the FUs.
7588000	7590000	As your final thought here. Alright, let's get to the FUs
7590000	7592000	of the week. By the way, if you want to send us emails. Hey, if you
7592000	7594000	want to talk the Street Fighter 5 thing, you know,
7594000	7596000	I realize people out there might disagree with me. Cool.
7596000	7598000	Just email us. Participate at
7598000	7600000	orangeonsrader.com.
7600000	7602000	See you next time.
7630000	7632000	I laid down at 10 AM.
7632000	7634000	I didn't get up until 5.
7634000	7636000	And I still have the same damn headache.
7636000	7638000	So. I hate it.
7638000	7640000	It needs to go away. And I'm going home. Bye.
7640000	7642000	Uh.
7642000	7644000	I will piggyback on that.
7644000	7646000	I'm going to cut Loki off and piggyback on that. Because FU
7646000	7648000	to being sick. Because being sick has been the
7648000	7650000	word. I have been. I have been like
7650000	7652000	Cootie Boy this year and I hate it. Like I
7652000	7654000	just keep getting sick and I won't stop. And yes, I've been to
7654000	7656000	a doctor and it's just kind of one of those.
7656000	7658000	People get sick.
7658000	7660000	Nothing serious. Just ruined your day.
7660000	7662000	Ah. Loki.
7662000	7664000	Um. Just FU to
7664000	7666000	not being able to concentrate on programming.
7666000	7668000	I try.
7668000	7670000	But it's just not coming to me. I'm not in the groove
7670000	7672000	I guess.
7672000	7674000	Alright.
7676000	7678000	Let's move on and get
7678000	7680000	to just a couple more stories for you guys.
7680000	7682000	Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877
7682000	7684000	Game OLR. username on Skype.
7684000	7686000	Orange Lounge Radio.
7686000	7688000	Loki. Alright. So this is
7688000	7690000	kind of cool. So apparently
7690000	7692000	they're going to be
7692000	7694000	kick starting a
7694000	7696000	Jay and Silent Bob game
7696000	7698000	called Jay and Silent Bob
7698000	7700000	The Chronic Blunt Punch.
7700000	7702000	And it's a side scroller
7702000	7704000	beat em up game.
7704000	7706000	And it's I guess going to
7706000	7708000	Kickstarter.
7708000	7710000	But they're doing some sort of crowd funding for that.
7712000	7714000	And apparently if it's successful they're trying to seek
7714000	7716000	a goal of $400,000.
7716000	7718000	And apparently this is
7718000	7720000	a little bit different. It's not
7720000	7722000	Kickstarter actually.
7722000	7724000	So they're doing through
7724000	7726000	Fig. So they're doing
7726000	7728000	it's where you can actually
7728000	7730000	invest money and get a sort of return
7730000	7732000	on that.
7732000	7734000	Why don't they do
7734000	7736000	$420,000?
7736000	7738000	Because they're actually
7738000	7740000	they're trying to get like
7740000	7742000	more than $400,000.
7742000	7744000	Okay, but I still think my joke was funny.
7744000	7746000	I know. I understand the joke.
7746000	7748000	Yeah. That would have been pretty cool.
7748000	7750000	But
7750000	7752000	yeah. I actually haven't really looked too
7752000	7754000	much of this platform though. I remember hearing
7754000	7756000	about this a little bit where they were actually doing some
7756000	7758000	of the crowd funding through that and it wasn't like
7758000	7760000	Kickstarter where you just get like the game you actually
7760000	7762000	can get returns on it because you're an actual
7762000	7764000	investor in that. So it would be kind of interesting
7764000	7766000	to check it out.
7766000	7768000	But $400,000 for
7768000	7770000	Jay and Silent Bob fighting game.
7770000	7772000	Or beat-em-up game.
7772000	7774000	I can see that.
7776000	7778000	What I would love to invest money in
7778000	7780000	is more
7780000	7782000	episodes of the Jay and Silent Bob cartoon
7782000	7784000	or the Clerks cartoon is
7784000	7786000	what I want to invest money in.
7786000	7788000	So can we put up like a crowd funding for that
7788000	7790000	please?
7790000	7792000	Because it would be awesome.
7792000	7794000	Alright. Well
7794000	7796000	I don't know. Maybe this
7796000	7798000	would be one of the few games that you could convince
7798000	7800000	me to pay money for
7800000	7802000	up front without seeing anything.
7802000	7804000	But Kojima and Del Toro.
7804000	7806000	That's right. Here we go again. Talking about
7806000	7808000	this. But that is because there was a talk
7808000	7810000	at DICE at 2016
7810000	7812000	between Hideo Kojima and joining him on stage
7812000	7814000	Guillermo Del Toro. Even
7814000	7816000	though Del Toro had said at one point I will never
7816000	7818000	again get involved in video games.
7818000	7820000	At DICE
7820000	7822000	he had basically talked about how
7822000	7824000	the whole video game thing came together and so forth.
7824000	7826000	He said the creativity
7826000	7828000	can be stifled by the
7828000	7830000	bastards with money. But basically
7830000	7832000	made it sound like if Kojima wants him to do
7832000	7834000	something again, he'll do it.
7834000	7836000	Hmm. Very interesting.
7836000	7838000	By the way, Del Toro also said
7838000	7840000	that as far as what he's playing, he's playing Fallout 4.
7840000	7842000	But he dies a lot.
7842000	7844000	So
7844000	7846000	that's pretty cool. I would
7846000	7848000	definitely buy
7848000	7850000	I would throw money at whatever Kojima and
7850000	7852000	Del Toro would do without having seen
7852000	7854000	it at first. It's one of the few
7854000	7856000	things I'd break the rules for.
7856000	7858000	Alright.
7858000	7860000	That's it. I know we're
7860000	7862000	to it a little early, but
7862000	7864000	we're to the Skype line at 1877 Game
7864000	7866000	OLR or username on Skype, Orange
7866000	7868000	Lounge Radio. The Skype line is open now
7868000	7870000	if you want to give us a call. 1877
7870000	7872000	Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange
7872000	7874000	Lounge Radio. All one word
7874000	7876000	while we wait for some calls. I don't know if Loki has
7876000	7878000	any last minute stories over there. Yes.
7878000	7880000	Apparently there is a patent
7880000	7882000	from Sony for a new
7882000	7884000	glove-like device.
7884000	7886000	People are comparing it to a power
7886000	7888000	glove for
7888000	7890000	PlayStation VR at least. It looks like some
7890000	7892000	sort of PlayStation move-like
7892000	7894000	device that you would use like hand
7894000	7896000	gestures with the glove
7896000	7898000	to kind of control the game.
7898000	7900000	Cool.
7900000	7902000	Yeah, maybe they're
7902000	7904000	going to do the power glove right or something like that.
7904000	7906000	That'd be kind of cool if that was something that they announced at this
7906000	7908000	VR thing. I'd be down with that. I wonder
7908000	7910000	if it isn't something that goes along with the VR
7910000	7912000	thing. It would be very interesting. The way the lights
7912000	7914000	were on the hands, very much could be.
7914000	7916000	Anyway, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
7916000	7918000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7918000	7920000	Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Rama. Hey, Rama.
7920000	7922000	How's it going? Good to hear from you.
7922000	7924000	Good, good. Things are going good. I actually have a day off
7924000	7926000	today, so I had to run around and take care of some stuff.
7926000	7928000	Oh, rough day to have the day off.
7928000	7930000	I guess,
7930000	7932000	but at least it gives me time to go to the gym, do you know?
7932000	7934000	Oh yeah, brah. You got to work out.
7934000	7936000	Seriously, man. Seriously.
7936000	7938000	So you didn't go to Katsucon or
7938000	7940000	MagFest this year, right? No,
7940000	7942000	because my job has this rule
7942000	7944000	where you have to request
7944000	7946000	three weeks in advance. I'm so used
7946000	7948000	to requesting a week
7948000	7950000	to two weeks in advance, but not
7950000	7952000	three weeks, so I kind of forgot, and I'm like,
7952000	7954000	you know what? I'm kind of gearing up for
7954000	7956000	another convention in April I'm looking forward to,
7956000	7958000	so I'm just going to save money, pay
7958000	7960000	bills, and play the adult game for a
7960000	7962000	little bit. That's fair. I am going to really try
7962000	7964000	to go back next year, so we'll see.
7964000	7966000	Definitely, definitely.
7966000	7968000	And I will make my way out there next year.
7968000	7970000	Hooray, I would love to have a Rama buddy
7970000	7972000	there with all my other buddies.
7972000	7974000	What's on your mind? What do we owe the phone call tonight,
7974000	7976000	OLR?
7976000	7978000	So, in case you haven't
7978000	7980000	heard, one of my favorite
7980000	7982000	strategy RPG games, Project Cross Zone
7982000	7984000	2, came out last Tuesday.
7984000	7986000	And I've been in the middle of playing
7986000	7988000	other games, so when this game
7988000	7990000	came out, I stopped
7990000	7992000	playing all my other games, and I've currently
7992000	7994000	been playing through this for the last two weeks.
7994000	7996000	I just picked up Mega Man Legacy Collection,
7996000	7998000	and it's actually sitting on my shelf
7998000	8000000	on a pile of games to play
8000000	8002000	when Project Cross Zone 2 is
8002000	8004000	done. Did you get the gold amiibo and all that?
8004000	8006000	I was
8006000	8008000	too lazy because
8008000	8010000	there was a Target up in
8010000	8012000	Queens, and I'm like, I don't feel like traveling
8012000	8014000	all the way up there just to get
8014000	8016000	this. But I'm like,
8016000	8018000	if I really wanted, I could probably contact
8018000	8020000	a friend and who could get it for me, you know?
8020000	8022000	Yeah, I
8022000	8024000	hear you, I hear you.
8024000	8026000	So,
8026000	8028000	besides the whole
8028000	8030000	gold amiibo and Legacy Collection,
8030000	8032000	here is my question for
8032000	8034000	you and Logie.
8034000	8036000	What is the last game
8036000	8038000	that y'all have played where you just
8038000	8040000	sat there and just played
8040000	8042000	it through from start to finish because
8042000	8044000	the game was that good? Actually,
8044000	8046000	I have an answer for this, and it
8046000	8048000	is kind of in the week off that
8048000	8050000	we weren't here. The week off,
8050000	8052000	I didn't really get a chance to talk about this game.
8052000	8054000	I think I talked about it a little bit
8054000	8056000	in my gaming week
8056000	8058000	the last episode because I just
8058000	8060000	barely started the game. So,
8060000	8062000	I guess Rama really was split up amongst
8062000	8064000	some sessions, but honestly, I played
8064000	8066000	this game a little bit on the Sunday
8066000	8068000	before OLR, and then I think I
8068000	8070000	played it all Monday night until I beat it.
8070000	8072000	And that was Firewatch.
8072000	8074000	And that is a recent release that just came
8074000	8076000	out on PlayStation 4 and
8076000	8078000	PC. And some
8078000	8080000	people kind of razzed
8080000	8082000	it a little bit because it's a walking simulator.
8082000	8084000	You can't really die or lose.
8084000	8086000	But I thought the story was
8086000	8088000	interesting enough
8088000	8090000	that I wanted
8090000	8092000	to know how it was going to end. I wanted to know
8092000	8094000	how it all tied together. I do have to
8094000	8096000	admit it became really predictable in
8096000	8098000	the last hour. I was like, okay,
8098000	8100000	I know exactly how this is going to go down, and sure enough
8100000	8102000	it's what happened. But
8102000	8104000	it's still one of those things where it's like, well, now that I've
8104000	8106000	made this commitment, might as well
8106000	8108000	finish the damn game.
8108000	8110000	Sounds about right.
8110000	8112000	But I thought that the dialogue in Firewatch
8112000	8114000	was so good, and you know
8114000	8116000	that most of the interactions in that game, it's all
8116000	8118000	over the radio. So you never
8118000	8120000	see the woman
8120000	8122000	that you talk to through most of the game. And I think we
8122000	8124000	talked about this a little bit on the last show.
8124000	8126000	There's a lot of parallels. I can't remember
8126000	8128000	if I talked about, unfortunately I'm getting to that point in my life,
8128000	8130000	I don't remember if I talked about it on this show,
8130000	8132000	or on guys on the show, or if this was just a
8132000	8134000	conversation I was having with my friends at MAGFest,
8134000	8136000	because it might have been all three.
8136000	8138000	But there's so many
8138000	8140000	parallels to things that happen
8140000	8142000	in Firewatch to, I think, the way
8142000	8144000	we've developed relationships
8144000	8146000	in the internet age, where
8146000	8148000	we have these deep friendships
8148000	8150000	with people we've never met, or never even
8150000	8152000	seen. And
8152000	8154000	Firewatch is interesting because it's set in the
8154000	8156000	80s, yet it has a very similar
8156000	8158000	type of relationship, and it kind of shows
8158000	8160000	that those types of mysterious
8160000	8162000	relationships have always existed, if
8162000	8164000	that makes sense. So I just,
8164000	8166000	I really like that kind of twist
8166000	8168000	in the story, and what
8168000	8170000	that story did. So, even
8170000	8172000	though I don't know if at the end of the year I'll
8172000	8174000	sit here and say, wow, Firewatch was one of the best
8174000	8176000	games I played of the year. I thought Firewatch
8176000	8178000	was a good story, it was like watching
8178000	8180000	a good movie, but you're
8180000	8182000	driving it.
8182000	8184000	So that was me, and thank
8184000	8186000	you for asking that this week, and not a couple
8186000	8188000	weeks before, because I don't know what the last one would have
8188000	8190000	been before Firewatch, because most of my
8190000	8192000	marathon sessions are thanks to MMOs.
8192000	8194000	Loki, do you remember
8194000	8196000	the last game you sat down and you had to play start
8196000	8198000	to finish because it was so damn good? Let me guess,
8198000	8200000	Grand Theft Auto 5.
8200000	8202000	I played a lot of that, I don't think I played
8202000	8204000	start to finish the whole time, but
8204000	8206000	I don't know.
8206000	8208000	I don't have an answer, I don't know.
8208000	8210000	No other better answer? What about
8210000	8212000	you, Rama? Is it
8212000	8214000	Project Cross Zone 2? Yeah,
8214000	8216000	before that,
8216000	8218000	it was The Legend of Zelda A Link
8218000	8220000	Between Worlds.
8220000	8222000	Ah,
8222000	8224000	that was a good one on 3DS.
8224000	8226000	Yes it was, and there were
8226000	8228000	times I had to stop playing the game
8228000	8230000	because I'm in the ice temple
8230000	8232000	sliding around, and I'm riding
8232000	8234000	the subway back and forth, I'm like,
8234000	8236000	no.
8236000	8238000	No. It's just too much.
8238000	8240000	Yes.
8240000	8242000	That's great, I got you.
8242000	8244000	That's a great question, Rama, I appreciate
8244000	8246000	it. I'll be curious with
8246000	8248000	some of the listeners might have to say for that in our chat room.
8248000	8250000	But I'm going to go ahead
8250000	8252000	and wrap up so we can get another call, but anything
8252000	8254000	else you want to get out there for our listeners tonight?
8254000	8256000	Ah, no, that's it.
8256000	8258000	Alright, take care my friend.
8258000	8260000	YouTube, brother. Good to hear from you, bye.
8260000	8262000	Bye. Alright, 1877 Game
8262000	8264000	OLR, our username on Skype, Orange
8264000	8266000	Lounge Radio. ActDeft in chat says
8266000	8268000	Undertale. Yeah, of course, I'm not
8268000	8270000	too surprised to hear that. SSJ
8270000	8272000	in chat saying, I really need to play
8272000	8274000	Firewatch. Yes, I think you do.
8274000	8276000	I do think you do. Alright, our phones
8276000	8278000	are lighting up tonight, so I'm going to try to get to another
8278000	8280000	call here, and
8280000	8282000	hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8282000	8284000	Hi, it's Embryon. Hey, how you doing
8284000	8286000	Embryon? I am okay.
8286000	8288000	I am also getting over being sick
8288000	8290000	just like you. You may have
8290000	8292000	gotten sick because I was patient zero
8292000	8294000	at MAGFest. Embryon hung out with me
8294000	8296000	lots and lots at MAGFest, so it was
8296000	8298000	great to hear from you. Yay, it was
8298000	8300000	the best. I have to go to that every year
8300000	8302000	from now on. I'm really, if I have the money
8302000	8304000	I would love to. Then that was your
8304000	8306000	first MAGFest as well, right? Yeah, it was.
8306000	8308000	What did you think from your perspective? I don't know if you were
8308000	8310000	here when I was talking about it earlier in the show, but what was
8310000	8312000	your impressions of MAGFest the first time?
8312000	8314000	It was just, I've been to a couple
8314000	8316000	of cons, not a ton,
8316000	8318000	but especially compared to E3,
8318000	8320000	it's like, it's just such a different
8320000	8322000	energy, because at E3
8322000	8324000	a lot of the people who are there are strictly
8324000	8326000	there for business, and I mean, a lot
8326000	8328000	of the people you see walking around are kind of like execs
8328000	8330000	or whatever. And there's certainly some
8330000	8332000	energy amongst the
8332000	8334000	journalists and people who are really excited, but
8334000	8336000	at MAGFest it's just like nothing
8336000	8338000	but positivity, and everybody is having
8338000	8340000	a good time, laughing, smiling.
8340000	8342000	I mean, the concerts that we went to
8342000	8344000	were amazing. It was, it was
8344000	8346000	amazing. I didn't expect to
8346000	8348000	like it as much as I did, and now it's like
8348000	8350000	probably the best con I've been to, and I want to go every
8350000	8352000	year. Well, in E3, E3
8352000	8354000	isn't really a con. It's technically a
8354000	8356000	trade show, and it's work. Of course. I mean,
8356000	8358000	it's work. It's fun work, and
8358000	8360000	you know, but there's a script
8360000	8362000	that people stick to, whereas MAGFest
8362000	8364000	was more, it's a celebration of gaming
8364000	8366000	culture, and there was no new things
8366000	8368000	to announce. There's no work to be done.
8368000	8370000	We're just going to have fun.
8370000	8372000	Yeah, and I think that's kind of the charm of it, really. It's not
8372000	8374000	like you're waiting for the next
8374000	8376000	big story to break. It's just you're enjoying
8376000	8378000	your time in the moment with people who
8378000	8380000	are awesome around you.
8380000	8382000	I'm even looking into
8382000	8384000	trying to do Rockage here, even though it's just
8384000	8386000	in a couple weeks. They didn't give a lot of
8386000	8388000	notice this year on that, but I'm going to really try to make it over
8388000	8390000	there, a very similar vibe out
8390000	8392000	there. Where's that? San Jose.
8392000	8394000	So it's not far from me at all. Oh, no.
8394000	8396000	It's pretty close. But it's a much smaller
8396000	8398000	scale. It's not quite on the scale of MAGFest.
8398000	8400000	I think they have it spread out through various venues
8400000	8402000	in San Jose this year, so it'll be interesting.
8402000	8404000	Well, to
8404000	8406000	what did you, I made you talk about MAGFest,
8406000	8408000	but what did you want to call in to talk about tonight, Emran?
8408000	8410000	Just to say, hey, Ranma just
8410000	8412000	asked about what games we were playing, and I know that you guys always
8412000	8414000	talk about it anyway, but I don't know about you,
8414000	8416000	Rob, but I have been going so hard on
8416000	8418000	Final Fantasy XIV since the patch dropped last
8418000	8420000	week. The patch is
8420000	8422000	really good. The patch was the kick in the ass
8422000	8424000	this game so desperately needed.
8424000	8426000	Yeah, it's a good patch. I was a little bit worried
8426000	8428000	before it released that it seemed a little
8428000	8430000	light to me because they were focusing so heavily on
8430000	8432000	the new beginner stuff, like the
8432000	8434000	Hall of the Mentor, sorry, the Hall of the
8434000	8436000	Novice and the Mentor system.
8436000	8438000	But no, there's so much to do, and everything that there is
8438000	8440000	is so high quality, like this, I
8440000	8442000	won't give spoilers, of course, but the story, this
8442000	8444000	patch, I thought was really good. Big step
8444000	8446000	up from the last patch of the story.
8446000	8448000	The new fights are fantastic. Yeah, I've
8448000	8450000	capped my lore tome stones for the week, and I'm
8450000	8452000	just kind of like... Oh my god, I have halfway to
8452000	8454000	go. I so wish we were on the same server.
8454000	8456000	I still have half my tomes to get, because there was so
8456000	8458000	much maintenance going on this week. But
8458000	8460000	for those that don't know, and I think this is
8460000	8462000	worth pointing out about the new dungeons, is that
8462000	8464000	there are some great references
8464000	8466000	to older Final Fantasy games, especially
8466000	8468000	in this dungeon called the Anti-Tower,
8468000	8470000	which is like an upside down castle that you go through.
8470000	8472000	The final boss of the Anti-Tower,
8472000	8474000	well, actually, the next
8474000	8476000	to last boss of the Anti-Tower is
8476000	8478000	Ziggy, a little,
8478000	8480000	what do they call those things, the little...
8480000	8482000	Spriggans. Spriggans, thank you. Ziggy,
8482000	8484000	and Ziggy summons stardust
8484000	8486000	that you have to kill. I just like to add, so
8486000	8488000	there was a cute little tribute there to David Bowie,
8488000	8490000	obviously. So cute. It was very adorable.
8490000	8492000	But the last boss
8492000	8494000	of the Anti-Tower is
8494000	8496000	Calcabrena, which, if you
8496000	8498000	ever played Final Fantasy IV,
8498000	8500000	that was an epic memorable fight in Final Fantasy IV
8500000	8502000	because the dolls are
8502000	8504000	really creepy, they do this little
8504000	8506000	dance, and then
8506000	8508000	you have to fight the six dolls,
8508000	8510000	and they combine into one large doll, and
8510000	8512000	then it becomes an endurance fight.
8512000	8514000	And, you know, spoilers for an almost
8514000	8516000	30 year old game here at this point, but that is
8516000	8518000	the fight where Rydia makes her triumphant
8518000	8520000	return to the story, is she saves you from
8520000	8522000	Calcabrena, right? So they've
8522000	8524000	translated elements of this fight into
8524000	8526000	Final Fantasy XIV, and
8526000	8528000	the dolls, when you go into the room, they
8528000	8530000	do the dance, and they do the little jumps and
8530000	8532000	twirls, just like they did in IV, and then you
8532000	8534000	begin fighting all of them, and they transform into
8534000	8536000	one giant doll, and it's awesome.
8536000	8538000	Oh yeah, and the whole music, everything is there.
8538000	8540000	It's fantastic. I love it.
8540000	8542000	Boss is freaky as shit. He is very
8542000	8544000	freaky. And in case it doesn't haunt your
8544000	8546000	nightmares enough, just from seeing the boss, you
8546000	8548000	can get a minion of the dolls. Yes.
8548000	8550000	I don't know why you would.
8550000	8552000	When the Calcabrena
8552000	8554000	doll dies at the end, because hopefully
8554000	8556000	you beat her, or you wasted your time in the dungeon,
8556000	8558000	it looks like one of those animatronics from Five
8558000	8560000	Nights at Freddy's, it really does.
8560000	8562000	It's so creepy, I hate it. Super creepy.
8562000	8564000	But the dungeon's awesome, and so is the
8564000	8566000	other new one. It's a really, really good patch, though.
8566000	8568000	I can't stop playing, and I wish that
8568000	8570000	I wasn't capped on lore tombstones so I could keep
8570000	8572000	doing stuff. Well, the good news
8572000	8574000	is the reset is on Tuesday, and I think
8574000	8576000	is the new PVP going at the
8576000	8578000	feast, is that in on this Tuesday, or is that next
8578000	8580000	Tuesday? It's a week from Tuesday.
8580000	8582000	So we still have another week before the feast, but
8582000	8584000	PVP is another great way to get tomes, if
8584000	8586000	you can get in there.
8586000	8588000	I was surprised that I enjoyed
8588000	8590000	Frontline as much as I did. I'm going to check this
8590000	8592000	one out for sure, especially because I'm pretty sure
8592000	8594000	you don't have to group with people from the
8594000	8596000	same grand company this time. Oh, thank
8596000	8598000	God. So you can just make friends and
8598000	8600000	do it that way. Oh, thank God. That was the
8600000	8602000	worst, that you had to be in the same free company.
8602000	8604000	Yeah, I hope I'm not lying to
8604000	8606000	you on that. I think that's the case.
8606000	8608000	That's okay. If you're lying to me on that,
8608000	8610000	I'll only hold it against you forever.
8610000	8612000	Okay. Alright, awesome.
8612000	8614000	Anyway, Embryon, anything else you want to
8614000	8616000	share with our listeners tonight before I let you go?
8616000	8618000	No, that's it. I just wanted to say hey, and
8618000	8620000	glad you're getting better, and please
8620000	8622000	send some of your magic my way.
8622000	8624000	I will. I'm rubbing my computer
8624000	8626000	monitor with magic right now.
8626000	8628000	Fancy. Alright.
8628000	8630000	Alright, we'll talk to you later on. Take care.
8630000	8632000	Thanks. Bye. Bye.
8632000	8634000	1-877-GAMO-LR or
8634000	8636000	username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
8636000	8638000	if you want to give us a call.
8638000	8640000	Well, it's lighting up tonight. You guys are
8640000	8642000	not disappointing on calls tonight.
8642000	8644000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8644000	8646000	Hey, this is Jeff. Hey, buddy. How you doing?
8646000	8648000	Pretty great.
8648000	8650000	What's on your mind? Watching the Oscars
8650000	8652000	and listening to OR. I suppose
8652000	8654000	I can permiss that, as long as you're paying attention
8654000	8656000	to us most.
8656000	8658000	Yeah, mostly. That's alright.
8658000	8660000	I'm just teasing. What's on your mind?
8660000	8662000	Anyways, I wanted to talk about
8662000	8664000	Street Fighter V. Ah, yes, please.
8664000	8666000	Anyways, uh,
8666000	8668000	you were talking about how
8668000	8670000	the game is incomplete
8670000	8672000	and all the complaints that
8672000	8674000	like I said in chat,
8674000	8676000	they're valid. They're not
8676000	8678000	bad complaints. They're good.
8678000	8680000	They're totally bad, but
8680000	8682000	at the same time,
8682000	8684000	it's not like the
8684000	8686000	game is going to be incomplete forever.
8686000	8688000	They promise, and
8688000	8690000	I'm pretty sure
8690000	8692000	they said that
8692000	8694000	Capcom was going to
8694000	8696000	add more stuff
8696000	8698000	or at least
8698000	8700000	the stuff missing from the game
8700000	8702000	at a later point.
8702000	8704000	I don't know.
8704000	8706000	My biggest problem with this whole thing,
8706000	8708000	again, I'm okay with the fact
8708000	8710000	that Capcom puts out a roadmap to say
8710000	8712000	at least, you know, here's when the features are coming
8712000	8714000	in, so at least people know, like,
8714000	8716000	oh, okay, well, what I want
8716000	8718000	or what I'm looking for in the game is put in there, then maybe
8718000	8720000	I'll buy it. But it just, I don't know, I can't
8720000	8722000	help but feel a little bit of that situation
8722000	8724000	where it's like, how far are
8724000	8726000	we going to let AAA game companies
8726000	8728000	go with this, you know?
8728000	8730000	Like, it's getting really bad
8730000	8732000	where now they want more and more of
8732000	8734000	your money for no product.
8734000	8736000	And it's just, I just,
8736000	8738000	I don't know, like, I just worry
8738000	8740000	it sets a bad precedent.
8740000	8742000	And that's what I
8742000	8744000	don't understand completely of the complaints
8744000	8746000	because we're going to get that
8746000	8748000	for free. So
8748000	8750000	even though you're paying, like, $60
8750000	8752000	right now for the game,
8752000	8754000	it's not like you're
8754000	8756000	paying more for it.
8756000	8758000	Like, for example,
8758000	8760000	and I'm going to say this example
8760000	8762000	that I've heard a lot this past
8762000	8764000	year, Battlefront
8764000	8766000	Star Wars. The game,
8766000	8768000	most of the
8768000	8770000	complaints I've heard of it, it's that it's incomplete.
8770000	8772000	That it lacks
8772000	8774000	game modes and it isn't
8774000	8776000	that fun.
8776000	8778000	And you have to pay another $50
8778000	8780000	up front for the season
8780000	8782000	path that will add more stuff
8782000	8784000	to the game.
8784000	8786000	In this case, and I
8786000	8788000	also made the comparison in chat,
8788000	8790000	Splatoon.
8790000	8792000	Splatoon, one of the complaints aside the
8792000	8794000	voice chat at the beginning
8794000	8796000	was the lack of maps, the lack of
8796000	8798000	variety in weapons.
8798000	8800000	A lot of stuff was missing in Splatoon
8800000	8802000	but they added
8802000	8804000	at a later date and a constant rate
8804000	8806000	also.
8806000	8808000	I get what you're saying with the Splatoon
8808000	8810000	thing but I just feel like it's almost
8810000	8812000	an off comparison to me because I still feel like
8812000	8814000	okay, even though maybe there weren't
8814000	8816000	as many maps, Splatoon still
8816000	8818000	felt like a fully featured
8818000	8820000	game when it was released. And I think maybe
8820000	8822000	part of the reason where I struggle with
8822000	8824000	the whole Street Fighter 5 and the fact that
8824000	8826000	all this stuff is coming later, it's like, well, I
8826000	8828000	didn't have to wait in Street Fighter 4
8828000	8830000	or 3 or pretty much any other fighting
8830000	8832000	game. Like Tekken, when Tekken 3
8832000	8834000	was out on the Playstation 1,
8834000	8836000	you know I realized that was a long time ago, but
8836000	8838000	think of all those awesome features that
8838000	8840000	were there on the disc and all you had to do was unlock
8840000	8842000	it. And it was a lot different than
8842000	8844000	having to wait till, oh please wait till
8844000	8846000	June for more
8846000	8848000	characters and other
8848000	8850000	stuff. It's just, I don't know, I just
8850000	8852000	don't like this trend.
8852000	8854000	That's what worries me more than anything
8854000	8856000	Akdeft, it's the trend of
8856000	8858000	well, we want you to pay $60
8858000	8860000	when the game's not
8860000	8862000	like totally done. But we're gonna
8862000	8864000	give it to you, but we just, we need your
8864000	8866000	money up front to finish
8866000	8868000	financing the rest of the game.
8868000	8870000	But it isn't like the game isn't
8870000	8872000	completely
8872000	8874000	like lacking
8874000	8876000	or, well the point I'm going to
8876000	8878000	trying to get, the game
8878000	8880000	works perfectly.
8880000	8882000	If you see the reviews for
8882000	8884000	Street Fighter 5 and even
8884000	8886000	some people I know that
8886000	8888000	are like
8888000	8890000	really into Street Fighter say
8890000	8892000	it's probably the best in
8892000	8894000	like since June.
8894000	8896000	Like it's one of the
8896000	8898000	it is the best
8898000	8900000	Street Fighter ever.
8900000	8902000	And that's the thing.
8902000	8904000	The game works.
8904000	8906000	The game isn't incomplete at
8906000	8908000	least in that sense.
8908000	8910000	So you can still play it.
8910000	8912000	I get that, yeah,
8912000	8914000	and also in comparison to
8914000	8916000	Splatoon, Splatoon had a complete
8916000	8918000	story mode.
8918000	8920000	Street Fighter 5 doesn't, at least from
8920000	8922000	what I understand.
8922000	8924000	But it isn't like, again,
8924000	8926000	it's not going to be there.
8926000	8928000	It is there and it will be complete
8928000	8930000	at a later date for free.
8930000	8932000	They're not adding
8932000	8934000	or they're not making
8934000	8936000	you pay another $20
8936000	8938000	$40 or another $60
8938000	8940000	for all that content.
8940000	8942000	Which also happened in the
8942000	8944000	past. That's one
8944000	8946000	of the complaints a lot of people had
8946000	8948000	with Capcom and
8948000	8950000	Street Fighter mostly
8950000	8952000	that they really
8952000	8954000	released a new version of the game
8954000	8956000	and
8956000	8958000	we saw it with 4.
8958000	8960000	Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4
8960000	8962000	Street Fighter 4
8962000	8964000	Arcade Edition
8964000	8966000	Ultra Street Fighter 4. We had
8966000	8968000	4 or 5
8968000	8970000	editions of Street Fighter 4
8970000	8972000	and we had to pay for each one
8972000	8974000	of them.
8974000	8976000	When this one, we won't have to pay another
8976000	8978000	$20, $40
8978000	8980000	to get the game.
8980000	8982000	I'll give you that, but at the same time I feel like
8982000	8984000	they kind of shifted that into
8984000	8986000	well, now they just piecemeal the extra
8986000	8988000	characters and that's how they're going to make their expansion
8988000	8990000	money. I just kind of feel like that's shifted.
8990000	8992000	I'm not, you know, okay at least there's a
8992000	8994000	baseline game that will work for everyone
8994000	8996000	and I kind of get that end of things but
8996000	8998000	I'll give you that, that at least there's not
8998000	9000000	going to be like an Ultra Street Fighter 5 and another
9000000	9002000	one and another one. He's not going to keep going but
9002000	9004000	I don't know, it's still
9004000	9006000	it just doesn't sit right with me and I don't feel
9006000	9008000	right paying all the money up front for it.
9008000	9010000	And I just, again, it's one of those things
9010000	9012000	where it's like, how long is this
9012000	9014000	going to go? And let me just ask one more
9014000	9016000	tricky question here.
9016000	9018000	You know, this probably
9018000	9020000	wouldn't happen. But what if
9020000	9022000	Capcom went bankrupt tomorrow and shut down
9022000	9024000	operations? You'll never get those
9024000	9026000	features that you paid $60 for.
9026000	9028000	And, you know, I know
9028000	9030000	it seems far-fetched but we've heard of
9030000	9032000	games like, what was that one that the
9032000	9034000	two, not two worlds,
9034000	9036000	what the hell was that game that the baseball
9036000	9038000	player did
9038000	9040000	and it was an EA
9040000	9042000	thing and then the studio closed, there was
9042000	9044000	all this legal drama.
9044000	9046000	I know what you're thinking of,
9046000	9048000	it's the EA game. Right? It came
9048000	9050000	out and then like that was it. What
9050000	9052000	if that game, you know, that's
9052000	9054000	the only thing I'm saying is that there's no guarantee,
9054000	9056000	there's no
9056000	9058000	absolute guarantee that they're going to meet that
9058000	9060000	roadmap. We are putting faith in, well
9060000	9062000	Capcom's been around a while so
9062000	9064000	you know, hopefully they're going to do it but
9064000	9066000	you know,
9066000	9068000	maybe one day we're going to put
9068000	9070000	down the money for a game and then we don't get it.
9072000	9074000	Yeah, I understand
9074000	9076000	that concern but like you said,
9076000	9078000	it's Capcom. I don't
9078000	9080000	think Capcom is going to disappear
9080000	9082000	one day
9082000	9084000	to another so I'm
9084000	9086000	pretty sure we can expect it and it's
9086000	9088000	not going to be that far
9088000	9090000	down the road, it's not going to be another year.
9090000	9092000	It's going to be just a couple of months
9092000	9094000	mostly.
9094000	9096000	Sorry, thank you Dungeon Buster,
9096000	9098000	Kingdoms of Amalur, that was the name of the game, thank you.
9100000	9102000	But yeah, it's not, like
9102000	9104000	I said, the lack of
9104000	9106000	continent, yeah, I understand
9106000	9108000	the complaint but
9108000	9110000	if you don't want to
9110000	9112000	pay $60 up front for the game,
9112000	9114000	you don't have to.
9114000	9116000	And everybody has said it,
9116000	9118000	you have said it a lot of times in the show,
9118000	9120000	it's your money, you can
9120000	9122000	do whatever you want or you can buy
9122000	9124000	whatever you want with it. That's absolutely right
9124000	9126000	and if you are happy with Street Fighter V the way it is
9126000	9128000	right now, or you're happy with
9128000	9130000	the roadmap that Capcom has presented, you know what,
9130000	9132000	more power to you, have a blast.
9132000	9134000	Just for me, somebody
9134000	9136000	who's sitting on the fence a little bit, that I'm not
9136000	9138000	like super into fighting games but I
9138000	9140000	can be sometimes, it's just
9140000	9142000	not enough for me. But granted, maybe
9142000	9144000	there will be an RPG later
9144000	9146000	on, or something that I will want to buy
9146000	9148000	and the rest of you will think I'm crazy and that's
9148000	9150000	just the thing about gamers,
9150000	9152000	we're a diverse bunch.
9152000	9154000	ActDeaf, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so
9154000	9156000	much for the call, okay?
9156000	9158000	Thanks very much. I appreciate your perspective, I always
9158000	9160000	love when people will call in and at least, you know,
9160000	9162000	stick up for another perspective, so
9162000	9164000	I appreciate it. Take care.
9164000	9166000	You too, thanks for having me. Yep, bye.
9166000	9168000	Alright, sadly I am going to call the
9168000	9170000	or close the Skype line at this time and I'm really
9170000	9172000	sorry because I know more of you are trying to get through,
9172000	9174000	but please consider sending an email or participate
9174000	9176000	at orangeloungeradio.com
9176000	9178000	Also, I'm just, I'm
9178000	9180000	straining my voice a little bit, I need to wrap
9180000	9182000	up and stop, so.
9182000	9184000	But that is about going to do it
9184000	9186000	for another week here at Orange Lounge
9186000	9188000	Radio. Dark Soccer's already left
9188000	9190000	the building, but Loki's
9190000	9192000	here helping me close things out. I want to
9192000	9194000	thank you guys for tuning in and downloading
9194000	9196000	the show. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
9196000	9198000	hey, tell a friend or two about the show, that's
9198000	9200000	all we ask. Help spread the word about the show
9200000	9202000	where every gamer has a voice because
9202000	9204000	you know, that's the only way
9204000	9206000	that we can get the word out there, is
9206000	9208000	to tell a friend, or several
9208000	9210000	about the show. I appreciate
9210000	9212000	all the word of mouth support.
9212000	9214000	That's going to do it.
9214000	9216000	Five star review on iTunes
9216000	9218000	or wherever it is that you found
9218000	9220000	this show, tune in, that stuff goes a long way as well.
9220000	9222000	Loki, your final thought
9222000	9224000	for our audience tonight? I have 13 minutes
9224000	9226000	to go knock down all the stuff that they put up in just a second.
9226000	9228000	You can do it! Go!
9228000	9230000	I have one that I'm going to hit, and that should
9230000	9232000	take down most of it. Alright, good luck buddy.
9232000	9234000	Alright, that is going to do it for me
9234000	9236000	as well. Thank you
9236000	9238000	guys again. We'll be back in seven days.
9238000	9240000	My final thought tonight is I really just want
9240000	9242000	to be done with being sick for the
9242000	9244000	rest of 2016. Darn it.
9244000	9246000	Alright, have a good one everybody. Have a great
9246000	9248000	night. We'll see you in seven days. Bye.
