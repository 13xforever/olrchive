00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, Pokemon Turn 20, showing no signs of slowing down, the cycle of releases continues as the next Pokemon games have already been announced.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll bring you the details on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 632 for this February the 28th of 2016.

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining you here live from lovely Studio N7 in Sacramento, California,

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
where we are live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG Network.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
And joining me on this adventure is my co-pilot, DarkSakura, or Jamie Sommers.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Hi.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi. She's the femme chef of this show.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
And she has some hair to kind of match right now, a little bit.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
This is my favorite chair in the studio.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
She's enjoying her recliner over there. How are you, DarkSakura?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm alright.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
We are back after a week off. I was out in the Washington, D.C. area last week for MAGFest, which I'll talk about here shortly.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
But did you enjoy a week off from OLR, DarkSakura?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I sure did.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah? What'd you do?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I did jack shit.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
You said you and the hubby were cleaning the vault a little bit.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Well, that was today.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh, that was today.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And it was mostly him and me just kind of watching and taking pictures and putting them on Instagram.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
As the supervisor should do, directing and watching.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Well, the cat was being the supervisor, really.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
She's just like, I'm supervising you, but you're not putting food in my mouth.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
And then she's like, she's like been doing this thing lately.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
We're like, I'll sit down. And it used to be she'd just sit on my lap and purr, purr, purr, get up when she's done.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You know, she just fucks off into the night.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Now she sits on my lap angrily.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
She thrashes around and then tries to bite my hand when I pet her.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
But she won't get up.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm like, cat, if you don't want to be on my lap, why are you on my lap?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
The joys of owning a cat or the joys of a cat owning you.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Whatever.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
She's a brat.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Wait, back to the vault thing for a minute here.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
So you were mentioning, you are going to be, and for those that might be newer to OLR,

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Dark Soccer and The Hubby have a stash of classic modern game stuff called The Vault.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
It's an entire room. At one point it was an entire room in their house of just,

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
I would call it crap, but it's awesome crap because it's like gaming.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It's a lot of stuff.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah. But so you're finally trimming it down a little bit.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
But you said you're getting rid of like duplicates. Like you have four Coleco Visions.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
No, I have two Coleco Visions.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
One of them is the same one I had as a kid.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
The other one is one that we bought later when I was working at the former money store.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Which is amazing that they still work.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Well, yeah. I mean, well, they, they built them kind of,

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
the less complicated the mechanics are, the longer it stands to reason it's going to work, you know.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
But we're thinking about like getting together, like whole sets and eBaying them.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Or making them available to listeners if they want to, to buy them from us.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Buy my crap.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Seriously. Cause I mean like, cause then, you know, we can put it in the, into the,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
send Jamie to X convention fund.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Dragon Con girl, you got to go sometime.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
They would, they would love you at Dragon Con. I'm telling you, love you.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I might, that might be a thing.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Maybe I'll have to break out the Grey Warden for that.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I like that. There you go. Now you're talking. Now you're talking.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Also joining us also here with me every week on this lovely show, Sunday nights.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Hello.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
How are you doing, Loki?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Fine.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
How was your week off from the show?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I went and saw Deadpool.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Did you?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yes.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Alan's been begging me to go take him to see you at night.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
I was going to take him yesterday morning, but I was like,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I want to go in the morning for a matinee and there's less teenagers there.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
And then what happened? I slept for 14 hours Friday night.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
14 hours. Loki, have you ever slept for 14 hours?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Nope.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Especially since the kids came around.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
14 minutes. Yes.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
14 hours because I was, I was sick at magfest and just,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I honestly think that was the first full night sleep I'd gotten in like two weeks.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Maybe 14 hours in a week.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Sorry to rub it in, but yeah.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
So we didn't end up seeing Deadpool because I slept for 14 hours.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
But how was Deadpool?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
It was excellent.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I loved it.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm such a uncool kid. I'm like the only one who hasn't seen it yet, but soon, soon.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I still never saw it.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I love James Bond movies and I never went to go see Spectre.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I just out of it. Isn't it all blue right now?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I think so.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Jeez. I'm behind the times. I need to get with it.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
And with it.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Uh, so, uh, so you went and saw Deadpool with your night off?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
You didn't go out and make triangles and ingress? I would have figured that.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
No, I did both.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh, you did both. Of course. Of course.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
At the movie theater, you had to hack.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Awesome.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
We are going to be at the Sacramento Indie Game Arcade show that's coming up on April 9th, I believe is the day.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
It's a Saturday. I think it's like the second weekend in April.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
We're going to be there at the Indie Arcade. We did this last year. We're going to do it again this year.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Although I know they've been kind of trying to convince Loki to be a part of it and showing a game is time to card.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
You think you might make it?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm not working on that anymore.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh, oh.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
At least not right now.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Excuse me.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
I was trying to work on something else, but I don't think mentally I'm just not capable of doing it right now.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
Like, I think yesterday, it's just too distracting. My environment, I'm too tired to do it.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Like, I was trying to program while the wife was watching Fuller House.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Which is awesome, by the way.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
It's pretty good.

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
If you're expecting a fucking Emmy-worthy TV series, you're not going to get it.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
It is just as bad as it was in 1990. That's what's awesome about it. It's so bad it's good.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
It's alright. We were almost done with everything. We've watched 12 of the 13 episodes. I'm sure she'll be finishing it tonight.

06:21.000 --> 06:33.000
Dude, I'm sorry. Stephanie is just exposed in a lot of that show to a distracting mirror.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Like, the first episode, I can't even tell you what happened in it because it was just her fucking tits the entire time.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
It was ridiculous.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
It's a little weird because it's like, I grew up with you.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
But it's funny though because they poke fun at themselves in the show and they also poke fun at stuff like that.

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
I was impressed at what a good comedic actress Jodie Sweetin turned out to be because she didn't really do anything after Full House except a lot of drugs.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
But, thankfully, she's cleaned up and she's got a great recovery story, wrote a book about it and all that stuff.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
She's really done a lot. So, it's really cool that people can see she's actually, I would say, she's kind of one of the better people on the show.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
That and, what is it, Kimmy's husband or ex-husband or separated husband. He's hilarious.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Oh, Fernando or something?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Fernando, yes.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, okay.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
My wife couldn't stop laughing at, like, who gives stationery for a birthday gift?

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
That is my mother. It's her go-to gift since she got fired from the stationery store for stealing all the stationery.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
And for some reason, she thought that was hilarious.

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
Now, I never in a million years thought that OLR would start off one week with Loki and I sitting here discussing the finer points of the Full House sequel.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
But, here we are.

07:50.000 --> 08:01.000
It's not bad. It was, like, the first episode, like, if I was to judge it on the first episode alone, I was like, holy shit, this is way, way too cringy.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
It was, like, it was incredibly cringy.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
You have to stick with it until, like, the third episode when it's, like, random 90s singer who disappeared forever cameo. And it's like, the fuck is this? But this is awesome.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
What, Millie Vanilli shows up?

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
No, minor spoiler alert, Macy Gray.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh my god.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Right?

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
And just, like, it just gets, the whole show just keeps getting weirder. Like, they...

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Isn't that the I'm Like a Bird?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
No, that was Nellie Furtado, dear.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Macy Gray was a, I try to say goodbye and not choke. Remember?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:45.000
She got the very distinctive voice. She's awesome, though. And it was, it was kind of awesome to see her in the show being just as big of a cornball as everybody else. I don't know, it was awesome.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Maybe I'll watch it.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It's on Netflix. Why not?

08:50.000 --> 09:05.000
Let's see. And of course, Dark Soccer and Loki join myself, Rob Roberts, here in studio every single week. But you guys join us in the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live at the Voice Geeks Network Sunday nights right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

09:05.000 --> 09:18.000
If you are listening live, join us and chat live.vognetwork.com where Eric RPG was referring to Loki's review of Fuller House as Titty House. That's apparently what it is.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Like that first episode, and she also ends up naked in another episode as well.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
She's not naked!

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
She is in a tub of tomato juice, not wearing any clothes.

09:30.000 --> 09:45.000
DungeonBuster in chat says, waiting for Netflix to resurrect Airwolf and turn the helicopter into a drone. You know what, that seems to be the thing to do now is that 90 shows are like, they're not just being rebooted, they're just fucking coming back for a new season.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You know, Full House, you call these new seasons.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
The X-Files?

09:49.000 --> 09:59.000
X-Files was a thing, and by the way, if you've been watching X-Files, you gotta check out the TV reviews at vognetwork.com. Critical Myth and his team have been breaking down all those episodes.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Nice, cheap plug, right?

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
And Twin Peaks, which I'm so fucking excited about, is coming back. I'm so excited about the new Twin Peaks.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
But yeah, what other shows would come back? How about Baywatch?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
No, Northern Exposure should come back.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Okay, now did you catch this? I caught this when I was watching, it was actually one of the last episodes.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm only on like episode 3 of Full House.

10:25.000 --> 10:37.000
Oh, okay, well, there's a part where they're talking about, like, it's Steve and DJ, they're going out on a date or something like that, and so he's like, yeah, I've got Atlantis playing in the car.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
He's like, you'll never believe what that song is about. You know, it's hilarious, you know, in the context of the shows.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yes.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
Let's see, go into the chat, live.vognetwork.com, s2100matt says they are bringing back Baywatch. Get out, really?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
But the Hoff's not gonna be in it. Pamela Anderson won't be in it, it won't be the same.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
See, at least Twin Peaks actually has, you know, what's his name, I can't remember in the moment, Kyle McLaughlin. Thank you, Cooper.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
Kyle McLaughlin's gonna be back in that. Full House has the original actors and actresses for better and for worse.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
It's pretty, I don't know, it's pretty awesome. Anyway, I know you guys are here to hear us talk about video games, so we are gonna get into some game discussion tonight.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
I do want to talk briefly, though, about the week off. We weren't here last week because I was in Washington, D.C.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
I was at a convention that I think a lot of you on the East Coast know, but maybe not as many of you on the West Coast are aware of.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
MagFest, a music and games fest, which took place in National Harbor, Maryland, over last weekend.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
It was on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but Sunday was, like, done by two.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
I have to be honest, I'm not sure why they bothered with Sunday, because there was very little that happened on Sunday, but I digress.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
Overall, I had a great time at the convention. It was truly one of my favorite conventions that I've been to.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
And Bobby and I talked about this a little bit on the throw call at the end of his episode.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
He called it a festival. I call it a convention. I really don't...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It's a ConVestable.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It's a tomato, tomato thing to me.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
ConVestable.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah. My thing is, do people convene there? Yes, it's a convention.

12:12.000 --> 12:22.000
But anyway, whatever you want to call it, it's a lot like Penny Arcade Expo without the commercialism that it's turned into and the exhibitors.

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
MAGFest is a celebration of games and the music that gaming has inspired, essentially.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
You're not going to get cutting edge, like, you're not going to have Nintendo there announcing things.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
You're not going to have Blizzard with a newly playable game.

12:39.000 --> 12:48.000
About the newest thing that was there was Street Fighter V, because it had come out that Tuesday, so it was already in the console room for people to play against each other.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
That's really it. But it was really otherwise a celebration of gaming.

12:51.000 --> 13:02.000
They have a huge arcade room, and growing up on music games, being that this is what this show was started on all these years ago, I have to say, I was impressed.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
I have never, and keep in mind, we used to drive to Los Angeles to go to Arcade Infinity back in the day.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I have never seen so many music games in one place.

13:12.000 --> 13:24.000
That was very impressive. Just like 10 different DDR machines, Para Para, whatever the Dance Masters Connect thing that turned into in the arcade, that was there.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
Neon FM, which I was like, oh my god, it is a real machine. I'd never seen one. There was Neon FM there.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Did you play it?

13:31.000 --> 13:38.000
No, here's the weird thing. I didn't play a lot in the arcade, all things considered. I was busy doing other stuff.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I just thought you would play Neon FM just to try it.

13:40.000 --> 13:49.000
There was a big line. There was a lot of lines for stuff. Really, I played the new DDR, but I just played an old song on it because I was so overwhelmed with the new song choices.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
I was just like, well, I'm going to pick one I know. So I played Ecstasy, and I was like, I remember this song being a 7-footer, and now it's a 10?

13:56.000 --> 14:05.000
I was like, alright, and I played it, and it was the same step chart, but adjusted for age because I was having an asthma attack practically by the end of it, but it was still a lot of fun.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Somebody snapped a picture of myself and Jonko from Koopa Club playing DDR, so that was that.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
But then they had Killer Queen, which just always was swamped. They had some classic machines, too.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
I couldn't get the Tron to work, though, which was kind of a bummer. I don't know what was going on with that, but they had a lot of classic games, too.

14:22.000 --> 14:31.000
The arcade was very impressive, I will say that. But it's weird, even admittedly, that I didn't spend a lot of time in the arcade.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
They had a great indie showcase. They had a ton of indie developers that were there showing off their game.

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
Our buddy YYR did end up with a space at the last minute. Somebody didn't show up. They were there on Friday, and then they didn't show up on Saturday, so he got the space.

14:45.000 --> 14:53.000
I was kind of surprised, like, why wouldn't you come back? But, I don't know, for whatever the reason, hey, I'm happy for YYR, so he took that space and was showing some games the rest of the weekend.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
But there was a lot of great indie stuff, and I got to play some things that I probably wouldn't have been aware of otherwise.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Did you just play multitasking?

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
I did play multitasking, and it is a lot of fun. It's on 360, and I'm going to give YYR this shout-out, because he's always been very supportive of OLR.

15:08.000 --> 15:19.000
Multitasking is on Greenlight, and I really would love to see this get support. So please, we never ask for your money here at OLR, except to enlist in a charity thing or something.

15:19.000 --> 15:28.000
But go to Greenlight, search for multitasking, and give it your vote so that YYR can get his game on Steam, because this game is really a lot of fun.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
And I want to see him encouraged to keep developing it, and come up with more mini-games for it, and so forth.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
So I know it got a really good response at MAGFest, so I really want to see him succeed.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
So please take a moment to go to Greenlight, and just search for multitasking, and get that voted on there.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
Somebody will have the link in chat shortly, I'm sure. Oh, thank you, S. Jonah. Already ahead of me, putting that link there.

15:51.000 --> 16:00.000
Excellent. I did some panels, which were some good, some not so good, which you're going to come into at any convention.

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
You know I was really excited about the Clue VCR game thing, right? Because I remember that from the 80s, growing up and playing that.

16:07.000 --> 16:14.000
I think the person running the tournament had never actually played the game, so that did feel a little bit disorganized, disjointed.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
But, you know what, it takes a lot of guts to get up there in front of people and run something for prizes like that.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
So I don't want to throw too much shade, but maybe two people could have done it next time, or I don't know.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
And then the documentary about that was pretty good, too.

16:30.000 --> 16:39.000
I did see a couple other panels. I saw the panel, it escapes me in the moment.

16:39.000 --> 16:48.000
There was another panel I saw that wasn't so good, and I'm not going to say what it was, but it was a topic that I was hoping to be more encouraged about.

16:48.000 --> 16:56.000
But it was just a lot of in-jokes and things that felt a little bit stale to me. So I was just, I don't know, I was a little let down by that.

16:56.000 --> 17:04.000
But yeah, I sound negative, but I'm really not. I actually had a really great time. A lot of great people, I met so many good people.

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
The music, what they had going on with the music was phenomenal. It was a great setup in the ballroom.

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
They had a stage A and a stage B, so that way while people were performing on one stage, the other stage could set up so they could keep going back and forth.

17:19.000 --> 17:30.000
Like there was no break like you would expect at a concert. And I will say, the concert that really was just above and beyond amazing was Journey Live.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
Austin Wintory was there actually directing an orchestra of people that were playing the soundtrack to Journey as somebody was playing Journey.

17:38.000 --> 17:48.000
So what they did, they disabled the music and just had the sound effects in the game. And it was amazing. I maybe shed a manly tear or two.

17:48.000 --> 17:59.000
I just thought it was so amazingly well done. That made the whole trip worth it, if nothing else. I thought Journey Live was worth the whole thing right there.

17:59.000 --> 18:08.000
I was very pleasantly surprised when somebody showed up in the game. Apparently the Playstation 4 they were playing on was connected.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
We all had a good laugh when a trophy was earned in the game. Everybody laughed because you don't expect that.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
But then another player showed up. And it was not until the last chapter when another player showed up.

18:19.000 --> 18:32.000
And it was just another moment of like, oh my gosh, they're online. And this person has no idea that they are playing Journey for the guy that wrote the music and a room of thousands of people.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
I wonder how many Playstation messages that guy got when it was over. Or girl, who knows.

18:39.000 --> 18:48.000
But I loved the Journey Live thing. That was awesome. I saw a couple other bands too. I saw the 1Ups, a little bit of that.

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
I saw I Fight Dragons was good. That was a fun show. But I was sick through a lot of the convention.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
So it kind of killed my mood to like, oh, I want to jump around and be with a bunch of other people.

19:01.000 --> 19:10.000
I had some sinus-y, gross, sore throat thing going on. Lucky me, I was sick. So if you got sick at MAGFest, sorry, it was probably me. I'm patient zero.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
I really tried my best to not touch a lot of things and be sanitizer and all that stuff. But I didn't really want to totally ruin my convention either.

19:18.000 --> 19:27.000
But I had a really good time. I will definitely try to go again next year. I hear the timing may be different next year. So we'll have to see how that all plays out.

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
But I had a really good time. I do hope though, I hope they are able to solve, I guess they had some major parking issues.

19:33.000 --> 19:40.000
Since I flew in and took Lyft, it didn't really matter to me. I didn't notice any of the parking issues. But I guess they had some really bad parking issues.

19:40.000 --> 19:49.000
And I do sort of think for a convention, okay, the hotel, gorgeous, gorgeous hotel. One of the best I've ever seen for a convention, period.

19:49.000 --> 19:58.000
But not a lot of food options around. And I have a feeling because the hotel is so nice and has such expensive restaurants in it, they probably put the kibosh on a lot of the cheaper options.

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
But I really think that needs to be loosened up a little bit. Especially if you're going to get many more people at that convention.

20:05.000 --> 20:14.000
Because you really have to either bring in your own food or buy something at CVS Pharmacy when they're open and make it last the day.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
Because a lot of the places around there, they're good, but they're expensive. It's just not the type of thing you'd expect to eat at a convention.

20:21.000 --> 20:30.000
Imagine if the only place you could eat was Ruth Chris Steakhouse. It's good, but you can't really eat every meal there.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
So I hope they do have some more options. Maybe a few more food trucks and all that in the future. We'll see what happens with that.

20:38.000 --> 20:48.000
I just found something on Steam, by the way. I went to go look up to vote on YYR's game. I found Bear Simulator.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Did you?

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
It's a game where you're a bear. That's it.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Why not?

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
I can't. I'm done.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Some folks in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com were talking about the Clue VCR game thing.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
And SG100Matt pointing out, Rob yelled during the Clue VCR tournament,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Just accuse YOLO!

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
That did happen. Because it wasn't going to end.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And they were like, should we accuse? Should we accuse?

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
And I was like, just accuse, YOLO!

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
I was proud of myself. And Bobby and I were totally quoting the lines.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Keep in mind, the Clue VCR game, not the same thing as Clue the movie.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
I am your singing telegram. Nope, that's the movie.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Which is phenomenal in itself, but that's not what this was.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
This is the Clue VCR game.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I was never in Sumatra.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
That whole type of thing.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Clue VCR game is quotable in its own cheesy way.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Raginator in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
How did you like the East Coast winter weather while at MAGFest?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
It was fine. I've had colder days in Sacramento.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
I guess the weather treated me pretty good out there while I was there.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
There was still some snow on the ground, but not just clumpy snow in different places.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Ermagerd snur.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah, pretty much.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
So, there you go. I had a good time at MAGFest.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Kudos to the organizers.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
I heard there were some bumps in the roads with things like autographs and things like that.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
But I honestly didn't notice any of it.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I had a really good time at the con.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I think as far as celebrating games, that is what happened.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
And there was just a lot to see and do and a great crowd.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
But really, the Colossus yell might be kind of done.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
It's time for a new thing, I think.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
That's the only negative thing I can say about the crowd.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
What's the Colossus yell?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's from the old X-Men game.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Like it just gets louder and louder as everybody in the room does it.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And I'm just like, OK, stop.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
It was funny the first night. Please stop it.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
So, there you go.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Alright, that was MAGFest.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
So, we're going to talk about our gaming weeks.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
But real quick, I wanted to talk about the Pokemon birthday that happened over the weekend.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Pokemon turned 20 years old over the weekend, you guys.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I don't know if that makes you feel old. It makes me feel a little old.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Because I remember when the Pokemon anime was first coming stateside and watching all those.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
I was more into the anime than the video game, which is a weird thing for me to say.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
That never happens, but it did with Pokemon.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
We went to the theater to see the movie.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Me too. We were the only people in the theater.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
You and I went.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Not for the first movie. That was me and Precious.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
We went and saw the second or third one together.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Yeah, it was one of the other ones, but you and I went.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
We did. I think we saw the third one together.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
But, yeah.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I don't remember what happened in it.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
How do you feel? Neither do I.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Apparently, they were all streaming on Twitch yesterday.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
They had like, instead of Twitch Plays Pokemon, they had a Twitch Watches Pokemon.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
And so, it was kind of like the Bob Ross thing.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
It was just, we're going to have a marathon with the chat.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
And so, I only caught it at the tail end.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
So, unfortunately, you get to watch a lot of it.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
But, I guess they did like all the movies back to back to back.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
And I was kind of surprised that they had the rights to do that.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
But, at the same time, you know, those movies are very old at this point.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
So, I guess it's no big deal.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
I still like Digimon better to this day.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Yeah.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Well, I mean, as far as anime goes, I think Digimon had a better plot.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I just want to quickly mention here in the chat because

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt is trying to explain the whole Colossus yell.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
The story is that one of the original Magfests, the arcade room, had four X-Men arcade machines.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
That was a huge thing at the time and the audio was pumped up.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
So, whenever Colossus used his super, you would get the roar.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It happened so much, it became a thing.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Alright, well, we have new arcade games to make things of.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I'm just saying. I'm just saying.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Maybe I'm old. Get off my lawn. I don't know.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Anyway, Pokemon.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Dark Star, do you have a favorite Pokemon out of the, what, 700 that there are now?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Do you have a favorite out of all the Pokemon?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
It's a toss-up because I really like Raichu.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
But, I'd probably say Eevee.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
Actually, no, no, no. What's the one?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Ninetales.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Vulpix?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Whichever one has the Ninetales.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
I think that's Vulpix.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
No, I think there is one called Ninetales.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Is there one called Ninetales? Okay.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Because, oh, hold on. Now I have to look.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Just because it's adorable? That's the reason why I like it the most?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
No, because I love Kitsune.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Oh, no, Act F does say there is one named Ninetales.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, which is based off of Kitsune.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Okay.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Which is a fox with Ninetales.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Alright.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
And I like mythology.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
I'll have to Google the picture because I'm not thinking it off the top of my head.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I'll find it for you.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
My favorite Pokemon, I'm going to go with a classic.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm going to go with one that's kind of mainstream, but I don't give a shit because she's my favorite.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Jigglypuff is my favorite Pokemon.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
And that all is about the anime and how when people fell asleep she would draw on their face with a marker

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
because she would sing, they'd fall asleep, she'd get really pissed off that people were sleeping,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
so she'd draw on their face with a marker.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I always love that.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
So Jigglypuff is by far my favorite Pokemon.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
But there's other ones I love too.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
What about you, Loki? Favorite Pokemon?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Come on, I'm dying to know.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
I don't watch Pokemon, but my favorite Pokemon has to be Gendo.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Gendo.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
I like that.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
It's Gendo.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
Have you ever seen the Evangelion parody that came from?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Yes, that's where I referenced that from.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Oh, that's right. I freaking love that whole thing.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
Act F is pointing out that Ninetales is a Vulpix evolution, so I was close.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
I was very close.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Here's your dang picture, Rab.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
What was the first Pokemon game you ever played, Darcyra?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Red?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Red.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Dan played red, I played blue.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Mine was actually yellow. I didn't get into it until after the anime.

26:42.000 --> 26:49.000
And I had the little Game Boy color that was a little cheek for Pikachu.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
So when you turned it on, the little cheek lit up red. It was adorable.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
I'm just saying.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I had the little Pikachu walker.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
The yellow one where he'd bop around on the screen and you could feed him.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
And he was like the Digimon Tamagotchi knockoff.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Because Digimon and Tamagotchi came out first.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
So are they coming up with any new Pokemon?

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Because it seems like they only come up with a couple new ones each time a new game comes out.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Like actual new Pokemon?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Well, I think we're going to get into the games they announced this week in a little bit here.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
And I'm pretty sure that's going to come with a new series of Pokemon.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Like when X and Y came out, they had new Pokemon in them.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
So each new generation does have new ones in it.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
So I'm sure whatever comes with the new generation will have stuff too.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And don't forget, we have Pokemon Go coming up soon.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Dear Tigerclaw, Digimon is not a clone of Pokemon.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Digimon came out. No, no. Here's your thing.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Tamagotchi led to Digimon come out.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Because it's made by the same company.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
Digimon was a versus version of Tamagotchi.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
And the anime came out after all that came out.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
So learn your history when it comes to Digimon.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Mic drop.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Isn't that interesting?

28:03.000 --> 28:10.000
You know, that's almost like a moment of Beatmania 2DX just ripped off Guitar Hero.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Remember that whole review that was on, what, X-Play or something?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
And where all of us that knew better about what had happened in Japan are sitting here going,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Fuck off!

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
You know, and that whole thing.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So people here in the States probably didn't know any better.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
Do you think it's possible that maybe Digimon was brought over here to the US because of Pokemon's success?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I mean, would maybe that be a fair thing to say?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
No, because we had Tamagotchi.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Yeah, that's true.

28:34.000 --> 28:42.000
I mean, think about it. The whole Digimon anime might have come about because of the Pokemon anime.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
But Digimon was a completely different thing.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
It never existed as a game until much later, until after the anime had been out.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
I see.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
As if memory serves me right.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
And on top of that, I've got one of the WonderSwan games and a couple of the PlayStation ones.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
And I liked the PlayStation one because it was actually a full battler and everything, a couple of them.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
But no, they had completely different evolutions.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
The movie was pretty terrible though.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
It actually was really good if you watched the Japanese one.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
No, I only saw the US movie.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
I've actually got both of the movies. They're really good.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Rama in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
In Before Monster Rancher.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of things we have been playing this week.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Pokemon or no? Who knows? We're going to see.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Come to think of it, I never did see the US one.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I don't think.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
You're probably better off, let's be real.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah, because I imported them. Never mind.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Anyway, my gaming week. I got Danganronpa, finally.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
Which I can play on my Mac. I'm happy because then I can take it to work and look at the weirdness.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
God, that game is freaky.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
And I love it. I love it so much because it's so fucked up.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
It's like someone took the formula for Phoenix Wright and made a really fucked up story.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
And I love it. It's great.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
Also, I want a plushie of Monokuma. So, end of story.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
I also played some Dragon Age Inquisition.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
I haven't touched any more Dragon's Dogma.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
I played some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
A crapload of Heroes of Dragon Age.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
And Neko Atsume. Which isn't really a game so much as just collecting cats.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
But I got Guy Furi today.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
And I got, like, the Cat Maid Girl.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
I have not played that game. It's on my phone, ready to go.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Rob!

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
I know, I haven't played it. I'm so uncool.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Rob!

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
What?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
But there's so many kitties.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, I know.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
And you see their little buttholes.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Yes, I'm aware.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
I know it's called Neko Atsume or whatever, but it's really kitty butthole.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It's really cat butthole.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
It's really cat butthole simulator. That's what it is.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
It should be called, what, Nekoshiri.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
So, cat butt. There you go. Cat butts the game.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Alright. Is that it for your gaming week? Cat butts?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Cat butts.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
I mainly just...

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Ingress.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Ingress.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That's a good one.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I guess that's what I'm saying.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
That's alright.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
I mainly just played Lego Avengers.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
Just to unlock more stuff than that because my son keeps bitching about how he doesn't have enough characters to play.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Most of them are just kind of repeats of each other, but whatever.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
So I'm almost done with that.

31:43.000 --> 31:50.000
I've unlocked all the characters that are in all the other hub worlds except for Manhattan because that's the largest one.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
And then I've gone through most of the levels as well.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
So that's just a matter of just finishing it.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
I bought the season pass for Fallout 4 because that's going to be going up in price here pretty soon and the DLC looks pretty awesome.

32:04.000 --> 32:10.000
So hopefully they'll check out in a few weeks. I think it's when the next piece of DLC comes out.

32:10.000 --> 32:26.000
And then, aside from that, I've been trying to program stuff and using Unity 5 and liking that it's using Microsoft Visual Studio instead of stupid other programs.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
Yeah, I think I've known that in Ingress a little bit.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
I've been mainly just to and from work, but I haven't really had a lot of time.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
I played a little bit on the way here though.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
There wasn't much for me to do though.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
I was going to take down a few fields and one of them I got to, someone already beat me to it by a few seconds.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
And then the other one I took down, but it's not anywhere near me.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
But whatever, I did it.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
And that was it. I'm running out of gear again.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
Alright, we'll get our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
Act F is calling Nico Atsume the take pics of cat butts the game.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Here it is.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
Seattle in chat is wondering what the fuck ever happened to Monster Rancher. That's a good question.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
I don't know, it was pretty awesome though.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
Pokemon killed them all. That was it, the end.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
My gaming week.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Well, since I had a flight I got to do some handheld gaming.

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
So I played some more Final Fantasy Monster Rancher basically and played that.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
And that was good. I finally got the stupid Summoning Case.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
That mission is the hardest because it's half luck based.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
But finally once I got past that I was able to do some more missions.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
That was fun.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
At MAGFest I did some local co-op with some friends.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
That was really fun that we got to do that.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
So yeah, that was fun.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
So I got to explore that a little bit.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Pun intended.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
A little more this week.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
Also, I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV because there was a patch this week.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
So a pretty major patch hit Final Fantasy XIV and it adds more story.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
There's two more dungeons.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
There's a new raid.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
There's a new Primal fight.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
So there's really a lot of content that was sort of badly needed.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
So I'm really glad that they've been addressing the content drought.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
So I'm hoping they can keep the inertia going into their inevitable next expansion.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
Since we know that Square is doing another Fan Fest this year for Final Fantasy XIV,

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
we know there's going to be expansion at some point probably in the next year.

34:21.000 --> 34:26.000
So hopefully they can keep the inertia going because there's a lot of great stuff in XIV still.

34:26.000 --> 34:33.000
It's just people that were playing it aggressively had a long time to wait for anything new.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
So I'm glad that they're finally on top of that again.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
And they're shutting down 11 for consoles next month.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
They are.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I got the email about that and the little reminder.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
It made me a little sad.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
I was like, oh, good times.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
So yeah, Final Fantasy XI no longer on consoles as of next month.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Don't they still be bringing up the phones or something at some point?

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
That's supposed to be the thing is that somehow it's going to be on phones, but it'll still be on PC.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
The game is not shutting down.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
PC will still be out there.

34:56.000 --> 35:04.000
And honestly, hopefully that will be better for the game because maybe they can do some graphic upgrades and release that on PC.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
But then again, supposedly development has stopped on 11.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
They're not going to do more expansions or anything like that.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
So I don't know.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Well, you know, with the phone market being largely free to play.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah, good luck with that.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Good luck with that.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Dream on.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
We'll see.

35:19.000 --> 35:30.000
Speaking of Final Fantasy XIV in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, please no read in chat says that reminds me of Final Fantasy XIV and the Power Man 5000 controversy.

35:30.000 --> 35:36.000
Yeah, I haven't done the new fight myself, but I did watch a YouTube that has the music in it.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Okay, so the music in XIV is badass.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
And a lot of it is very themed for different fights.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Like the Titan song is this rock song.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Get it, rock?

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
But it's like an awesome little rock song that plays really fast.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
It kind of goes like that.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
It's great.

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
And then when you fight Ravana, which is one of the newer bosses, it's like a Russian waltz that plays during it.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
It's really cool.

36:03.000 --> 36:11.000
Well, for this new one, Separat, not Separat, Separat is the new primal or whatever that they have in it.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And it has nothing to do with Separat.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
It's like a world tree or something as you fight.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I believe Separat was an Esper in VI.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I could be wrong, but I think that was the thing.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
But anyway, the music during the second phase of the fight is industrial.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
So it's like a Nine Inch Nails sounding song or like, you know, stabbing westward in the 90s or whatever.

36:28.000 --> 36:41.000
Or I guess if you're the lead singer of Power Man 5000, you kind of think, you know, the first minute of the song sounds an awful like When Worlds Collide, which was their one hit they had in the 90s.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
So I don't know.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I mean, I don't know.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
I guess they're a little similar, but a lot of industrial music has similar openings.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I don't know.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I think it was a big mountain out of a molehill.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And that guy posted that thing.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
And then, of course, the Final Fantasy fandom attacked his Facebook like, you ignorant bastard, blah, blah, blah.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
And then, you know, I don't know.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
So it was a little weird.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
SG100Matt says, wow, didn't think Power Man 5000 would be mentioned in the news.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Yep, that was a thing that happened this week.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Go check that.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Check out his Facebook page.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
It happened.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Anyway.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
So also, one other thing.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
This is very important.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
A lot of you have been waiting for this.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
So there was some maintenance on 14.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
I couldn't play every day this week because, you know, when there's new patches, there's always going to be some maintenance.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
So I was like, what do I play tonight?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
I need to find a game to play.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
So I was like, let's catch up on the Steam backlog.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
So I finally played Undertale.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
That's right.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Finally, after all this time, I finally installed and played Undertale.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
Boy, did it take me a minute to figure out why the fucking thing wouldn't launch.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
I had the big, like, I kept launching it and it was just automatically closed.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Launch, closed.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Launch, closed.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
I was like, what the hell?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Like, I'm not able to play this game.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
I don't understand.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
Well, apparently, you cannot use the Steam beta and play Undertale.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
You have to drop out of the beta, install the regular client, and then you can play Undertale.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Really?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah, that was weird.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I'm running the beta and I've been playing it.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Maybe it depends on your system or something.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
But that was the trick.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Once I dropped out of the beta, it worked fine.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Weird, right?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Very weird.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
But finally, once I figured that out, I'm not going to totally hold that against the game.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
It was just a weird, frustrating thing.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
But once I got into the game, I played through the prologue and a little past that, right?

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
You know, there's a whole, like, for those that play the game, there's a whole little opening sequence.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
And then you get the official Undertale.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And then there's a little more that happens after that.

38:35.000 --> 38:42.000
I can really best define my reaction to Undertale with a classic meme.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And that would be the What Lady.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
Yes, that's the, if you just put what, w-a-t lady into Google, that was me playing Undertale.

38:51.000 --> 39:00.000
And that's the infamous older lady that may or may not have teeth looking into the lens who's wearing some big blue muumuu and it just says what underneath it.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And that was me playing Undertale.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the whole time I was like, what?

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
But I can see why this game has its fans.

39:10.000 --> 39:17.000
Right from the very beginning, there's a little scene with a flower and it's like, I'm a happy flower that's gonna help you on your adventure.

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
And then the flower goes, and I want you to die! Die, die, die!

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
And all this crazy stuff and it turns into a mean face and so forth.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
I will say, the writing is pretty witty.

39:29.000 --> 39:41.000
And there's just, like, it's got this very ironically underbelly of this really dark stuff on top of the fluffy surface.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
Like, what do I mean by that? The big character that's with you in the prologue, what's her name?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
The character that is just like a mother?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Toriel.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Toriel?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Toriel.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
Toriel. You can even call her mom if you want.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
You can also kill her.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
You can! But that's the one thing about Undertale that's been spoiled for me.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
And if you want zero spoilers, mute real quick, give me 30 seconds.

40:06.000 --> 40:15.000
Okay, the one thing that's been spoiled for me is the fact that you can play completely passively or you can play kill everything, basically.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Or you can play middle of the road.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Or you can play middle of the road.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Which is always recommended, play middle of the road to start.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
But knowing in the back of my mind that passive is a thing that you can do, that's how I've been playing it so far.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
So I've been trying to chat everything to death, basically.

40:28.000 --> 40:39.000
Which is interesting. I will say, to Undertale's credit, I like that the battle system is something a little different than just fight, run, walk, that whole thing.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Yet it still feels old school.

40:42.000 --> 40:51.000
You have this little dot and you want to avoid all the other dots.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
What do you call that in gaming? It's just collision detection, basically.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
The whole battle system is collision detection.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
You might be fighting a boss and all these pickles or something fly at you.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
But the green one will restore health if you can grab it, but all the others are bad.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
I thought it was a neat little twist on the classic RPG engine.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah, I understand why people are super into Undertale.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Because it's kind of fucked up.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
But like, you know, in a fun way.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
So, there you go.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
Act F'ed is explaining the joke that I didn't catch.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
Her name is Toriel because, get it, two Toriel.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
And that sums up Undertale perfectly.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
That joke sums up the Undertale experience perfectly.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
But I had fun with it.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Let's see. PleaseNoReadInChat says,

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
I hit on Toriel first, then did the ass to call her mom.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
She thinks I'm weird.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
I wonder why.

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
I'm just irritated that two of my favorite characters so far in Danganronpa,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
their fates aren't even spoiled for me.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Aww.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
Which is fine because I kind of expected it because I don't take anything for granted.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
But still, I actually liked Sakura in that game, and I like Mondo.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Pissed off.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
No spoilers.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
No spoilers. People already know anyway.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Alright. Anyway, so that was my gaming week.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
I played mostly Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy Explorers while traveling,

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
and then a little bit of Undertale just to finally be like,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
okay, I did it. You can stop sending the emails.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
But I enjoyed Undertale enough that I definitely want to play more.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
So, yeah.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
But even if my expression the whole time was,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
what in the hell?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Loki, do you think you're going to play Undertale at some point?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Eh, probably not.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
That's like asking if I'm going to play any of my scene backlog.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Eh, probably not.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Does it mean I'm going to stop playing games?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
No, it doesn't.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Alright, so some quick housekeeping here real quick.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Hey, speaking of Magfest, I gotta pimp this.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
So even though I was sick as a dog on Saturday at Magfest,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
we did some videos in the Indie Hall,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
and the first two are up on our YouTube channel.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Just look for VOG Network on YouTube,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
and you can actually see some interviews that we did at Magfest.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
We did an interview with YYR about the games he's making like multitasking.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
We also just completely discovered this game we thought was kind of cool

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
called That Rock Paper Scissors Game,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
where it's a three-player game,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
and one person plays rock, another paper, another scissors,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
and you chase each other basically around a big map.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
It's kind of a silly, simple concept, but it works really well.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Like, who doesn't like those types of multiplayer or living room games?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
So we interviewed those guys as well.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Bobby talked to them.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Those videos are up on YouTube, and I just gotta give props to Bobby.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
Like, he edited those videos, and he put them together really slick.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
I was like, wow, this looks like something that...

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
This looks like...

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Legit!

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Sounds silly to be saying that, but it's how I felt.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
So check those videos out over at the VOG Network YouTube.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I know we were not here last week,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
and so I hate to say that we're going to be having another missing show,

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
but, you know, I have a life and things that I like to do too.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
So we do have our next no-show weekend.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
It's going to be April 3rd.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I will not be here on April 3rd.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Sorry, Loki, I'm probably surprising you with this.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I told her earlier, but I will not be here April 3rd,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
but get this.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
You'll get a kick out of this, Loki.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Do you know why I won't be here?

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
And I'm not coming back.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I'm going to Tucson, the first, second, and third.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
You're going to laugh.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Disneyland?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
No, I'm not going to Disneyland.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I'm going to Tucson.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
You know what's in Tucson?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Racist!

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Well, every city has those, but...

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Well, I have friends that live in Tucson.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
That's very important.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I have some friends in Tucson that I'm going to go visit and say hello to,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
but then I'm also going to do an Ingress anomaly that's on that Saturday,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
the second in Tucson.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Go to the Special K's.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
What?

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Go to the Special K's.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Is that close to the Phoenix area?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Oh, the Circle K's or whatever?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Yeah, it's like two hours outside Phoenix.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I'll get the codes or whatever.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I don't have to do that. It'll be fun.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Our Circle K's gave out codes.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I'm going to actually go shop there.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I'm going to be going to Tucson in a few weeks

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
and visiting some friends that are there

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
and doing the Ingress anomaly, and I'm looking forward to that,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
so that'll be fun.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I'm allowed to take a vacation once in a while,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
such as life.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I don't think you just had an anomaly there.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
In Tucson? No, I don't think so.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Maybe it was in Phoenix, I'm thinking.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I thought they just did that because that's why they have the codes there now.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
No, I don't know.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I don't think it was there. Maybe it was in Phoenix.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Bobby Blackwolf is asking,

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Tucson, like an Earthbound convention?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
They do have that.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Earthbound convention is in Tucson,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
but sadly, I think that's in the summer

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
and I'm not going the right weekend to see that.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
So, there you go.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Alright.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Let's move on

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and get into this week's news.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I think it's time. You guys have been waiting for it. Loki.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Holy crap, they announced

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Pokemon Sun and Moon, and it's coming

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
this holiday, and I cannot be more excited

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
about this.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Actually, I'm not, because I don't play Pokemon, but

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
it's pretty exciting for everybody else that plays

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Pokemon, and this is part of their

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Pokemon Nintendo Direct,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
and of course,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
you know, showing off that there's going to be

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
some more products based off that coming out,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
as well as like trading cards, plus toys, all that

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
fun stuff. You know, the usual

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
marketing stuff, and

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
yeah. So,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
it'll be coming out, not really sure yet,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
but holiday sometime.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
And that would be on the 3DS.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Are you

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
pre-ordering Sun and Moon,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Loki? Yes, I'll pre-order

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
that for my 3DS I don't have.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
That sounds like a perfect idea. Hey, that'd be totally

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
awesome. Let me invest the money in a 3DS

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
for them to, you know, put out the

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
NX, which will totally,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
you know, just like, hey, it's cool, we

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
got a Wii U now, we can get the new Zelda game,

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
except that they're maybe

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
putting out another system. To Nintendo's

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
credit, they're pretty good about the

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
backwards compatible thing, though. If they do put out a

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
new handheld, it'll probably play the 3DS

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
games. I don't think they would put

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
all this effort into a new Pokemon game,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
just to instantly antiquate it,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
you know, the same season, if NX

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
is out this holiday. Now, that's the thing, is this

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
a game that only runs on the new 3DS,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
or is this just, like, 3DS?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
They haven't said, which is, um,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
that could be peculiar, we'll see.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I hope they don't limit it to the new 3DS,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
because that'll lock

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
me out, because... Sorry, you can only get 10

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Pokemon on the 3DS versions of the game.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm not gonna buy a new 3DS if a

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
NX is just around the corner.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm gonna wait till after 3DS.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
The new 3DS seems like the DSI to me.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
It's, like, kind of unnecessary.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Which is, I mean, it's fine, they can do

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
an upgrade of the system for the people that still haven't come on

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
board or whatever, or the real diehards

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
who must have the new technology, but I don't,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
you know, there's no game on

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
the new 3DS that I want to play

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
that's exclusive to that. They have,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
yes, I know there's Xenoblade, but I can play that on Wii.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And there was, what, one other game, I think?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So, there's really

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
nothing that I need the new 3DS for.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Let me just drop some of the prices of the first-party Wii U

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
games. Please.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Anyway,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I'll check out

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Pokemon Moon. I like Pokemon Moon

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
because it makes me think of butts. So, there you go.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Darsakha, would you play

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Pokemon Moon because butts?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Probably not.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I haven't played, honestly,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
to be serious, I haven't played any

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Pokemon games in ages.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I didn't think X and Y were that bad.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
It was a very different, like, look for the series,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
but I thought the battles were kind of interesting.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
The fact that they were able to

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
modernize it a bit. So, I'm curious how they might take that

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
a step further for Sun and Moon. So, we'll see.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Anyhow, Nintendo

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
also this week

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
released a fiscal year update

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
revising their

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
fiscal year projections for the year

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
ending March 31st.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Because, you know, fiscal years run like

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
April to April. They don't start

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
like the way the calendar does.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
They have scaled back the sales and profit

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
expectations, as well as

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
projections for 3DS sales.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
This is because the holiday quarter had

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
a drop in profits.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
They fell short of their 3DS

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
goal of 7.6 million units

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
sold by 1 million.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
It also says the

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
software shortfall of 9 million

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
down to 47 million units.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
So, unfortunately, the

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
DS projections, it didn't go

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
as good as they'd hoped.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
They did, though, admittedly

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
highballed. I seem to remember discussing this when it first

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
came out, and I remember thinking, like,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
the DS projections were kind of highballed

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
to begin with. Interestingly enough,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
though, Wii U projections were

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
unchanged. So,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
that's, you know, the Wii U,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
you know, didn't underperform

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
or anything like that.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Amiibo sales were still strong, however,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
but the operating income and profit

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
projections did have to be lowered.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
The upcoming fiscal year will

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
include things like Star Fox Zero,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
The Legend of Zelda for Wii U, Bravely

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Second, and two Dragon Quest ports.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Of course, this could also mean

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
the NX,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
but we won't know any of that

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
details until after E3.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
So, alright.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Let's move on. DarkSakura.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Well,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Ubisoft has taken

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
some crap

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
for reasons. However, now

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
they are looking to be acquired by

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Vivendi, I'm sure.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Yeah, I know.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I kind of laugh, too.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
So, basically,

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
what happened is that Vivendi purchased

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
140 million euros

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
worth of shares in Ubisoft,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
which brings their stake in the company

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
up to 10.39%,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
and so the CEO

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
of Ubisoft calls this an unwelcome

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
move, and wants

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
to retain its independence from

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
what could be a hostile takeover.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
So, they have

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
approached

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
different investors,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
shareholders in Canada,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
to see if they can invest more

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
so that they can maintain

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
ownership of the company.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
So, right now,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and the

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
CEO is Yves Guillemot,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
and his family

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
owns 9% of the Ubisoft

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
stock, and then

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
two of the major shareholders,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
which are BlackRock and Fidelity,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
own 15% together,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
and they're on his side, but he needs

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
50% of the

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
vote to block Vivendi.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
So, he's really pushing

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
for it, and

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
basically,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
his whole thing is that, you know,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
if Vivendi takes over,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
then the most loyal

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
employees to the company

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
are going to be leaving the company, which would

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
leave them with nothing

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
major. So,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
they're hoping to keep it

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
out of Vivendi's hands.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So, strange that Vivendi

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
kind of got out of the business

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
with the whole Activision stuff,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
just to be wanting to get right back in. That's very

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
strange to me. They acquired

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Gameloft

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
earlier this week, and

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
bought more shares. So,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
yeah, they're not out. Curious

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
what their long-term plan is over

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
there, but of course, when you're trying to take over

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
companies, you don't really make a lot of comments on that.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
So, we'll see.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Moving on, Loki.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Alright, so,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
PlayStation TV,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
unfortunately, is going to be discontinued

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
in Japan.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Just didn't quite hit it off as

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
well as they thought it would. I mean,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
it's dropped in in price

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
very low. In fact,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
it originally started off at

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
around $100. Now, it's around

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
$40, probably even cheaper. I know I got mine for

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
$30.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Just, you know,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
unfortunately, it didn't

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
seem to

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
do well with consumers.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
They didn't really know why.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Basically saying you could use it as

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
a video streaming device.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
It's like a mini-console, almost.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
But,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
unfortunately, there's not a lot of people

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
using them.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
So, it's too bad. I don't use mine either, unfortunately.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Yeah, interesting, because the

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Vita seems to show more strength

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
in Japan. You know, we actually

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
have Japanese Vita release dates,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
which kind of disappeared

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and died here in the States.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And maybe that's why those people take the Vita

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
and they're purchasing the Vita and not the

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
PlayStation TV.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
That's true, because, well,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Japan is a more handheld-driven

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
industry. We got a lot

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
more people to play on transportation

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
and so forth, so maybe the TV thing

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
was just kind of a

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
not-so-great idea. But I'm still

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
a little surprised to hear that.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Hmm.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Alright, let's see.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Going to Brad from

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
PodCulture in our chatroom over at

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
live.vognetwork.com, says, you can play Vita games.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
That is why I got one. You can play most

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Vita games, right? Some of them are still locked out on the

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
TV for some weird reason. And then there was

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
that whole thing with the workaround

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
and all this. PleaseNoRead

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
in our chat says, good, I bought my

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
PSTV for 20 bucks and it's got to be the worst

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
console ever made.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
It's not the worst, but it's not...

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I don't know about the worst, but...

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Let's put it this way. For the price that I paid,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
it's way

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
better than the Ouya was, and it's way more

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
functional than it was, so

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I would say it is a pretty decent

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
console. And what I was planning on using

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
it for is mainly just playing

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
classic PlayStation

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
games, that type of thing on there.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
PS1 games. PS1 games, also

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Vita games that I

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
have in my library, because I don't really have a

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Vita anymore, so I have a bunch of

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
games in my library that I wanted to check out,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
but the problem is, I don't play a lot of them

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
because I have a lot of them.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
They're like multi-console games.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Some of them are on PlayStation 4 and

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Vita, so it's like, well, why am I going to play

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
the Vita version when I have the PlayStation 4 version?

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Right. Well, more news out of

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Sony, going from

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
basically what is the past now to the

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
future. Sony has sent out

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
invitations to a special press event

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
that will be occurring in San Francisco on

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
March 15th, and it is going

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
to be all about PlayStation

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
VR, and funny

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
enough, this is timed quite appropriately

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
with Game Developers Conference,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
so I think this is our big

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
event that we've been waiting for.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Was it the rumor that we were supposed to find out about the pricing

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
stuff around that time period?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I don't know if it was the rumor so much as

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
the expectation is that if Sony

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
is going to put this out in the first half of the year

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
still, which may or may not be true,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
but it does seem like if they're going to say

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
it now, then it's before the holiday

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
period, because if they were going to wait until the

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
holiday period, they would have just

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
waited until E3, I think, but I

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
do think this gives a good

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
precedent that it'll

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
probably be out in the summer.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I don't know still about the whole first half

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
of the year, but maybe like summer, maybe

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
June, if June counts as first half of the year,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
then maybe it'll make that, which

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I guess it would, wouldn't it, because it is the sixth month.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
But I'm like, if it's like

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
late July, cut them a little

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
slack, it's not the end of the world.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
So yeah, the

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
event will be on March 15th, and

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
we are expecting to hear the price,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
the date, and

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
the launch lineup. So, you know, when you're

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
rolling out a new piece of hardware like that, that's going to

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
be a pretty lengthy conference.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I'm pretty excited about it, I'm thinking about picking that up.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I mean, I almost bought a

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Gear VR today, but then I was like kind of

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
reading some reviews on it, and it's just,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
it doesn't seem like it'd be that interesting.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
For me, it's really about the software.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
What are the games going to be? And I've got

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
to be honest, Res alone,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
even though, you know, that game is years

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
old, it's still, I'm like, ooh, that is an

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
experience I really want to try, and that's

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
in the PlayStation VR.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Res would be pretty amazing, actually.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
You know, like most consoles,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I've got to have three. I'm going to have to have

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
like the three must-have games before I'm

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
finally going to break and buy the console.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Because I'm treating PlayStation VR

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
as a console at this point because I expect

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
it's going to be priced like one.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I would expect it's going to be

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
I really think

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I'm going to say

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
$5.99

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
just because that way if it's $4.99

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I'll be pleasantly surprised.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I think $5.99

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
is going to be too expensive.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
The hopefulist in me says $4.99, the realist

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
in me says $5.99. I would think $4.99

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
at the highest. I would hope

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
it's $3.99, but

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I don't know if it's,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I don't think it would be. But I mean

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
it's just going to be a hard sell if it's

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
$4.99, I think. Because you're talking about

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
it's way more than the actual console.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
This is going to be a blue chip piece technology.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
This is not going to be for everybody. This is going to be

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
for a very select audience

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
of gamers. So

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
this is aimed at 30-somethings

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
with disposable income.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I think it's what a 20 and 30-somethings

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
would have to be. We'll see how much it is because

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
if it's too expensive, I'll just pass on that too.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Bobby Blackwolf

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
pointing out if it was going to be cheaper than the

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
X5, they would have announced that by now.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Not necessarily.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Not necessarily. Maybe they want to

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
strike while the iron is hot,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
get the pre-orders, and maybe the console

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
will be coming right out. Who knows?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
But I think it's a fair

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
counterpoint.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Alright, let's move on

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
while we wait for March 15th.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Dark Sakura.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Well, we've off and on talked about

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Leland E. And for those who

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
don't know, he was the

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Democratic Senator for

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
California for San Francisco.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
He's finally been

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
sentenced

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
for five years in prison

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
and a $20,000 fine.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
He actually did

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
plead to the racketeering charge.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
So for his plea deal, he

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
also admitted to

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
exchanging

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
official acts for

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
money conspiring to traffic

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
and weapons and money laundering.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
And so his lawyer

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
said that he is

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
a 67-year-old man who has

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
accepted his responsibility

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
for his conduct. That he's led an otherwise

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
exemplary life as a family man

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
and an active voice for the betterment of society.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah, while he's exchanging

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
political favors for

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
weapons.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Bye, Felicia.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
He also agreed to

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
forfeit $33,000 in campaign

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
contributions that were part

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
of his fund to run

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
for Secretary of State for California.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And he also,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
his anti-video game

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
law was, of course, struck

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
down as unconstitutional

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
that it violated the First Amendment.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Which is why we bring him up now.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
You know, if in case you forgot,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
he was the big driving

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
force behind trying to

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
basically censor video

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
games at the retail level.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
And all this time,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I mean, the irony of the fact that he was living

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
a Grand Theft Auto life while he

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
was trying to get Grand Theft Auto banned.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Well, let's not also forget.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
His bill

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
was signed into law

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
by Schwarzenegger.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And it would have

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
fined retailers $2,000

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
per instance of selling

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
M-rated games to minors.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And would have also required

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
additional warning labels

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
of what a mature

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
game entails.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So, yeah.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Bye, Felicia.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Do not pass Go.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Do not collect $200.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
That's the last time we'll ever have to bring him up on the show.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I hope.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Unless we're here in five

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
years talking about his parole.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
But I figured it was at least worth mentioning.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It is worth mentioning.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Closing the book on that whole thing.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Anyway.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Let's try and talk about some

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
release dates. We're gonna travel around the world and check out some

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
games that you will be able to walk

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
into a store and buy without question.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And without getting carded and all that stuff.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So, Loki, starting us off in the US.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Alright, so we've got

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Elekhine's Gun

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
on PlayStation 4

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and Xbox One.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Return to Popolo Cross, a story

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
of seasons fairytale on

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
3DS.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Darkrai Primal coming out on

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
PC.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Mortal Kombat XL edition.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
The one that has the DLC included

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
with it. That is coming out on

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Let's see.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And then finally,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess HD.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That's coming out on Wii U

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
this week.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
That's it. Let's go to Japan.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Right now. And check out some release dates

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
over there. Some price reductions on the PlayStation 4

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
for Assassin's Creed Unity and

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Far Cry 4 as they move into the best series

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
on March 3rd. But as far as new games

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
go, Gundam Breaker 3 and Life

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
is Strange gets its Japanese version

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
on March 3rd. Those on

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
the PlayStation 4.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
On the PlayStation 3,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
no new games, but you get that same price reduction

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
on Assassin's Creed Rogue and Far Cry

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
4. Nothing of note on the

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Wii U, although we do have

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess HD

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
coming out on March 10th.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
So we're getting very, very close

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
to that. On the PlayStation Vita,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
which you can, you know, not play on your TV

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
anymore, I suppose. Gundam Breaker 3

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
is out there as well. There's also a brand

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
new Vita starter kit in Aqua

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Blue and Glacier White.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And then there's a new game on the Vita.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Chalet no Atelier Plus,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Kukon no Ume no Renken Jutsu

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
comes out on the PlayStation Vita.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
this week in Japan, Haiku

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
cross team match

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
regular and cross game box.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I'm not sure what that all entails. Must be like

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
a limited edition type thing.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And just for you, Dark Sakura,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Doraemon!

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Shin no Bita no Nippon Tanjuu

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
comes out. I'm not really a big fan of Doraemon.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Really? I always thought that was something you were into.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I think he's cute.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
You know, a cat with no ears.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
So I looked up that Haiku cross

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
team match and the special kit that it comes with.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It's like a little, like the game comes in a

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
tin. And by the way, this is like a little

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
fighting game. It looks like an old school Street Fighter 2

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
type of game. So I think this is just supposed to be

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
like a, I don't know, just a little

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
cute little

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
extras that come with it. Cause you know they love

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
collector's editions of Japan. They really do.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
You thought we have a lot here.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Check there. Dark Sakura, how about the

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
UK? On March 1st we have

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Deponia Doomsday for Mac and PC.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Screen cheat for

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Xbox One. X-Blaze code embryo

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
for PC.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Let me move on to the next days. On the

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
second, Bus Simulator 16

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
for Mac and PC.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Bus Simulator? Is it a school bus?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
School bus.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
By the way, I found that album

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
is on iTunes.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Is it really? I was listening to school.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I added it to all my Apple music. Of course you did.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Cause whatever.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And then on March 3rd is

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Black Desert Online

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
for PC.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I think it's in

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I can't see the label on the thing.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I'm trying to pull it up.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
But at a distance, or in the little tiny

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
characters. Yeah, it's in Korean.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Act F'd

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
in chat says Magic School Bus Simulator?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
You know this whole thing does

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
remind me though, I need American Truck Simulator.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
That came out not that long ago on Steam.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I need to get that.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Those games are actually

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
really fun. I don't know if you play them.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It's very zen.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Like I imagine driving cross country probably

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
is. More like

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
how many caffeine pills can you take before

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
you pass out

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and crash your bus

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
or your truck

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
into the ravine

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
where you die.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Did you see, this is going to be totally random

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
but I don't even care. That's what we do on this show.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Did you see that series of tweets that was on

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Twitter about the mega bus

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
this week where the person tweeted

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
like, they're pulling over

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
the mega bus. Something's wrong with the mega bus.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And then the next tweet was a picture

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and it goes, mega bus is on fire.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
What?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
The next tweet was update, mega bus

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
exploded. And there was a big

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
picture of the exploded mega bus.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It was kind of sad. Mega bus.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
It was like life on Twitter.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Mega bus?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
You never heard of mega bus? No.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It's like a Greyhound alternative.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Apparently they're extremely terrible.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Are they? I haven't heard horrible things about them.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
They'll remind me never to be on one.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Moving on.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And then hopefully this show won't blow up

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and we can get to the classic game of the week.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
But first, Dark Sakura with news.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I have news?

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Oh no, I'm just kidding. It's Loki, not Dark Sakura.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I was going to say, um,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
so EA has abandoned their

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
trademark filing for ghosts.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
There will be no ghost games coming from

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
EA anymore.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So, sorry.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I know you guys were all looking forward to

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Battlefield 5, really

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
spooky ghost edition, but

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
not going to be happening.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Instead, this was originally

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Ubisoft, I guess, was objecting to

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
EA's attempt to trademark ghosts since

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
they have ghost recon and a lot of the

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
other Tom Clancy games and that type of stuff.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So now

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
they've just decided not to do it.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And no idea what it was

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
supposed to be intended for, but

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
they've dropped it.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So we'll never know

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
what the ghost game was from EA.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Nope.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We won't, and nor will we care.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
But we can still get, you know,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
what was it, Tom Clancy ghost recon?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That's still okay, though, right?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Yep, we should have Tom Clancy's Ghost

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Hunters. That would be awesome,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
actually. Where they just go, like,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
search for

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
EMF Fields.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Hey, it's a...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Try to record, was it white noise?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Or not white noise, uh...

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I forget what they call those.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
The Supernatural Ghost Hunters?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Not the white noise, I forget, like, I used to be real into

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
that shit, and I can't remember what the fuck they call

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
that shit, um...

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It's not white noise, it's, uh...

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Fuck, I can't remember. Eh, who cares?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It, um...

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Ghost voices or whatever, it's something.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Alright, I'm gonna move on.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Another week, another

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Nintendo NX rumor, that's right.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
It seems like these are a dime a dozen, these

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
NX rumors. I don't know why we keep

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
reporting them here on OLR, but apparently

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
each one of these rumors, no, really,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I mean, this is from a trusted source.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
This is, uh, this is it.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
This is a trusted source, and, you know, you can

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
believe this. So, one of the big NX

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
rumors this week is that

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the NX will officially launch

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
this year, and the Legend

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
of Zelda, the new one, is a

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
launch window game. So, we may be

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
in it, and this is something that people have been

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
speculating for a while, is that we may be in a similar

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
situation when we were

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
expecting the Legend of Zelda on the

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
GameCube, and it ended up also

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
being a launch title for the Wii.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
We may be looking at a very similar situation

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
here with the new Legend of Zelda.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And then the same thing happened with

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
the Zelda on the Game Boy

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Color that was on

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
the Advance. That was the Oracle of

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Seasons and Ages, right? Where you had, like, the special

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Advance

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
shop, I think, that you could get if

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
you played it on an Advance. So,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
you know, Zelda

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
has done this before.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
There is a precedent. But, anyway,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
apparently this source is

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
someone who works directly at Nintendo,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and, you know,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
it makes sense, though,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
if the NX is coming out this year, and if Zelda Wii U

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
is coming out this year, it's

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
probably happening on the NX as well, but we'll see what

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
happens.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
To register participation

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
for this week's episode of Orange Andredi

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
with VoGnetwork.com, use the past

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
phrase, DIRT.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Also, more

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
NX rumors, and this is something

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
from a rumor spiller

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
named Geno, who has

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
released other information in the past,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
such as that Pokemon was going to be

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
in a 3D engine, and that it would have

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
a fairy type, that

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
PlayStation 4 was going to have modern day

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
graphics on a DirectX level like Unreal Engine

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
4 and Frostbite 2,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Microsoft's Omni Projection unit

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
that turned out to be the Illumeroom,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
so here is some of the

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
juicy stuff he's saying about NX.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
There will be a, oh, your favorite

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
word is coming up, DarkSagra.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
There's going to be an HDMI

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
dongle that attaches

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
to the television. It uses

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
wireless HDMI technology.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It's a very similar

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
type of streaming thing that the

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Wii U uses today, except

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
now it's evolved.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
As speaking of Pokemon. Has the porn industry

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
created the dongle?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
The dongle? I don't know,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
you're asking the wrong guy.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
This device will stream

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
via the HDMI dongle

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
to the TV, so you won't even need

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
an HDMI cable. That's kind of interesting,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
actually. The analog

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
controls have motors for

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
haptic feedback, so if you hit

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
a wall, the sticks will move away

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
from the wall to simulate hitting it.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
That seems kind of cool, and something

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
that I'm surprised we haven't seen before.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Supposedly there will be a Bluetooth

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
syncing with tons of

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
devices, smartphones,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
tablets. I wonder if this is where

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
those earlier rumors about the

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
smartphones and the PS4s and all that came from

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
is through some type of Bluetooth integration.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
That could be interesting. You can

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
answer phone calls and display

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
text messages from your phone

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
onto the NX. So

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
does that mean I could be playing a video

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
game and somebody could send me a text

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
message and it's going to display on the TV while I'm playing

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
the game? That could be interesting. Wait a second.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
You're telling me that there's going to be some sort of

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
network integration with this system? I don't

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
believe it. You know what?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
What? I have a phone

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
and it gets messages.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Can an Apple TV

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
display text messages like that?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I don't have an Apple TV. Why are you

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
looking at me? I thought

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
because you have an Apple Watch, I figured you

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
have the TV too. Silly me.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Alright. I

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
actually don't know if you can.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I can get text messages on my Mac though. How about this?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
How about this Nintendo?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
How about you focus on fucking making the

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
networking work correctly instead of trying to

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
integrate your fucking text messages from your

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
phone onto your TV because

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
guess what? If

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
my phone is fucking synced with the TV

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
anyways or whatever the system is,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I probably have my fucking phone in my hand

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
already. So what's the point of

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
needing that on the TV? Well,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
the tech uses apparently the

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
same hardware layout as the PlayStation 4

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
and Xbox One and they're saying

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
a 130 party

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
developer said it's the easiest device we've

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
ever developed for you. Take your code, compile it

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and it works.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And look to Pokemon Go

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
to get an idea of the

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
social features that will be in NX.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
This will take multiplayer, AR,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
and the StreetPass concept to a whole new

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
level. And they're saying the strengths of the device are

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
usability and ease of use.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Visually and functionally,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
it is as if

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
the Samsung and the Nintendo 2DS

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
had a baby. The operating

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
system is Nintendos.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That's adorable, I'm sorry.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Nintendos is the operating

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
system. Even you're smiling, Loki.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
It's kind of cute. It's cute. Shut up.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It's cheesy, whatever.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I love it. Nintendos

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
is the operating system and it has

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
a lot of the modern features of mobile

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
operating system. Nintendo is being

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
careful in showing it off because they're

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
afraid that it would be mistaken as

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
running Android, which was an

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
earlier rumor about this device,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
interestingly enough. Remember that? That Nintendo was

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
supposedly running an Android thing on

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
its console. So maybe

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
those link together somehow. I don't

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
know. But anyway, again,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
huge rumors. Get your

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
salt licks. We don't know any of this to be true.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
But it's fun to speculate.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
So, there you go.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I mean, there's nothing in

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
there that strikes me as

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
what a bunch of horseshit.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I actually think the idea of

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
playing a game and having

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
a text message come up on your screen

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
while you're playing the game is actually

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
kind of an interesting idea. That's

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
why I was asking if Apple

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
already had that built into their ecosystem.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I mean, whatever. That's fine if they want

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
to do that.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It's only

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
between the computers and the phones anyway.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
And watch.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Dark Tetsuya in Chat says

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I do agree Nintendos is

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
adorable. I hope that part is real

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
at least. Yeah, me too.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That's just as adorable as Glados was.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
So, you know. Well, maybe

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
it'll offer you cake.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And then you find out there actually isn't

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
cake at the end.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It's kind of like how they offered me, you know,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
DJ Hero and Fucking Saints

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Row on the 3DS. And then there wasn't

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
a Fucking DJ Hero and Saints Row on

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
the 3DS. The broadband

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
adapter is a lie. But there was

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Fucking Submarine Game that I didn't give a

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
shit about. That was on the 3DS.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Woo hoo! 3DS.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And Fucking Cubic Ninja or whatever the fuck that

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
was. It's like, woo. Like a Box Boy.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Box Boy or whatever. Yeah, it's like

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It's like, I don't

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I've made you a shirt. It has

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
two letters on it. QQ

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Alright.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Let's

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
travel back. Let's travel back to a

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
simpler time when there was

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
no rumors on consoles. You

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
read about it in the magazine and

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
it was fucking fat. And then it didn't come out.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And then it never came out.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Dark Soccer's gonna step into what's left of the vault

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
and find a game that she- The vault is

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
still there. We're just downsizing

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
the extra. We're cutting the

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
chaff. The downsized

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and the outsourced vault.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
We're sharing the vault. You are outsourcing

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
parts of it to other players. We're sharing the vault with

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
other people for money. Alright.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
We'll rent a ColecoVision.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
The classic game of the week.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Dark Soccer, what did you find in the vault that you think

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Hey, Bratz

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
you should be playing this game. And actually, I gotta say

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
yet again, here's a game you picked this week

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
where I'm going, how has this never been

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
a game? How was this never

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
picked? This game is legendary.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
How many

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
games are there in the world, Rob?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
There's a lot, actually.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I know, right? There's a lot of games. And hey,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I picked crap last time, so I picked a good one

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
this time. Alright, so

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
here it is. What is your classic game of the week?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Spy Hunter.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
You can hear it very

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
faintly.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Anyway,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Spy Hunter came out in 1983

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
by Valley Midway.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And it basically

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
was supposed to be

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
a James Bond game.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But they didn't get the license for it.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
So basically, you're driving down roads

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
in what's called the interceptor

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
car, which can destroy other enemies

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
with different weapons, so it's like the James Bond

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
car, you know.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It had sit-down versions and stand-up

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
versions, which of course

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
the stand-up ones were more common because they could just be

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
integrated into any old cabinet design.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
It had a steering wheel

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
that had the aircraft-style steering wheel.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And you also

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
had a stick shift for low and high

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
gears and a pedal.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
There were many, many ports. There was even

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
a pinball version.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Sequels, a new

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
version of the game's everything.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And a movie that had

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
The Rock in it.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Oh, don't ask me.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I didn't see it.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So it is, you know, a scrolling

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
down,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
vertical scrolling driving

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
game. You have a top-down perspective.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And you are driving

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
the G6155

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
interceptor.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Yeah, you just go around

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
shooting stuff and you can get like

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
augmented weapons

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
like different machine guns and things by

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
entering a weapons van.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And you can summon

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
your van by clicking

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
you press

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
a blinking

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
weapons van button that would show

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
up. And you get like oil slick

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
smokescreen, surface-to-air missiles,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
stuff like that. And you have

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
limited ammo for those and you'll lose

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
them if the car is destroyed. You also have a little

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
dashboard that shows you what you've got

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
when. You can also

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
convert the car to

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
a go fast boat.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Vroom. By driving through

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
a boathouse that will appear from the side

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
of the road.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
So it's kind

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
of an infinite game. It has no ending.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
You play until you die. Until you run out of money.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
So basically, the guy that

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
created

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
the game, George

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Gomez, was inspired by audio

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
cassette tape music from

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
the James Bond movies. And he worked with Tom

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Leon who

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
the two of them worked together on Tron.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
So pretty cool. And of course

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
it plays the Peter Gunn theme in the background.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So they wanted to have

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
the James Bond theme. They were trying to get the

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
license. And like I said, they couldn't get it.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
So Peter Gunn it is.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
There was also a pinball version

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
that came out in 1984 by Bally.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Since it was Bally Midway that put

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
out the game. They had the license.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I don't think I've ever played a Spy Hunter table.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It's alright.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But Spy Hunter also had a sequel

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Spy Hunter 2 in 1987.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And it had a co-op 2 player.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But instead of the

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
top down, it had the 3D perspective

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
from above and behind the car.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Excuse me. Also

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Sunsoft in Japan had

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
reprogrammed the game for the

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
NES. And they also did

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Battle Formula which was

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
kind of much like

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
it. But

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
they were trying to avoid copyright infringement

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
so they had

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
a different front cover and everything.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So crazy.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And outside of Japan

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
it was released as Super Spy Hunter.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Let's see what we had for other

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
releases.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Yeah, so

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
they were going to be doing

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
a movie that did

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
not go into production that had

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
The Rock.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
All kinds of other stuff

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
going on with that one. Yeah, I didn't really pay

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
much attention to movie stuff when it was happening.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
So

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
as far as different versions, we've

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
had

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
DOS, NES,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Atari 2600,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
8-bit family computer,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
well, the Atari 8-bit family computer.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
The CPC, the ZX

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Spectrum, Commodore 64,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Apple II, ColecoVision,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
BBC Micro. There was a

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
clone called Major Motion that

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
came out by Microdeal on the

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Atari ST and Amiga.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
The Nintendo port was kind of crap because

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
it had really bad collision

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
detection.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
The Commodore 64

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
and Atari 8-bit versions

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
had very similar bugs.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Like, the car

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
would drive on the side of the

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
road and enemy

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
cars couldn't touch it. There was just some weird

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
stuff that would go on. Also

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
there were re-releases for the Atari Greatest Hits

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
of

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Midway's Greatest Arcade

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Hits Volume 1 for N64,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Midway Arcade Treasures,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
GameCube PS2, Xbox,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
the Extend to Play versions

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
for PSP, and

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Midway Arcade Origins

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
for PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It was

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
funny.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Spy Hunter had actually

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
been incorporated into other

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
things in pop culture.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
In Murder, She Wrote, do we remember

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
that show?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Hell yes, of course we do.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
How could you forget the great Angela

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Langbury? Well, there

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
was an episode called Hit, Run, and Homicide

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
where

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
her character realized

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
that the

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
solution to the case

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
was after she was playing

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Spy Hunter, so

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I thought that was kind of

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
a neat inclusion for inspiration.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Spy Hunter

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
there's an easter egg for it in Microsoft

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Excel 2000 that requires

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
DirectX to work. I just wanted to say

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
real quick, since the Spy Hunter music

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
ran out, I thought maybe we could

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
use a little bit of this here

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
instead.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's the Murder, She Wrote theme

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
song. Oh, Rob.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Did they ever make a game out of Murder, She Wrote?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Why the fuck not?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I'm pretty sure it was probably a PC game

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
from Murder, She Wrote.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Can I finish, Rob?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I suppose.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Okay.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
In 2008, Pontiac had a commercial

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
that had

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
the Spy Hunter car being replaced

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
by the Pontiac G8 GT

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
after the original car was destroyed.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Zynga did

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
a game

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
it had in Mafia Wars

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
that was a car called The Hunter Spy

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
XS.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
The Hunter arcade game was seen in Big.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And in Teen Titans Go, which

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
they had

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
an episode called Video Game References

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Cyborg played a game called

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Pie Hunter.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Several games, actually.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I was gonna say

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
that they'd made

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Murder, She Wrote and Murder, She Wrote 2

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
returned to Cabot Cove.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
They made a Murder, She Wrote game.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
They're on iPhone. In 2009,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
they made a Murder, She Wrote game.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Oh yes, Spy Hunter, though.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I'm done.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Fuck.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Just think, we're only a few more years away

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
from Classic Game of the Week that could be Murder, She Wrote.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I'll do a Murder, She Wrote game before I do Halo.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
That's it.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
We've got Doriaki

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
in the fridge and I'm gonna have some.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Alright, there it is. Your Classic Game of the Week.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Spy Hunter and a little bit of Murder, She Wrote.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
But like,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Dark Soccer can't argue

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
because Murder, She Wrote is a true classic.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I mean, that's just how it is.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I can argue.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Alright.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
We're gonna take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
We have plenty more to come

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
with the show, including

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
the Fugu Question of the Week.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
We're gonna get to your calls as well.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
and emails.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Phone calls. You guys.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Plenty more when we come back right after this.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Live tonight with Episode 632

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
of our show,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
February the 28th of 2016.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I apologize.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
My voice is kind of going in and out.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I'm still trying to shake.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Remember I missed a show like a month ago because I was sick?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
That came back in full force for

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
MagFest and I'm still trying to shake it.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I think I've probably had three different

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
colds all at once is what's happening.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
This is what happens when you go to conventions

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
is everything tries to kill you.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
It's called confunk.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah, confunk. A little bit of that.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Not meaning the smell of confunk, but the feeling of confunk.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I will give props to MagFest.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
It did not smell

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
like butt.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
It actually was pretty respectable.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Maybe that's because it was so cold

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and it was a big open space.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
There was proper refrigeration and ventilation everywhere,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
but I was very proud

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
of you MagFesters for not

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
smelling.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
MagFest did not MagFester.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That's right. It did not MagFester.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Quick live programming note

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
for those of you guys that are listening live tonight

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
at The Voice of the Geek Network.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
We're going to do a special encore presentation

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
of one of our new shows on the network, GameBui.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
If you've never heard them,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
GameBui.org did a great little

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Zelda retrospective this past week.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
We're going to replay that after tonight's episode of OLR.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
We had some,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
for lack of a better term, fuckery

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
go on with the station this week,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
where I was not able to get new shows in

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
for a couple days, which was really irritating

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
the shit out of me, and unfortunately,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
nobody got to hear the new GameBui because of it

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
on the feed.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So we're going to play it at a special time tonight

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
here after the show, so apologies to the boys

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
over there at GameBui.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And thanks for putting up with technical difficulties

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
that are out of our control.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It's frustrating in the slightest, but anyway.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Let's get to some rapid

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
fire news.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Loki.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
So this is kind of a neat little

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
addition to the package for if you

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
purchase the Xbox One version of Doom.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Not only will you get Doom,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
but you'll also get the original Doom and

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Doom 2, which were re-released

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
on Xbox 360 via

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Xbox Live Arcade. You will get

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
those since they will be backwards compatible with

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
the Xbox One.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
So that's pretty sweet.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
So yeah,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
go check that out. It's kind of a nice little bonus

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
if you want to purchase that game on that platform.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Also, speaking of backwards

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
compatible games, there's been

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
some more added to the Xbox One,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
including Geometry Wars,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Retro Evolved, Carcassonne,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
and I think

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
a few others. Let's see.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Nope. Those are the only

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
two that they mentioned. Oh.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Yep. But Geometry

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Wars. That's pretty awesome.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Never really got into Carcassonne, though.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And finally,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
March is right around the corner here.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And with that, of course, you can expect some new games

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
that will be free on

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Xbox and PlayStation

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
platforms, starting off with the Xbox

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Games with Gold.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
For Xbox One, you're going to have

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
from March 1st through March 31st,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and Lords of the Fallen

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
from March 16th through April 15th.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
A little bit extra time on that one.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And then on Xbox 360,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Supreme Commander 2,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
March 1st to March 15th,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
and the original Borderlands

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
from March 16th to March 31st.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And of course, as usual,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
the Xbox 360 games are backwards compatible

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
with the Xbox One.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And then on top of that,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
we've also got

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
for

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
PlayStation 4, now you

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
may remember there was the whole vote to

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
see which game would be included

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
free for March. Well,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Broforce won, so you can expect

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
that on PlayStation 4,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
as well as Galaxie, which

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
looks pretty awesome. It's kind of a

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Saturday morning cartoon, anime

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
style

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
space shooter game that

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
looks pretty badass, actually.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
So that'll be coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Flame Over and Reality

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Fighters on PlayStation Vita,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
and Super Stardust HD

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
and the last guy on PlayStation

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
3.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So, I don't know.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Those two, though, on the

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
PlayStation 4, though, are pretty awesome. And of course,

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I believe the other two titles that were not

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
part of the free selection there

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
will be discounted for the month of March.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And I believe that was Assault Android

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Cactus is one of them.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Yes, I'll definitely be picking that up, but a lot

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
of good free stuff.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Yeah, that Galaxie looks

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
badass. I actually almost

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
purchased that, and now I

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
get it free.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
It's always irritating when you get a game, and then

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
it goes free like the very next month, right?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
But, you know, that's what

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
happens in this day and age sometimes.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Well, how cool is it that

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
hidden stuff is found in a video

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
game years and years later,

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
especially a game like

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Mortal Kombat? That's right.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
There are some additional menus

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
in the Mortal Kombat series.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
They were called EJB menus,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and they were rumored for a very long time,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
and these menus were... That's for Ed Boon's

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
initials. That's right. They were finally found

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
on arcade hardware

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
of the first three Mortal Kombat games.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Thanks to

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
ROM scrubbing, it was known that the menus were

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
there for some time, but nobody really

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
knew how to get there. It takes

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
a lightning-quick input,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I guess some complicated button presses

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
with a block, on

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
both player one and player two sides

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
to unlock.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
All the menus do, they have a

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
special hello message, a shortcut

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
to putting your initials at the top of the

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
ranking board, a Galaga

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
minigame in

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, and a gallery

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
of all the characters' endings.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
It's not

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
anything that's going to change the game.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
It's not like it's giving you, like, morphs

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
as Kano or whatever, but

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
it's just interesting that they were hidden for

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
20 years and they were just found. And I

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
guess what's interesting about it is that

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
the patterns were there the whole time.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
They also work on ROM hacks.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
They do, and they work on the

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Midway arcade treasures. So if you

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
have, like, the Xbox version

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
or anything

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
that's basically emulating the game itself,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
it's in there. So that's pretty cool.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
There's also

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
the Fatality Viewer

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
in, I think, Ultimate

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Mortal Kombat 3 was one of

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
the menu items there that wasn't in the

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
other two. It used

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
to be that it was

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
something that you could get as an unlock for, like,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
beating one of the hardest modes.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And it's there as a...

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
It also has the hidden

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
character unlock as well

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
for one of the

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
different builds, I think.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I remember watching the video of it. It was actually

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
really cool.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Well, Twitch

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
also announcing this week that they are

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
now archiving streams

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
with

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
chat. So you

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
can now get chat replay alongside the

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
streams, which is, I think, great because

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
when you're trying to

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
create content that is going

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
to last longer and

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
work on demand and not just be live,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
you have to be able to

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
see the chat. Like, what we try to do

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
here at OLR, if we're going to respond to

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
something in chat, we do try to read that

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
comment before just saying, oh, ha

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
ha, that was really funny, DarkTetsuya.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
You know, like, you have to be able to read

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
the comment in order to respond to it.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
So I think it's really good that Twitch will have

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
this on their replay. So that's

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
pretty cool. I guess

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
a user actually helped created that.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Oh, neat.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Also, in sort of

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
video game news, like, really distant,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
like, super removed, but

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I'm going to mention this anyway.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Kanye West has apparently announced on Twitter that

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
his next album will be called

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Turbografx-16, named

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
after one of the most favorite gaming systems

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
from his childhood. He said

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
in a series of tweets, my next album

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
is titled Turbografx-16 as of

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
now, just on some super nerd vibes.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
One of my favorite gaming systems when I was

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
a kid. Blazing Lasers is probably my favorite

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
game on that console. My boy

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Molly that I spoke about on the song

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Drive Slow actually had an EOGO in real

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
life, bro. We actually played Spy

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Hunter at my mom's house. Hey, how about that?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Bringing it all together. You know, it's funny.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I've got both of those.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Yeah, so, you know,

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Kanye West has a tendency to just tweet

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
kind of, he kind of lets his butt do

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
the tweeting, so I don't know if that

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
will actually end up happening, but

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
cool to know that he was a gaming nerd

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
at one point like a lot of the rest of us, so

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
neat.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Moving on. Dark Soccer, excuse me.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Well, one of the writers

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
for, um, who's working on

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Mass Effect Andromeda

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
left BioWare to go to Bungie.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
He was actually one of the

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
writers for Dragon Age as well

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
and that he thinks that Andromeda

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
will blow people away and he couldn't be prouder to

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
be a part of it, but he's

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
also, um, left

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Chris Schlerf, who

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
was with BioWare Montreal.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
We already lost David Gator,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
so sad.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Also, and I was actually watching the trailer

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
for this last night. Oh my god.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Raiden 5.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Coming out to Xbox

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
1 in Japan.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I guess this would be the only

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
reason to have an Xbox 1

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
ever in Japan.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But Raiden 5, like,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
it looked pretty freaking amazing.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I was so happy. And it uses

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
the power of the cloud to gather

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
player data and it impacts your game

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
in real time, so

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
that's pretty exciting.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Maybe we'll get it on PC or something.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And then,

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
last but not least, uh, character

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
for Killer Instinct.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
The Arbiter from Halo

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
is going to be there.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And I watched the trailer for that

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
too and I was like, that's kind of cool.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
And then I went back and

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
watched the rest of Hisako's story mode.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
There you go.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Alright. I need to, uh,

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I need to play through the rest of the,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
uh, stories

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
in Killer Instinct as well. I did do Hisako

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
though. You're a fave.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Let's get to... I just have

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
an odd obsession with Onryo.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
So... Now I know,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
you have for a long time. Did you hear

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
they're doing, uh,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
The Ring vs Juhon?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Yes, I have read that. I'm like, oh my god!

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Yeah. Two of my favoritest ever

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
movies in one. In Japan, right?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Except Sadako 3D was stupid.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Like, really stupid.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And I haven't seen the last

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
two, uh, Juhon flicks.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
But the premise seemed really stupid for those two. So are they gonna, like,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
slap fight each other or something?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I mean, like... And then will they Americanize

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
it and ruin it? I have no idea.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Well, The Grudge was okay for the US

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
because it had the same director. It was all

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
the subsequent sequels I refused to watch

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
that were, as I understood,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
fairly shitty.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
But... Are they gonna call it,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
like, you know, The Ring?

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Ring vs Grudge? The Grudge

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
match? Enter The Ring!

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's the Grudge match!

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
One can hope.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
What happens when you get

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
two completely different vengeful

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
ghosts in the same room?

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I hope it's jumpscaring back and forth.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Like, they'll have a jumpscare off. You know how, like, the wizards

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
can usually fight? And it's like that giant

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
bolt of lightning or something that they go back and forth?

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It says there's gonna be jumpscares

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
going back and forth.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Only if at the end of it, one of them will go,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
you just got served. Would this be

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
like...

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
immortal

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
combat?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Perhaps?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
It'll be like... Next Mortal Kombat?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Jason vs Freddy or whatever.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
No, I don't think so.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
We need to get to the foogle question of the week,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
and quick.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Every week, you guys answer

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
our question that we post on our Facebook

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
and Google Plus communities. You take Facebook and Google

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
and you slam those words together, you get

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Google! And this week, of course,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
all about the Pokemons,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
since we did just have the big birthday we've been

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
waiting for over the weekend.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Okay, one more Pokemon question

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
for you all this week, since we did just have the big

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
birthday. Have you already decided

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
if you're getting Sun, Moon,

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
or neither? And

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
which Pokemon across the years is your

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
favorite, and why?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So, very similar to the questions I asked here at the studio

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
at the beginning of the show. We'll start

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
off at Google Plus, Prince

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Peach Fuzz starting us off

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
tonight, saying both.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Some people have to, when you say

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
gotta catch them all, they actually have to have

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
them all, which is why they will buy both games.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
So, Prince Peach Fuzz is gonna

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
plan on getting both Sun and Moon.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
And favorite Pokemon, Snorlax.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
He's my spirit Pokemon.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
That's a good answer. That's a very good

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
answer. I see a lot of myself in

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Snorlax as well.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
ActDeaf responded on Google Plus

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
saying, of course, yes, probably Moon.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And I have a lot of favorites

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
like Lucario and Ninetales,

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
but I think Hawlucha

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
is the Pokemon that I like the most.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I hope I didn't butcher that name.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
With 700 Pokemon, even I can't pronounce them all these days.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
So, there you go.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Going over to

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Facebook,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
starting off with Haseo Sumeruagawa

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
says, might check them out,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
and Rayquaza is the

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
legendary for emerald is my

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
favorite. Our first legendary Pokemon

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
showing up in the favorites.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
AndyR says, at the moment, neither.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Since I didn't really enjoy the

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
last two I played, White and Y.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
But I said I wasn't gonna get Y

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
either, and the zeitgeist that launched got me.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Do you mean game or monster?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
If former, gold. If latter,

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
far-fetched. Yeah, I know.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
He's just a lame duck, but for some reason

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I just really liked him as a kid.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Hey, you know what another one of my favorite Pokemon is?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Psyduck. You wanna know what's funny?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Ages and ages

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
ago, in fact

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I think it was the same night that we picked up my Togepi

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
which I also still super love Togepi.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
We found a Psyduck,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
a little Psyduck and we bought it.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And he's been our family Psyduck.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
We've had him ever since, like first

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
gen Psyduck toy.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I used to have a little keychain that would light up that was a

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Psyduck. You turn the little thing and it would just

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
light up. I found my Togepi

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
keychain that you push in the stomach

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
and he goes, tippy tippy!

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Adorable!

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Bryce H. responded

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
and said, I'm definitely getting Sun or Moon.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I won't choose which one until I see the legendary

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Pokemon for each. And my favorite

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Pokemon is Ditto because Ditto

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
can be any Pokemon.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
That was a good episode of the show too with

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Duplica. My friend witnessed

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Duplica one Halloween. We all witnessed Pokemon

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
characters and I witnessed Ash and I

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
had a life-sized Pikachu.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
My friends, you've met Billy, right? Billy was

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Team Rocket.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
He was Team Rocket. He was James

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
and our other friend was Jessie. It was

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
adorable. And then

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
our friend was Duplica. We had a good

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
time. It was silly. I loved it.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I think we had a friend that was Misty too.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I can't remember. Anyway.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Bryce H. continued, oh sorry. I already

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
read that answer. How about Cial who says

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I'm getting one of them. I don't know which yet.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Favorite Pokemon over the years?

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Kabutops because Horseshoe Crabs

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
are cool.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Fifth Dream says, I already pre-ordered

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Pokemon Moon today. I'm so excited

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
for it. And I love Pikachu.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Maybe I'm just a sucker for the way they

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
marketed him. But he's just too cute.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I liked him since the very beginning of the anime. I just

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
bought another t-shirt with him on it

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
to celebrate Pokemon Day yesterday.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Pika Pika.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Degenerate Johnny says, as a Dark Souls fan

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I have three words. Praise

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
the sun. As far as my

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
favorite Pokemon of all time, it will have to

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
be Ditto because he, she

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
it makes my Pokemon shiny.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
That's a good reason to get

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Sun. I'm thinking Wii Fit Trainer.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Salute the Sun.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Redtertainment says, I've never got any

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I'm sorry, excuse me, I've never really gotten into

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
any of the Pokemon games, but Red speaks

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
to me for some reason.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Never answered about Sun,

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Moon or any of the other Pokemon, but Red.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Veronica Isabel replied

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
and said, I'm getting Moon. My

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
favorite Pokemon is Mewtwo who

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I always nickname Frieza

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
because of Dragon Ball Z.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I almost read that as

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Franzia because I had something else on my mind.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
It involves a box.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Red the Haze

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
replied over on Facebook and said

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I'll wait for the available Pokemon list

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
and the versions before I choose though.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I haven't played a Pokemon game since Platinum.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Pokemon Ekans

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
because it's Snake backwards.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
It is, it's a very

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
creative name, isn't it?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And lastly, Kareem

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Jay responded and said, my

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
favorite Pokemon is Meowth.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Instead of reminding viewers what his name

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
is, he can actually talk.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Well, one Meowth

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
can actually talk. I believe not all

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
the Meowths could talk, just that particular one.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
No, just that one.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I have a Pokemon CD.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
In fact, I don't know if you remember when

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I got it, I think you were there when I did.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
But I have one of those little singles and it has the

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Miyasu song on it.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
it's basically him singing

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
about all of the other Pokemon.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
So it was cute.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
S2100 Matt says,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
wow, I never knew that. Mind blown.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I'm assuming that's about the Ekans. Is Snake

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
spelled backwards?

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
There's all sorts of weird stuff you see in the

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
games and then you're like, oh my god,

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
how did I never see that before?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
My god.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Alright, anyway.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Let's move on. That was it for the Fugu

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Question of the Week, so let's get back into

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
some gaming news. Loki.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Sorry,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I was checking up on your friends.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Oh yeah, our village

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
is being raided right now, isn't it?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Yes,

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
anyways,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
never

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
really had a favorite Pokemon.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
But,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I don't know.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
So, this is kind of

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
cool. They're going to take their time

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
on HoloLens, which is good because

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
HoloLens as it is right now kind of sucks.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
But Microsoft isn't looking

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
to rush it out like they did

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
with, well, not really rushed it out, but

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
they didn't want to put it out like Connect.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Basically, they didn't want it to be

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
not adapted

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
as widely as the

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Connect was. So, for example, they were

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
describing the Connect as not really a pleasant

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
experience. It just wasn't ready.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
They were saying that the consumer bought a

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
HoloLens today. They would have like 12 things to

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
do with it. And they would say, cool, I

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
bought a $3,000 product. Well,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
first off, you know, that is the

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
price of the development kit, not the actual

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
MSRP, because if it was $3,000,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I'd be like, fuck you. No

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
way that this is going to happen.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But, you know,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
after you've done those 12 things, it's going to be collecting

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
dust. So,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
right now, this just,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
you know, going to release it when it's

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
ready.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
So, we'll have to see when that's ready.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Hopefully soon, and hopefully

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
they fix all the problems with it. Maybe they can

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
just do an entirely internal first

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
generation, so that way we're not subjected

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
to it until they get a lot of the kinks worked out.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I hope so.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
It looks interesting, it's just

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
it's not good the way it

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
is right now. It needs, like,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
if it were to perform

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
like they show it often, like,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
you know, during their press conferences

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
and stuff with the special cameras and shit,

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
if it actually worked like that,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
then yes, it would be pretty badass.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
But it's not. It

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
doesn't look anything like that, so

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
that's the problem.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Alright,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
well, let's talk about an

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
exciting partnership, at least I'm really excited

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
about this. Silicon Studio

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
and Mistwalker are apparently joining

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
together to develop a new game.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
If you've not heard of Silicon Studio, well,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
they're the makers of Bravely Default.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
So, that's the makers of

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Bravely Default and the makers of

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Lost Odyssey coming together to make a

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
game. We don't know what it's called,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
what it looks like, or when it comes out, but

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
of course, more info

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
to come soon, whenever that is.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I'm very excited to hear about

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
this. I wonder

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
if this ties to, we saw

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Mistwalker, the guy from Mistwalker

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
did a little talk, and he teased

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
some art, so I wonder if this could be

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
something about it, who knows.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Apparently there was an image that did come out

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
with the announcement as well, so

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
we'll see. Maybe

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
E3 this year is when we'll hear more about it

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and what system it might be on.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Maybe it's an

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
NX game, maybe it's another DS game.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Who knows? We'll find out.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Moving on,

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
DarkSakura. Sorry, I'm having a very, very

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
important conversation. I bet.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I bet. About what's

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
worse, Sadako or

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Kayako. The Ring

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
versus Ju-on.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Anyway.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
So, Disney's

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
up to some shystey

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
crap. They

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
are wanting to lobby in favor

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
of the TPP,

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
the

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Trans-Pacific Partnership,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
big trade thing that's

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
wanting to send our more jobs

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
overseas, and blah, blah, blah.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
So, the Disney CEO

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Bob Iger has

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
encouraged employees to enroll in a program

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
that would deduct part of their

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
check, so that it would

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
go into the Disney PAC,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
the Political Action Committee,

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
and wanting to

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
basically influence

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
the language of the

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
TPP.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
There's a lot

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
of

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
a lot of

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
scrutiny on this law. I mean, the big

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
thing about it is that

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
big

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
corporations are really in favor of it.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
It's supposed to make trade a lot easier for

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
them, make things a lot more affordable

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
for them to operate. However,

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
it's pretty much going to screw the local

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
economies of, you know,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
just about everybody

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
involved. So, the fact

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
that Disney is behind this,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I mean, I'm not surprised

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
because they are a big corporation.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
At the same time, though, they're wanting

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
their employees

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
to contribute

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
to this, too.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
It just seems a little bit

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
no bueno.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I mean, I don't

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
like to talk about my day job a lot

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
on the show, but I will just say

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
in very general terms, for the past

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
15 years, I've worked in the

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
healthcare industry, which is a very

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
controversial thing here in the United States,

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
and I've never been

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
asked to give money

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
to a political cause

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
like this through

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
work. It's very surprising

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
to me. With as

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
high visibility

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
and how politically charged

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
healthcare has been over the past

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
15 years, I'm really

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
surprised. I'm seeing it here

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
and I've never been asked to do it

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
in my industry.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I worked for one company for 14 years.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I'm really surprised. I was never asked to do that.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I work in

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
the tech industry.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
I've been very careful to say, to not

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
say who I work for. Only a few people know.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
It's nobody's business. Exactly.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
We are happy to spend our nights with you,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
but our days are private. But my company

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
has never asked us.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
We've just been asked to

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I guess

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
show integrity in our

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
you know, how we handle ourselves, but we've

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
never been asked specifically

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
to support this cause, to support this cause,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
to support this cause. So,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
this is just really

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I don't know. It's just

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
really stinks

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
to me. Yeah. It's interesting.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Alright, well

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
let's move on with some more news. We'll see

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
what comes of all that. Loki.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Alright, so to kind of help

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
push the whole

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
VR thing. As I mentioned, I was almost going to

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
get a Gear VR, but I kind of decided not to.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
If you

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
pre-order a

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Samsung Galaxy S7

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
or S7 Edge,

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I guess starting February

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
23rd, they're also going to

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
kind of sweeten the pot by including a

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Gear VR.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
And along

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
with that, I guess they're throwing in

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
six VR games

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
and it depends on which

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
provider you purchased it from.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
But they include such games

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
like Eve Gunjack, Esper 2,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Dead Secret, Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Start Chart,

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
and Hero Bound for one of them.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Ashar 2,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Darknet Drift, Keep Talking, Nobody

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Explodes, Start Chart, and Hero

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Bound for another one, and Lands' Ed

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Mortal Blitz VR, Deer Hunter VR,

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Ocean Rift, and Hero Bound

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
for the third one.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
It's kind of neat, I mean, I just

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I don't know. I mean, if I was going to

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
purchase a new phone, I'd love to get, you know, that

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
shit free, but

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I just bought a phone, so I don't think I'll

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
be upgrading anytime soon to the

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
to the brand new S7

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
because I have an S6.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Don't you hate that when you buy the hardware

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
and then the very next week, oh, now the hardware comes

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
with games. Well, you know, it's free stuff.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Yeah, and I don't know, I don't know how to see how much

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
the S7 is and what's so cool about

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
it, I mean. Well, they want

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
to move these units, so they have to put

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
in something, you know, it's like, it's the whole

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Nintendo sold the Wii through

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Wii Sports, and I'm not saying any of these games

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
are necessarily at the level of Wii Sports, but you have

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
to have those games that are gonna, you know,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
make people want to buy the hardware, really.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
That's why I think it's really rough

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
when you release your hardware with no

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
pack-in games. What they need to do is just

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
include a fucking, a three month

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
subscription, the virtual real porn,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
and there you go. That'll

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
sell tons of those units.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Alright.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I didn't talk a lot about this game this week

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
because I didn't play it myself,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
but Alan has been playing a lot of,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and you'll be proud to hear this, Loki, he's been playing a lot of

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Fallout 4, in fact, I think he's in there playing it right now,

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
but he's off work tonight because

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
they, with that whole little

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
gold statue show that's going on right now,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
there's not a lot of people answering polls,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
so he's in there playing Fallout 4

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
right now, so I watched him play some of it,

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
and I was like, show me killing mobs,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
and he got

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
his butt kicked.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
It was funny. But anyway,

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
talking about Fallout 4, I guess

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
there's a new survival mode

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
that is gonna be coming out for Fallout 4, and Bethesda

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
actually confirmed it. Some of the details

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
had leaked on, I guess, Reddit

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
somewhere, and the publisher came out and

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
confirmed it. Basically, you'll

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
be able to enable this with a menu swipe,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
and you'll be able to do more

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
and take more damage.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Manual and quick save options will be disabled,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
you have to sleep at least an hour

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
to save, and there is no

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
fast travel.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Enemies won't show up on your compass, and fatigue

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
will matter. So,

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
yeah, sounds like it's

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
gonna be a little bit more of a hardcore mode,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
but we'll probably make for some good

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
livestream feeds and all that stuff, those people

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
like to play hardcore and show off and all that

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
stuff. By the way, if you've been

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
eagerly anticipating a mod

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
support on the various platforms,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
we now have some time frames

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
as to when that mod support is finally

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
going to come out, and that was via an

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
interview with Game Informer, where

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
the PC will be getting its official

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
mod support in April. I say official

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
because you know the mods are already out there.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
They're already out there. They're just not official, but

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
official modding comes in April.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Xbox One will start getting the mods in

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
May, and PlayStation 4 in

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
June. I'm pretty excited about that.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Yeah, that'll be pretty awesome.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
He did say the full quote,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
our goal is between the first two DLCs.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
It'll be up at that time on PC

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
in April. All that stuff will go

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
up on PC. People are beta testing it.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
There will be a lag on consoles.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
We want to get it up and have it work. It'll

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
probably be a good month before it hits

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Xbox One, and another month for

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
PlayStation 4. So notice how

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
he didn't really quote June. He said

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
about a month, so it could take

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
a little longer if you're on PlayStation 4.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Yeah, I was going to say one of the things

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
that they did announce while we were out

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
was the actual Fallout 4 DLCs,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
or at least the first bit of it.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
They're saying they're adding more on top of that, but this

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
is what you get for your season pass right

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
now, which it will be going up to $60

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
in March, so if you were interested

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
to purchase it now. But the first

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
three pieces of DLC, they've got the Automatron,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
which is coming out for $9.99

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
in March, and that adds

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
some new robots. You can create your own

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
robots, that type of stuff.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
You mix limbs and stuff together.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Then in April, Wasteland

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Workshop, where you can create your own fighting

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
pits, as well as some new

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
settlement things, and then finally

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
kind of the actual big

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
expansion, which is in May, called Far Harbor,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
which is going to be $24.99

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
separately, but it's all included

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
in the season pass, plus

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
other things that they haven't announced yet,

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
so definitely check it out.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Alright, it's time

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
to get to the mailbag! Hey, what do you know,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
DarkSakura, you're here to do it after all.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Sorry, give me a second.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
That's okay, you thought you'd be gone, but

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
No, I think you should open it and read it.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I'm actually feeling a little under the weather

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
still, so I'd really prefer it if you could do it.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I'm the one that has had a headache

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
since Thursday. Maybe we'll make Loki do it.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Hold on. Loki should read the email.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I don't even know if he knows how to log in.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
I don't even know how to read!

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I can maybe do one if you really

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
want me to, just my voice is

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
hurting tonight.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
You can always email us.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
is the place to send us emails.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And we will happily

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
read your emails every week here at

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Orange Lounge Radio, and respond to them

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
in kind.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Come on, Hoback, log me in.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
There we go.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Alright, okay, you ready?

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Yes.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
This one's

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
labeled color from last week.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Hey, OLR family, please don't

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
take this the wrong way, but when Derek

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
called in last week, I thought it was

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Latrice Royale from RuPaul's Drag Race, LOL.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Wouldn't it be cool to interview

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
one of the drag queens that play video games?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Long time podcast listener, DJIQ.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I will tell you this.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I have

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
done an interview

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
with one of the drag queens from RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
You did? I did Tatiana

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
from season two.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Back when I was writing

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
for Tiara's

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
website thing that she was doing before.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
The Geek Life, or whatever it's called, right?

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Yeah, Geek Life.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I'm laughing because I'm not

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
sure Derek will see the

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
great compliment that

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
is in your comparison there,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
but in all seriousness,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
I actually don't

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
think I hear it at all.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
When I think of Latrice Royale,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I think of the laugh. Latrice Royale has a

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
very epic laugh. Have you ever heard

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Latrice Royale's laugh, Dark Sakura?

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
No, I haven't listened to Latrice Royale

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
at all.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
You don't know what you've been missing.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
She's very large and in charge

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
and she says that herself.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Drag queen, and she has a

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
laugh that you will remember through the ages.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
In fact,

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I'm trying to find the one...

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Okay, here's her laugh.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
There was one that was set to death metal.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I can't find it though.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
See, it's always like a scream, right?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
That's it. But here's the thing.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I think you know who sounds like that.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
It's Captain Spike from GameBooey.org.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
If you ever get him to laugh,

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
listen to it, because he'll do that same thing

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
where he goes,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
he'll kind of do that same little scream.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
When I think of

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Latrice Royale laughing,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I think of Captain Spike from GameBooey.org.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
There's a clip out there

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
where it's mixed to death metal, and it's so

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
funny. I wish I could find it.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
How about I go to the next email? How about it?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Okay, this is from Raginator.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Yes, I'm reading your email.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Even after I said I wasn't, because I'm here.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
We got to the mailbag early tonight.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Hi everyone, it's Raginator yet again.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I appreciate that there won't be a show

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
on Sunday 2-21, and odds are

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
this email may be slightly out of date by then,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
but I wanted to update everyone real quick,

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
and if need be, supplement this email with

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
a quick, short email in the days

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
to come. Last weekend I received

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
my, um,

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
one check for a computer,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
and I had the usable funds in my bank

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
account by the 16th.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Unfortunately, the one PC that I was

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
initially eyeing was out of stock by the time

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I had the opportunity to order it.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
That being said, I ordered this one.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
It's a different one. I'm not going to go about

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
the specs on it.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
I also ordered extra

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
RAM, a webcam, an additional Blu-ray

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
drive. Earlier today I received the PC

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
itself, and I'm still waiting on the

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
other three items.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
All that being said, it will still be a little while

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
yet before I have my internet and whatnot

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
turned back on. I still need to

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
save up for the two additional months so I can buy

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
two more things, a cheapo barebones

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
TV, and one of those fancy gaming headsets

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
that's capable of surround sound.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
That being said, I anticipate my internet

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
and whatnot being turned

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
back on by May 1st.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Anyone talk to you soon?

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
It's to me. Never mind.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
That's for Majornator. I read your email.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Mostly.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
And he's back.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Also in chat.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
He got that computer situation worked out.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Last email.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Last email.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Is long.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
This comes from

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I don't have a name on it so I'm just going to say

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
well, I have a full name on it but a new

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
nickname, so I'll just say Delvin is who it's from.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Hey, OLR. Glad

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
to have you guys back this week because I am

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
upset about the launch of Street Fighter 5.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
It was kind of crap, wasn't it?

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
The game launched with many features not present

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
in the game.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
The store is not available. The online battle lounges

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
only allow you to play with one other friend

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
in an arcade mode. An empty

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
story mode and extremely piss poor online

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
at launch. Amen to that.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Oh my god, it was not great.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Now,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I fully understand that high demand of any

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
new game will shut down the servers on launch

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
day and a few days after

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
that, so I'm willing to let that slide. However,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
they had many other

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
issues once things stabilized.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Not being able to play with friends, which is

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
one of the few things you can currently do in

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
the game. Also,

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
when the servers are not online, you don't get

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
any in-game currency for things

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
to purchase, such as new characters

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
and costumes. This

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
brings me to my next issue,

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
being the lack of characters and high price

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
tag of the game. 16 characters

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
with more on the way at $6 each.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
You can purchase characters with

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
in-game money at $100,000

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
per character and you'll only

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
earn $25 per loss and $50

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
per win. To keep this short,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I'll get to my point here and say that this

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
model concerns me

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
and is a trend that I see starting to

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
increase instead of decrease. Why do

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
developers continue to launch games that are

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
half done, collect our money, and then fix it

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
later? When did this become acceptable?

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I purchased the game under the pretense

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
of it's done and we'll add more

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
extra stuff later. Now, here's 50%

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
of the game now and they give you

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
25% in a month and the rest

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
over the next couple of months at $6

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
a pop. But give us full pop now.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
This is starting to make

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
an extremely expensive, make gaming an

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
extremely expensive hobby. Your $70 game

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
just become over $100. Canadian

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
dollars here, our dollar is poo right now.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
What are your guys' thoughts on all of this?

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Love you guys, Delvin.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Yeah, I gave you my thoughts, I agree with everything

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
you just said.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Cosigned.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I was like, they gave us

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Karin and no Sakura.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
That was like

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
nailed for me right there. Well, it's not even

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
like necessarily who's in and who's out

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
and the characters they picked and so forth, but it's

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
just the fact that the game is only like

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
half there, you know?

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
There's this really disturbing trending

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
by the way Delvin is from the podcast

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Video Game Realness and is a pal

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
of mine on Reading is Fundamental

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
so if you, which I

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
realise is a little

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
separated because it's not exactly nerdy

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
but it's nerdy of a different sort. But anyway

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
so

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
we have this disturbing

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
trend going on in gaming where

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
they want your money for

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
less product up front

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
and I think in a way

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
we have Kickstarter to thank for some of

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
that.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Because companies have seen that people

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
will pay a lot of money

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
in advance for a product that doesn't exist

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
yet. And you know, I think

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Kickstarter was really meant to do

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
indie development and indie support but you see

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
a lot of bigger developers are getting up on that.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
I mean hell, Shenmue 3

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
announced on the Sony stage

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
and how many people have given money to that

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
for a product that's not even out and we don't

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
know if it's going to necessarily be at the same

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
quality as games 1 and 2. I mean

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
it might be, I'm hoping it will be.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I'm having faith in the

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
creators and so forth but the reality

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
is it might not be. And

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
now we have this case of Street Fighter 5

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
where they're promising, well it'll all

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
be there, just not right now

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
and we had to get this out before the fiscal

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
year is up so you know, just

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
buy it, support it and have fun.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
All you fighting game players are really only interested

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
in the versus mode anyway, right?

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
And it's like, not me.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
I prefer the casual stuff

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I wanted a better story mode.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I mean seriously.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Or a story mode at all.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
It had this dinky version of a story mode

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
and it was

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
really very dinky. I mean

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
I was used to having, you play through

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
all of this stuff and you

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
get a real ending. There were no endings.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
It was just like,

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
precursor story modes.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
It's like, what the hell Capcom? No,

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
this isn't going to fly. You were only

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
minorly forgiven because there's an U.S. Attorney

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
on the way. But then, I mean

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
this is a trend that's continuing.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Blizzard, now

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
not even is there a pre-order

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
for Overwatch.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
There's a pre-pay for

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Overwatch. If you're willing to pay

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
all 60 bucks up front or whatever

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
it is, probably 70 for the collector's edition,

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
you get a couple extra crappy skins

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
in the game and so forth.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Are they even guaranteeing access to the beta

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
if you pre-play? I don't think they are.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And this is a really disturbing trend

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
that's happening in gaming and it is imperative

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
that we vote with our wallets.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
And I know it sucks

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
for a game like Street Fighter V

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
because it's

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Street Fighter V. Any indication

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
before that that this was going to be the case.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Yeah, I know. And this is one of those

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
things where unfortunately now Street Fighter V

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
this is going to have

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
repercussions for a long time.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Because I think for a lot of us now

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
it's lesson learned.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
And I don't know about you guys

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
but I don't plan on buying a game that's

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
not fucking done or that doesn't have

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
the stuff that I want in it.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
You know, indie developers I'll probably

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
cut a little more slack on things like

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Kickstarter and so forth but you know

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Street Fighter V, there's not

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
a lot of excuse for this.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
You have to win 2,000 matches

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
to unlock one character.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
It's a little silly.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Bob Coffee in chat

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
says, Street Fighter V came out

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
early mainly because of the Capcom Pro

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Tour. And Act Def says

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
and it's probably the best Street Fighter to date.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
But I just

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
if you're

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
into the certain you know

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
player versus player

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
and the tournament thing is what you're all about

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
only. But I don't know. I didn't

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
buy it. Just like I didn't buy Mortal Combat

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
X which to be fair at least

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Mortal Combat X wasn't

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
fucking half finished. But I knew

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
with Mortal Combat X they would

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
release all these character packs and soon

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
enough there'd be a game of the year edition

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
and oh look what's happening.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Except

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
now they're still not done.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Now there's a whole wave 2 of downloadable

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
characters so there'll be like a second

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
game of the year edition at some point.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I don't know. Rama in chat

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
says, this half done game was released

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
for those going to Evo to train.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Great. I hope only the people going to

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Evo to train bought it.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Unfortunately we all know

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
that's not the case. A lot of the rest of us

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
got suckered into doing it. But now

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
it's a question that

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
game previewers and game reviewers

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
and people will have to

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
ask game makers as embarrassing

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
as it is. Is your game done?

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Will your game be fully featured

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
at launch? And I can't

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
wait to see what fucking

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
dance around the issue answers we're going to get from that

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
question. This is another minor thing too

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
but they changed some of the characters moves.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
The way they control. Just saying.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Martin

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
in chat says, who cares about

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Street Fighter anyway? Where's my new Tekken

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
at?

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Bob Coffee in chat says,

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
it's shitty but they did this for the hardcore

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
target audience. I don't know. Like

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I respect your guys' opinion

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
but I have to be completely honest

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
and say, I feel like you guys are

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
excusing this. And like

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
if I'm not a part

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
of that

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
audience that is doing Evo or whatever

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
I don't see the excuse for this

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
at all. There is no excuse.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Fuck Street Fighter, where's

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
my Rival Schools 3?

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
And it's not excusing when

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
people are defending them. They're a fucking

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
company. You don't need to defend them.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
They need to fucking put out a product that's working.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
If it's not ready in time for Evo

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
boo fucking who? You should have worked

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
harder on it then. It'll be there for

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
next year's Evo. Exactly.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Oh poor baby. Your game's

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
not out in time for the fighting tournament.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Well, too fucking bad.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
ActDevtonChat says, I get the complaints

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
it's not excusable but the content is

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
going to be there anyway. I mean

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
to be fair, to give you guys

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
some slack here because I want to

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
respect all opinions and so forth.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
I get the whole fact that at least they're presenting

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
a roadmap on, okay

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
this is where we want the game to be

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
and this is how we're going to get there.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
But from my perspective

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I'm like, okay great. I'll buy

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
the game when it's done. Because that'll be

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
about the time maybe it'll go on sale. I'll

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
get an even better deal out of it. Hurray.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
So.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
ActDevtonChat says

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
remember Splatoon? I

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I still feel like Splatoon

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
was a fully featured game when it was

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
launched. They added stuff to it.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
It was a full game when it was done. Yeah, they added

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
maps. The things that they added

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
to Splatoon, I feel like

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
other companies would have charged me money for

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
to be quite honest. I mean did they

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
add a lot to Splatoon? Yeah, they did.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
And I think Capcom would have charged you for it.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Or made you get a million

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
billion splat points when you

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
only get five in a match.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
I think with Splatoon you at least had

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
you had a fully functional single player

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
mode in Splatoon.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
That's actually pretty darn

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
good. It has boss fights that are fun and everything else.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
So.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I don't know. Alright.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Yes, but the voice chat thing

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
is still an issue. I will say that.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Alright. Anyhow.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Thank you for doing the emails tonight

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Dark Soccer. I appreciate it. But I understand

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
you are going to head out and be on your way

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
for the night. Yes.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Do you have any final thoughts for the audience? Actually

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
we're getting to FUs. Do you want to quickly stick around

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
and do your FUs? Sure, I'll stick around and do the FUs.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
As your final thought here. Alright, let's get to the FUs

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
of the week. By the way, if you want to send us emails. Hey, if you

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
want to talk the Street Fighter 5 thing, you know,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I realize people out there might disagree with me. Cool.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Just email us. Participate at

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
orangeonsrader.com.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
See you next time.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I laid down at 10 AM.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I didn't get up until 5.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
And I still have the same damn headache.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
So. I hate it.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
It needs to go away. And I'm going home. Bye.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Uh.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I will piggyback on that.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I'm going to cut Loki off and piggyback on that. Because FU

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
to being sick. Because being sick has been the

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
word. I have been. I have been like

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Cootie Boy this year and I hate it. Like I

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
just keep getting sick and I won't stop. And yes, I've been to

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
a doctor and it's just kind of one of those.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
People get sick.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Nothing serious. Just ruined your day.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Ah. Loki.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Um. Just FU to

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
not being able to concentrate on programming.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I try.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
But it's just not coming to me. I'm not in the groove

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I guess.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Alright.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Let's move on and get

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
to just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Game OLR. username on Skype.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Loki. Alright. So this is

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
kind of cool. So apparently

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
they're going to be

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
kick starting a

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Jay and Silent Bob game

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
called Jay and Silent Bob

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
The Chronic Blunt Punch.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
And it's a side scroller

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
beat em up game.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
And it's I guess going to

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Kickstarter.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
But they're doing some sort of crowd funding for that.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And apparently if it's successful they're trying to seek

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
a goal of $400,000.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
And apparently this is

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
a little bit different. It's not

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Kickstarter actually.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
So they're doing through

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Fig. So they're doing

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
it's where you can actually

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
invest money and get a sort of return

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
on that.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Why don't they do

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
$420,000?

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Because they're actually

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
they're trying to get like

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
more than $400,000.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Okay, but I still think my joke was funny.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
I know. I understand the joke.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Yeah. That would have been pretty cool.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
But

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
yeah. I actually haven't really looked too

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
much of this platform though. I remember hearing

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
about this a little bit where they were actually doing some

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
of the crowd funding through that and it wasn't like

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Kickstarter where you just get like the game you actually

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
can get returns on it because you're an actual

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
investor in that. So it would be kind of interesting

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
to check it out.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
But $400,000 for

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Jay and Silent Bob fighting game.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Or beat-em-up game.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I can see that.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
What I would love to invest money in

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
is more

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
episodes of the Jay and Silent Bob cartoon

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
or the Clerks cartoon is

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
what I want to invest money in.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
So can we put up like a crowd funding for that

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
please?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Because it would be awesome.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Alright. Well

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I don't know. Maybe this

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
would be one of the few games that you could convince

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
me to pay money for

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
up front without seeing anything.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
But Kojima and Del Toro.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
That's right. Here we go again. Talking about

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
this. But that is because there was a talk

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
at DICE at 2016

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
between Hideo Kojima and joining him on stage

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Guillermo Del Toro. Even

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
though Del Toro had said at one point I will never

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
again get involved in video games.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
At DICE

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
he had basically talked about how

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
the whole video game thing came together and so forth.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
He said the creativity

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
can be stifled by the

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
bastards with money. But basically

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
made it sound like if Kojima wants him to do

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
something again, he'll do it.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Hmm. Very interesting.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
By the way, Del Toro also said

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
that as far as what he's playing, he's playing Fallout 4.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
But he dies a lot.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
So

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
that's pretty cool. I would

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
definitely buy

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I would throw money at whatever Kojima and

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Del Toro would do without having seen

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
it at first. It's one of the few

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
things I'd break the rules for.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Alright.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
That's it. I know we're

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
to it a little early, but

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
we're to the Skype line at 1877 Game

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
OLR or username on Skype, Orange

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Lounge Radio. The Skype line is open now

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
if you want to give us a call. 1877

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Lounge Radio. All one word

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
while we wait for some calls. I don't know if Loki has

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
any last minute stories over there. Yes.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Apparently there is a patent

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
from Sony for a new

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
glove-like device.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
People are comparing it to a power

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
glove for

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
PlayStation VR at least. It looks like some

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
sort of PlayStation move-like

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
device that you would use like hand

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
gestures with the glove

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
to kind of control the game.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Cool.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Yeah, maybe they're

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
going to do the power glove right or something like that.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
That'd be kind of cool if that was something that they announced at this

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
VR thing. I'd be down with that. I wonder

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
if it isn't something that goes along with the VR

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
thing. It would be very interesting. The way the lights

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
were on the hands, very much could be.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Anyway, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Rama. Hey, Rama.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
How's it going? Good to hear from you.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Good, good. Things are going good. I actually have a day off

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
today, so I had to run around and take care of some stuff.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Oh, rough day to have the day off.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
I guess,

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
but at least it gives me time to go to the gym, do you know?

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Oh yeah, brah. You got to work out.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Seriously, man. Seriously.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
So you didn't go to Katsucon or

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
MagFest this year, right? No,

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
because my job has this rule

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
where you have to request

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
three weeks in advance. I'm so used

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
to requesting a week

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
to two weeks in advance, but not

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
three weeks, so I kind of forgot, and I'm like,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
you know what? I'm kind of gearing up for

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
another convention in April I'm looking forward to,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
so I'm just going to save money, pay

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
bills, and play the adult game for a

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
little bit. That's fair. I am going to really try

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
to go back next year, so we'll see.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Definitely, definitely.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
And I will make my way out there next year.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Hooray, I would love to have a Rama buddy

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
there with all my other buddies.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
What's on your mind? What do we owe the phone call tonight,

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
OLR?

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
So, in case you haven't

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
heard, one of my favorite

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
strategy RPG games, Project Cross Zone

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
2, came out last Tuesday.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
And I've been in the middle of playing

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
other games, so when this game

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
came out, I stopped

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
playing all my other games, and I've currently

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
been playing through this for the last two weeks.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
I just picked up Mega Man Legacy Collection,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
and it's actually sitting on my shelf

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
on a pile of games to play

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
when Project Cross Zone 2 is

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
done. Did you get the gold amiibo and all that?

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
I was

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
too lazy because

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
there was a Target up in

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Queens, and I'm like, I don't feel like traveling

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
all the way up there just to get

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
this. But I'm like,

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
if I really wanted, I could probably contact

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
a friend and who could get it for me, you know?

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Yeah, I

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
hear you, I hear you.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
So,

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
besides the whole

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
gold amiibo and Legacy Collection,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
here is my question for

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
you and Logie.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
What is the last game

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
that y'all have played where you just

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
sat there and just played

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
it through from start to finish because

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
the game was that good? Actually,

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I have an answer for this, and it

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
is kind of in the week off that

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
we weren't here. The week off,

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I didn't really get a chance to talk about this game.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I think I talked about it a little bit

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
in my gaming week

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
the last episode because I just

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
barely started the game. So,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I guess Rama really was split up amongst

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
some sessions, but honestly, I played

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
this game a little bit on the Sunday

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
before OLR, and then I think I

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
played it all Monday night until I beat it.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
And that was Firewatch.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
And that is a recent release that just came

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
out on PlayStation 4 and

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
PC. And some

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
people kind of razzed

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
it a little bit because it's a walking simulator.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
You can't really die or lose.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
But I thought the story was

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
interesting enough

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
that I wanted

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
to know how it was going to end. I wanted to know

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
how it all tied together. I do have to

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
admit it became really predictable in

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
the last hour. I was like, okay,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I know exactly how this is going to go down, and sure enough

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
it's what happened. But

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
it's still one of those things where it's like, well, now that I've

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
made this commitment, might as well

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
finish the damn game.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Sounds about right.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
But I thought that the dialogue in Firewatch

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
was so good, and you know

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
that most of the interactions in that game, it's all

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
over the radio. So you never

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
see the woman

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
that you talk to through most of the game. And I think we

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
talked about this a little bit on the last show.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
There's a lot of parallels. I can't remember

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
if I talked about, unfortunately I'm getting to that point in my life,

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I don't remember if I talked about it on this show,

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
or on guys on the show, or if this was just a

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
conversation I was having with my friends at MAGFest,

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
because it might have been all three.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
But there's so many

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
parallels to things that happen

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
in Firewatch to, I think, the way

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
we've developed relationships

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
in the internet age, where

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
we have these deep friendships

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
with people we've never met, or never even

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
seen. And

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Firewatch is interesting because it's set in the

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
80s, yet it has a very similar

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
type of relationship, and it kind of shows

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
that those types of mysterious

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
relationships have always existed, if

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
that makes sense. So I just,

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I really like that kind of twist

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
in the story, and what

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
that story did. So, even

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
though I don't know if at the end of the year I'll

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
sit here and say, wow, Firewatch was one of the best

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
games I played of the year. I thought Firewatch

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
was a good story, it was like watching

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
a good movie, but you're

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
driving it.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
So that was me, and thank

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
you for asking that this week, and not a couple

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
weeks before, because I don't know what the last one would have

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
been before Firewatch, because most of my

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
marathon sessions are thanks to MMOs.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Loki, do you remember

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
the last game you sat down and you had to play start

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
to finish because it was so damn good? Let me guess,

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I played a lot of that, I don't think I played

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
start to finish the whole time, but

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I don't know.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
I don't have an answer, I don't know.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
No other better answer? What about

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
you, Rama? Is it

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Project Cross Zone 2? Yeah,

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
before that,

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
it was The Legend of Zelda A Link

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Between Worlds.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Ah,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
that was a good one on 3DS.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Yes it was, and there were

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
times I had to stop playing the game

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
because I'm in the ice temple

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
sliding around, and I'm riding

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
the subway back and forth, I'm like,

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
no.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
No. It's just too much.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Yes.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
That's great, I got you.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
That's a great question, Rama, I appreciate

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
it. I'll be curious with

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
some of the listeners might have to say for that in our chat room.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
But I'm going to go ahead

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
and wrap up so we can get another call, but anything

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
else you want to get out there for our listeners tonight?

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Ah, no, that's it.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Alright, take care my friend.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
YouTube, brother. Good to hear from you, bye.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Bye. Alright, 1877 Game

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
OLR, our username on Skype, Orange

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Lounge Radio. ActDeft in chat says

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Undertale. Yeah, of course, I'm not

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
too surprised to hear that. SSJ

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
in chat saying, I really need to play

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Firewatch. Yes, I think you do.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I do think you do. Alright, our phones

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
are lighting up tonight, so I'm going to try to get to another

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
call here, and

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Hi, it's Embryon. Hey, how you doing

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Embryon? I am okay.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I am also getting over being sick

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
just like you. You may have

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
gotten sick because I was patient zero

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
at MAGFest. Embryon hung out with me

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
lots and lots at MAGFest, so it was

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
great to hear from you. Yay, it was

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
the best. I have to go to that every year

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
from now on. I'm really, if I have the money

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I would love to. Then that was your

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
first MAGFest as well, right? Yeah, it was.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
What did you think from your perspective? I don't know if you were

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
here when I was talking about it earlier in the show, but what was

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
your impressions of MAGFest the first time?

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
It was just, I've been to a couple

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
of cons, not a ton,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
but especially compared to E3,

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
it's like, it's just such a different

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
energy, because at E3

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
a lot of the people who are there are strictly

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
there for business, and I mean, a lot

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
of the people you see walking around are kind of like execs

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
or whatever. And there's certainly some

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
energy amongst the

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
journalists and people who are really excited, but

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
at MAGFest it's just like nothing

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
but positivity, and everybody is having

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
a good time, laughing, smiling.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I mean, the concerts that we went to

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
were amazing. It was, it was

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
amazing. I didn't expect to

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
like it as much as I did, and now it's like

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
probably the best con I've been to, and I want to go every

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
year. Well, in E3, E3

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
isn't really a con. It's technically a

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
trade show, and it's work. Of course. I mean,

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
it's work. It's fun work, and

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
you know, but there's a script

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
that people stick to, whereas MAGFest

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
was more, it's a celebration of gaming

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
culture, and there was no new things

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
to announce. There's no work to be done.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
We're just going to have fun.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Yeah, and I think that's kind of the charm of it, really. It's not

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
like you're waiting for the next

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
big story to break. It's just you're enjoying

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
your time in the moment with people who

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
are awesome around you.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I'm even looking into

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
trying to do Rockage here, even though it's just

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
in a couple weeks. They didn't give a lot of

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
notice this year on that, but I'm going to really try to make it over

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
there, a very similar vibe out

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
there. Where's that? San Jose.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
So it's not far from me at all. Oh, no.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
It's pretty close. But it's a much smaller

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
scale. It's not quite on the scale of MAGFest.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I think they have it spread out through various venues

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
in San Jose this year, so it'll be interesting.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Well, to

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
what did you, I made you talk about MAGFest,

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
but what did you want to call in to talk about tonight, Emran?

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Just to say, hey, Ranma just

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
asked about what games we were playing, and I know that you guys always

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
talk about it anyway, but I don't know about you,

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Rob, but I have been going so hard on

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Final Fantasy XIV since the patch dropped last

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
week. The patch is

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
really good. The patch was the kick in the ass

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
this game so desperately needed.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Yeah, it's a good patch. I was a little bit worried

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
before it released that it seemed a little

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
light to me because they were focusing so heavily on

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
the new beginner stuff, like the

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Hall of the Mentor, sorry, the Hall of the

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Novice and the Mentor system.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
But no, there's so much to do, and everything that there is

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
is so high quality, like this, I

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
won't give spoilers, of course, but the story, this

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
patch, I thought was really good. Big step

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
up from the last patch of the story.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
The new fights are fantastic. Yeah, I've

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
capped my lore tome stones for the week, and I'm

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
just kind of like... Oh my god, I have halfway to

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
go. I so wish we were on the same server.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I still have half my tomes to get, because there was so

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
much maintenance going on this week. But

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
for those that don't know, and I think this is

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
worth pointing out about the new dungeons, is that

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
there are some great references

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
to older Final Fantasy games, especially

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
in this dungeon called the Anti-Tower,

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
which is like an upside down castle that you go through.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
The final boss of the Anti-Tower,

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
well, actually, the next

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
to last boss of the Anti-Tower is

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Ziggy, a little,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
what do they call those things, the little...

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Spriggans. Spriggans, thank you. Ziggy,

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
and Ziggy summons stardust

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
that you have to kill. I just like to add, so

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
there was a cute little tribute there to David Bowie,

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
obviously. So cute. It was very adorable.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
But the last boss

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
of the Anti-Tower is

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Calcabrena, which, if you

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
ever played Final Fantasy IV,

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
that was an epic memorable fight in Final Fantasy IV

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
because the dolls are

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
really creepy, they do this little

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
dance, and then

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
you have to fight the six dolls,

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
and they combine into one large doll, and

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
then it becomes an endurance fight.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
And, you know, spoilers for an almost

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
30 year old game here at this point, but that is

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
the fight where Rydia makes her triumphant

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
return to the story, is she saves you from

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Calcabrena, right? So they've

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
translated elements of this fight into

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Final Fantasy XIV, and

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
the dolls, when you go into the room, they

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
do the dance, and they do the little jumps and

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
twirls, just like they did in IV, and then you

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
begin fighting all of them, and they transform into

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
one giant doll, and it's awesome.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Oh yeah, and the whole music, everything is there.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
It's fantastic. I love it.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Boss is freaky as shit. He is very

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
freaky. And in case it doesn't haunt your

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
nightmares enough, just from seeing the boss, you

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
can get a minion of the dolls. Yes.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
I don't know why you would.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
When the Calcabrena

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
doll dies at the end, because hopefully

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
you beat her, or you wasted your time in the dungeon,

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
it looks like one of those animatronics from Five

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Nights at Freddy's, it really does.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
It's so creepy, I hate it. Super creepy.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
But the dungeon's awesome, and so is the

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
other new one. It's a really, really good patch, though.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
I can't stop playing, and I wish that

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
I wasn't capped on lore tombstones so I could keep

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
doing stuff. Well, the good news

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
is the reset is on Tuesday, and I think

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
is the new PVP going at the

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
feast, is that in on this Tuesday, or is that next

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Tuesday? It's a week from Tuesday.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
So we still have another week before the feast, but

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
PVP is another great way to get tomes, if

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
you can get in there.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I was surprised that I enjoyed

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Frontline as much as I did. I'm going to check this

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
one out for sure, especially because I'm pretty sure

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
you don't have to group with people from the

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
same grand company this time. Oh, thank

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
God. So you can just make friends and

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
do it that way. Oh, thank God. That was the

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
worst, that you had to be in the same free company.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Yeah, I hope I'm not lying to

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
you on that. I think that's the case.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
That's okay. If you're lying to me on that,

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
I'll only hold it against you forever.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Okay. Alright, awesome.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Anyway, Embryon, anything else you want to

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
share with our listeners tonight before I let you go?

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
No, that's it. I just wanted to say hey, and

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
glad you're getting better, and please

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
send some of your magic my way.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I will. I'm rubbing my computer

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
monitor with magic right now.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Fancy. Alright.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Alright, we'll talk to you later on. Take care.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Thanks. Bye. Bye.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
if you want to give us a call.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Well, it's lighting up tonight. You guys are

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
not disappointing on calls tonight.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Hey, this is Jeff. Hey, buddy. How you doing?

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Pretty great.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
What's on your mind? Watching the Oscars

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
and listening to OR. I suppose

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
I can permiss that, as long as you're paying attention

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
to us most.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Yeah, mostly. That's alright.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
I'm just teasing. What's on your mind?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Anyways, I wanted to talk about

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Street Fighter V. Ah, yes, please.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Anyways, uh,

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
you were talking about how

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
the game is incomplete

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
and all the complaints that

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
like I said in chat,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
they're valid. They're not

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
bad complaints. They're good.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
They're totally bad, but

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
at the same time,

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
it's not like the

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
game is going to be incomplete forever.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
They promise, and

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I'm pretty sure

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
they said that

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Capcom was going to

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
add more stuff

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
or at least

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
the stuff missing from the game

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
at a later point.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
I don't know.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
My biggest problem with this whole thing,

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
again, I'm okay with the fact

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
that Capcom puts out a roadmap to say

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
at least, you know, here's when the features are coming

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
in, so at least people know, like,

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
oh, okay, well, what I want

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
or what I'm looking for in the game is put in there, then maybe

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
I'll buy it. But it just, I don't know, I can't

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
help but feel a little bit of that situation

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
where it's like, how far are

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
we going to let AAA game companies

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
go with this, you know?

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Like, it's getting really bad

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
where now they want more and more of

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
your money for no product.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
And it's just, I just,

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I don't know, like, I just worry

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
it sets a bad precedent.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
And that's what I

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
don't understand completely of the complaints

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
because we're going to get that

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
for free. So

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
even though you're paying, like, $60

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
right now for the game,

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
it's not like you're

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
paying more for it.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Like, for example,

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
and I'm going to say this example

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
that I've heard a lot this past

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
year, Battlefront

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Star Wars. The game,

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
most of the

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
complaints I've heard of it, it's that it's incomplete.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
That it lacks

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
game modes and it isn't

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
that fun.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
And you have to pay another $50

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
up front for the season

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
path that will add more stuff

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
to the game.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
In this case, and I

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
also made the comparison in chat,

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Splatoon.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Splatoon, one of the complaints aside the

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
voice chat at the beginning

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
was the lack of maps, the lack of

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
variety in weapons.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
A lot of stuff was missing in Splatoon

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
but they added

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
at a later date and a constant rate

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
also.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
I get what you're saying with the Splatoon

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
thing but I just feel like it's almost

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
an off comparison to me because I still feel like

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
okay, even though maybe there weren't

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
as many maps, Splatoon still

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
felt like a fully featured

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
game when it was released. And I think maybe

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
part of the reason where I struggle with

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
the whole Street Fighter 5 and the fact that

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
all this stuff is coming later, it's like, well, I

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
didn't have to wait in Street Fighter 4

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
or 3 or pretty much any other fighting

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
game. Like Tekken, when Tekken 3

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
was out on the Playstation 1,

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
you know I realized that was a long time ago, but

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
think of all those awesome features that

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
were there on the disc and all you had to do was unlock

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
it. And it was a lot different than

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
having to wait till, oh please wait till

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
June for more

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
characters and other

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
stuff. It's just, I don't know, I just

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
don't like this trend.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
That's what worries me more than anything

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Akdeft, it's the trend of

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
well, we want you to pay $60

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
when the game's not

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
like totally done. But we're gonna

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
give it to you, but we just, we need your

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
money up front to finish

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
financing the rest of the game.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
But it isn't like the game isn't

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
completely

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
like lacking

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
or, well the point I'm going to

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
trying to get, the game

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
works perfectly.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
If you see the reviews for

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Street Fighter 5 and even

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
some people I know that

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
are like

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
really into Street Fighter say

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
it's probably the best in

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
like since June.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Like it's one of the

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
it is the best

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Street Fighter ever.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
And that's the thing.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
The game works.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
The game isn't incomplete at

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
least in that sense.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
So you can still play it.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
I get that, yeah,

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
and also in comparison to

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Splatoon, Splatoon had a complete

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
story mode.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Street Fighter 5 doesn't, at least from

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
what I understand.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
But it isn't like, again,

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
it's not going to be there.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
It is there and it will be complete

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
at a later date for free.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
They're not adding

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
or they're not making

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
you pay another $20

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
$40 or another $60

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
for all that content.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Which also happened in the

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
past. That's one

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
of the complaints a lot of people had

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
with Capcom and

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Street Fighter mostly

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
that they really

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
released a new version of the game

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
and

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
we saw it with 4.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Street Fighter 4

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Arcade Edition

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Ultra Street Fighter 4. We had

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
4 or 5

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
editions of Street Fighter 4

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
and we had to pay for each one

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
of them.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
When this one, we won't have to pay another

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
$20, $40

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
to get the game.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
I'll give you that, but at the same time I feel like

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
they kind of shifted that into

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
well, now they just piecemeal the extra

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
characters and that's how they're going to make their expansion

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
money. I just kind of feel like that's shifted.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I'm not, you know, okay at least there's a

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
baseline game that will work for everyone

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
and I kind of get that end of things but

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
I'll give you that, that at least there's not

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
going to be like an Ultra Street Fighter 5 and another

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
one and another one. He's not going to keep going but

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
I don't know, it's still

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
it just doesn't sit right with me and I don't feel

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
right paying all the money up front for it.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
And I just, again, it's one of those things

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
where it's like, how long is this

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
going to go? And let me just ask one more

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
tricky question here.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
You know, this probably

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
wouldn't happen. But what if

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Capcom went bankrupt tomorrow and shut down

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
operations? You'll never get those

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
features that you paid $60 for.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
And, you know, I know

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
it seems far-fetched but we've heard of

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
games like, what was that one that the

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
two, not two worlds,

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
what the hell was that game that the baseball

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
player did

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
and it was an EA

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
thing and then the studio closed, there was

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
all this legal drama.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I know what you're thinking of,

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
it's the EA game. Right? It came

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
out and then like that was it. What

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
if that game, you know, that's

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
the only thing I'm saying is that there's no guarantee,

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
there's no

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
absolute guarantee that they're going to meet that

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
roadmap. We are putting faith in, well

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Capcom's been around a while so

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
you know, hopefully they're going to do it but

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
you know,

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
maybe one day we're going to put

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
down the money for a game and then we don't get it.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Yeah, I understand

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
that concern but like you said,

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
it's Capcom. I don't

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
think Capcom is going to disappear

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
one day

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
to another so I'm

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
pretty sure we can expect it and it's

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
not going to be that far

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
down the road, it's not going to be another year.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
It's going to be just a couple of months

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
mostly.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Sorry, thank you Dungeon Buster,

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Kingdoms of Amalur, that was the name of the game, thank you.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
But yeah, it's not, like

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I said, the lack of

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
continent, yeah, I understand

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
the complaint but

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
if you don't want to

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
pay $60 up front for the game,

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
you don't have to.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
And everybody has said it,

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
you have said it a lot of times in the show,

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
it's your money, you can

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
do whatever you want or you can buy

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
whatever you want with it. That's absolutely right

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
and if you are happy with Street Fighter V the way it is

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
right now, or you're happy with

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
the roadmap that Capcom has presented, you know what,

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
more power to you, have a blast.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Just for me, somebody

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
who's sitting on the fence a little bit, that I'm not

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
like super into fighting games but I

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
can be sometimes, it's just

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
not enough for me. But granted, maybe

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
there will be an RPG later

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
on, or something that I will want to buy

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
and the rest of you will think I'm crazy and that's

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
just the thing about gamers,

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
we're a diverse bunch.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
ActDeaf, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
much for the call, okay?

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Thanks very much. I appreciate your perspective, I always

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
love when people will call in and at least, you know,

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
stick up for another perspective, so

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I appreciate it. Take care.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
You too, thanks for having me. Yep, bye.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Alright, sadly I am going to call the

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
or close the Skype line at this time and I'm really

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
sorry because I know more of you are trying to get through,

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
but please consider sending an email or participate

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
at orangeloungeradio.com

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Also, I'm just, I'm

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
straining my voice a little bit, I need to wrap

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
up and stop, so.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
But that is about going to do it

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
for another week here at Orange Lounge

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Radio. Dark Soccer's already left

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
the building, but Loki's

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
here helping me close things out. I want to

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
thank you guys for tuning in and downloading

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
the show. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
hey, tell a friend or two about the show, that's

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
all we ask. Help spread the word about the show

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
where every gamer has a voice because

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
you know, that's the only way

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
that we can get the word out there, is

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
to tell a friend, or several

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
about the show. I appreciate

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
all the word of mouth support.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
That's going to do it.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Five star review on iTunes

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
or wherever it is that you found

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
this show, tune in, that stuff goes a long way as well.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Loki, your final thought

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
for our audience tonight? I have 13 minutes

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
to go knock down all the stuff that they put up in just a second.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
You can do it! Go!

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I have one that I'm going to hit, and that should

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
take down most of it. Alright, good luck buddy.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Alright, that is going to do it for me

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
as well. Thank you

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
guys again. We'll be back in seven days.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
My final thought tonight is I really just want

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
to be done with being sick for the

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
rest of 2016. Darn it.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Alright, have a good one everybody. Have a great

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
night. We'll see you in seven days. Bye.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
