00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This week Amazon announced a new video game engine named Lumberyard and it's available now completely free!

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
It's currently PC and console only but will soon find its way to mobiles as well.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
This is just one of many monetary stories and we'll tell you about all these and more starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on February the 14th of 2016, episode number 631 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you from Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
But you might know me on Twitter at Skie.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
And joining me at my side as always, my trusty co-hosts over the past I've lost count number of years.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Rawr.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Rawr. 13 and a half by the way.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Rawr.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Rawr. How are you doing?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Um, I'm okay. I bit my tongue so hard it bled.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
That's not good.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
And now I have a hole in the side of my tongue and it feels weird.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Do you need a tissue?

01:15.000 --> 01:25.000
And I love my friends, but I'm a little peeved when I get woke up from a deep, deep sleep at one in the afternoon.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, I was gonna say to be fair, wasn't it like one in the afternoon?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Lazy, lazy Valentine's Day for DarkSakura.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Texting me about troubleshooting their computer.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm like, I'm not at work, dude.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
But I was impressed with myself that I could do half a sleep via text message.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Awesome.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
There's lots of hearts here on Valentine's Day.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Even the blackest heart here on the show. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Hello.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
How are you doing?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Doing fine.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah?

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
We just had a big live announcement here at the Voice of Geeks Network that we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Usually we're on at 6, but we're on at 6.30 tonight and I'll do my little spiel here.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
vaughnetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
So we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight, but not too terribly late.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
We'll still have a great show tonight.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
But Loki, I don't know what you've been working on over there while we were doing that announcement stuff.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You still working on Time to Car?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I don't know.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You don't know?

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, the thing is, see, I was trying to get something done just to release it and I don't even like the way it is right now.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't like the state that it's in and I don't really want to complete it in the state that it is right now.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I just want to work on something else.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Interesting.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Now, I still may finish it and I have a better idea of what I want to do with it, but it's too out there right now.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
It's so far away from its initial idea that I don't know what the hell to make of it.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
So I'm going to put it on the fence or back burner for now.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
I've got several projects on the back burner right now.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
So we'll put another one on the back burner after I start another one, of course.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
So, of course, we do have our live chat room and you can visit our chat live.vognetwork.com.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
And AkumaJP is starting us off tonight saying, yay, half Loki 3.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
No, I've got like I've got like I want to come up with ideas.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
I basically create a text file for them on my on my computer and I just start kind of jotting ideas down with it.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I've got so many of them. It's ridiculous.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
And I'm just looking now that I've got Unity 5 and that's another reason why I kind of want to put the one I was working on hiatus right now,

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
because it was being developed in Unity 4 and I was really limited on what I could do with it.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
That's why I didn't look that great, because I was stuck with using all the Unity basic stuff.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Whereas now Unity 5, you have all those pro features that were originally locked away from you.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
Instead of worrying about porting it over and everything, I'm just going to probably start something different for right now.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And then just because I just want to work on something different.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
I've mentally been drained. I was like trying to work on this like high score table for the longest time.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm like, for what? For this demo? It just didn't make any sense for me to do that.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
And I even went back and played the demo, what I had done.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm like, you know, it's not as fun as I thought it was originally.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
For what it's worth, I totally get it.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I've had those situations where it's like, I need to put this on the back burner. I understand.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
But a lot of people did tell you that for your first big game you were being very ambitious.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Would you change anything in retrospect?

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
No, I wouldn't actually. It's just, you know, I don't know.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
The idea was like, I had an idea and I could have, you know, done it that way.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
But I wanted to do something different with it later on.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Because I decided, you know, okay, I don't know. I had some more ideas to go along with it.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I just, I want to implement that instead.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
But in order to do that, it's just completely redoing the whole thing anyways.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
And I just don't want to do that. I don't want to waste any more time on this.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
I'd rather do something that I think would be more interesting gameplay-wise. Let's put it that way.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the last 10% takes 90% of the time.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Of course, yes. No, I understand that.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
And that's the thing. It's like, but you got to, the problem was I kind of took it the wrong way.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
You got to develop, you know, the core gameplay first and then work on the rest of it.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
And the problem is the gameplay on it wasn't quite there. It just wasn't fun.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
And I don't want to release something like that, even if it's unfinished.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Because then that looks even worse. I'd rather just come up with something I think is interesting.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
I play it and it's fun. Then go from there.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
And I have a few ideas of things I want to do.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
And some even way more ambitious than what I started.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
So, I still want to do those two, but we'll get around it.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Alright, fair enough. Well, best of luck to you in whatever it is you choose to do.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
You know, SG100Matt in chat saying if we've learned anything about Loki over the years,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Loki is always go big or go home. Loki doesn't half-ass things.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And I go home a lot. So, it's fine.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Alright, we're going to get right into the show tonight.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Usually we would do a kick-off topic to start things off,

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
but since we did have our live announcement tonight, we're going to go right into How Was Your Gaming Week?

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
But I do just want to give a quick shout-out to the three new shows joining The Voice of Geeks Network.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
If you like video games, you absolutely need to be subscribed to GameBui.org,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
which is joining The Voice of Geeks Network.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
They've got well over 100 episodes of really deep informational gaming content and discussions.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
And Captain Spike and Slidekick are very talented.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I've been honored to be on that show way in the past. I was on episode 37 or something.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
In a row?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Haha. But they are now a part of the network.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Look up whichever one was about music games. That was the one I was on.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And we're very excited to have them here.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Also joining us, probably not a huge surprise.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Shane's been here the past few weeks, and it was really only a matter of time

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
before Ranger Pride also came onto the network.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So if you like Power Rangers, you need to be checking that out.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
And then I announced that Extfer and I brought back from a very long 10-year hiatus,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
a show we used to do on Orange Onch Radio, the network, called Guys on a Show,

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
which is going to be about all things pop and geek culture and passion.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
But obviously, you can expect when Extfer's involved, with tongue planted firmly in cheek.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And the first three episodes of Guys on a Show available right now.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
We surprised everybody. It's out on iTunes right now.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
We dropped the album on iTunes right now.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
So you can check that out by just searching for Guys on a Show

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
or head on over to guysontashow.com.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And also Twitter, Guys on a Show.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And while you're on Twitter, you should also follow GameBooey.org

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and RangerPrideCast on Twitter.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
All right, so since that pretty much took over our kickoff slot tonight,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
let's get into how was your gaming week

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and the types of video games you've been playing this week. DarkSakura?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
I really haven't played very much because I've had a lot of stuff going on.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
It's a side project I'm working on.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
But I played a little bit of Hot to Full Boyfriend last night

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
by hooking up because it's now on the OS X App Store.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
And so I played it. I had my Mac already hooked up to the Sony TV

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
so that they could watch the new Yamato series.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
The Space Battleship Yamato.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And so I decided just to test out games on it.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
So I turned on Hot to Full Boyfriend and started dating some pigeons.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It was great.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I'm going to have to play through that all the way again.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
I love that you had this gigantic TV and the great resolution

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
where people would try to play things like, I don't know, Destiny.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You know, things that really push the graphical envelopes.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
And here you are playing...

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Destiny? Come on.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't know. It was the first game that came to mind.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And you're playing Hot to Full Boyfriend.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Because... And it was really pretty.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I put a picture up on my Facebook.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Nah, I saw that. It was very pretty.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It's on my Tumblr too. I put a picture on my Tumblr.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Fine. How about like Mario Kart 8?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Even as cartoony as that is, I bet that would be badass on a big screen TV like that.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
We'll do that anyway.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
The whole point was for me to test the HDMI out on my Mac.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I understand.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
And it was pretty nice.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
It made me realize now that the wallpaper I have is super low res in comparison.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
It looks fine on the Mac, but not on the big TV.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
I've also been playing some Animal Crossing.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Some Happy Home Designer.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Because I got some new Amiibo cards.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Really? Yeah, not a whole bunch else.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
And I've decided that I really don't like Super Hexagon because it makes me mad.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Really mad.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
And so I've gone back to my stress relief game of...

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Crap, what's it called?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I used...

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Mass Effect?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
No, not Mass Effect.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Dragon Age?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Not Dragon Age.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Can I say quickly while you're thinking about Super Hexagon?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
That's kind of the point, I think, is to anger you a little bit.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
It's so fun in the short little bursts.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm glad you think it is.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I know. It can get very frustrating.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Just like...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Fractal.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Fractal.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Fractal is my stress relief game.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
And Moonlight Mahjong.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
You know that's funny.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
MXC actually called it in our chat room.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Fractal.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Props to you, MXC.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
But I was going to say about Super Hexagon.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Try something different than what you're doing now.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
Because for me, to beat the first level, all I had to do was stop playing full screen and go to windowed.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Obviously, you're not going to be able to do that on the phone.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, I never play windowed.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
But you can...

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I mean, not windowed.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I never play full screen.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Because I get motion sick on full screen games.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, I know what else.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I played a little bit more Dragon's Dogma.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Oh yeah?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
It's alright.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm not completely in love with it yet, but I like it decently.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Decently.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
And that's it.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Alright.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, wait, wait.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Ingress.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I hit level 5.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
That's always a given.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I think all three of us are addicted to that game.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And also Heroes of Dragon Age.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Excellent.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Loki, how about you?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I just basically played three games this week.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
So I played more of Lego Avengers just to unlock more characters for my son.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So I did that.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I've got like...

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
I think I'm like 50% done with all the unlockables in the game.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
And we're 25 hours into it already.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
So that's a lot.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And then I played more Fallout 4.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm just going through the...

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Was it a companion quest for MacCready?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
So I'm pretty much done there.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I mean, I did all of his, but I still haven't gotten his perk yet.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Which is really the only reason why I have him with me anyways.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Because he's annoying.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I mean, he's not as annoying as some of the other characters.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
But I just want his headshot perk that's all fucked up right now.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Because I've disconnected my Playstation 4 from the internet.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
So I can keep my really buggy, glitchy version of Fallout 4.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
I mean, you know, the more buggy, glitchy version of Fallout 4 right now.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
And then I played...

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
What was the other game I played?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I played also...

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
We actually played a little bit more of the League of Marvel Super Heroes.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Because my son-in-law played the older game.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
And then I also played Ingress a little bit.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Mainly just on the way to and from work.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Just driving.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I know that's dangerous, but I don't care.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
We're in traffic. We're moving like 50 miles an hour. It doesn't matter.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Alright.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Well that's it for your gaming week.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Still been playing a lot of Diablo 3.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Working on my Witch Doctor in Seasons.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm past Paragon level 500 now.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
And that also means that I am past the point where my non-seasonal characters are at.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And I did that already once last season.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
So that just shows you how into the game I am.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
But I've been playing with friends and having a great time with it.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Again, that Seasons is only on PC.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't play on consoles as much.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
But I notice a lot of my friends are playing on Xbox One.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
I have a couple different groups of friends that are playing on Xbox One.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
So I'm like, maybe I need to play Diablo 3 on Xbox One.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
But here's the funny thing. I own it on PS4.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
So I would literally have to buy a third copy of Diablo 3.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
So I'm like, maybe when it goes...

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Well, I didn't buy the first Diablo 3 on PC.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Because there was that whole World of Warcraft subscription thing.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
But, we'll see.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And then, it does go on sale quite a bit.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
It was down to like $24 the other week.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
And I was like, maybe?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, so maybe if it goes on sale.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
If it goes on sale again, I'll probably pick it up.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I'm considering Knack because it's down to $8.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Is it really?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't know yet. Maybe.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I just don't have... I want to finish some games.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
But Fallout 4 is never going to finish.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Because once I'm done with Fallout, I'm going to have to start my asshole character.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Which, you know, that's going to be another several hundred hours.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Can I talk about a piece of video game hardware that I picked up?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
And this is one of the things I just bought because I wanted it.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
And Shane was trying to tell me they're not that great.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
But I wanted it.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
So I bought the wireless PlayStation 4 headset.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Because I like playing games.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
I found that from playing more PC games, I really enjoy gaming with the headset.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
And even though I like...

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Which one? Do you have the stereo headset?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I have the official wireless one.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Is it the stereo headset? Is it surround sound?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
7.1.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I have the...

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Gold or something like that.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, I've got the PlayStation 3 one.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Which works on the PlayStation 4.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
And I use it when I play with my friends Call of Duty and stuff.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
And the thing with that device is that as much as I love to plop down on the TV and play the games,

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
I don't necessarily get that same sound stuff coming from the little soundbar I have.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I don't have a deluxe sound system.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I just have one of those little bars that outputs all the sound.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
So I was like, you know what? What the hell? I'm just going to get some headphones.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
And so far, I'm really enjoying using the headphones.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
But I will say this. I tried playing amplitude with the headphones on.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
And the bass got all distorted in different parts of the song.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
So I might just need to play with the settings a little bit.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I always play with headphones plugged into my controller.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
That's not how I play because my wife's usually watching Netflix on her thing or she's doing something else.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
And so they don't like hearing the audio coming from that.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But I love it with headphones.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
And Tigerclaw says a wireless headset. That would be kind of a hassle if you forget to recharge it.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
You can still use them when they're plugged into the PlayStation 4.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
But since they're the official Sony ones, you charge it with the same cable you use for your controller.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
So it's just like charge one then charge the other and kind of flip back and forth.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
It doesn't seem to be too difficult. So far, so good.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I did play one new game this week.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
It was a game that released on, I think, PlayStation 4 and PC this week.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
I'm not sure about Xbox One. Maybe somebody in chat can set me straight.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
But I played Firewatch.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I think it's on Xbox One also.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It just came out this week.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And it was really not a game that was on my radar at all.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
But I saw a lot of my friends on Twitter talking about it.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And that it was another one of those kind of...

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Walking simulators?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I guess if you want to call it that.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
But I feel like, okay, if you call something like Gone Home or Everybody's Gone to the Rapture a walking simulator...

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
They do.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
But this game, yeah, I mean it's not like it's action packed.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
You're not like fighting enemies or whatever.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
But I feel like there's still kind of a deeper level of interaction maybe in this game.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
Because the little twist in this game is that you're playing basically a ranger who's by themself out in the forest.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
The Firewatch refers to the fact that they watch for fires and emergency scenarios and so forth, right?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It's like a two day hike out to the thing.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Exactly. And so they can only communicate with each other by radio.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
So you're playing this main protagonist.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And the protagonist interacts with the boss via radio.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
And it's kind of like, for me a little bit, it invokes GLaDOS a little bit in Portal.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I get a little bit of that similar feeling.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
Because the boss that he's talking to on the radio can be a little bit sassy with him and things like that.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
So there's that. But you can ask about a lot of different objects and radio back.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
And it's a little deeper too because some of the decisions that you make and some of the things you say could...

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
Like I had a case today where I said something that pissed her off and she wouldn't talk to me for like five minutes.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Or answer my calls or anything.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So it was kind of an interesting little twist there.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
But yeah, it is one of those very story-driven things.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
But I was very interested in it because it's not a scary game.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
But you get this whole sense the time you're playing that something's off.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
So I kind of like that. Because you know I'm not a big fan of jump scares, but I like unsettling games.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
And so Firewatch is definitely that.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
The one thing I am going to rag on the game though, and I think a lot of people are calling this out from what I see on Twitter.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
There's a little bit of jitteriness on the PlayStation 4.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
And whenever it tries to autosave you really notice like jump, jump, jump, jump around.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
And it can really take you out of the experience.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Because otherwise a lot of the visuals are gorgeous.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
You're walking around at sunset. You can look out and see an objective that's all far away.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
But that's a place you know you can actually travel to.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
So it's a gorgeous looking game.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
But because of the PlayStation 4 performance issues it can take you out of the experience momentarily.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
But I would actually say that's kind of a minor beef.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
But that is something you may want to consider.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
If it's like do I get it on PlayStation 4 or do I get it on PC?

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Because I hear the PC version doesn't really do that.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
I suppose that would depend on your PC as well.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So anyway.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Going to the chat over at live.vognetware.com.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Dungeon Buster says there is no Firewatch on Xbox One.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
Only a tantalizing hint that it could come over to other platforms if there is a desire for it to.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
And TigerClaw says it isn't a game that you play with the kids.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
The characters have adult conversations that aren't kid friendly.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
That is very true.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
I believe this could depend on what you do in the story in the very beginning.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
But I had nudity in the first 15 seconds of the game. Dude nudity.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
So it's not something you want to play.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Would that be dude-ity?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah dude-ity.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
It's not something you necessarily want to play with kids around.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
Or maybe you do. Just kind of know that there's going to be explicit.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Hell. From what I understand parents are taking their kids to see Deadpool.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
And I'm like.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Lucky bastards.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
And these are very stupid parents.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Well you know.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I should take my kids to see Deadpool because at least I'd see Deadpool.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And that's probably why a lot of kids are going to see Deadpool.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I saw someone even watch part of Iron Man 3 on TV the other day.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I was like. Hey look see here's what the movies look like.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
And he's like. I don't want to watch it. It's scary.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I'm like. Come on you're like fans of all this stuff.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Like he talks all the time about you know all the Iron Man stuff.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
And he'll talk about like the Minecraft things.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
He'll talk about all the enemies and stuff.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And he always plays on peaceful with no enemies.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I finally convinced him like. Hey listen.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
You play creative mode with enemies and they don't do anything.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
You can just go and punch him in the face and there's like.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Hi.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So finally got him to do that and he's like super psyched about.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Oh hey look at all these things I did.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
But like see I'm trying to get him to watch the Avengers movies.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
So that I can show him this stuff and he just won't do it.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
You know what I bet happens is that like when he's like six or so something's just going to flip.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
And then suddenly it'll be like he loves ultra violence.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
I just noticed that happened with kids that even happened to me.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
That's not going to be him.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
My parents say I was completely different when that is not going to be him.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
That'll be my youngest son because my youngest son.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
What he does now is he's like super cuddly and everything and all said I'm going to beat the shit out of you.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Like he will just run up to you and just punch you in the face.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I mean that is what he does.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
All right anyway I would overall recommend Firewatch at least based on the little bit that I've played.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
If you like the heavily story driven games.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
If you need more action in your games it's probably going to be a pass for you.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
But if you're if you like those games like Gone Home, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and the more story driven experiences.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Then I think Firewatch will be right up your alley.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
All right some quick housekeeping before we get into the news tonight.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Please follow us on Twitter. Twitter dot com slash O L R.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google Plus at Orange Launch Radio as well.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
We will not be here next week. There is no live show or podcast show next week.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And the reason for that is there might be a dead show.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
There might be a dead show. Are you going to periscope something.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Actually that's what I'm doing next week.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
You're going to see Deadpool.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm going to go see Deadpool.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
We should totally go see Deadpool.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm going tomorrow with Dan.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
You'll want to see it again.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Damn it.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh you know I'm going to go see it again.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
So we should ingress and see Deadpool.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Hell yes.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
OK.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
And then we should periscope it.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
OK.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
Usually I would be insanely jealous but I am going to Magfest which I'm super pumped about and that's why there's no show next week.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
So if you are going to Magfest I really look forward to see you there.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
If you are somebody that I told about this show at Magfest.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio and thank you so much for being here.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And I'm really looking forward to having a great time at Magfest.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
My first time going and I'm coming all the way from the West Coast to go to Magfest.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
So I'm really excited about it.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
So I will see you there in National Harbor, Maryland.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
I arrive on Thursday.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
But there will be no show because I don't get back until Monday.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
Which by the way, what a great idea to premiere three new shows on the Voice of the Geeks Network this week.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm not going to be here for half the week but we have a way to work it out.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
All will be well.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
All will be well.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
I do want to address one other issue this week that I'm going to be honest.

22:16.000 --> 22:24.000
This issue really bugged me and it has to do with a lot of you guys listen to this show on an app called Stitcher Radio.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Which is something that we have promoted here on Orange Launch Radio pretty heavily in the past.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
And what happened with Stitcher is that our latest show was not showing up on Stitcher.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
And we got tweets from several people that said, hey did you guys do a show this week?

22:38.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't see it. And I was confused because I'm going into iTunes and I'm looking at the Voice of the Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and I see the latest show.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
But I go onto Stitcher and it's not there.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
But unfortunately Stitcher doesn't really have a way for me to ping, like force ping the feed or anything like that.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
Well come to find out, long story short, Stitcher's been down for the last three days for maintenance.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
So these people that have been relying on Stitcher Radio to listen to podcasts are really up a creek right now.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
So I'm going to be honest, and this is a rough kind of hard thing for me to say.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
But I don't think I can really continue to promote Stitcher Radio here on the show.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And I'm not going to.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
And I'm not saying we're going to take ourselves off or anything.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
And if that's how you choose to listen to the show, that's cool.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm all about getting Orange Launch Radio any way you can.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
But if you are currently using Stitcher Radio, I would recommend you look into an app called TuneIn.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
And the main difference is, on TuneIn, they don't actually download the shows in a different bit rate.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
You're connecting directly to our feed.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
So you're not relying on any third party to get the shows.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You're going to be getting the shows yourself.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
That is just one recommendation.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Part of the reason I like TuneIn is that you can also use live radio with it.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
So not only can you get OLR in it, but you can get the VoG network stream in it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
So that's why I'm a little partial to that.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
But whatever you want to use to listen to the show, iTunes Podcast has it.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Google Play Store is supposed to be having podcasts.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
I know we are on there whenever they roll that out.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
So I'm very excited.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
But unfortunately, this is one too many burns from Stitcher for me.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
But this isn't a permanent thing.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
If they are able to fix things and maybe communicate a little more, ever since they got bought,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
I feel like a lot's gone downhill in that department.

24:25.000 --> 24:32.000
So not saying forever, but I would recommend Stitcher folks find another way to listen to OLR

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
because I'm not encouraged by the support that's been coming from them.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
And that's just the honest advice.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
So sorry, I know it's a little harsh.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
And I do, I just want to emphasize, I love all you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
But just as a podcaster, what's happening where you can't get the show is extraordinarily frustrating.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
And that's why I'm putting my foot down and saying I'm just going to recommend something else.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Okay.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
And some folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com are suggesting some other Android solutions.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
MXC says Pocket Casts is good.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Mr. Rizos, I'm sorry, is that Rizos or Rizos?

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Sorry, says try Pocket Cast if you're using Android.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
There's some other comments there from our chat.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
And then SHO 100 Matt says Stitcher did just update a few hours ago

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
saying that they're hoping to get service up via test sometime today.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Good luck to them. I hope they're able to work it out.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
All right, let's go around and talk about what's going on this week in the news.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Loki's starting us off.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
So Activision has finished their full reports for fiscal year 2015.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
And they're talking about kind of the revenue and everything.

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
Apparently revenues are up 4.6 billion from 4.4 in 2014.

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
Of that, they said that 47.5% was due to subscriptions, including World of Warcraft.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
Licensing, including Skylanders and all sorts of different things and Call of Duty.

25:59.000 --> 26:06.000
Among all that, though, they're also saying that 53% is actually digital revenue now.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
So from digital sources.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
I'm thinking probably a lot of that has to do with all the DLC stuff that they have out.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
I mean, especially with like the season passes for, you know, Call of Duty is probably a big thing.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
You know, Destiny with all of its DLC stuff and it's consumable.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
So that's probably a lot to do with it.

26:25.000 --> 26:34.000
Right now, they're still saying, though, that apparently Guitar Hero Live and Skylanders Supercharged

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
have fallen short of expectations.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
Skylanders I can totally see because it's hard to keep that brand alive.

26:41.000 --> 26:49.000
I mean, it's kind of it's become popular on its own, but I mean, they're not doing too much crazy stuff with it.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
They're just kind of adding one new gimmick each year.

26:51.000 --> 27:00.000
Whereas I think, you know, Lego Dimensions and Disney Infinity has a lot of that licensing that they can kind of back up on.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
You know, they've got, you know, the Marvel and Star Wars.

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
I mean, that's huge compared to Skylanders, which anybody coming into this, it's like who Skylanders what?

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
I kind of agree with you a lot here is that Skylanders maybe established the model,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
but now all these other players are coming in and kind of pushing Skylanders out.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
Well, and like Skylanders, I think, I mean, it looks like an interesting game and from what I've seen, it's OK.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
It's just like for me, like if I was trying to get this for my son, like who are these characters?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
I don't know who these characters are.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
I know that they're talking about bringing a cartoon and stuff like that.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
And there's a lot of kids that are really big fans of it because they've already been playing the other games.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
And so they know the characters and everything.

27:41.000 --> 27:49.000
But coming in from the outside, it's hard to kind of get hooked into that world without, you know, kind of knowing who these characters are.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
Whereas if you're Disney Infinity and stuff, I mean, it's like Star Wars.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
Oh, shit, we saw the Star Wars movies and we know all the Star Wars characters, you know, Marvel characters and Disney characters and all that stuff.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I mean, that's that's easy to kind of hook people into that.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
And I think even the Lego Dimensions stuff, aside from it being insanely overpriced, which I think a lot of that,

28:07.000 --> 28:14.000
especially when they have like Doctor Who, Portal, Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, that's totally aiming at the adult crowd.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Right.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You know, just buys that kind of stuff.

28:17.000 --> 28:25.000
So I think that's kind of the problem they have with Skylanders and they need to figure out some way to, I don't know, do something a little bit more interesting with it.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
It needs to kind of innovate a lot.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
And maybe, you know, I don't know if there's a lot necessarily they can do.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Maybe Activision needs to try to push a new character.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Here's the other thing that's like kind of a big no-no with them.

28:35.000 --> 28:45.000
It's like every time you buy a new version of Skylanders, you have to buy a whole new like starter pack, the whole new portal and everything to run with it because it doesn't work with the other stuff.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Whereas like Disney Infinity, I mean, not so much Lego Dimensions because it's the first time they released it.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
But Disney Infinity, you can use that same portal from the first one on all the new games.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
It's going to support any new game that they put out.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
So, I think it's kind of dumb that they do it that way because it's more expensive.

29:01.000 --> 29:12.000
You get to plop down, you know, $80 versus what I bought Disney Infinity 3.0 for $20 because I bought a digital version because I had the hardware for it already.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
And I just thought I'd buy toys. So, I don't know.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Not surprising though that Activision is making so much off digital.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I mean, especially the Blizzard side of things.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Oh yeah.

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
And you know, they're doing these really weird things and Shane and I were talking about this the other day where it's kind of sketchy how, I know that's a strong word but I really can't think of a better one.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
Where Blizzard is now trying this thing where instead of like pre-ordering games, you straight up pre-pay for games.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Like that's what's happening with Overwatch.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
If you pre-pay for Overwatch on PC, you get like special skins and these sorts of things.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
And it's like, you know, we're talking like $60.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
So, it's like a $60, it's a full pre-order. You're paying the full $60 up front.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
But the Blizzard fan base is so strong and the hype is so real for a game like Overwatch.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
Which they're, you know, and God I hate the way they do this.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
Is that they really funnel out the beta so that only certain people, it's to drive the hype.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
And they've really got this formula down. As frustrating as it can be.

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
Well yeah, and people need to grow up and realize that skins for a game is fucking stupid.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
And not a reason that you should pay $60 before it comes out.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
And like, I think that can be, you know, a lot of games are like that.

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
Where it's like, you know, look at oh, order a GameStop and you get like a gold skin for your gun in Call of Duty.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
Who gives a shit? It's a fucking skin. No one's gonna fucking notice what your gun skin is.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
And even if they do, no one's gonna give a shit that you have the gold gun skin.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
No one's gonna be like, oh my God, you're so cool because you have this skin.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Because they know what it comes from.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Yeah, exactly. No one cares.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
S2100Matt says, this is the same Blizzard fan base that bought ridiculous mounts in WoW.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
And on top of a regular monthly fee. Although I can't talk, I bought a mount in Final Fantasy XIV.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
I was gonna say, the mounts, that's not so bad. I mean, I understand that people want to do that.

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
And a lot of times they're doing that for charity as well. So that's, I don't see is, you know, a terrible downside to that.

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
I mean, that's fine. If you want to spend the money on customization like that, they go ahead and spend the money on customization.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
I don't understand the point behind it a lot of times, but I don't know.

31:14.000 --> 31:23.000
It's just trying to get people to pay for a game in full, especially in this type of market where, I mean, Blizzard's maybe not so bad.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
I don't think that they have a reputation of releasing games that are absolute broken when they come out because they develop mainly on PC anyways.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
But paying for a game in full way before it comes out is a kind of a risky move, especially in this market.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
Because of all the stuff that comes out absolutely broken at launch.

31:41.000 --> 31:50.000
Not to say that I don't do that still for games I really want, but, you know, Bethesda games I expect a certain level of broken, so it's fine.

31:50.000 --> 31:59.000
AkumaJP in chat says, no one cares what skin you have. That's what she says. Bad taste in joke, I know, but I can't help it.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
Alan Halkemi says, Final Fantasy XIV shop like that is evil. They've only done one account-wide mount for $25.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
Every storm out since is like $10 or $15 and it's per character.

32:09.000 --> 32:17.000
Dungeon Buster says, The Taken King's physical release disk was only for vanilla Destiny. You still had to punch in a code for The Taken King to download it.

32:17.000 --> 32:25.000
You know, I saw a comment here by Dungeon Buster. Skylanders isn't a bad game, it's just getting slammed by having to compete against the likes of Nintendo and Disney.

32:26.000 --> 32:38.000
Nintendo. There's something you want to do. You want something for your amiibos. There you go. Fucking rip off fucking Skylanders and put out like an RPG game where you actually play as the damn characters.

32:38.000 --> 32:47.000
That right there would probably get me to buy some of your amiibos. Because I think that would be pretty awesome. And it would be like, hey look, we have an actual use for this shit.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
Here's the reality of that. I love that idea, but isn't that Smash Brothers?

32:52.000 --> 32:58.000
Well Smash Brothers is a fighting game. Let's just change the genre. Let's just do an action RPG or something like that.

32:58.000 --> 33:08.000
Okay, so maybe a platformer. Although I would be like, that's Mario Maker. How about a racer? Oh, that's Mario Kart. I feel like Nintendo has already done a game with all these genres.

33:08.000 --> 33:19.000
But just spin off. You can even spin it off and just create almost like a Kingdom Hearts type thing where you have these different licensed properties coming into this brand new world that you're creating brand new characters for.

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
So I don't see why they couldn't do that. And hell, it'd give them an excuse to make more amiibos. I don't know.

33:25.000 --> 33:40.000
Alright, well let's move on and talk about a feature that another company is proposing doing. And it's Microsoft. And you know, Microsoft made a lot of waves this week in updating everybody on what's going on with Quantum Break.

33:40.000 --> 33:47.000
And I'm pleasantly surprised to hear Quantum Break's coming a lot sooner than I thought it was. They announced the release date for, what was it, April? For Quantum Break?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Wow, really?

33:48.000 --> 34:01.000
Yeah, it's soon. Sorry, I don't have the date in front of me where it's at. I'm trying to look that up right now. Quantum Break, April 5th is when Quantum Break's out, right? That kind of came out of nowhere. I was like, oh, it's going to be a holiday game.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
Yeah, I thought for sure that was a holiday, because we didn't hear anything about it for the longest time.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
No, just like we just dropped three episodes of Guys on the Show on everybody, they just came out and said, okay, it's ready. April 5th.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Is it because, are they still doing the TV portion of that?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
They are?

34:14.000 --> 34:31.000
Well, I'm sorry, when you say that, I mean, because they have like some big name talent that's in the game. Who's that guy that plays Iceman on the X-Men? I think he's in there. Sean Asmore? Is that? Asmore? Ashmore.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
My name is Sean. Sean Asmore.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
I must be thinking about something else. Anyway.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
I have your pizza.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
So anyway, yeah, Quantum Break. So where was I going with this before we got into that?

34:46.000 --> 34:56.000
Yes, Microsoft announced that Quantum Break is coming, and if you pre-order the game on Xbox One, you're going to get the Windows 10 version with it.

34:56.000 --> 35:08.000
This is interesting. So what Microsoft's essentially doing here is like, alright, Sony, you guys do this cross-buy thing all the time, where if somebody buys it on PlayStation 4, they get it on the Vita as well.

35:08.000 --> 35:22.000
Well, since we are basically injected into almost every PC out there, unless you have a Mac, which even if you have a Mac, you're probably double-booting, you will be able to get a copy of your Xbox One game on your PC.

35:22.000 --> 35:33.000
And this may be something that actually ends up being a trend. Phil Spencer actually tweeted at somebody who asked, do you expect to see third-party games on the cross-buy list or just MS-related releases?

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
Phil Spencer replied, we'll make it a platform feature. We think it's good for gamers.

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
So, I mean, it's nice to get something additional for the money that you pay.

35:45.000 --> 35:58.000
And by the way, in this case, specifically with Quantum Break, not only is it going to be Quantum Break, but you're also going to get Alan Wake with the backwards compatibility thing on 360 is also going to be included, and the little spin-off game they did.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
It's not a bad deal.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And I like Alan Wake a lot.

36:03.000 --> 36:10.000
I mean, I like Minecraft on Windows 10, but I am not going to the Windows 10 store to go shop for games.

36:10.000 --> 36:19.000
So, I mean, I don't know. Cool. I mean, hey, something for free is better than nothing for free, so I'm down with that.

36:19.000 --> 36:28.000
Now, ActDeft brings up in chat over at live.vognetwork.com something that kind of happened on the internet and on Twitter as a result of this.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
And ActDeft says, I'm going to cancel my Xbox One pre-order for Quantum Break because more people will play it.

36:33.000 --> 36:48.000
He's saying that in quotes. He's not saying that himself, but reflecting what was seen on Twitter this week, where some people reacted very angrily to this news saying, I can't believe you're doing this and that you promised this game is an Xbox One exclusive,

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
and now you're going to give it to PC people as well. I'm canceling my pre-order. I'm so mad.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
Which, I don't know if that makes a lot of sense to me.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Oh, it doesn't.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
I don't understand why you would be mad that more people can play it or whatever.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I guess they're complaining because...

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
They were promised it as an exclusive and it's not.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
So maybe they feel burned in the purchase of the Xbox One game.

37:10.000 --> 37:20.000
Yeah, exactly. Like, I bought this Xbox One for these exclusives and they're not exclusive anymore. Why did I purchase this one? I can just get it on this other platform that I already had that I didn't require this purchase on.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
But I don't think it works in reverse. You can't buy the PC version and get the Xbox One version for free.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.000
No, we don't know yet. Maybe if you buy it through the Windows 10 store instead of Steam, you will. Watch.

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
I'm on PlayStation Steam integration. Let's do that.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
No, they were flirting a little bit when PlayStation 2 came out.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah, that didn't happen.

37:42.000 --> 37:53.000
But if there was any way to do Half-Life 3 and just the internet explode in a sea of jism, that's gonna be the way to do it.

37:53.000 --> 38:01.000
But anyway, all that tinfoil hatting aside, I still don't understand the whole idea of just canceling your pre-order.

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
Because in my mind, you shouldn't be getting an Xbox One for just one game anyway.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Until that's all the Forza fans.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
And you're still getting that game.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
But you at least have two Forza games.

38:12.000 --> 38:22.000
And so what? You're still getting the game. And I mean, let's be honest. I have a Windows 10 laptop. Doesn't mean this game is gonna run for shit on my laptop.

38:22.000 --> 38:30.000
Just because it's free with Windows 10, or free if you buy it and you get a Windows 10 version, I can't run that shit.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
My laptop's gonna be like, no.

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
It's gonna be benchmark for the Xbox One. There's certain multiplayer integration on Xbox One and so forth.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
Well, I don't know if Quantum Break's a multiplayer game, but there's certain things you kind of come to expect with the Xbox One.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
But I kind of like the idea that if I get a game on one system, I'm gonna get it on both.

38:51.000 --> 38:58.000
I just fucking said, like, 20 minutes ago, that I want to get Diablo 3 on Xbox One.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
If it had had the cross-buy, this wouldn't be an issue, right?

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
So, from that regard, from that frugal money-saving standpoint, I love this.

39:08.000 --> 39:16.000
And if you're getting pissed off about shit coming out on Xbox One and then not being exclusive, I mean, I don't know.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
I think it's just a dumb argument anyways. On any platform.

39:20.000 --> 39:28.000
Bobby Blackwolf with some insight in our chat saying the idea that some people have is that this is Microsoft abandoning the Xbox One platform.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
They're not.

39:29.000 --> 39:36.000
In a way, it kind of makes it stronger. Like, they're trying to say, this is how we're gonna really try to push it past Sony.

39:36.000 --> 39:41.000
If anything, I don't think they're using it to get you to buy more games on Windows 10.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Because eventually, what they're trying to do is they're supposed to be unifying all those platforms anyway.

39:45.000 --> 39:55.000
So, where it's just Windows 10 on Microsoft's Xbox One and all these other devices, and you buy something on one platform, you get it on all platforms.

39:55.000 --> 40:02.000
And Bobby also says you need Oculus-like specs to run it on a PC, which, again, is pretty high-end, and that's without VR.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
And AkumaJP says, and remember, AkumaJP is in Japan, what's this Xbox One mystical machine you're talking about?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
It's a console that came out in the early 2000s.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
It had some pretty awesome games on it. I remember, granted, San Andreas was on it. First Halo game was on it.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
Xbox One. Xbox One. The new one. The new one.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Wait, the new one?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Anyway.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
That doesn't make any sense. Why would you call it the Xbox One if there's been two more before?

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Okay, hello debate from, like, three years ago when they first announced the name. Get over it.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
I'm telling you what, I'm just gonna go buy a Wii, and then that way I can play, you know, the new Zelda game when it comes out.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Is that Wii for you?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
No, that's the original Wii.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
You know, because it can run the new Zelda game, right, in 1080p?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Moving on. Dark Sakura, save us from this silliness.

40:48.000 --> 41:02.000
So there's a survey out that was put up by the video games analytics group Quantic Foundry that interviewed over 140,000 gamers for something called a gamer motivation profile.

41:02.000 --> 41:09.000
And it showed that basically the older that someone gets, the less appealing they find competition.

41:09.000 --> 41:20.000
So things like PVP or competitive gaming, things like that, basically just stops appealing to them.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
They're also saying that the big difference sort of hits right around age 35.

41:27.000 --> 41:43.000
You know, things start going further after they're, you know, it has an allegory to, like, life choices and the capacity the one has for wanting to compete more, like, in work and everything too.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
So I thought it was pretty interesting.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
So is this study proving that everybody's a goddamn wuss?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
No, I'm not motivated to compete.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
I'll tell you what it is, and I can completely understand because I am 35.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
So here's what it is, is you can't fucking compete.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
You can do it all you want, but it's impossible, and you know why?

42:01.000 --> 42:13.000
Because there are people that don't have jobs or don't have, you know, a life, or not a life, don't have family that they have to take care of, you know, a spouse, that type of stuff.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
So they have unlimited time to get at the top of these leaderboards.

42:19.000 --> 42:29.000
And by all means, it is impossible for you with your fucking two hours a day at the most playing these games to be able to compete on that level because you just don't have the free time.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
And I'm looking at you, all you unemployed fucking retired people playing goddamn Ingress Rant.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I knew this was an Ingress Rant, I knew it.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
I personally don't think that's the situation at all.

42:41.000 --> 42:49.000
One of the notes on here, it says the appeal of strategy declined the least, but the motivation to compete with others did.

42:49.000 --> 42:56.000
And for me, I personally just think that I am more satisfied with what I have, you know.

42:56.000 --> 43:04.000
I don't feel any need. I know I'm good. I don't feel like I have to prove it, you know.

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
It's like, what's another one? It was like back when I was playing Busted Move all the damn time.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
I entered one tournament, you know, and just kicked ass the entire hour before the tournament.

43:16.000 --> 43:23.000
And I was kind of like, I had a broken controller, so I didn't win my fourth match.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
And I didn't carry even really. I mean, I kind of didn't care.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
And it's the same thing now. I know I'm good at these games that I'm playing.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
I just don't feel a need to prove it to anybody.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
I'm somewhere in the middle because I totally get that whole element of I don't really want a PvP.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
And a lot of times I don't want a PvP because of some of the things we're low-key saying,

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
where it's just like you always get matched against people who are way outside of your bracket.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
And I feel like matchmaking in games, nobody's really perfected it yet because, you know,

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
and the reality is it's not fun to lose over and over and over again.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
And I get that, you know, sometimes there's winners and sometimes there's losers.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
But, you know, in some games you get matched up and it's like you just can't,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
you're just banging your head against a wall. You don't go anywhere.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
But at the same time, I have a lot of fun when I'm playing like Rocket League with my friends.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
And so when it's kind of like when that PvP environment is friends versus friends

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
and we're all kind of evenly matched, it's super fun.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
It's also a lot of those competitive environments are toxic.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
It's just very toxic people that you're playing with.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
It's not like, you know, I remember like that was one of the things I used to do.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
I even still do that with my friends when I play like Call of Duty with them and stuff.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
It's like I'm very like, hey, you know, great shot.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
You know, that was a great kill he got me and stuff like that and like very positive on that.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
But there's a lot of people.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
I mean, there's a vast majority of people you play with. They're fucking just toxic.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
You don't want to waste your eat.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
Like I said, you're talking about people that have very limited time in their schedule to play games.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And this is the kind of shit that you're, you know.

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
Oh, I spent two hours getting my ass kicked by someone that was just fucking yelling racial slurs at me the entire time.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I really want to play more of this.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
I mean, that's kind of the problem is you have limited time.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
And so you want that quality of gaming to be there.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
And if that, you know, it's going to be impossible to make sure that, you know,

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
who you're playing with is going to be a very positive experience.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
I don't know. A little bit of trash talking is fine.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
But I mean, it's just when people take it way too seriously.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Kaijuto in chat says, I disagree.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
If you want to be competitive, you have to get out there.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
And I sort of like I kind of get that.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
But at the same time, I still feel like matchmaking and a lot of the games I've tried could just be better.

45:39.000 --> 45:47.000
And that you could still learn from people that are like, like, oh, God, Splatoon is a great example.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
I think like I I hit my head against a wall in Splatoon all the time because I keep getting matched with people that are way up here.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
And it's like I just I make no progress in it and I'm not learning anything.

45:57.000 --> 46:05.000
And I don't know, maybe it's just maybe it's just but but when I play Splatoon with friends, I have a great time.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
So I'd play more Splatoon if it had off screen play, but it doesn't.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
So I don't. Now you're you're getting into things that aren't even about the topic.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
You're just you're just finding new things to complain about, Loki.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
I want to like that game. I don't like it, though, right now. And it's because I don't play much of it.

46:23.000 --> 46:29.000
And that's the reason why right there, which is frustrating because they have it in offline mode.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Why can't you do that online?

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, I miss hacked 64 player matches in Battlefront 1942.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
You know, cluster fucks can be kind of fun, like when the game is just one giant cluster fuck that actually like that.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Just Cause 2 multiplayer right there.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
Or going back to like Duke Nukem 3D when it was like eight people on a match. It's just one giant cluster fuck.

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
Like that's kind of fun. Like, you know, I don't know. I guess we should totally do that.

46:55.000 --> 47:02.000
I have Duke Nukem 3D and like all these different platforms. Like I know I have it on PlayStation 3 and Xbox.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Yeah, I think I have Duke Nukem on PC for sure.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And definitely PC reboot.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We get some other stories we got to get to Loki.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
All right. Sorry.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
So this is kind of cool.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
Lego Star Wars. They're going to be making an actual animated show that's coming to Disney XD this summer.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
It's called Lego Star Wars Freemaker Adventures.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
It's going to take place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
They're going to have some new heroes and villains that they're adding.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
Plus it's going to be kind of lighthearted like most of the Lego stuff is.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
And I'm totally down with this. I really wish they would do a Marvel show though as well.

47:38.000 --> 47:46.000
Because I'll tell you, we watch that Lego Marvel Superheroes Overload or whatever that's called.

47:46.000 --> 47:55.000
It's like a little made of like four or five different clips that they have on YouTube that they made around the time of the previous Lego Marvel game.

47:55.000 --> 48:01.000
My kids watch that show every day, at least once, probably twice or three times a day.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
And it's awesome. It's got, you know, Trey Baker as Loki in there.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
And the humor is just funny.

48:09.000 --> 48:15.000
So I'm really, if they can do that that well for just like 40 minutes and to the point where it's so rewatchable,

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
I'm totally down with them doing a Lego show.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
I just hope that they follow it up with a Marvel show as well because I don't want to miss out on that.

48:26.000 --> 48:33.000
Yeah, you know, the more you can tie into TVs and TV and get the kids hooked in, the more it's going to help the franchise.

48:33.000 --> 48:40.000
I think that kind of got them hooked in with the whole game in the first place because it was on there like a Lego show and we watched it.

48:40.000 --> 48:47.000
And, you know, that's one of the reasons also I was kind of disappointed that they didn't have the voice actors from, you know, the original game,

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
whereas all original voice acting doing the different characters, they just kind of splice it out of the movies

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
because the voice actors were the same in the cartoon as they were in the actual game.

48:56.000 --> 49:02.000
And I thought they were great. It's just, I don't know, now it's just clipped out voices and it doesn't make any sense.

49:04.000 --> 49:11.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase PIPE.

49:11.000 --> 49:19.000
Alright, well let's move on to your weekly Nintendo NX rumors because it seems like every week there's another damn NX rumor out there

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
as the hype continues to build for Nintendo's new platform.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Well, here's your rumors for this week.

49:25.000 --> 49:32.000
Apparently, the Nintendo NX will support Unreal Engine 4 and Unity at launch, which, I mean...

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Phones support that, so it's not surprising.

49:34.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of something you're gonna have to support if you want to get into a lot of the indies and, you know, a lot of the different titles.

49:41.000 --> 49:56.000
So, this isn't exactly surprising, but the source that was talking about this says that Unity and Unreal Engine 4 will be ready in time for when developers outside of key partners are able to purchase dev kits of their own.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
We may hear more about this at GDC, maybe?

49:59.000 --> 50:09.000
Maybe, but I still feel like it's gonna be early. I really feel like Nintendo's gonna do it at E3. I think that is what they're waiting for, for sure.

50:09.000 --> 50:17.000
But Nintendo, you know, in a separate report, Nintendo is still continuing their development and planning efforts for the NX in preparation for launch.

50:17.000 --> 50:26.000
And this was something that the president of Nintendo, the new one, Tatsumi Kimishima, said as he was talking to investors.

50:26.000 --> 50:34.000
That development and planning efforts for the NX in preparation for launch are underway, but obviously he didn't say a lot more than that.

50:34.000 --> 50:48.000
He did continue to say that previous and current fiscal years have been a period of preparation to launch a number of new endeavors, such as NX development, development for smart devices, and business using our character IP, in addition to driving our Wii U and Nintendo 3DS business.

50:48.000 --> 50:57.000
At the same time, it's been our priority to take a close look at areas of our existing business where the revenue and expenses have become unbalanced and to make sure that we corrected this balance.

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
As I've said before, we will be launching many of our new business activities as we move from this fiscal year into the next.

51:03.000 --> 51:10.000
The question was to pick one area with which we will be able to achieve Nintendo-like profits, but I would like to suggest two areas.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
One is our NX business and another is our business for smart devices.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
I believe that keeping these two endeavors on track will be key to achieving Nintendo-like profits.

51:19.000 --> 51:27.000
I don't have any further details to share about the next fiscal year at this time, but we will explain our plan and what we will aim to achieve Nintendo-like profits at a future date.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
So, I mean, it's really all but a given that NX is going to show up at E3 this year.

51:33.000 --> 51:41.000
If not sooner, but certainly by E3, I think we'll finally have a name and kind of know what the catch is with this.

51:41.000 --> 51:52.000
If we haven't already figured it out, which a lot of folks speculating based on prior reports that it's going to be similar to a Wii U, but the tablet is simply a fully functional handheld system.

51:52.000 --> 52:01.000
And that is the NX ecosystem, essentially. And apparently it will run Unreal and Unity, because it has to.

52:01.000 --> 52:14.000
Well, Unreal is scalable, so that's the point. Hell, remember, there are Unreal games that are on Android devices and iOS devices, so it makes sense.

52:14.000 --> 52:23.000
And Dungeon Buster reminding us that Iwata, before he passed away, did ask everyone to look forward to E3 this year for NX news, so it would be, you know, on track for them.

52:23.000 --> 52:30.000
And SSG100Matt says Nintendo can take their time in releasing this. I'd rather they release it later and get it right.

52:30.000 --> 52:40.000
Well, you know, we had an earlier rumor, and this was even something I had thrown out there as a suggestion in early January, that maybe one will predate the other.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
That maybe we'll have the handheld this year, but we won't necessarily have the console until later on.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Why not split up when they're going to ask for your money?

52:47.000 --> 52:55.000
Instead of making you pay $600 all at once, or whatever it's going to end up being, get your $250 for the handheld and your $300 for the console, or whatever it is.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
I'm throwing arbitrary numbers out there. But get that separated a little bit so it doesn't feel like such a punch.

53:00.000 --> 53:08.000
I really feel like that's the direction Nintendo's got to go to get more people to adopt this, is basically sucker people into buying two systems.

53:08.000 --> 53:15.000
Which, to be fair, most Nintendo fans already have a Wii U and a 3DS. It's not going to be anything different. It's just that they'll work together.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
Logie, I feel like you're trying to start dying to say something over there.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
I just want the PlayStation VR this year, so, you know, I can play that.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
There is that. That might be the thing you hear more about at GDC.

53:29.000 --> 53:36.000
I hope we get some sort of price for it soon. I mean, maybe, I think it's going to be close to the holiday that we hear the price about it.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
We'll probably know the release date around E3 and maybe the price around the holiday.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
See, the PlayStation VR is supposed to be out the first half of the year. So...

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I hope that's the case. I'd love to pick it up.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
I really think there's...

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
Because that's a system I know that'll at least run VR, because my laptop ain't cutting it.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
There's no other real time I can think of for them to say anything about it other than GDC.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
Or they're going to have to wait until E3. Or, you know, it's Sony.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
They could throw another event whenever they want.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
Are they? I mean, can I order them?

54:11.000 --> 54:17.000
I don't believe so. I think a listing was spotted, and that's where the price supposedly leaked out from.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
But I don't think that was an intended mass thing yet.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Because you can't really pre-order something you don't necessarily know the price for.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Well, GameStop would disagree with you.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
That's true, that's true.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
Alright, moving on. Before we get to release dates, start Sakura.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Oh, I guess.

54:34.000 --> 54:46.000
So, for fans who love their old Windows 3.1 games, which are some of my very, very fond memories back on a 486.

54:47.000 --> 54:58.000
The Internet Archive, which is a non-profit that's devoted to basically creating an online archive for anything digital, I guess.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
They've added a bunch of DOS games about a year ago up there.

55:03.000 --> 55:11.000
But now they've expanded it to include over a thousand Windows 3.1 games and programs.

55:12.000 --> 55:20.000
Like the article that I got my information from shows a picture of Election 92 that you can play. Who remembers that?

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
I don't, but I remember Minesweeper.

55:23.000 --> 55:31.000
But they have the various list of programs up there, and the entire archive is available.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
So I would most assuredly say, you know, check it out.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
See what's up there, because you might find an old treasure that you forgot about, you know.

55:40.000 --> 55:50.000
Just looking through the archive list, and yeah, the website is at archive.org slash details slash software library underscore win three.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
Which they had previously already done a bunch of old DOS releases, you know.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
That's, yeah, about a year ago.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
So yeah, oh my god, that was about a year ago. So now we're moving into the Windows era, so that's pretty cool.

56:02.000 --> 56:10.000
Yeah, just looking at some of the ones on here, we have the Windows 3.1.1 stock installation.

56:10.000 --> 56:19.000
We have Sea Battle, Travel and Ted, Pharaoh's Curse, 3D Maze, The Spooky Door.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I don't remember any of these games.

56:21.000 --> 56:28.000
Battlestar, some of these I did play, Monopoly Deluxe, Windows Risk, TDK Pinball.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Oh, I wonder if something like CivNet or one of those old Civilization games you have on there.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
Windows 3.1 WinTrek, remember that Star Trek game.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Click and Play.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
SSG100 Matt is asking if Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is on there. God, I hope so.

56:42.000 --> 56:48.000
I'm looking, Brainwave 2, RoboWin, Blob Factory.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Alright, don't name all the games, I'll be here all night.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
No, I'm just looking through it just to see if I can find any in particular that are, yeah, I should see if I can see them on there.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
But yeah, there's just a ton of stuff on here, so.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
Go dig through yourself. Find a game to play for 30 seconds before you move on to the next one.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Spooky Door.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
The Spooky Door.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
It actually has so many O's in both of them.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Better than the Spooky Door.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Better than the Poopy Door.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.000
Now this is funny, it has Autodesk 3D Studio 3 on it.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Really?

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
That's old school.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Very old school. I like the fact that there's just like the stock Windows installation.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
Hey, wanna play around with the Windows 3.1 desktop just for fun?

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
It was the 3.1.1.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
Oh, excuse me, DarkSagra. 3.1.1 installation.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Actually, Wheel of Fortune's on here.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Wow.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
You have the old Windows Wheel of Fortune. I'm just trying to see.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
Do they have Jeopardy 2 so you can get all the 90's answers in there?

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
Try going back and playing a game like Jeopardy on an old system. It asks you questions from that era.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
And it's like, oh my god.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Dan was doing that with Puzzle and Dragons.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
Or playing The Price is Right will fuck you up.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Tamagotchi for Windows.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Alright.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Crazy.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Let's move on.

58:01.000 --> 58:09.000
We're gonna talk about what games you can play in the here and now this week as we travel around the world and look at release dates. Loki starting in the US.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
Alright, so this week, quite a bit of stuff's coming out.

58:14.000 --> 58:21.000
So, let's see. Let's start with Street Fighter V. That'll be coming out on Playstation 4 as well as PC.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
Then we've got Project X Zone 2 on 3DS.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
And Return. Let's see. That's not coming out this week.

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
It's not even in order. That makes no sense.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
On Friday, we have Fire Emblem Fates Conquest.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
With, let's see here.

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
Bayonetta 2 is getting re-released, looks like, on Wii U.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I don't know if that's a price drop, maybe.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
It looks like a price drop.

58:52.000 --> 58:57.000
And Fire Emblem Fates Birthright and Fire Emblem Fates Conquest.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Both coming out on Friday.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
And that would be it.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
Alright, let's go over to Japan where Street Fighter V is also coming out over there.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And I know a lot of people are very excited about that.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
That will be on February 18th for Street Fighter V.

59:13.000 --> 59:19.000
On the Playstation 4, there's also a hot package which I think just has some of the extra skins like Daddy Ryu and stuff.

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
There's also a full system bundle that's gonna be coming out with Street Fighter V included.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
So I'm sure some people are very much looking forward to that.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
But that's not the only release on the Playstation 4 in Japan this week.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
You can also get Shingeki no Kaioujin is coming out this week.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
That is Attack on Titan.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
Yay! I want that, like, a lot.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
Playstation 4 region free, right?

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
So that's something you can do.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Yeah, I got Puyo Puyo.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
That's right. So you can do it if you wanted to.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Puyo Puyo.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
Going over to the Wii U.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Nothing.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
For a long time.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
So let's go over to the Vita, which, the Vita has more releases than the Wii U in Japan.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
That Shingeki no Kaioujin is also out on the Playstation Vita.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Kankole- what?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Kyojin.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
One of these days.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Kankole Kai comes out on the Vita as well.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Ikene Tu Yuki no Setsuna also comes out on the Playstation Vita.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So a little bit of a busy week over there in Japan, especially with Street Fighter V.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Let's go over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I don't wanna go.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
We're not physically going there, we're just mentally going there.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I know, I actually lost my place on the webpage.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
To talk about their release date.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Excuse me, princess.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Okay, so on the 16th, we have Layers of Fear for the Mac.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And then The Escapist, The Walking Dead for PS4.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
On the 17th, Californium on Mac and PC, and Rainbow Moon on PS4.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And that's it for the week.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But first, Loki.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Alright, so I think we talked about this before, but Ubisoft has confirmed that there will not be a new Assassin's Creed game this year.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And instead Watch Dogs will be coming, which may not necessarily make it out this year as well.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's supposed to be out by March of 2017 though, so expect that.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And basically saying, this year we are stepping back and reexamining the Assassin's Creed franchise.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000
As a result, we decided that there will not be a new Assassin's Creed game in 2016 since the release of Assassin's Creed Unity.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
We've learned a lot based on your feedback, because it was really terrible.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:44.000
We've also updated our development process and recommitted to making Assassin's Creed a premier open world franchise, blah blah blah blah blah, PR speak.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Okay, so that's all you need to know about that.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:08.000
What is on their table though, between now and the end of March 2017, For Honor, South Park, The Fractured But Whole, Ghost Recon Wildlands, and of course the new Watch Dogs game, and some other AAA titles.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I am excited about the South Park game.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yeah, South Park's game is definitely one I gotta check out.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It reminds me, I gotta go back and finish the South Park game.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And yeah, a lot of people picked up that other South Park game, The Stick of Truth. It's pretty amazing.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Speaking of which, South Park, The Stick of Truth, has sold 5 million copies.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.000
5 million copies. So, maybe we can sell a few more in anticipation of the sequel.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Definitely play it if you haven't yet, because it is a fantastic game. It is basically the show. I mean...

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's a really long episode of the show.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Really long episode of the show. I mean, it is fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about the game.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Alright. Well, moving on to one more story here that's actually a really big deal that happened in gaming this week that we should talk about.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And that is that Amazon has released a new game engine, and they've released it for free.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So, right now out there, you hear a lot of people often talking about Unity or they're talking about Unreal Engine.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Well, a new 3D game engine was released by Amazon, and it's called Lumberyard.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And this is going to allow you to create games for the PC or consoles and mobile.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000
It is based in part on the CryEngine, but there's other tech and code that comes from Double Helix.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I believe Amazon had acquired them some time ago, who had made Killer Instinct on Xbox One.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:40.000
There's also some Amazon AWS code, and it's really going to focus on multiplayer and social games and where online instances are important.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And that's pretty cool because that is how Amazon is essentially quote-unquote monetizing it.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Because by them integrating the Amazon web services into it and the whole cloud and using that for the multiplayer,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.000
that's how they're essentially making money off of it is because if you use the easily built-in multiplayer stuff, it's going to integrate with Amazon.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And not just that, but the whole social element where Twitch TV, you're going to be able to have your game have those interactions with Twitch very easily.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And I'm not just talking about streaming the game on Twitch.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I'm talking about like when people type things on chat and it does things in the game, that is all integrated into Lumberyard as well.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
So this is interesting how Amazon is using a game engine to essentially bolster their other properties.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I almost have to wonder at some point if, I don't want to necessarily say the word antitrust, but it's going to come to a point where there's too many hands-in-hands going on in Amazon.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I think this might be about the limit. So we'll see.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But I mean, I don't see this as negative necessarily. I think more options are a great thing.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And having this engine that's going to be completely free is going to be extremely competitive and probably get more people out there actually making games.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.000
By the way, Gamelift is the other side of this and that is where you actually create the session-based multiplayer games.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
That's not necessarily directly in Lumberyard, but obviously those two are pretty much hand-in-hand.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:17.000
So Lumberyard will support PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Supposedly mobile and VR support also coming to Lumberyard.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Akuma JP points out in chat, Lumberyard is basically CryEngine equals UI disaster.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So it may be something you, I don't know if Amazon's polished it up or what, but it may be something you have to spend a little bit of time learning.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I can't imagine Amazon wouldn't put something out there though that they don't have a really good support at like teaching people how to use.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But I think at the end of the day, you know, different programmers are going to prefer different things.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And it might be really hard to pull somebody who's been doing Unity off of that into Lumberyard.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I don't know, Loki, you use these things way more than I do. What do you think when you hear about this?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Is this something where you're like, hmm, I want to check this out or nah, I need to look at it.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I know Crytek was available for a while. I mean, it's still available, but like, I don't know if I would try to use that.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I mean, it's free. I was going to download it, but it's 10 gigs right now, so obviously I'm not going to download that right now.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But I'll take a look at it, I guess. I mean, it just depends on what it looks like.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And I don't really have anything that would necessarily need to use this to make.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I mean, like, I don't know. I'll stick with what I'm comfortable with for right now.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But it's good to have alternatives, I guess. I like the Twitch integration thing. That's kind of cool.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah. It'd be very interesting to see what Twitch looks like a couple years from now, where it's not just watching people playing games, it's interacting with people playing games.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
It's going to be very, very, I mean, that's already out there in some capacity.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I want to say right now, or in the very near future, is when Twitch is celebrating the Pokemon, or Twitch plays Pokemon, things like the second anniversary of that whole thing.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And that was kind of the little pebble that started the avalanche of more interaction in streams.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Yeah, that was ridiculous. Who would have thought that you could have had a group of people just play Pokemon in that manner?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And played through, like, most of the games.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yeah. I think they beat it. I'm pretty sure they beat it.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Did the fish ever play in Pokemon ever finish Pokemon?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I don't know if any of those other, I mean, there was a lot of knockoffs after that, and I didn't really follow any of those.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Alright, let's move on. Let's go back to a simpler time where, you know what, the internet, there was no internet, actually.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:41.000
There was no internet, so there was nobody to yell at you at what you were doing wrong while you were playing a game besides, you know, maybe somebody who was sitting in the room with you.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The classic game of the week.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Darsakha's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, put down, get out of the lumber yard.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Get over here and check out this classic before you start a new game.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Darsakha, what did you choose for the classic game tonight?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I chose Chubby Cherub, which is stupid because it's not even a love game.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
But I was like, Dan, pick a game that has a Valentine theme.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Chubby Cherub? I'm like, no, but it'll work.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So, Chubby Cherub was known in Japan as...

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Sorry, here's the music. Sorry, I did the wrong part there.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
It has cute music because it's a cute Bandai game.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But in Japan it was known as Obake no Kyutaro 1-1 Panic, which translates to Kyutaro the Ghost Bow-Wow Panic.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And I'm gonna stop there and tell you what Obake no Kyutaro is.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So, basically Obake no Kyutaro was a comic from like 1964 and then again in the 70s and it had a couple of anime series

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000
about a ghost that likes to go around, scare people, and steal food.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And he's very, very afraid of dogs.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And he hangs out with some human kid.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I gotta look up the name again.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Named Shota. So, that's where that comes from.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
In the US, of course, no one knows who Kyutaro is.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So, they remade the game into Chubby Cherub with a cute little naked blonde cherub baby running around.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Of course, with that old school 80s Bandai artwork.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Okay, maybe I'm an idiot, but I don't know a lot about this game.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I always thought it was a tongue-in-cheek reference to Chubby Checkers.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
No. Nothing to do with it.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
This whole time, I always thought Chubby Cherub was a silly little play on, you know, the famous, you know, from the 50s.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Chubby Checkers.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Come on, baby.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Yeah, and I thought...

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Let's do that, please.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Exactly! Everybody knows that, right?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Yeah.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Oh my gosh.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Not Chubby Checker.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So, now that you stand corrected, you know, 30 years later...

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I gotta be honest, though.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
It's a stupid little game.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
You know, I love and respect your opinions, DarkSakura, but this game kind of looks like shit.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
It is shit.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
But it's classic shit.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And it's like in Valentine's Day, and Dan picked...

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Proof that Dan can pick a shitty game.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I would have thought that, you know, a good pick would have been Chulip, which is a kissing game.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Maybe next time.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I don't think that's even old enough.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
It's 2002, actually.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Oh, maybe next time.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Maybe next time.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
No, that's alright.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So, anyway...

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
This is the game, too, that...

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Maybe we're gonna say it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I'm sorry.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
The misspelling.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Can I say that?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Do it.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
The congratulation.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Because I actually see that on the screen right now.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Anyway, basically, to go back to the original game, Kyutaro's friends are kidnapped by burglars.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And so Kyutaro has to save them.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But there are many dogs in the way, and that's why I went back to say things about Kyutaro.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
He is afraid of dogs.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So, basically, he has to cross 12 levels, and at the end of each, he's got a protagonist...

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Wait, why did I say protagonist?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
An antagonist.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
A different, you know, fight he has to do.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
He saves his friends.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And he eats food that keeps his flight up.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
But if the flying meter goes all the way down, he'll have to stay on the ground and walk around.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And he can bark at the dogs before they bark at him.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And if his bark hits the character...

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
If the bark hits Kyutaro, then he dies.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
There are heaven and hell stages.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So when he goes down on one of the stages when there's a down, he goes to hell.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And it's dark and he can't see anything and he can't fly.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Or when he touches a dog...

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
When he gets touched by a dog, it acts like a miss.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
But it keeps going until he gets to the exit.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
So, I mean, the game is, like, not very well put together.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
The heaven stages basically are scrolling stages.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And he gets warped all the way through the levels.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So, anyway, like I said, it's not a very good game.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So, their main character is Kyutaro, or in the US, Chubby Cherub.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And they fly through the air or walk on the ground.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Flying has a meter, which, like I said, if it drops low, he has to walk around.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Lollipops give him the ability to shoot four shots at the dogs and other food replenishes the meter.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And it's funny, though, because the person who did Kyutaro was Huchiko Fujio.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And I think it's cool that the original artist for Kyutaro no Obake did the drawing of Chubby Cherub.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
So that was pretty cool.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Beagles are the main enemies in the game.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
They also have bulldogs. They're not very fast, but they bark a lot more.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Damn those bulldogs.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And there's cats.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Cats are really not so much of a threat, but they're pretty much impossible to get rid of.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
They just kind of get in the way.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Yeah.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Meow, meow, meow.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
As cats tend to do.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Yeah.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
They're just kind of sitting there wanting to be fed.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
This was listed as the 50th worst nest game of all time.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Sean Riley, the reviewer, said that the graphics were-

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Is that Sean Baby?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I guess.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
It might be. I just remember when that guy was everywhere.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Hold on. Yeah, Sean Baby.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Described the game as ugly and that the cartridge was a waste of plastic and could be used for many other things.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So, thank you, Dan, for this suggestion of an awful game based-

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:46.000
That was a revamping of another really awful game based on an actually pretty cute manga series.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Well, what a shitty way to wish everybody a Valentine's Day.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Have a shitty Valentine's Day, everybody.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
At least it didn't tell them to play Back to the Future.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That would be pretty bad.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I can't believe that this playthrough-

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
But it has really cute music.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:10.000
It does have cute music for an 8-bit game, but I can't believe that this playthrough that this person's doing goes on for an hour and 20 minutes.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I would not be able to tolerate this for an hour and 20 minutes.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
But then again, our tastes were so different back in the day on the NES, you know?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Like, repetitive games, it's all good.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
You know what game that I actually- I haven't done a review of it yet, I think.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But it just used to piss me off so much because I'd play it for like 5 minutes and be like,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
There's no end to this game ever, was MagMax.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Did you ever play that?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Oh, God.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Hated it.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Yeah.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But I would play it because I'd be like, I'm done with Dr. Mario and I'm gonna play MagMax.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
And it was only when I was visiting my family in Dothan.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And you know what? Sometimes games are classically bad, okay?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
You know what?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Chubby Cherub.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000
If I were to do, like, my Jamie explains you a thing podcast, I'm just gonna have this section that's called Game Shit.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Where it's gonna be- it's gonna have the GameStop logo on it, but it'll be Game Shit.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Or the Smashburger logo, you mean?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Whatever. Smashburger took it from- GameStop had it first.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
No, I know. But you could do Game Shit while eating Smashburger.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
No...

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
The problem is Smashburger doesn't accept my trades, so, you know.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I'm just- yeah, I'm gonna have a segment called Game Shit and Girl No.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Alright, we're gonna take a break, guys.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
We have had a lot of show so far, but we've got plenty more to come, including when we come back for the quick break.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Rapid Fire News, we're gonna do, as well as talking about a potential sequel to a game I really didn't think was going to get a sequel, but it might.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And a very interesting movie and game tie-in, and then your calls as well over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Or the old-fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR. We're also gonna get to your emails when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 631 for this February the 14th of 2016.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Happy Valentine's Day to all of our listeners, or, you know, Singles Awareness Day, whatever it is that you're celebrating out there, but hope you have a good day.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Happy Deadpool Weekend.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Happy what?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Happy Deadpool Weekend.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Happy Deadpool Weekend, which apparently is doing huge at the box office, from what I'm hearing, so.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.000
But, you know, I feel bad because Alan and I did a really nice Valentine's Day dinner on Friday.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And then after that, he was like, well, so do you wanna go see a movie? He's like, I wanna go see Deadpool.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And I was like, ugh. Now, I wanna see, don't get me wrong, I wanna see Deadpool, but I don't wanna see it opening weekend with all the kids.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
We're going tomorrow.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And all the frickin', you know, noisy teenagers. And I tell you about how I hate seeing movies with noisy teenagers, and you know there's gonna be a ton of them at Deadpool, so.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Well, you're such an old man now.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I really am. Damn those kids!

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Except I'm the one who's having the old birthday, but oh well.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Whatever. But, hey, I'm looking forward to your birthday celebration, so I can't believe how fast this year is moving already. Crazy.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And, of course, I just keep wishing that the 2016 Angel of Death would go visit Ted Nugent.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.000
You know. As long as you're getting rock stars, go after Ted.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Alright, look, let's move on. We gotta get some rapid fire news here in gaming, so let's start off with Loki.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Alright, so Sega, they're releasing a collection of their Sega 3D Classics as part of the Sega 3D Classics collection on 3DS.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And along with that, if you happen to be one of the first ones that purchases the game, you'll get some stickers!

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:55.000
So they're gonna have a decal sheet with, like, Mega Drive, Genesis, some weird bunny, which I have no fucking clue what that's supposed to be for.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I'm assuming something has to do with the Genesis and Mega Drive, but who knows.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
But that's cool. And then, oh, here we go. It's probably gonna tell me right here.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Professor Asobin. I guess he was in the manual for the SG-1000.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Okay. Well, didn't know that. Cool. And, yeah. So when is that coming out? No fucking clue.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000
But soon, though. April 26th. $29.99. 3DS. Pick it up.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:37.000
This is kinda cool. And I may have to plug my internet back in on my PlayStation 4, but Earth Defense Force 4.1 has some DLC out.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
And the best part about it? It's free! For the first two weeks.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:49.000
So with that, you're gonna get a couple missions. So they've got the Mission Pack 2 Extreme Battle and Time of the Mutants.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And that's gonna be 23 new missions. I guess 26 in the first add-on. And that's pretty awesome.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And after the two-week period, it's gonna be $10. So pick it up now.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000
And then finally, Mega Man is gonna be coming to Nintendo Badge Arcade.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Oh, yay. That shit.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:20.000
So you can waste virtual currency getting badges for your 3DS if you really want to dump that money on that kind of stuff.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I still don't understand the point of that stuff. I really don't. And I know people that are really into it.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And it's like, I can't. I can't with that badge arcade thing on 3DS. It seems like the biggest waste of money.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
But you know what? Spend your money. If it makes you happy, go for it. Go for it.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Alright, moving on. Let's talk about Pokemon. Because you know it is the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So Nintendo is rolling out lots of different celebrations for the Pokemons.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And Super Mario Maker is going to be getting some Pokemon-related content.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle, which as you may recall were the original three Pokemon before Pikachu and the cartoon and all that stuff.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And they had to do Pokemon Yellow. Those are the starter Pokemon.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
There's an event course and you can unlock Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle costumes.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000
They are three separate costumes and they actually will provide retro sound effects when you complete courses and things like that.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Keep in mind, you know, if you want to get a Pikachu skin, there already is a Pikachu amiibo you can use to get it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Or playing through the courses as many times as it takes to unlock it, you can do it that way.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
My understanding is you have to actually beat this course three separate times to unlock each costume.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
So that's kind of a neat little twist in that for what it is.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Speaking of Pokemon, a lot of people looking forward to Pokemon Go.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I have to admit, I was really nervous about Pokemon Go when I first heard about it.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
But the more I think about it, the more excited I think I am for Pokemon Go.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000
But there's a lot of beta scams going on for Pokemon Go.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.000
So there's been kind of a push to let people know that if you see a beta sign up out there for Pokemon Go, it's fake.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Now Niantic did say, Niantic of course, the developers of Ingress, which we've talked about also on this program before,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
even though Niantic has said that there is going to be a closed beta that will take place in the winter,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
they haven't really given any updates since then.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000
So my advice, if you see a Pokemon Go thing on Facebook that sounds too good to be true, it is.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Wait and look for something official to come from Niantic or to come from Nintendo themselves.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And you know when this news comes out, it will be all over Twitter.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
It will be all over the gaming news sites.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Everybody's going to tell you about the official beta once it's out.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Niantic will say something under Google Plus and it will be out everywhere.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And also a couple of the Pokemon fan sites have said that there's indications that the game's release is going to be in mid-March anyway.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So I just found a post on it just a moment ago.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
That would be great because I know not everybody knows the inner workings of Ingress necessarily unless you've played.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
But a lot of people in Ingress are going to be getting a very important badge right at the end of this month.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000
It's a badge called Sojourner and it means that you have hacked every single day for an entire year.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And that's what they call a black Sojourner badge. You're going to get that at the end of February.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I'm not.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And I know, well, because you're newer to the game and so is Loki.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.000
But when I know when I and I've been hacking every single freaking day and you better believe I looked up.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
OK, when I go to Magfest, are there portals nearby? Am I going to be OK? Yes, I am.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Once I get that black Sojourner badge, it's going to be like relief.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Now I now I can now I can put the game away for a few days.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I can take a well-deserved vacation from Ingress until the bat phone goes off.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Rob, can you drop this link somewhere in the middle of nowhere?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Oh, OK. Anyway, I'm still looking forward to Pokemon Go.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Let's talk about Silent Hills. Yet again, the game that never was still continues to show up in the news somehow.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Like at least every month we have some damn story on Silent Hills.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
But this is a pretty good one and it's a Twitter story, but it comes from Cliffy B.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And Cliffy B had tweeted earlier this week that Kojima once told me he wanted me to do a new Silent Hill with him together out of L.A.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I was flattered, but declined. And he replied when somebody asked him about it, saying,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I don't like L.A. I love new IPs and I would have fucked up Silent Hill.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So interesting that he confesses that I would have fucked it up.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
You know what? He'd probably be actually pretty good about doing a new zone or was it a Zone of Enders game?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Because I think, you know, the combat and gears is pretty awesome.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And that's more of a combat focused game. I think pretty sweet. Right.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So, yeah. And then if you can imagine, he might have joined that Dream Team lineup.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I mean, this would have been a really kick ass game.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Maybe that's part of what was making it so damn expensive and why Konami pulled the plug on it.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I don't know. But then again, that would be trying to apply logic to a Konami 2015-2016 scenario, which I don't think is possible anymore.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So...

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I just don't care anymore.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yep.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And let's say the Onu DDR announcement, in which case I still don't care because it's probably going to be mobile or arcade game I'm never going to play.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Yeah. How about Dark Sakura? What do you have for us before we get to the Fugu question?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Well, there is Hatsune Miku news.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Basically, our favorite virtual idol is going to be going around with...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Anamanaguchi. I'm going to mispronounce this. Anamanaguchi.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Anamanaguchi. Yeah.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Anamanaguchi.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I'm a little gooey.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Just think of Anamanapia, but with Gucci at the end.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
But without an O in it either.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yeah.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:53.000
So basically, the tour is going to start off in Seattle on April 23rd, right after my birthday if someone wants to take me to the San Francisco one.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And going to be going around with a really awesome chiptune band.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And she's got that makeover from Nomura, which is pretty cool too.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Future of the Final Fantasy All-Star Carnival has a teaser out and about.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It's going to be...

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Is this an arcade game?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Yeah, it's an arcade game.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
That's going to have two buttons and two joystick sliders.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And it will let you play across the country, of course, in Japan.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:34.000
So you can enjoy the game with other people with cute little chibi versions of all your favorite characters.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And Zoe Quinn, which we know her for being a big icon with this whole, I guess, gamer gate deal, has dropped the harassment suit against her ex.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And she actually put out a statement that said, ironically, getting a restraining order against him was the least effective thing I could do in terms of getting him out of my life for good and for protecting myself.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
When you seek charges, you're on trial as much as the other person, if not more.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And then she's also saying that there was the near impossibility of how to create a case for online harassment when basically all the people in the deciding capacity, they don't know how the internet works.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And one person told her to give up her career and stop going online if she didn't like the abuse, which is stupid, absolutely stupid.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:49.000
She put out everything publicly, so it's basically done. But she says she's still going to work for trying to educate and reform so that the next person who experiences won't have the same thing happen to them.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Sometimes you're just done with bullshit.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Yeah, sometimes you just gotta say, I'm just cutting this fuck, I'm just severing this limb. I'm cutting this fuckery out of my life. Done.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we would be moving on to the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Thanks for having a good home.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And we read some selected answers to a question that I forgot to post.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Oh, Rob.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Good job.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I was so busy preparing the clips and all that stuff for the announcement show tonight that I was like, I feel like I'm forgetting something. You ever have that feeling when you're like leaving the house, like I'm forgetting something, I'm leaving something at home?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Did I leave the stove on?

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Yeah, did I leave the stove on?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Did I feed the cat?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Did I post the FUGL question?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Did I leave the stove on the cat?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Did I leave the cat on the stove?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Well, sg100matt in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com actually says, I thought you didn't put one up because of the delayed start due to the announcements between shows.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Yes, that is it. Thank you.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
sg100matt, you read my mind. That is it.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
That is why there is no FUGL question this week.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Alright, here it is.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:24.000
No, I actually had thought of a question, so we're going to do this the Bill O'Reilly way, the classic YouTube clip.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Fuck it. We'll do it live.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So we're going to do a little bit of a live way of doing this in our chat room.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So, here's the question I was going to ask.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Since it is Valentine's Day, I wanted to know what is your favorite couple, romance, love story type of thing in a video game?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
What's your favorite romance, love, awe?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And it could even be, I would say that a close friendship type of love.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000
It doesn't necessarily have to be like, you know, hearts in the eyes love, but it could be like a deep, deep friendship love too.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
What is your favorite kind of love story in a video game?

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
So, if you guys want to answer in our chat room, I'll read some of those answers live.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
What do you guys think? Loki, you're laughing over there. What is it?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Oh, Bobby.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
What? Oh, God. Bobby. Oh, God. Bobby.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Black Wolf says, Custer's Revenge.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
It was a forbidden love.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Are you trying to get this show canceled?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Bobby Black Wolf.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
That's not okay. That answer is, that is stricken from the list.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000
A Dark Sakura. I have a feeling I know where you might go with this, but I'm going to ask anyway.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Favorite romance in a game? Favorite romance story?

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Getting boned by Cullen on a table.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That's pretty romantic.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
For Dragon Age, right? Or Dragon Age Inquisition specifically.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:53.000
All the Garris romance. I mean, I like that our games these days, you know, give us the option for who we want to romance and how we want to romance them.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And then how much crying we want to do at the end when, I'm sorry, not Solas. I'm not going to talk about Dragon Age.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:11.000
But, you know, if you have your classic games where it was written into the story, there was, and I took it as a full on canon romance, was Selleys and Locke in Final Fantasy 6 slash 3.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000
You know what? My answer actually, it's funny you bring up the Final Fantasy series because my answer, not to totally cut you off, but I'm just piggybacking on it.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:28.000
My answer would be from Final Fantasy 4, Cecil and Rosa. I mean that, I mean, and that was like growing up as a kid when it was Final Fantasy 2 to me.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.000
That was like one of the first games I really remember having such a rich story. And I think that's why I'm so attached to it.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:43.000
But that, you know, love plot that went in between Cecil and Rosa, that's always going to be like, they're my, what do they call it? It's my original OTP. What do they call that?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
It's your OTP.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Yeah.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
One True Pairing.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:53.000
One True Pairing. That's it. That's my OTP. In video games, it's Cecil and Rosa. Sorry, Dr. Stalker, I didn't mean to cut you off. Did you have a further thought with what you were saying?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
See now the love theme is in my head from the Celtic Moon CD.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Oh, good call because that actually had a romance theme that went, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Yeah.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:12.000
The Celtic Moon version was wild cats sing the Final Fantasy 4 soundtrack.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And anywho, even though Final Fantasy 8 was not the best of games, I will say that it did like Leon and What's Your Fuck.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Actually, no, I'm going to take that back. I'm going to take that back. As much as I liked Rinoa, I really, really liked Mr. Annoying, Tidus, and Yuna.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Yeah.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Especially the reunion, if you got the good ending for 10-2, because what can I do for you?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
That was, you know, that was like the Final Fantasy series and a whole other cinematic level.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I bawled my freaking eyes out when I saw the ending.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Yeah.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And then like the whole, you know, the fact that she's going through the whole game based on having seen a glimpse that he might still be around.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:08.000
You know, it's just a thing that, you know, just because the person in your life is gone doesn't mean that you stop loving them.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
You know, for her and not all intents and purposes, he died.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Yeah.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:19.000
But that doesn't mean that you still might seek things that remind you of them or, you know, keep that memory alive for you.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And that was really what got me about 10-2.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000
You know, just riding this Final Fantasy wave because, you know, when the stories are done right, they're right.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:34.000
But I will say without, I mean, honestly, this is a how many year old game at this point. I have total license to spoil this game.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.000
But Final Fantasy 13, without saying too much, you know, and talking about, I said the relationships don't necessarily have to be romantic, right?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
What about the relationship between Lightning and her sister Sarah in that game?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Yeah, totally.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And then the ending of that game. And then I would argue in that game, and I've talked about, I've alluded to this before, but I didn't get into such spoiler territory.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I would say Fang and Vanille, if they weren't having a romantic relationship, they definitely had a deep love for each other.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And like all those, and then you have the Saz and his son, there's so many different love subplots in the game that like the ending of that game.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And I've said this before, the ending of Final Fantasy 13 specifically, I think because so many people poo-pooed that game because it was running down a giant hallway.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
A lot of people didn't get to the ending, but the ending for that game is short, but perfect.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I mean, it is, I love the ending. And it's also one of those cases where I think the US, where they actually put in the US music because they had the Leona Lewis song, was perfect.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
It really was. I love 13's ending.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.000
What about the type of, what's a good word I'm thinking of, dutiful love?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
A bromance.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Not a bromance. Where like Snake and Big Boss.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Oh, okay. Okay.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Or not Big Boss Snake and whoever, what was her name? God, I can't remember now.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:04.000
But I'd almost say that when you have someone that you look up to that much, it's a type of love all on its own.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:12.000
It goes beyond respect. It's almost like a parental love, if that makes sense.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000
You know, and funny enough, Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vonganetwork.com says, does it have to be male and female?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
The Japanese game makers then tend to sneak in some male on male stuff.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
No, I mean, you're asking a gay host of a video game podcast if it has to be male and female?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
No, I think love is all different types of forms and genders and everything.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I think you, not you, ActDeafed, I think that you actually missed me correcting myself.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
So, whatever.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
It's delayed, don't forget.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Yeah. Anyway, I'm just trying to think of, because I, the term bromance, I hate, and I'm going to stop and take a quick rant.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Oh, dear.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Quick rant.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I hate shipping in some cases, because they will take characters who have a very good, close friendship.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000
You know, I would even say that the friendship that borders on romantic or has romantic elements.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:18.000
But, you know, just because there are two characters who have that deep and abiding thing, they got to be fucking.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
No, they don't have to be.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
They don't have to be.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.000
It's because deep down inside, a lot of people really like porn, Dark Sakura.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And so, for some people.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
It's over sexualizing in society.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I know.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You know, two people.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Well, I mean.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
It doesn't take two people to over sexualize, though, either.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Well, I mean, I'm just saying, like, you know, there are even those deep friendships, you know, in our history, like Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And my brain is not working history right now, but they wrote themselves, wrote a wonderful loving letters back and forth.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Yet now people saying, were they lesbian lovers?

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
No.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
When did they meet up and scissor?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
That's what people want to know, right?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
No, I get it.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I get it.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Because by what you're saying, essentially, is that when people make these things about sex, it is invalidating that people can have a romantic relationship.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
A romantic relationship that doesn't involve sex.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Exactly. Exactly that.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I get it. I get it.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
And I mean, and there even is, you know, for like for the ace people out there, right?

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
You can the type of.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Well, it doesn't even have to be about like for me.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Sorry, it doesn't even have to be about asexuality.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I mean, it can be.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
But like, you know, like for I can love a woman and still be comfortably gay.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:49.000
No, I mean, my my point is not necessarily like even an ace person will have a person, you know, can have a person that they are deeply in love with, you know, like their romantic partner.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Right.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Even if they have no interest in sleeping with them, that's still a different thing than a romantic friendship.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Does that make sense?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Yeah.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
It's a different kind of romance.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Just because two people love each other, it doesn't mean that they want to be in an eternal relationship and cohabitate and, you know, look at adopting cats together.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000
But you know that Mario and Peach are fucking and toad watches, right?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
All right.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Anyway.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Pons006 in chat suggests bromance, Ken and Ryu.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
SSG100 Matt, interesting.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Top Gun was a dude movie back in the day.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Now people think that it's a gay themed movie.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Top Gun.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Thank you Cards Against Humanity for the sexually charged volleyball montage.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
You know what? That was around before Cards Against Humanity.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I know, I know, I know.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
All right.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
We didn't we didn't get an answer from Loki.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
What's your OTP for video games when it comes to romance and all that?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Probably the Heterolife partners of Sam and Max.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Because they're insane.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Of course, a Jay and Silent Bob style relationship.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Absolutely.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Heterolife mate.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I think that's awesome.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000
You got some laughs from our chat over there over at live.voggenetwork.com.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Sam and Max.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Or like, uh, Klonoa and Q-Pal.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
They were, you know, they were just, they were buds.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
They were buds.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
That's right.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
All right.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
There you go.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Our impromptu foogle question of the week there.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And I apologize to our fan communities there.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
But I will be more diligent about posting that in the future.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
When I'm not trying to multitask hopefully next week.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Or two weeks from now because there is no show next week.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Let's get back into some other news.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Loki.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
So apparently there is evidence that there is going to be a sequel to Knack coming out.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
And this is coming from...

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Why?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Because, I don't know.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
It's a first party title and they wanted to, you know, give it another shot.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Maybe, you know, more people like it now.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
You never know.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:03.000
But this is coming from a LinkedIn resume for Mindy Liang.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And she's an animator basically crediting different things she's worked on.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
So Knack 2 is listed there.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Animated 3D character motions and cutscenes for PlayStation 4.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Including a screenshot.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And so there's a screenshot of a Knack like character on fire.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So maybe that's something we're going to see.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:30.000
And hey, if you want to check out Knack it's only $8 right now on sale until the 15th I think.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
I'm really surprised they still haven't made that a PlayStation Plus game.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I'm surprised too.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And maybe they will.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Probably the month before Knack 2 comes out.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Well, I don't think the month before but maybe like if they announce it during E3 or something

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
they'll put it out for like, you know, free.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
To build hype a little bit.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Yeah, I mean it does.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I don't think it was a terrible game.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
It's just maybe not one people are necessarily interested in.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Maybe.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And who's to say they can't fix it?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Just because one game is bad doesn't mean the next one's going to be like terrible as well.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
That's true.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I mean there are other games out there where the first one maybe wasn't so great

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
and the second one greatly improved on it.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Of course I can't think of any in the moment but I know it's happened before in games where the sequel really...

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Well, okay.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Some would argue, I don't know if I necessarily agree with this, but some would argue Mega Man.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Mega Man 2 outshined the original in many different ways.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
But see, the difference is I don't think the original Mega Man was a bad game at all.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Dance Dance Revolution, Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Okay.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Or Beat Mania 2DX.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Only got better with Beat Mania 2DX way better than the original Beat Mania.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
So there are some games that age very well.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Oh, you never know.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Let's move on to somewhat of a sadder announcement.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
We have another gaming industry closure to talk about this week.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And that is the website GameTrailers.com closed its doors after 13 years this week.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Which, hmm, that means...

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
That's shitty.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
They also started in 2002.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
And we started in 2002.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And we outlived them.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Which I'm not saying that to be a bitch.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I'm just saying it's kind of humbling in a way.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
But yeah, Game Trailers unfortunately is shut down after 13 years.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And what was kind of shitty about it is that they were just told in the news the day it happened.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
They were given no notice.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Just that the lights went off, basically.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And so you had a lot of very confused people posting on Twitter.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Now, it should be noted, you know, Viacom sold it off a year ago.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And I think it went to a company that didn't really know what to do with it.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
So they kind of just ran it into the ground, unfortunately.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
That doesn't mean the people working there were pretty talented.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I distinctly remember as of recently, there's a clip going around from this past year's E3.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And it was from Game Trailer.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
And it was four individuals on the panel.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
One gal and three men.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
And it's kind of like a reaction video.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
They're reacting to the press conference and the Final Fantasy VII Remake.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I swear, all these dudes are breaking down and crying while the girl's kind of watching and laughing at them.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.000
They're crying at the Final Fantasy VII Remake and then Shenmue 3.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.000
And they're literally dancing and cheering and they're acting like kids.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
And I say that in a very positive way.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I think a lot of us were kind of feeling that watching that press conference this year.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So I just know that's a recent Game Trailers thing that they've done very recently that was very well received out there.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Unfortunately, one moment like that wasn't really enough to carry the website.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Especially when Game Trailers kind of founded itself on, well, providing Game Trailers.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
When there was no YouTube.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
When there wasn't really a way to get video on demand.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
When trailers weren't built into the damn consoles.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Unfortunately, Game Trailers didn't really evolve the way it needed to.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And they lost a lot of visitors as a result.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
But hopefully the talent there will be able to bounce back and find new work quickly.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Kind of shitty that they got no notice.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
They really got no explanation either.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
They're just kind of left to figure out what happened.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
DarkSagra.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Well, sorry.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
It's a deep word.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Yeah. Well, I was actually reading the email.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The FBI.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
They suck.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Well, and what I mean by suck is they actually suck at creating games.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Or whoever they hired to make the game sucked at making the game.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
So they made a game that's called Don't Be a Puppet.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And it's to encourage teens to think for themselves.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:52.000
And display a healthy skepticism as they come across anyone who appears to be advocating extremist violence.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000
But yeah, it's pretty much a crappy game you play as a goat.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And not a very well designed goat.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:07.000
So basically, the lesson learned from this game is hire a better designer or FBI.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
So basically, they are as good making video games as PETA.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Which is not very good because I've played the PETA game.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I actually have that on my Playstation 4 and it's fucking terrible.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
That's right! I forgot they put out a game on Playstation 4.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
It's fucking terrible.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I just remember like so super...

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Okay, because PETA is fucking terrible.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Super Tofu Boy and all that stuff that they do.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
But you're saying that their games may actually be of a better quality than the FBI's games?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Maybe.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Alright. Let's move on. Loki.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
So this is kind of cool. This is also from some tweets.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
They're talking about DLC. Not too far off for Fallout 4.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Probably something they're going to announce at E3.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
You know, a couple tweets from Bethesda Game Studios.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
We know you're ready to learn what's coming for Fallout 4 DLC.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
We're not far off and we think you'll be excited.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Which I'm assuming also E3.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Also, they're going to be doing a complete overhaul on the Fallout 4 survival mode.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Food, sleep, diseases, danger, and more.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
So that'll be a tweet that's coming out as well.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
They're also saying that there's going to be a $30 season pass.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
So it'll save you $10 on the DLC.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
So I'll be interested to see what it is.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I don't know. I played a lot more of it this week.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I'm down.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I definitely need to play some Fallout 4.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
You do.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I keep waiting for Alan to buy it.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Just get it on console. I mean, you play on PC.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I don't think that Dan's actually playing or a copy if you want to play the PS4 one.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Ooh, yeah. I'd totally be down with that.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I'll ask him if he can borrow it.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Sweet.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Then I don't have to pay for it. Awesome.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Alright. Let's talk about World of Warcraft, believe it or not.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:53.000
If you have yet to be sucked into the World of Warcraft, you may get your opportunity when you go to see the Warcraft movie.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Assuming you're going to go see the Warcraft movie.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
See, now here's the thing.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I figured most people that were going to go see the Warcraft movie were World of Warcraft players.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:10.000
But in order for this movie to be successful, they're going to need to do a good job of appealing to people who don't play World of Warcraft.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
How about the people that actually liked Warcraft?

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:20.000
There's people that see movies that don't read books for those said movies, so maybe it's not reading the book.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.000
And on top of that, I know a lot of people who hated World of Warcraft that love Warcraft and vice versa.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000
You can still love the lore and hate the game. For sure.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:39.000
But anyway, apparently Blizzard is considering offering World of Warcraft free for people that have their ticket stubs to the Warcraft movie.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:47.000
There's apparently a World of Warcraft Ultimate Movie Edition that will have the MMO and all expansions besides the newest one, Legion, that's not even out yet.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.000
That will be included at no cost and there will be one month of game time that will be free on the house.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Apparently it has been confirmed on Reddit. This is something that's going to happen when Warcraft hits theaters on June 10th.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:13.000
With World of Warcraft, Legion is supposed to be out before September 21st, but a lot of people are speculating they're going to launch Legion around the time of the movie to try to get the hype train rolling for Warcraft.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:23.000
But again, to reiterate, I think if they don't do a good job pushing this movie, it's a given that most hardcore Warcraft players are going to make time to see this movie.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000
But they need to be able to convince other people that aren't familiar with the source material to be able to see this and the movie is not going to be successful.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So it will be very interesting to see how they market it and so on.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:41.000
So it would make sense that if somebody who had no idea what Warcraft was about enjoys the movie, decides to play World of Warcraft.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And I said for a long time on Horde House, World of Warcraft, Summit version of it ought to be free anyway.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Yes, I'm aware of the one that they have where you can play up to level 20, but let's be real, you can't do shit up to level 20.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000
They should really just give base Warcraft away for free and do nothing but charge the subscription fee.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.000
If they want to keep gold spammers out or whatever, then fine, charge the subscription fee or whatever.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I don't understand why they're still charging for base Warcraft. I think the price of entry is too high.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Because people know they've got to buy the game and they've got to pay a monthly fee on top of it.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000
So this just makes logical sense to me. I don't know.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Alright. Let's move on. Oh, I want to mention this real quick too.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Blizzard also hit their 25 year anniversary this week, believe it or not.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Blizzard has been around for 25 years, so they celebrated that little birthday this week.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Congrats. Let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000
DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and picks the email she's going to read on air.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Got my tongs ready.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I was going to say last week I think we complained about not getting a lot of emails.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
We got quite the response because of it, right? We have a lot of emails tonight, right?

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Yeah.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Alright, let's get to it.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
This comes from Robert M. Again, this is likely a topic you've already covered in the announcement.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:11.000
But I am somewhat obsessive over the VoG network metagame and entering the podcast code words.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Though I freely admit I could be and should be doing more to participate beyond that.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Since the program started, two shows whose codes are tracked on the site,

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
USL and Hoard House, have sunsetted.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Will any of the new shows be using the password system?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Not, of course, that I would make that my sole reason to subscribe or not subscribe to any of VoG's podcasts.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Great question. Admittedly, any show on VoG is able to do this.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.000
And I think it's just been a while before we've kind of approached the shows going who's on board and who wants to do this.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.000
So I don't really have a definitive answer for you on that now.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000
But we probably are going to re approach the shows in the network and say, hey, who's interested in doing it?

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And then take it from there. So we'll see who signs on for that.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I think the gamification is fun and it's part of what makes VoG a little different.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:10.000
And, you know, yeah, and I agree, it kind of stinks that two of the shows that were doing it have unfortunately sunsetted for various reasons.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000
But it happens. VoG has been around for a few years now, so shows are going to come and shows are going to go.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
So I hope to have an update for you on that in the future.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
But at this time with the new shows, there's nothing yet.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I will say, though, that the new shows are all three of them going to premiere on VoG network.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
You hear them here first before they actually hit the podcast feed.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So be ready for it.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Good morning, which is not morning for us, but oh well.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.000
When the weather is stagnant in the Salt Lake City valley for a lengthy amount of time, air pollution that is emitted from many various resources has no way of clearing out.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:58.000
As a result, the air pollution congregates, accumulates and just plain sits in the air above the valley, eventually creating what is called an inversion, which is a cute way of saying smog.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
By the way, the title of this is God damn it, I'm a video game.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:10.000
When these small conditions exist, not only is the sky overcast in a way that is visually depressing, a light haze settles in near the ground.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:19.000
This isn't like the fog that you'd see in London, but the kind of like the light haze you see in certain survival horror video games franchise,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.000
developed by a certain company that has earned much scorn for its preference of slot machines over Snake.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000
On Wednesday morning, such conditions existed in the Salt Lake Valley.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:36.000
On Wednesday morning, I looked out of my window and thought to myself, if I hear a high pitched whale come out of my radio, I'm getting the fuck out of here.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Has this ever happened to you? Have you ever looked around at whatever environment you find yourself in and thought, God damn it, I'm in a video game.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Stay black or entertainment.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And don't you know, if you hear the whale on the radio, it's already too late. You're not getting out.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Just beware of the sirens.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I was going to say, there are definitely places that remind me of scary video games and Silent Hill.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.000
And I've even texted Shane before. I think I'm in Silent Hill right now. Like I've sent him texts like that.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I do that all the time. So yeah.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Now when, this is before Silent Hill was out, but I mean, what was funny is that when I lived in Alabama,

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:18.000
we had this little Grove that was outside the dorms and it would get super foggy and we'd play hide and seek in the fog, which is pretty fun.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:25.000
The first time I saw Silent Hill, I was like, Oh, Hey, it's like when I was in college. So it was sort of the reverse for that.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Anyway. So moving forward, this is from...

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I'll just say though, until I see the world in pixels, though, I don't think I'm ever going to say I think I'm in Minecraft.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I don't think that's one that's ever going to come to mind.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
So this is from AZHP. It's kind of long.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Hey, well, our crew AZHP here. I haven't been writing in lately because I've listened to every episode.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Just wanted to let you know that even though we quiet people don't say anything, we're here and we listen.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Smiley!

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Appreciate it. I know that's true. Thank you.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:06.000
So several years ago, there was an indie film called The FP, which revolved around post-apocalyptic Frasier Park.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
No, I know what they're talking about.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
He talked about that movie on a show.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
I haven't watched it though.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.000
A tiny burb just north of the grapevine on I-5 in California.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
And the turf wars over the only liquor store in town.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000
What made the movie special was that the turf wars were fought using the ancient sport of beat beat revelation.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000
All of my DDR friends and even some of the people who never touched a dance pad in their life loved the movie.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
It was really well written for the tiny budget they had and we all wanted to see more.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Apparently the creator also wanted to see more because the film was a flop financially.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Though a cult success among the nichest of video game players, he's had to do random movie gigs just to stay afloat these last few years.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:00.000
But DDR and the FP was his passion and he really wants to see his new script be made reality and I want to help him do it.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:07.000
He started an Indiegogo campaign to raise the money to make this movie the best star movie about smashy arrows it can possibly be.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
As indies who got your start with DDR as well.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I hope you all can sympathize with an indie visionary's plight and help spread the word.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:24.000
You can find the campaign by searching for Beats of Rage The FP Part 2 on Google.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:34.000
And if you have never heard of the original movie before the FP can be rented on Amazon video for just four dollars or bought on Amazon or iTunes for 10.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000
You have plenty of time to you'll have plenty of time to see if you enjoy the original movie before kicking in for the new one.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000
As of this writing February 11th there are two months left in the campaign.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:52.000
The creator's brother was actually the cinematographer for quite a few Hollywood productions like Nick Cage's Ghost Rider.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000
So the actual filmography is pretty darn good. It's definitely a good weekend slash sorry weekend drinking slash party movie.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.000
So grab Shane and a few bottles of wine and make an I don't think you'll regret it.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:11.000
You OK. Side note. Yeah. I found the bottle of shining Blanc that you gave me years ago and I opened it.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Did you drink it was still delicious. It's in my fridge right now. That's awesome. OK.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Anyway I hope you don't mind me asking you to spread the word on this movie.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I've had annual viewings of this movie at my house for the last years a few years and we've never we never get tired of it.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I don't have any stake in this financially. I just really love this movie and DDR and want to see a new movie come out of it.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Sorry for the long email and thanks for reading. Once again you can find the campaign by searching for beats of rage the FP part 2 on Google.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
And there's the URL which I will copy into the chat room. Yours truly is HP.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:53.000
P.S. I listen to your podcast in my new cart and for some reason it tries to override album art with whatever it finds when it searches for the artist's name of its album art database.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Here's what it gives me whenever I put an in line image.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I'll let Rob paint a picture with his words but like to imagine this is what you all look like when you record this podcast.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
If you scroll down you can see the attachment that has the image and I did look at it.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I was like what the hell? Which is weird because we put album art inside every episode.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I have to do that manually in iTunes so I forget once in a great while but usually the album art should be in there.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:27.000
So it's weird that you're I'd be curious what you're using to listen to podcasts because I wonder why it's still going out to get album art even though we put it in there.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.000
That's weird. Anyway real quick though about the movie. That's awesome that you have the passion for that and you know what?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:41.000
It's expensive enough to do the podcast that we do. I can only imagine how expensive and how excruciating it is to do a movie.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:47.000
So I'll say this much. I don't know how accessible those guys are but I'll email them and see if we can get them on the show.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I think they'll be hilarious. We'll talk DDR stories. See what happens. I'll let you know.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Okay well I also put the link in the chatroom. I couldn't get the image up but I'll just look at it later.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
It's okay.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Come on there we go. So this one's labeled commercials.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Okay.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Does the email get a load? And it's by YYR.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Yay.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Hello LR. In last week's and last episode's kickoff topic you guys discussed video game commercials once again.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000
My favorite of these is actually little known and generally not well remembered.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I can't remember if these ran on Saturday mornings or weekend afternoons but back in the days of the NES I saw this ad several times.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000
It was for a game I'd never heard of anywhere else called Mendel Palace.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000
The game was developed by Game Freak, the same Game Freak that would later develop Pokemon, and published in North America by Hudson Soft.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Its advertisement was different from most others you might remember. Around ten whole seconds of it consisted of gameplay footage.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I never understood why so many video game ads over the years showed little or no footage of actual gameplay from the games they were supposedly advertising.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Because usually they look like shit on TV. But I remember this ad actually. I remember Mendel Palace.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Sega's ads for Dreamcast games were absolutely awful in this regard. Most ads contained only a few seconds of footage or less.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.000
On the other hand, Mendel Palace looked so interesting to me that I specifically sought it out.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.000
All these years later it has remained one of my favorite NES games of all time.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.000
It's a sort of action puzzle game where you need to eliminate the enemies on the screen to move forward.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And the enemies come in many different types.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Similarly to Bubble Bobble, but with a different style of action.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys arcade style action games and I hope some of you check it out.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And there's a link to the commercial which I will put in the chat room as well.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I suppose I haven't mentioned it previously, but multitasking is now out on Xbox Live Indie games.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Next stop, Steam Greenlight, and I hope to be on there by MAGFest.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Well I know what I'm gonna buy soon.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Alright, I know what I'm doing later.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Oh, and the new yyrgames.com has launched.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Go there and play Pixel Poops if you want to be on the brand new Super Poopers leaderboard.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Super Pooper, Taco Bell's gonna blind me. I don't know, that's all I got.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
By the way, did you see the thing that I linked you?

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Yes, I did.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
That was pretty cool.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Anyway.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Okay, to tell people.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Which literally none of the listeners know what you're talking about.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.000
There's a singer who has a big band orchestra that covers popular hits.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000
But he sings like the old 20s and 30s style warbler, so it's pretty cool.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
It was a little weird, but it was cool.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000
It's like Max something. Anyway, I'll look up later. For all of y'all.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I will mention that I was asked whether I wanted to be notified if a spot opened up in the MAGFest Indie Showcase at the last second.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I said yes, but at this point I'm assuming I will not be a part of it.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Despite this, I hope to see some of you at MAGFest anyway.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:44.000
It's a fantastic experience, and if I don't get to show games, it just means I'll have more time to play them.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Happy Valentine's Day, and have fun. Aaron Yyr.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Well, thank you very much for the email.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I look forward to seeing you at MAGFest, for sure.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I don't even think my Xbox 360 is hooked up right now.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I really wish Indie Games somehow was backwards compatible on Xbox One.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I know I'm asking for a lot, but whatever.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
That's exciting, though, about the Steam Greenlight.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
I'll be looking for that.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Okay, we have one more email.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Alrighty.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Okay. Hello, OLR. This email is addressed to Rob in reactions to what he said last week.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
In regards to what he said last week.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:30.000
This concerns what I can honestly say is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever happened upon, and that is Undertale.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Yeah, I know, I hear his eyes rolling already.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Wait a minute, did I bag on Undertale last week?

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
I don't know.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I don't remember doing that.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
I don't remember you doing that either.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Oh, you know what? Maybe I referenced, you bought it for me on Steam and I still haven't played it.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
But that doesn't mean I'm rolling my eyes.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Just to be clear, I just haven't played it.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000
But really, please give the game a chance and I know you'll fall in love with it.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:59.000
The characters in the game have a way of making you feel attached to them in a way that made it hard for me to even consider a genocide run.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
This is why I'm doing it on a different computer.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
And your interactions with them break the fourth wall like the Hymen of Zeus.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Okay.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
What?

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
The gameplay is addicting and just a lot of fun.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Most importantly, the story. I'm not going to spoil anything, of course.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:23.000
I just want to state this game uses a particular method of storytelling at one point of the game that caught me off guard completely, and it moved me to tears.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.000
In fact, the game as a whole did it multiple times.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Please, I'd be so happy to hear your thoughts on it in a future OLR episode.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
What if I hate it? You're not going to be happy to hear it.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I don't think you'll hate it.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I don't think I will either.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Undertale is something special that I'm not going to forget for the rest of my life.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Sincerely, Garth Wolf.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.000
P.S. Have a Valentine's Day fursuit photo of myself. Have a good one.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
What?

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Yeah, there's a picture attached where he's wearing the whole...

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
If it'll load.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
If it'll load. Attachments are not working for Dark Sakura today.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
No.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000
It was just...

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
There we go.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
It was him being a fursuit.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I keep wanting to say theme park character, but is that an insult?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I don't want to be insulting.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Mascot.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Alright.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Mascot sitting on a park, just chilling on a park bench.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.000
I love, I love, I love furries. I really do.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
You know somebody's going to cut that out and use that against you someday, right?

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Fuck them, then. I don't care.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I love, well, especially furry cosplayers.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
People who take the time to make their fursuits like that.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
It's a lot of craftsmanship.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
You know what? I will say this.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000
I realize that that whole scene gets their shit and all that stuff,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000
but I will say they are dedicated to their craft,

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
and the cosplay that, you know, they pull off is pretty fucking impressive

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000
when you realize they are not Disney or a theme park operating company

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
that just can, you know, crank these suits out in a factory like they make them.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
So I'll give you that.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I'll tell you this. If you kind of want to have an idea of what goes into

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
making a fursuit, there's actually an episode of How It's Made

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
where someone makes like a game mascot,

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000
and they go into like how the entire body of it is stitched.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
How they keep them cool enough is what I want to know.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Because those things look hot.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Sometimes they put fans in them.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Some do put fans in them, but I've also seen some that have like

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
ventilation built in at key places.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
And then there's like, I call them the hybrid fursuits

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
where people will do like the appendages and whatnot,

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
like another type of anthermorph, so.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
And well done. I really, really, really dig your fursona.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
And I will play, and I'm getting yelled at by Act Deft in chat, too.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Play Undertale. I will. I just, you know how it goes.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000
When Alan's home from work, we want to just chill in Diablo III.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000
So I will get around to it. I will.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
But not this week, because I'm going to MAGFest.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Unless somebody makes me play it at MAGFest, which might happen.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000
I don't know. Do they have the whole...

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I'm going to ask SSGA 100 Matt.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Black Wolf says Undertale and chill, maybe.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Do they at MAGFest, do they just have like places where you have

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
like old school Nintendo Entertainment Systems

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
and you can like rent games? Like they have at PAX.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Because that was some of the most fun I had at PAX East last year,

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
was like, what the hell do you mean, Bobby Black Wolf?

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
You haven't played the Guardian Legend.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
We are fucking fixing this right the fuck now.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
We marched into that room and checked out Guardian Legend

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
and had a good time just playing that.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
I hope they have some of that at MAGFest.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Oh, thank God. Everybody's telling me yes. Yay. I'm so excited.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Okay, that's happening then.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Yay. Dan and I may sit through and have me make him sit down and play through the Guardian Legend.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Oh, good.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Because he's never beaten it.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
You should stream that or something. It'll be fun.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I have beaten the shit out of that game. I can't do it anymore.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
It's hard. It's a hard game.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
It is.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Let's see. AkumaJP in chat is asking naked pics from fans.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Um, no.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
No.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I... Yeah, let's keep it professional.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Unless you're really hot.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
No.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Keep that in your trousers.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Direct message me on Twitter.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Is that it for email tonight?

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
This is the place to send emails.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Every week we get a little bit angsty on this show.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Because, rawr.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
This is bad.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Here is justice.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Here is punishment.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Here...

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
This is fucked up.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
FU to making a valve with a situation.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Um, I made a valve that I was gonna, for everything that I was gonna cook,

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I wasn't gonna go out and buy anything new.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I was gonna use this in the fridge, right?

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
You know, I've got frozen vegetables.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I have konnyaku. I have noodles.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I have different stuff.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And then I realized this morning

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
when I went to go fix coffee

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
and use the last of it, I'm not a creamer.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
So I have to go buy creamer.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
So it's just stupid.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000
It's not like I can drink Irish cream before, you know, work every day.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I mean, I could.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
But I would not.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Because I don't want to, you know, be a drunk driver.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I wouldn't be drunk either, but you know what I mean.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I know what you mean.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Setting a bad example.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
It's all about you.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
And also in FU, to me having missed the FUs

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
for this whole past schedule of mine,

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I go back to closing shift again,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.000
the week of the 20th?

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
March 20th?

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Oh, March 20th.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
So we still have a few shows of early Dark Soccer departures.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Yeah.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
But it's gonna be nice to be back on a Monday through Friday again

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.000
and not have, you know, my days off split.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Not tonight because of the holiday.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Yeah. Well, tomorrow I requested off and I got off.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Cool.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
And yeah, I missed having two days in a row.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
It's really hard to feel rested with one day

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
and then having to go right back to work.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
It doesn't feel like I have any real gap in my week.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
So nice.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Very happy.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
All right.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Loki, your FU of the week.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
My FU to my ankle for still hurting

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
from me stepping on it funny

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
when I was playing Ingress and FU to my arm

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
for hurting for, I don't know,

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I must have slept on it weird, but it's hurt,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
it's been hurting for two weeks now and I can't like

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
move it in certain directions, which is weird.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
But, but,

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
you know, one of my previous FUs

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
has been FU to Red Bull for not

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
getting me my free Red Bull, but I finally got

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
my fucking free Red Bull.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
So I'm happy about that.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Finally got that sweet,

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
sweet settlement Red Bull.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
The taste of an agreement.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Which, by the way, I registered

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
for myself and for my wife.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
So she's like, why did I get one in the box

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
with my name on it too? Because I wanted two of them!

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Is why.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
I can't just see

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
that conversation between you and Nelly too.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
All right, my FU of the week.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Honestly, I don't have a lot to be

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
angsty about because I've had a pretty good week.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
I will say this, FU to the fact that

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
every time I host Rocky, which I did

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
last night, I managed to throw out my voice.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Although I'm doing pretty good through

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
today's show, but like last night,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
like this morning, I couldn't talk.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Like Alan said, good morning,

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
and I said, I couldn't

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
talk. Thankfully, thanks to

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
hot liquids and drinking a lot of water today,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I have my voice back. But FU to the fact

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
that I don't know how to not

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
throw my voice out at Rocky and I need to stop

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
yelling as loud as I do

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
and throwing out my voice. But the show was really

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
great last night. If you're local

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
and you weren't there, you missed it.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says he squawked

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
like a goose. I really did. It was

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I couldn't talk. It was scary.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
It was scary. Can you imagine if I

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
lost my voice, like for a long time?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Oh my god, what would I do

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
with myself? I would be able to podcast.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I would be able to teach.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Oh my god.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I guess I'd finally play games like Undertale

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
because I have nothing else to do.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Alright, just a couple more

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
But first, Loki.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Alright, so Minecraft Windows 10 edition

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
is getting yet another update. They're finally

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
getting closer to being like the PC version.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
So with this,

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
they've gotten some more updates

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
to the Redstone stuff. So for example,

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
different mechanical contraptions

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
you can make. The

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
compactors, repeaters, suspencers, droppers,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
hoppers, trap chests,

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
etc. are now available to build.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Also, they added witches

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
and item frames.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
So those are available for the Pocket edition and

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Windows 10 beta edition as well.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Slime Blocks, wearable pumpkins,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
and Red Sandstone

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
have been added, as well as

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
chicken jockey mobs.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I still haven't seen that yet.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Awesome.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I can't wait to check that out.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I guess eight more achievements

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
as well.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Alright, I'll have to check that out.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
It runs really well, I think.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Oh yeah, I've played it on Windows 10 before

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
and I love that you can see

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
it endlessly in that game.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
I mean, it renders the new areas

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
so fast.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I know that they have all those different

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Sonic Ether, really awesome

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
shaders and stuff for it.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
That's what I wanted the PlayStation 4

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
and Xbox One versions to have.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Keep it the blocky stuff,

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
but make it look extra nice.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
And maybe do the water differently.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
But unfortunately,

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
that's not what we got.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Minecraft 2, I guess.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Unfortunately, tonight, in the Department of

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Things We Didn't Fucking Ask For,

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
somebody,

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
somebody, Dark Soccer laughed at that,

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
somebody has recreated

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
the Nintendo Classic

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
game, I use that term very loosely,

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
because you all know how I feel about this game.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Somebody has created the Nintendo game

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Duck Hunt in VR.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
And the criminal responsible

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
for this is Joseph Delgado,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
who actually did this during

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
the Global Game Jam

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
2016 last month.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
And I say this very

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
tongue-in-cheek, because I'm just not a fan of Duck Hunt,

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
but honestly, this guy did something

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I can't do, so I'm just saying that tongue-in-cheek.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Awesome work, dude.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
He is actually studying computer science at

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
And

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
he built the game in a single

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
day, and then he uploaded what he did

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
in his YouTube channel, and it actually

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
kind of like, you see the little orange

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
gun kind of floating in space that you

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
kind of use, and then the

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
ducks, and it's almost like you're actually in the

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
environment, and you can like look around and see

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
that little shitty dog and everything else.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
He also made a game

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
oh, I'm sorry, he actually put in the Game C

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
minigame where you can shoot the little

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
clay pigeons and all that stuff.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
The game is planned to be released for

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
free for the HTC Vive VR

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
platform when that comes out in April.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
But that is, of course,

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
hoping that Nintendo

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
is not going to do anything to shut it down.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Although, when I looked at it, I mean,

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
yeah, okay, it's really similar and has a lot of

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
the same stuff, but if Nintendo wanted him

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
to shut it down, I'm pretty sure he could just change

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
some of the sprite art, and it would

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I don't know, if he's willing to do it, we'll see.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Who knows.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Bobby Blackwolf saying,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
someone did this early on

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
in the DK1 lifespan, it just

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
didn't make the news sites. Maybe,

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I'm assuming this one did because it came out of a

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
game jam, so maybe it was kind of faster.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I don't know.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I don't know with the DK1 if

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
they really had good controller support

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
as far as using the actual

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
controllers that they have

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
to manipulate

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
stuff in space.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I mean, that's what it has on there. It looks kind of cool.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
The floating gun and everything.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
says, now everyone can have that dog

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
laugh at them in VR.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Tigerclaw says, I can never play a game

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
like Duck Hunt. Ducks are cute and stuff.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Why would you want to kill them?

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
And my favorite, SSJ100

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
of course, something this crappy

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
would come from New Jersey.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
That's not nice.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
It doesn't look bad. I think it looks pretty cool.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Okay, that was funny though.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Sorry to any of our New Jersey people listening,

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
but you know, just tongue in cheek.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
It's funny. Alright. I'd play it.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Yeah, I mean, as much

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
as I hate on Duck Hunt here

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
on the show, you guys know it's a little bit of an in-joke.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I would check it out just for laughs, but

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
again, we don't need to shoehorn

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
everything into VR, okay?

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Totally cool with new

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
VR experiences, but this

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
guy's a student. It's part of a

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
game jam. Scenario's a little

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
different here. I think it's okay. Alright.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Let's get into

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
the Skype line tonight.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
We're going to take your calls. OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
All one word on Skype. Old school.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
1877 game OLR.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
While we wait for some calls, I should say.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Do we have any last minute stories here over from Loki?

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
No.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
What?

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Sorry. There's something going on.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Alright. Well, we'll see if we get any calls then.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Again, that's OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word on

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Skype. TigerClaw on chat

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
says, what if they recreated Super Metroid

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
in VR? Do you think that draws the line?

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Yes, because

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
It wouldn't be the same game. It would not be the same game

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
whatsoever. I mean, a game

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
like Metroid Prime

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
might work a little better in VR.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
But even then, I'm like, you know,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
these experiences weren't really created

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
for VR. So I'm just

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
It's kind of like when you see the movies that were

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
like converted into 3D

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
post-production. It can be really

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
hit and miss. I'm sure there's going to be

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
something out there that gets converted for

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
VR that works out pretty well. But

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
I just don't really have an

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
interest in trying to shoehorn classics

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
into VR. Now, if Nintendo

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
one day was like, we're going to make a

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Metroid game for VR. And I don't

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
fucking know why they do that. But if they

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
did it, I would be like, okay,

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
fuck yeah, let's check this out. How cool

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
is this going to be? But I just

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
don't really see that happening unless the

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
NX is going to adopt VR. I do have a couple things.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
So first off,

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
according to NECA Toys,

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
they're saying that Sony is bringing back

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Crash Bandicoot

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
because I guess they would have some sort of in on

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
that. Meaning that, you know, they'd be

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
making toys for it.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Also, apparently

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
they're bringing back that really shitty

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
PC gaming show to

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
E3 again. Which I will not

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
watch this time. Oh. I didn't realize

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
that was happening. Interesting.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Yes. When did they do that? That was like a... It was

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
a live broadcasting. It was like three

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
hours long or something. When did they do that?

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
It was so fucking boring. Was that the

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
second night? Not even the first night? I don't know.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
But this time it's supposed to be June 13th

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
at noon.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Oh.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I don't know what the... I don't know.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
It was so boring last time. I am not

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
watching that thing.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Oh. Did they snag the

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
EA spot? I bet

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
that's what it is. They probably

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
took the spot that would have usually been EA.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Yeah. It was just a big advertisement

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
fest last time. I mean,

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
no thank you. I'm not gonna

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
watch it. I think they showed like a new Heroes

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
of the Storm map. There was like a couple little things

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
here and there, but it wasn't a lot.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
S200Matt says, oh, that

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
was a PC show. God, that was a waste of time.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
People really thought they were gonna announce

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Half-Life 3 during it. Hey, you know what?

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
If they did announce Half-Life 3

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
this year, no one is ever gonna bag on that show

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
again. I'm just saying.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I'm just throwing it out there. They wouldn't...

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Yeah, it wouldn't be done at that show.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And I would think if you're gonna launch

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
or do Half-Life 3

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
that it would be console as well.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Honestly, I think that they would wanna capitalize

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
on as many people as possible

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
on that. Yeah, I agree.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
I think Half-Life 3 will ultimately be console

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
as well. Even though they might do like a

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
It's On Steam first

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
because they can. Oh yeah, I can see that.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
We'll see. Anyway,

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
putting out one more call for calls.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Skype if you wanna give us a call.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Otherwise, I do wanna remind our podcast listeners

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
the show is probably gonna feel a little short this week.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
We did get a 30 minute late start tonight

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
because we did the special announcement

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
show live at the Boyziques Network, so that's why if

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
things seem a little shorter tonight, well, they were.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
But it is already, believe it or not, 9 o'clock

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
on the West Coast.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Again, there is gonna be no live OLR

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
next week because I'll be at MAGFest.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Although, and it sounds like Loki and Dark Soccer

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
are gonna have a ball without me here

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
going to see Dead School and playing Egress. We'll see.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
We'll see what happens. We'll see.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
But I will be at MAGFest.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I will be tweeting.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I really, you know, I've been putting together

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
the guidebook app, the things I wanna do.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
And I have left myself a lot of free time.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
But I did find, surprisingly, there is

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
a lot I wanna see, so I'm just

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
irritated that I didn't realize MAGFest

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
started as early as it did. When they said it was

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Thursday through Sunday, I thought

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
that meant like Thursday night. But it actually

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
meant like, it actually starts at like 2 o'clock

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
on Thursday or something like that. It starts like really

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
early. And I don't

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
even get into DC until 3

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
or 4 o'clock local time on

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Thursday, so I'm gonna miss

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
a little bit. But as long as I don't miss the VCR

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
clue thing, that's why I'm praying

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
my flight doesn't get delayed because I'll be so mad.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
So mad if that happens.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Alright.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And Bobby Blackwolf

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
is saying follow him on Twitter

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
with the hashtag RoadToMAGFest

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
and you can

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
check that out over on

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Twitter. He'll be posting about that

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
as he's going to MAGFest.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Our phone is ringing, so

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
let's get to it. We're gonna go to the phones

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Who's this? Hi, it's

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Derek H. First time listener,

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
long time listener.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
First time listener, long time

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
listener. Derek,

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
it has been a very long time, my friend.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
How are you?

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I've been better. I've been worse.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
You know what? I was about to

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
ask how you guys are doing, but

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
listening to the show, I can tell you're doing awesome.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Congratulations on another

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
great Rocky Horror Picture show. I probably

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
will never see it because

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
you're not across the street from

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
me, but I know that I'm

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
missing something good. Thank you very much.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
I appreciate that. They do some showings in L.A.,

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
but it's different no matter where you go.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
But how are you, my friend?

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
What do we owe this phone call tonight?

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I was listening to the show and I heard

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
the call. You said, call in.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
So I was like, I don't think I've called

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
into Orange Lawn's Radio in a while. I will

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
call in because I actually would like to

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I would like your guys' take on

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
something that I've been mulling

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
over

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
for the past few weeks now.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Okay.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
This mini

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
PC deal that's going on

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
where you can get a full-fledged

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
PC. At first it was

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
the Raspberry Pi

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
for $35.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
And I was

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I want one, but I was able to say

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
nah, what can I really do with it?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
But you can do a lot of stuff with it, but still

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I was like, yeah, it's a toy.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And then the Kangaroo

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
PC came out. That's $99

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
and you can do whatever you want with it.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Play games and everything.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
And it's kind of getting hard for me

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
to

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
dismiss it like I had before.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
And even worse

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
it's hard for me to justify

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
spending any money on my

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
big, giant, old-fashioned, stupid

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
computer now. When I looked

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I was like, well

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
there's one that does like 90% of this stuff

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
for $100.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
And I spend that much on

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
a mouse.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Isn't it amazing

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
how technology

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper?

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Well there's that one that they included with a magazine

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
too.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
They had like a whole PC that was with a magazine.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
That's right, they had like a magazine they were selling

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
and it was like the little, like back in my day

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
it was a demo disc for PlayStation

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
games and now it's like, oh hey,

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
now you get a whole freaking PC

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
included with the magazine.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
That stuff is crazy, but you know

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
when we talk about this kind of stuff

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
I'm reminded of, I remember

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
a few years ago, when I say a few years ago

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I'm talking like 10 years ago, I remember when

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
like the Mac Mini had first come out

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
and that was like, hey, you have

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
this kind of like, for all practical purposes

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
bare bones computer that's

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
a cheaper price. Now granted

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
you know, it was the Apple, still the

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Apple premium Mercedes Benz

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
brand and all that stuff, so it's not like we're talking about

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
$99, but it was still that

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
whole, hey we're going to strip out a lot of the fluff

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
and do this very like bare bones PC.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
So, I don't know, I mean a lot of

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
this stuff is,

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
it's not surprising necessarily

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
but it is just fascinating

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
like how much more we can do with it.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
You know, I know a lot of people

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
get those Raspberry Pis because you can

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
install emulators and play

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
games for days on there.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I actually have a project right now because

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
I have a non-functional

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Mac SE

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
that I'm going to put

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
a Raspberry Pi in and a small

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
LCD monitor and

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
just use it as you know, a little

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
emulator.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Crazy. I think

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
the whole, I think phones

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
have kind of opened people's eyes

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
to what they really need

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
a computer for because I remember

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
when I was

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
back in the good old days when I was young

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
we would look at laptops

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
and say well, laptops are okay but

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
if you want a real computer to do real

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
stuff then you need a real computer.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
And then laptops got more and more

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
powerful and then tablets came out

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
and was like, well tablets are okay

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
but if you need a real computer you need at least a

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
laptop. And now people are

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I see a number of people

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
plugging

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Bluetooth keyboards into their

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
phones and they're like, well

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
it does everything I need it to do.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
And I think that's kind of

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
opened people's eyes to say, I

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
don't really need one of these

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
big honking dinosaur computers

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
when everything I need

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
is in this

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
can fit in the palm of my hand. So why am I

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
spending $2,000

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
$2,000, $1,500 on a

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
computer when I don't have to.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
You know what's interesting about all this

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Derek is that, and I feel like it's

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
actually, I feel in a way even though

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
this is going to kind of sound cold but it's not

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
because I'm in the same boat. But I

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
think it's a sign that we're just getting old.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Because we remember

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
the way computers were when we

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
were younger. It's funny because somebody's making a joke in chat.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Tiger Claw says, remember the days when a

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
computer magazine would have codes you type in a basic

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
to run some program. Yes, I love those

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
things. I want those things to come back.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Right, me too. It's like I love that stuff.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
But the reality is it's like you think

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
about now what teenagers

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
and kids today are growing up

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
with. See the difference here is we have

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
different expectations of what a computer

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
should be. Kids that are growing up

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
today it's like they get cell phones

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
when they're like 10 years old

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
and they have this completely different perception

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
of what technology is and how

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
technology affects their lives.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
I remember when technology was

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
like an enrichment class you took in high

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
school. It was not something that was necessarily

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
mandatory or what have you. It was

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
like you know maybe you had basic

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
word processing skills or whatever but

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
like computer skills were an elective.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
They weren't a necessity. That is so not the

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
case today. So I just, the reason

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
why I bring that up is I just think it's funny

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
when we talk about like our perception of

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
what is a computer? What is

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
technology? And what you know what do

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I take with me on the go? What do I have

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
in my living room? It's changing. It's

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
changing by the year.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
And now we're on this verge of VR.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
How is that going to change things?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I mean maybe it'll end up being nothing

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
like it was in the 90s. But I

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
don't know. I was around with that

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
first VR and trust me

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
you guys aren't missing nothing.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
But it was

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
kind of shitty then and now it's

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
it's come a long way. It really has.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
I don't know. You know and

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I've said this on the show before. If

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
VR has its Wii Sports

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
it's going to do huge.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
But if they don't have that must have thing

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
it'll be another flash in the pan.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
And when was the last time you got

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
well you guys are, well I don't know

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
when was the last time you guys played one of those

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
motion control games that were all the rage

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
a few years ago that were gonna

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
revolutionize

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
and revitalize

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
the industry. They're all gone.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
They were the flash

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
in the pan. I got a feeling

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
VR is gonna be huge for

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
six to eight months

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
and then people are gonna say yeah no

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
give me 4K. Well

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
for what it's worth I did just play Just Dance

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
2014 earlier this week. But I

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
realized I'm the exception to the rule.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
It's not really for everybody.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
And I totally get that point. And it's you know

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I think with a lot of those

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
motion games it kind of became the same thing over

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
and over and it didn't evolve.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
And as we were talking about earlier tonight

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
with the unfortunate closure of game

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
trailers if things don't evolve

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
they're not gonna necessarily

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
make it sometimes. And so VR is

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
gonna need that too. Anything.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Unfortunate. I laugh at that.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Look we

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
both run the same thing.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
VOG and along with all games we

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
outlasted them. Screw those

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
people.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
What do you call it? The establishment

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
where there are big giant companies behind

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
them. Independent networking.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
That's what it's all about.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I'm with you and we're I mean not

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
to sound all ego-y but we're the

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
people putting them out of business. Not you and I

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
specifically. No you and I.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
You, me, Black Wolf.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
There are

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
people at the

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
unemployment line because of us.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
And I say more power to them.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
I'll double that number if I could.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Even worse their unemployment

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
line is monitored by

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Bea Arthur like in History of the World

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
part one.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
It's my wine break.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Derek it is

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
so good to hear from you here at OLR.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I know you're working on various projects.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
You wanna drop a few quick plugs before I let you go?

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
I will drop one plug

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
and one plug only because

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
I don't wanna over

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
stay my welcome. My one plug

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
is AllGames.com

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Look we're all one big happy

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
family. We may be estranged

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
but I still see everybody

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
as one big happy family. We're fighting

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
against demand. We're keeping

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
independent podcasting alive.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
You don't have to be a big time

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
comedian or a

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
pop star or have a talk show

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
on TV to have a podcast.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
We can do it still. We don't need

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
big giant companies behind us.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
OLR, Bobby Black Wolf Show,

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Electric Sisterhood,

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Dead Pixel Live,

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Bomb Submitted, R9cast.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
We're all in this together

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
and by that I will say just please

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
go to not only vognetwork.com

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
just remember to

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
click over on AllGames.com

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
also. I will cosign what you

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
just said Derek. You're always welcome here at

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
OLR. Oh thank you.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
I'll give everybody a big hug.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Alright sounds good. Have a good one Derek.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Thanks so much for the call. Bye guys.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Take care my friend.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
I'm surprised. Derek, I don't think

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
he's been on this show since we were over

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
at AllGames and that was a while ago

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
at this point. That was 22.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Or 2012, 22.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
In the year 22. You know

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
right after all the Jesus stuff.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
But anyway.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
No in all seriousness I cosigned what he said.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
That's why I don't sit here on this show

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
and bash other indie podcasters.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
And I know for some people that's what they

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
do is they like to do drama.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Stir the pot on and stuff. I don't like

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
all in this together. We've got no room for that.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
And yes sometimes we're going to have

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
different ideas and we do things a little differently

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
and try new things or whatever.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Try to find the best way the puzzle pieces

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
fit together. But that doesn't mean

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
you completely turn your back on your roots.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
So I

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
I cosigned what he said.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I'm going to do one more courtesy shout out for calls

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
but then I'm going to close up the Skype line.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Skype. Or 1877

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Game OLR if you want to do it the old fashioned way.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I don't know if you pulled up any other last minute stories

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Loki. Can I just say

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
here at the end of the show then some big

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
kudos to Akuma

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
JP. I want to thank our pal Akuma

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
JP. I said so in the chat room today.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
We were talking earlier. Oh good.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Well he deserves some public kudos as well.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Totally thank you for sending me Toda KK.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
And I got to go grab. Loki doesn't know that he

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
had something in the box too. I got to go grab it.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Well for those

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
who don't know Toda KK

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
was named after

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
one of the big

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
sound designers for Nintendo games.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
You might have also heard

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
either KK song or Toda KK

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
song.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
But KK Slider

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
in the US version

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
is Toda KK.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Nice.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Nice. A villager amiibo.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
That's funny. Yeah. I just got

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
a villager amiibo which by the way you know those

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
are very hard to find here in the US

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
or at least you know I know they had a quick reprint or whatever

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
but they're still very hard to find. I stood in line with Shane for one.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
And Animal Crossing is

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
a great memory for you know

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
all of us here at OLR so I thought that was awesome.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Thank you. But anyway another call is

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
coming in so I want to get to it. Hi Aaron

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
who's this? Hey it's Strelok.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Hey Strelok how you doing buddy?

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Pretty good. Good to hear from you. What's on your mind?

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Not too much.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Just kind of wanted to mourn

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
the death of game

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
trailers.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
And what was a memory

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
or an impact that that site had for you?

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
I

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
really liked their reviews.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Brandon Jones

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
has an amazing voice. I hope he

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
continues to

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
do stuff somewhere.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
I could listen to that guy all day. He's

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
awesome.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
I was also a big fan of

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
their pop fiction series.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
If you don't know

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
what that is basically they would take

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
like gaming

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
myths like

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
you know bringing

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Aris back in Final Fantasy

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
7 and once and for

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
all you know debunk

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
that kind of stuff.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
All those things that Electronic Gaming Monthly in April

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
would try to say is true that wasn't really true

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
and all that other stuff I'm sure. Yeah.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
That's awesome. Like I'm liking

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Simon Belmont and

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
TMNT2 for NES.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
You know

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I know a lot of these folks

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
that have found themselves out of work whether

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
it be by choice or by

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
you know being laid off or what have you

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
a lot of them have turned to sites like

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Patreon or Kickstarter

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
to actually fund future projects.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Like I remember when

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
not Joystiq but their

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
WoW Insider

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
they lost that arm and then they lost the

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
MMO what was it

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Massively. They cut loose.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Both those sites went to Patreon

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
and you know I mentioned

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
the Blizzard community is very

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
very very rabid

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
fans and I'll tell you that

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
WoW Insider thing got which I think they

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
call now Blizzardwatch. I think it's a

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
tongue in cheek thing for Overwatch.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
That got funded like

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
a ton of times over and you know

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
they were able to continue doing that for their

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
jobs. Now you know you guys

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
know that when it gets into crowdfunding

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
and podcasts it's a little bit of a gray

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
area for me because I don't

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
want to do it for OLR

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
because I

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
just feel like if you give money

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
to us there's a

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
certain expectation that I need

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
to be able to turn around for you guys

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
and when I do have a normal day job

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
and all this other stuff like I really worry about

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
putting myself in that position. Like if I'm gonna

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
put myself out there and say this is my job

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
then I'm gonna have to treat it like my job

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
and be willing to learn my day job to do it.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Yeah. But

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
for these guys that have done it professionally

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
and maybe want to continue to do it

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
maybe they're in a different position than I am

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
and if they're able to deliver something

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
worthy of your monthly fee

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
or your yearly fee or whatever it is then

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
you know Patreon might be a way to do that.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Yeah.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Also it really sucks

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
the way it happened

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
like they literally

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
had like zero

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
warning that

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
that sucks. So I hope they can

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
find work. But I will say

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
with all of that too never say never

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
I'm just saying you know

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
for this show

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
right now

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
I would have to be able to

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
produce a lot more if that makes sense.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Yeah. So.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
But anyway for game trailers

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
you know I think they are still probably all

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
recovering from the shock and I'm sure

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
some of them will brainstorm some ideas

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
and see how they can maybe move forward.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
And I wish them the best of luck.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
I wouldn't be

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
surprised if we see like a smaller

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
you know like

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
I don't know what you would call it

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
but you know like a spin off

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
site with like a

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
bunch or a few of the guys

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
from game trailers

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
pop up and maybe like a

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Kickstarter or Patreon or something.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
They just have to figure out what are their

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
strengths and what can they really offer

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
people that other sites don't

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
do and obviously that's not going to be true.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I love their reviews. Like their reviews were

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
actually really well done and there actually

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
weren't like

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
perfect 10s across the board

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
like you see a lot. They were pretty fair.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
It's a good call out.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Well I hope they're able to continue

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
one way or the other. Yeah.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Any other thoughts for us, Sturlock?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
I know

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
this is Dan and

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Red Entertainment's line but stay black.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
I'll try. Thank you very much

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Sturlock. Alright. Take care my friend.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Bye.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Alright. I think that's

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
going to do it for the Skype line tonight. It's about 9.15

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
so we need to wrap up the show tonight but

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I really want to thank all you guys who participated with

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
the show tonight. Again I'll be at

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
MagFest next week so there is

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
not going to be a live Orange Lounge

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
radio but we will be back in two weeks

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
and I do have and I pimped this earlier

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
in the show. I do have guys

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
on a show is back and we just

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
dropped three episodes out there so a little something

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
to hopefully fill the gap for you

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
before we come back in two weeks although that show is

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
really really explicit so it might not be for everybody.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
But you know another great

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
video game based show we talked about

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
earlier tonight was Game Buoy

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
who just joined the Voice of Geese Network and they do

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
a great job talking about video games in depth

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
so you know you could

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
check them out on the week that we're off for sure

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
and you know if you're into Power Rangers

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
maybe Ranger Pride

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
is where it's at for you and you can listen to them

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
talk about the latest in Power Rangers

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
and Super Sentai so congrats to

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
those guys for being a part

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
of the network and appreciate that. Anyway that is

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting the show

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
hey if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
tell a friend or two about the show

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
your voice goes a long way

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
in helping to spread

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
the word and like Derek

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
said on the call there we gotta

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
support each other and continue

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
to spread the love amongst the indie podcast

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
so word of mouth is the biggest way you can help.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
A five star review goes a long way on

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
whatever site it is you learned about this show

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
possibly iTunes or

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
some other type of podcasting app

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
a five star review would go a long way

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
in your support as well

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
we would appreciate that.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
That is going to do it however

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
tonight for the show

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Dark Sakura we'll see you in two weeks

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Maybe. No I want the

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
froyo and then I want

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
nine pm eastern

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
the views and opinions expressed in this program

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
do not necessarily reflect those

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio
