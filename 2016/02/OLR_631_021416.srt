Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week Amazon announced a new video game engine named Lumberyard and it's available now completely free!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's currently PC and console only but will soon find its way to mobiles as well.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is just one of many monetary stories and we'll tell you about all these and more starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on February the 14th of 2016, episode number 631 of our show.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you from Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But you might know me on Twitter at Skie.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And joining me at my side as always, my trusty co-hosts over the past I've lost count number of years.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Rawr.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Rawr. 13 and a half by the way.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Rawr.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Rawr. How are you doing?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Um, I'm okay. I bit my tongue so hard it bled.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's not good.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And now I have a hole in the side of my tongue and it feels weird.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you need a tissue?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And I love my friends, but I'm a little peeved when I get woke up from a deep, deep sleep at one in the afternoon.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, I was gonna say to be fair, wasn't it like one in the afternoon?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Lazy, lazy Valentine's Day for DarkSakura.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Texting me about troubleshooting their computer.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm like, I'm not at work, dude.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I was impressed with myself that I could do half a sleep via text message.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Awesome.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's lots of hearts here on Valentine's Day.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Even the blackest heart here on the show. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hello.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How are you doing?

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Doing fine.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We just had a big live announcement here at the Voice of Geeks Network that we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Usually we're on at 6, but we're on at 6.30 tonight and I'll do my little spiel here.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
vaughnetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight, but not too terribly late.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll still have a great show tonight.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But Loki, I don't know what you've been working on over there while we were doing that announcement stuff.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You still working on Time to Car?

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You don't know?

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, the thing is, see, I was trying to get something done just to release it and I don't even like the way it is right now.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't like the state that it's in and I don't really want to complete it in the state that it is right now.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I just want to work on something else.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Interesting.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now, I still may finish it and I have a better idea of what I want to do with it, but it's too out there right now.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's so far away from its initial idea that I don't know what the hell to make of it.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I'm going to put it on the fence or back burner for now.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I've got several projects on the back burner right now.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So we'll put another one on the back burner after I start another one, of course.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, of course, we do have our live chat room and you can visit our chat live.vognetwork.com.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And AkumaJP is starting us off tonight saying, yay, half Loki 3.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I've got like I've got like I want to come up with ideas.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I basically create a text file for them on my on my computer and I just start kind of jotting ideas down with it.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've got so many of them. It's ridiculous.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And I'm just looking now that I've got Unity 5 and that's another reason why I kind of want to put the one I was working on hiatus right now,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
because it was being developed in Unity 4 and I was really limited on what I could do with it.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's why I didn't look that great, because I was stuck with using all the Unity basic stuff.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Whereas now Unity 5, you have all those pro features that were originally locked away from you.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Instead of worrying about porting it over and everything, I'm just going to probably start something different for right now.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And then just because I just want to work on something different.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I've mentally been drained. I was like trying to work on this like high score table for the longest time.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm like, for what? For this demo? It just didn't make any sense for me to do that.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I even went back and played the demo, what I had done.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm like, you know, it's not as fun as I thought it was originally.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
For what it's worth, I totally get it.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've had those situations where it's like, I need to put this on the back burner. I understand.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But a lot of people did tell you that for your first big game you were being very ambitious.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Would you change anything in retrospect?

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, I wouldn't actually. It's just, you know, I don't know.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The idea was like, I had an idea and I could have, you know, done it that way.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But I wanted to do something different with it later on.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Because I decided, you know, okay, I don't know. I had some more ideas to go along with it.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I just, I want to implement that instead.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But in order to do that, it's just completely redoing the whole thing anyways.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I just don't want to do that. I don't want to waste any more time on this.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'd rather do something that I think would be more interesting gameplay-wise. Let's put it that way.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the last 10% takes 90% of the time.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course, yes. No, I understand that.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And that's the thing. It's like, but you got to, the problem was I kind of took it the wrong way.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You got to develop, you know, the core gameplay first and then work on the rest of it.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And the problem is the gameplay on it wasn't quite there. It just wasn't fun.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I don't want to release something like that, even if it's unfinished.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because then that looks even worse. I'd rather just come up with something I think is interesting.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I play it and it's fun. Then go from there.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And I have a few ideas of things I want to do.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And some even way more ambitious than what I started.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So, I still want to do those two, but we'll get around it.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Alright, fair enough. Well, best of luck to you in whatever it is you choose to do.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You know, SG100Matt in chat saying if we've learned anything about Loki over the years,

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Loki is always go big or go home. Loki doesn't half-ass things.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I go home a lot. So, it's fine.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Alright, we're going to get right into the show tonight.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Usually we would do a kick-off topic to start things off,

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but since we did have our live announcement tonight, we're going to go right into How Was Your Gaming Week?

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I do just want to give a quick shout-out to the three new shows joining The Voice of Geeks Network.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you like video games, you absolutely need to be subscribed to GameBui.org,

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
which is joining The Voice of Geeks Network.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They've got well over 100 episodes of really deep informational gaming content and discussions.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And Captain Spike and Slidekick are very talented.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've been honored to be on that show way in the past. I was on episode 37 or something.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In a row?

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Haha. But they are now a part of the network.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Look up whichever one was about music games. That was the one I was on.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And we're very excited to have them here.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Also joining us, probably not a huge surprise.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Shane's been here the past few weeks, and it was really only a matter of time

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
before Ranger Pride also came onto the network.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So if you like Power Rangers, you need to be checking that out.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then I announced that Extfer and I brought back from a very long 10-year hiatus,

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
a show we used to do on Orange Onch Radio, the network, called Guys on a Show,

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
which is going to be about all things pop and geek culture and passion.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But obviously, you can expect when Extfer's involved, with tongue planted firmly in cheek.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And the first three episodes of Guys on a Show available right now.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We surprised everybody. It's out on iTunes right now.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We dropped the album on iTunes right now.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So you can check that out by just searching for Guys on a Show

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
or head on over to guysontashow.com.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And also Twitter, Guys on a Show.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And while you're on Twitter, you should also follow GameBooey.org

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and RangerPrideCast on Twitter.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
All right, so since that pretty much took over our kickoff slot tonight,

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
let's get into how was your gaming week

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and the types of video games you've been playing this week. DarkSakura?

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I really haven't played very much because I've had a lot of stuff going on.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a side project I'm working on.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I played a little bit of Hot to Full Boyfriend last night

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
by hooking up because it's now on the OS X App Store.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And so I played it. I had my Mac already hooked up to the Sony TV

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
so that they could watch the new Yamato series.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The Space Battleship Yamato.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And so I decided just to test out games on it.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So I turned on Hot to Full Boyfriend and started dating some pigeons.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It was great.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm going to have to play through that all the way again.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I love that you had this gigantic TV and the great resolution

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
where people would try to play things like, I don't know, Destiny.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know, things that really push the graphical envelopes.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And here you are playing...

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Destiny? Come on.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know. It was the first game that came to mind.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And you're playing Hot to Full Boyfriend.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Because... And it was really pretty.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I put a picture up on my Facebook.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Nah, I saw that. It was very pretty.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's on my Tumblr too. I put a picture on my Tumblr.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Fine. How about like Mario Kart 8?

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Even as cartoony as that is, I bet that would be badass on a big screen TV like that.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We'll do that anyway.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The whole point was for me to test the HDMI out on my Mac.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I understand.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And it was pretty nice.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It made me realize now that the wallpaper I have is super low res in comparison.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It looks fine on the Mac, but not on the big TV.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've also been playing some Animal Crossing.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Some Happy Home Designer.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Because I got some new Amiibo cards.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Really? Yeah, not a whole bunch else.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And I've decided that I really don't like Super Hexagon because it makes me mad.

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Really mad.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And so I've gone back to my stress relief game of...

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Crap, what's it called?

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I used...

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mass Effect?

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, not Mass Effect.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Dragon Age?

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Not Dragon Age.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Can I say quickly while you're thinking about Super Hexagon?

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's kind of the point, I think, is to anger you a little bit.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's so fun in the short little bursts.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm glad you think it is.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I know. It can get very frustrating.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Just like...

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Fractal.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Fractal.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Fractal is my stress relief game.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And Moonlight Mahjong.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You know that's funny.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
MXC actually called it in our chat room.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Fractal.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Props to you, MXC.

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But I was going to say about Super Hexagon.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Try something different than what you're doing now.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Because for me, to beat the first level, all I had to do was stop playing full screen and go to windowed.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Obviously, you're not going to be able to do that on the phone.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, I never play windowed.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But you can...

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I mean, not windowed.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I never play full screen.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Because I get motion sick on full screen games.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, I know what else.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I played a little bit more Dragon's Dogma.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh yeah?

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's alright.

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not completely in love with it yet, but I like it decently.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Decently.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And that's it.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Alright.

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, wait, wait.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ingress.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I hit level 5.

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's always a given.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think all three of us are addicted to that game.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And also Heroes of Dragon Age.

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Excellent.

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Loki, how about you?

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I just basically played three games this week.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I played more of Lego Avengers just to unlock more characters for my son.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I did that.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I've got like...

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think I'm like 50% done with all the unlockables in the game.

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And we're 25 hours into it already.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So that's a lot.

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And then I played more Fallout 4.

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm just going through the...

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Was it a companion quest for MacCready?

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So I'm pretty much done there.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I mean, I did all of his, but I still haven't gotten his perk yet.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Which is really the only reason why I have him with me anyways.

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because he's annoying.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I mean, he's not as annoying as some of the other characters.

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But I just want his headshot perk that's all fucked up right now.

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because I've disconnected my Playstation 4 from the internet.

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So I can keep my really buggy, glitchy version of Fallout 4.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean, you know, the more buggy, glitchy version of Fallout 4 right now.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And then I played...

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What was the other game I played?

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I played also...

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We actually played a little bit more of the League of Marvel Super Heroes.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because my son-in-law played the older game.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then I also played Ingress a little bit.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Mainly just on the way to and from work.

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just driving.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I know that's dangerous, but I don't care.

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We're in traffic. We're moving like 50 miles an hour. It doesn't matter.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Alright.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well that's it for your gaming week.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Still been playing a lot of Diablo 3.

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Working on my Witch Doctor in Seasons.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm past Paragon level 500 now.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And that also means that I am past the point where my non-seasonal characters are at.

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I did that already once last season.

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So that just shows you how into the game I am.

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But I've been playing with friends and having a great time with it.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Again, that Seasons is only on PC.

250
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't play on consoles as much.

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But I notice a lot of my friends are playing on Xbox One.

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have a couple different groups of friends that are playing on Xbox One.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So I'm like, maybe I need to play Diablo 3 on Xbox One.

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But here's the funny thing. I own it on PS4.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So I would literally have to buy a third copy of Diablo 3.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So I'm like, maybe when it goes...

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, I didn't buy the first Diablo 3 on PC.

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because there was that whole World of Warcraft subscription thing.

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But, we'll see.

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then, it does go on sale quite a bit.

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was down to like $24 the other week.

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I was like, maybe?

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, so maybe if it goes on sale.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If it goes on sale again, I'll probably pick it up.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm considering Knack because it's down to $8.

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Is it really?

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know yet. Maybe.

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I just don't have... I want to finish some games.

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But Fallout 4 is never going to finish.

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because once I'm done with Fallout, I'm going to have to start my asshole character.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Which, you know, that's going to be another several hundred hours.

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Can I talk about a piece of video game hardware that I picked up?

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And this is one of the things I just bought because I wanted it.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And Shane was trying to tell me they're not that great.

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But I wanted it.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So I bought the wireless PlayStation 4 headset.

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because I like playing games.

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I found that from playing more PC games, I really enjoy gaming with the headset.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And even though I like...

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Which one? Do you have the stereo headset?

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I have the official wireless one.

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is it the stereo headset? Is it surround sound?

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
7.1.

284
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have the...

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Gold or something like that.

286
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, I've got the PlayStation 3 one.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Which works on the PlayStation 4.

288
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I use it when I play with my friends Call of Duty and stuff.

289
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And the thing with that device is that as much as I love to plop down on the TV and play the games,

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't necessarily get that same sound stuff coming from the little soundbar I have.

292
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't have a deluxe sound system.

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I just have one of those little bars that outputs all the sound.

294
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So I was like, you know what? What the hell? I'm just going to get some headphones.

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And so far, I'm really enjoying using the headphones.

296
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But I will say this. I tried playing amplitude with the headphones on.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And the bass got all distorted in different parts of the song.

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So I might just need to play with the settings a little bit.

299
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I always play with headphones plugged into my controller.

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's not how I play because my wife's usually watching Netflix on her thing or she's doing something else.

301
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And so they don't like hearing the audio coming from that.

302
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But I love it with headphones.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And Tigerclaw says a wireless headset. That would be kind of a hassle if you forget to recharge it.

304
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can still use them when they're plugged into the PlayStation 4.

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But since they're the official Sony ones, you charge it with the same cable you use for your controller.

306
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So it's just like charge one then charge the other and kind of flip back and forth.

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It doesn't seem to be too difficult. So far, so good.

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I did play one new game this week.

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It was a game that released on, I think, PlayStation 4 and PC this week.

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm not sure about Xbox One. Maybe somebody in chat can set me straight.

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But I played Firewatch.

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think it's on Xbox One also.

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It just came out this week.

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And it was really not a game that was on my radar at all.

315
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But I saw a lot of my friends on Twitter talking about it.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And that it was another one of those kind of...

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Walking simulators?

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I guess if you want to call it that.

319
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But I feel like, okay, if you call something like Gone Home or Everybody's Gone to the Rapture a walking simulator...

320
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
They do.

321
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But this game, yeah, I mean it's not like it's action packed.

322
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're not like fighting enemies or whatever.

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But I feel like there's still kind of a deeper level of interaction maybe in this game.

324
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because the little twist in this game is that you're playing basically a ranger who's by themself out in the forest.

325
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The Firewatch refers to the fact that they watch for fires and emergency scenarios and so forth, right?

326
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's like a two day hike out to the thing.

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Exactly. And so they can only communicate with each other by radio.

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So you're playing this main protagonist.

329
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And the protagonist interacts with the boss via radio.

330
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And it's kind of like, for me a little bit, it invokes GLaDOS a little bit in Portal.

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I get a little bit of that similar feeling.

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because the boss that he's talking to on the radio can be a little bit sassy with him and things like that.

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So there's that. But you can ask about a lot of different objects and radio back.

334
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And it's a little deeper too because some of the decisions that you make and some of the things you say could...

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Like I had a case today where I said something that pissed her off and she wouldn't talk to me for like five minutes.

336
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Or answer my calls or anything.

337
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So it was kind of an interesting little twist there.

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But yeah, it is one of those very story-driven things.

339
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But I was very interested in it because it's not a scary game.

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But you get this whole sense the time you're playing that something's off.

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I kind of like that. Because you know I'm not a big fan of jump scares, but I like unsettling games.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And so Firewatch is definitely that.

343
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The one thing I am going to rag on the game though, and I think a lot of people are calling this out from what I see on Twitter.

344
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There's a little bit of jitteriness on the PlayStation 4.

345
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And whenever it tries to autosave you really notice like jump, jump, jump, jump around.

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And it can really take you out of the experience.

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Because otherwise a lot of the visuals are gorgeous.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're walking around at sunset. You can look out and see an objective that's all far away.

349
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But that's a place you know you can actually travel to.

350
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So it's a gorgeous looking game.

351
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But because of the PlayStation 4 performance issues it can take you out of the experience momentarily.

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But I would actually say that's kind of a minor beef.

353
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But that is something you may want to consider.

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If it's like do I get it on PlayStation 4 or do I get it on PC?

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because I hear the PC version doesn't really do that.

356
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I suppose that would depend on your PC as well.

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So anyway.

358
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Going to the chat over at live.vognetware.com.

359
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Dungeon Buster says there is no Firewatch on Xbox One.

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Only a tantalizing hint that it could come over to other platforms if there is a desire for it to.

361
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And TigerClaw says it isn't a game that you play with the kids.

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The characters have adult conversations that aren't kid friendly.

363
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That is very true.

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I believe this could depend on what you do in the story in the very beginning.

365
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But I had nudity in the first 15 seconds of the game. Dude nudity.

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So it's not something you want to play.

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Would that be dude-ity?

368
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah dude-ity.

369
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's not something you necessarily want to play with kids around.

370
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Or maybe you do. Just kind of know that there's going to be explicit.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hell. From what I understand parents are taking their kids to see Deadpool.

372
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And I'm like.

373
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Lucky bastards.

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And these are very stupid parents.

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well you know.

376
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I should take my kids to see Deadpool because at least I'd see Deadpool.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And that's probably why a lot of kids are going to see Deadpool.

378
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I saw someone even watch part of Iron Man 3 on TV the other day.

379
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I was like. Hey look see here's what the movies look like.

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And he's like. I don't want to watch it. It's scary.

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm like. Come on you're like fans of all this stuff.

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Like he talks all the time about you know all the Iron Man stuff.

383
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And he'll talk about like the Minecraft things.

384
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He'll talk about all the enemies and stuff.

385
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And he always plays on peaceful with no enemies.

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I finally convinced him like. Hey listen.

387
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You play creative mode with enemies and they don't do anything.

388
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You can just go and punch him in the face and there's like.

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hi.

390
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So finally got him to do that and he's like super psyched about.

391
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh hey look at all these things I did.

392
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But like see I'm trying to get him to watch the Avengers movies.

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So that I can show him this stuff and he just won't do it.

394
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You know what I bet happens is that like when he's like six or so something's just going to flip.

395
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And then suddenly it'll be like he loves ultra violence.

396
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I just noticed that happened with kids that even happened to me.

397
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's not going to be him.

398
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
My parents say I was completely different when that is not going to be him.

399
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That'll be my youngest son because my youngest son.

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What he does now is he's like super cuddly and everything and all said I'm going to beat the shit out of you.

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Like he will just run up to you and just punch you in the face.

402
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I mean that is what he does.

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
All right anyway I would overall recommend Firewatch at least based on the little bit that I've played.

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If you like the heavily story driven games.

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If you need more action in your games it's probably going to be a pass for you.

406
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But if you're if you like those games like Gone Home, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and the more story driven experiences.

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then I think Firewatch will be right up your alley.

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
All right some quick housekeeping before we get into the news tonight.

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Please follow us on Twitter. Twitter dot com slash O L R.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google Plus at Orange Launch Radio as well.

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We will not be here next week. There is no live show or podcast show next week.

412
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And the reason for that is there might be a dead show.

413
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There might be a dead show. Are you going to periscope something.

414
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Actually that's what I'm doing next week.

415
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You're going to see Deadpool.

416
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm going to go see Deadpool.

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We should totally go see Deadpool.

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm going tomorrow with Dan.

419
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You'll want to see it again.

420
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Damn it.

421
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh you know I'm going to go see it again.

422
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So we should ingress and see Deadpool.

423
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Hell yes.

424
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
OK.

425
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then we should periscope it.

426
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
OK.

427
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Usually I would be insanely jealous but I am going to Magfest which I'm super pumped about and that's why there's no show next week.

428
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So if you are going to Magfest I really look forward to see you there.

429
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If you are somebody that I told about this show at Magfest.

430
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio and thank you so much for being here.

431
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And I'm really looking forward to having a great time at Magfest.

432
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
My first time going and I'm coming all the way from the West Coast to go to Magfest.

433
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So I'm really excited about it.

434
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So I will see you there in National Harbor, Maryland.

435
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I arrive on Thursday.

436
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But there will be no show because I don't get back until Monday.

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Which by the way, what a great idea to premiere three new shows on the Voice of the Geeks Network this week.

438
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm not going to be here for half the week but we have a way to work it out.

439
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
All will be well.

440
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
All will be well.

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I do want to address one other issue this week that I'm going to be honest.

442
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This issue really bugged me and it has to do with a lot of you guys listen to this show on an app called Stitcher Radio.

443
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Which is something that we have promoted here on Orange Launch Radio pretty heavily in the past.

444
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And what happened with Stitcher is that our latest show was not showing up on Stitcher.

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And we got tweets from several people that said, hey did you guys do a show this week?

446
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't see it. And I was confused because I'm going into iTunes and I'm looking at the Voice of the Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and I see the latest show.

447
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But I go onto Stitcher and it's not there.

448
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But unfortunately Stitcher doesn't really have a way for me to ping, like force ping the feed or anything like that.

449
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well come to find out, long story short, Stitcher's been down for the last three days for maintenance.

450
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So these people that have been relying on Stitcher Radio to listen to podcasts are really up a creek right now.

451
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So I'm going to be honest, and this is a rough kind of hard thing for me to say.

452
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But I don't think I can really continue to promote Stitcher Radio here on the show.

453
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And I'm not going to.

454
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And I'm not saying we're going to take ourselves off or anything.

455
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And if that's how you choose to listen to the show, that's cool.

456
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm all about getting Orange Launch Radio any way you can.

457
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But if you are currently using Stitcher Radio, I would recommend you look into an app called TuneIn.

458
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And the main difference is, on TuneIn, they don't actually download the shows in a different bit rate.

459
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You're connecting directly to our feed.

460
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So you're not relying on any third party to get the shows.

461
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're going to be getting the shows yourself.

462
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That is just one recommendation.

463
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Part of the reason I like TuneIn is that you can also use live radio with it.

464
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So not only can you get OLR in it, but you can get the VoG network stream in it.

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So that's why I'm a little partial to that.

466
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But whatever you want to use to listen to the show, iTunes Podcast has it.

467
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Google Play Store is supposed to be having podcasts.

468
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I know we are on there whenever they roll that out.

469
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So I'm very excited.

470
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But unfortunately, this is one too many burns from Stitcher for me.

471
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But this isn't a permanent thing.

472
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If they are able to fix things and maybe communicate a little more, ever since they got bought,

473
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I feel like a lot's gone downhill in that department.

474
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So not saying forever, but I would recommend Stitcher folks find another way to listen to OLR

475
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
because I'm not encouraged by the support that's been coming from them.

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And that's just the honest advice.

477
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So sorry, I know it's a little harsh.

478
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And I do, I just want to emphasize, I love all you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed.

479
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But just as a podcaster, what's happening where you can't get the show is extraordinarily frustrating.

480
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And that's why I'm putting my foot down and saying I'm just going to recommend something else.

481
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay.

482
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And some folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com are suggesting some other Android solutions.

483
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
MXC says Pocket Casts is good.

484
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Mr. Rizos, I'm sorry, is that Rizos or Rizos?

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Sorry, says try Pocket Cast if you're using Android.

486
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
There's some other comments there from our chat.

487
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And then SHO 100 Matt says Stitcher did just update a few hours ago

488
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
saying that they're hoping to get service up via test sometime today.

489
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Good luck to them. I hope they're able to work it out.

490
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
All right, let's go around and talk about what's going on this week in the news.

491
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Loki's starting us off.

492
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So Activision has finished their full reports for fiscal year 2015.

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And they're talking about kind of the revenue and everything.

494
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Apparently revenues are up 4.6 billion from 4.4 in 2014.

495
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Of that, they said that 47.5% was due to subscriptions, including World of Warcraft.

496
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Licensing, including Skylanders and all sorts of different things and Call of Duty.

497
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Among all that, though, they're also saying that 53% is actually digital revenue now.

498
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So from digital sources.

499
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm thinking probably a lot of that has to do with all the DLC stuff that they have out.

500
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I mean, especially with like the season passes for, you know, Call of Duty is probably a big thing.

501
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know, Destiny with all of its DLC stuff and it's consumable.

502
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So that's probably a lot to do with it.

503
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Right now, they're still saying, though, that apparently Guitar Hero Live and Skylanders Supercharged

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
have fallen short of expectations.

505
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Skylanders I can totally see because it's hard to keep that brand alive.

506
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I mean, it's kind of it's become popular on its own, but I mean, they're not doing too much crazy stuff with it.

507
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They're just kind of adding one new gimmick each year.

508
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Whereas I think, you know, Lego Dimensions and Disney Infinity has a lot of that licensing that they can kind of back up on.

509
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You know, they've got, you know, the Marvel and Star Wars.

510
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I mean, that's huge compared to Skylanders, which anybody coming into this, it's like who Skylanders what?

511
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I kind of agree with you a lot here is that Skylanders maybe established the model,

512
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but now all these other players are coming in and kind of pushing Skylanders out.

513
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Well, and like Skylanders, I think, I mean, it looks like an interesting game and from what I've seen, it's OK.

514
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's just like for me, like if I was trying to get this for my son, like who are these characters?

515
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't know who these characters are.

516
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I know that they're talking about bringing a cartoon and stuff like that.

517
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And there's a lot of kids that are really big fans of it because they've already been playing the other games.

518
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And so they know the characters and everything.

519
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But coming in from the outside, it's hard to kind of get hooked into that world without, you know, kind of knowing who these characters are.

520
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Whereas if you're Disney Infinity and stuff, I mean, it's like Star Wars.

521
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Oh, shit, we saw the Star Wars movies and we know all the Star Wars characters, you know, Marvel characters and Disney characters and all that stuff.

522
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I mean, that's that's easy to kind of hook people into that.

523
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I think even the Lego Dimensions stuff, aside from it being insanely overpriced, which I think a lot of that,

524
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
especially when they have like Doctor Who, Portal, Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, that's totally aiming at the adult crowd.

525
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Right.

526
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You know, just buys that kind of stuff.

527
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So I think that's kind of the problem they have with Skylanders and they need to figure out some way to, I don't know, do something a little bit more interesting with it.

528
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It needs to kind of innovate a lot.

529
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And maybe, you know, I don't know if there's a lot necessarily they can do.

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Maybe Activision needs to try to push a new character.

531
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Here's the other thing that's like kind of a big no-no with them.

532
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's like every time you buy a new version of Skylanders, you have to buy a whole new like starter pack, the whole new portal and everything to run with it because it doesn't work with the other stuff.

533
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Whereas like Disney Infinity, I mean, not so much Lego Dimensions because it's the first time they released it.

534
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But Disney Infinity, you can use that same portal from the first one on all the new games.

535
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's going to support any new game that they put out.

536
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So, I think it's kind of dumb that they do it that way because it's more expensive.

537
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You get to plop down, you know, $80 versus what I bought Disney Infinity 3.0 for $20 because I bought a digital version because I had the hardware for it already.

538
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And I just thought I'd buy toys. So, I don't know.

539
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Not surprising though that Activision is making so much off digital.

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I mean, especially the Blizzard side of things.

541
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh yeah.

542
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And you know, they're doing these really weird things and Shane and I were talking about this the other day where it's kind of sketchy how, I know that's a strong word but I really can't think of a better one.

543
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Where Blizzard is now trying this thing where instead of like pre-ordering games, you straight up pre-pay for games.

544
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Like that's what's happening with Overwatch.

545
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If you pre-pay for Overwatch on PC, you get like special skins and these sorts of things.

546
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And it's like, you know, we're talking like $60.

547
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So, it's like a $60, it's a full pre-order. You're paying the full $60 up front.

548
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But the Blizzard fan base is so strong and the hype is so real for a game like Overwatch.

549
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Which they're, you know, and God I hate the way they do this.

550
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Is that they really funnel out the beta so that only certain people, it's to drive the hype.

551
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And they've really got this formula down. As frustrating as it can be.

552
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Well yeah, and people need to grow up and realize that skins for a game is fucking stupid.

553
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And not a reason that you should pay $60 before it comes out.

554
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And like, I think that can be, you know, a lot of games are like that.

555
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Where it's like, you know, look at oh, order a GameStop and you get like a gold skin for your gun in Call of Duty.

556
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Who gives a shit? It's a fucking skin. No one's gonna fucking notice what your gun skin is.

557
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And even if they do, no one's gonna give a shit that you have the gold gun skin.

558
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No one's gonna be like, oh my God, you're so cool because you have this skin.

559
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Because they know what it comes from.

560
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah, exactly. No one cares.

561
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
S2100Matt says, this is the same Blizzard fan base that bought ridiculous mounts in WoW.

562
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And on top of a regular monthly fee. Although I can't talk, I bought a mount in Final Fantasy XIV.

563
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I was gonna say, the mounts, that's not so bad. I mean, I understand that people want to do that.

564
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And a lot of times they're doing that for charity as well. So that's, I don't see is, you know, a terrible downside to that.

565
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I mean, that's fine. If you want to spend the money on customization like that, they go ahead and spend the money on customization.

566
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I don't understand the point behind it a lot of times, but I don't know.

567
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's just trying to get people to pay for a game in full, especially in this type of market where, I mean, Blizzard's maybe not so bad.

568
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't think that they have a reputation of releasing games that are absolute broken when they come out because they develop mainly on PC anyways.

569
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But paying for a game in full way before it comes out is a kind of a risky move, especially in this market.

570
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Because of all the stuff that comes out absolutely broken at launch.

571
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Not to say that I don't do that still for games I really want, but, you know, Bethesda games I expect a certain level of broken, so it's fine.

572
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,000
AkumaJP in chat says, no one cares what skin you have. That's what she says. Bad taste in joke, I know, but I can't help it.

573
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Alan Halkemi says, Final Fantasy XIV shop like that is evil. They've only done one account-wide mount for $25.

574
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Every storm out since is like $10 or $15 and it's per character.

575
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Dungeon Buster says, The Taken King's physical release disk was only for vanilla Destiny. You still had to punch in a code for The Taken King to download it.

576
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You know, I saw a comment here by Dungeon Buster. Skylanders isn't a bad game, it's just getting slammed by having to compete against the likes of Nintendo and Disney.

577
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Nintendo. There's something you want to do. You want something for your amiibos. There you go. Fucking rip off fucking Skylanders and put out like an RPG game where you actually play as the damn characters.

578
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That right there would probably get me to buy some of your amiibos. Because I think that would be pretty awesome. And it would be like, hey look, we have an actual use for this shit.

579
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Here's the reality of that. I love that idea, but isn't that Smash Brothers?

580
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Well Smash Brothers is a fighting game. Let's just change the genre. Let's just do an action RPG or something like that.

581
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Okay, so maybe a platformer. Although I would be like, that's Mario Maker. How about a racer? Oh, that's Mario Kart. I feel like Nintendo has already done a game with all these genres.

582
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But just spin off. You can even spin it off and just create almost like a Kingdom Hearts type thing where you have these different licensed properties coming into this brand new world that you're creating brand new characters for.

583
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So I don't see why they couldn't do that. And hell, it'd give them an excuse to make more amiibos. I don't know.

584
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Alright, well let's move on and talk about a feature that another company is proposing doing. And it's Microsoft. And you know, Microsoft made a lot of waves this week in updating everybody on what's going on with Quantum Break.

585
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I'm pleasantly surprised to hear Quantum Break's coming a lot sooner than I thought it was. They announced the release date for, what was it, April? For Quantum Break?

586
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Wow, really?

587
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah, it's soon. Sorry, I don't have the date in front of me where it's at. I'm trying to look that up right now. Quantum Break, April 5th is when Quantum Break's out, right? That kind of came out of nowhere. I was like, oh, it's going to be a holiday game.

588
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, I thought for sure that was a holiday, because we didn't hear anything about it for the longest time.

589
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
No, just like we just dropped three episodes of Guys on the Show on everybody, they just came out and said, okay, it's ready. April 5th.

590
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Is it because, are they still doing the TV portion of that?

591
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
They are?

592
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, I'm sorry, when you say that, I mean, because they have like some big name talent that's in the game. Who's that guy that plays Iceman on the X-Men? I think he's in there. Sean Asmore? Is that? Asmore? Ashmore.

593
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
My name is Sean. Sean Asmore.

594
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I must be thinking about something else. Anyway.

595
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I have your pizza.

596
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So anyway, yeah, Quantum Break. So where was I going with this before we got into that?

597
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes, Microsoft announced that Quantum Break is coming, and if you pre-order the game on Xbox One, you're going to get the Windows 10 version with it.

598
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:08,000
This is interesting. So what Microsoft's essentially doing here is like, alright, Sony, you guys do this cross-buy thing all the time, where if somebody buys it on PlayStation 4, they get it on the Vita as well.

599
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Well, since we are basically injected into almost every PC out there, unless you have a Mac, which even if you have a Mac, you're probably double-booting, you will be able to get a copy of your Xbox One game on your PC.

600
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And this may be something that actually ends up being a trend. Phil Spencer actually tweeted at somebody who asked, do you expect to see third-party games on the cross-buy list or just MS-related releases?

601
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Phil Spencer replied, we'll make it a platform feature. We think it's good for gamers.

602
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So, I mean, it's nice to get something additional for the money that you pay.

603
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And by the way, in this case, specifically with Quantum Break, not only is it going to be Quantum Break, but you're also going to get Alan Wake with the backwards compatibility thing on 360 is also going to be included, and the little spin-off game they did.

604
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's not a bad deal.

605
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And I like Alan Wake a lot.

606
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I mean, I like Minecraft on Windows 10, but I am not going to the Windows 10 store to go shop for games.

607
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So, I mean, I don't know. Cool. I mean, hey, something for free is better than nothing for free, so I'm down with that.

608
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Now, ActDeft brings up in chat over at live.vognetwork.com something that kind of happened on the internet and on Twitter as a result of this.

609
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And ActDeft says, I'm going to cancel my Xbox One pre-order for Quantum Break because more people will play it.

610
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He's saying that in quotes. He's not saying that himself, but reflecting what was seen on Twitter this week, where some people reacted very angrily to this news saying, I can't believe you're doing this and that you promised this game is an Xbox One exclusive,

611
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and now you're going to give it to PC people as well. I'm canceling my pre-order. I'm so mad.

612
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Which, I don't know if that makes a lot of sense to me.

613
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, it doesn't.

614
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't understand why you would be mad that more people can play it or whatever.

615
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I guess they're complaining because...

616
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
They were promised it as an exclusive and it's not.

617
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So maybe they feel burned in the purchase of the Xbox One game.

618
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, exactly. Like, I bought this Xbox One for these exclusives and they're not exclusive anymore. Why did I purchase this one? I can just get it on this other platform that I already had that I didn't require this purchase on.

619
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But I don't think it works in reverse. You can't buy the PC version and get the Xbox One version for free.

620
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No, we don't know yet. Maybe if you buy it through the Windows 10 store instead of Steam, you will. Watch.

621
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm on PlayStation Steam integration. Let's do that.

622
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
No, they were flirting a little bit when PlayStation 2 came out.

623
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah, that didn't happen.

624
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But if there was any way to do Half-Life 3 and just the internet explode in a sea of jism, that's gonna be the way to do it.

625
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But anyway, all that tinfoil hatting aside, I still don't understand the whole idea of just canceling your pre-order.

626
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Because in my mind, you shouldn't be getting an Xbox One for just one game anyway.

627
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Until that's all the Forza fans.

628
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And you're still getting that game.

629
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But you at least have two Forza games.

630
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And so what? You're still getting the game. And I mean, let's be honest. I have a Windows 10 laptop. Doesn't mean this game is gonna run for shit on my laptop.

631
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Just because it's free with Windows 10, or free if you buy it and you get a Windows 10 version, I can't run that shit.

632
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
My laptop's gonna be like, no.

633
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's gonna be benchmark for the Xbox One. There's certain multiplayer integration on Xbox One and so forth.

634
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, I don't know if Quantum Break's a multiplayer game, but there's certain things you kind of come to expect with the Xbox One.

635
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But I kind of like the idea that if I get a game on one system, I'm gonna get it on both.

636
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I just fucking said, like, 20 minutes ago, that I want to get Diablo 3 on Xbox One.

637
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If it had had the cross-buy, this wouldn't be an issue, right?

638
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So, from that regard, from that frugal money-saving standpoint, I love this.

639
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And if you're getting pissed off about shit coming out on Xbox One and then not being exclusive, I mean, I don't know.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I think it's just a dumb argument anyways. On any platform.

641
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Bobby Blackwolf with some insight in our chat saying the idea that some people have is that this is Microsoft abandoning the Xbox One platform.

642
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
They're not.

643
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
In a way, it kind of makes it stronger. Like, they're trying to say, this is how we're gonna really try to push it past Sony.

644
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
If anything, I don't think they're using it to get you to buy more games on Windows 10.

645
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Because eventually, what they're trying to do is they're supposed to be unifying all those platforms anyway.

646
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So, where it's just Windows 10 on Microsoft's Xbox One and all these other devices, and you buy something on one platform, you get it on all platforms.

647
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And Bobby also says you need Oculus-like specs to run it on a PC, which, again, is pretty high-end, and that's without VR.

648
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And AkumaJP says, and remember, AkumaJP is in Japan, what's this Xbox One mystical machine you're talking about?

649
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's a console that came out in the early 2000s.

650
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It had some pretty awesome games on it. I remember, granted, San Andreas was on it. First Halo game was on it.

651
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Xbox One. Xbox One. The new one. The new one.

652
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Wait, the new one?

653
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Anyway.

654
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That doesn't make any sense. Why would you call it the Xbox One if there's been two more before?

655
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Okay, hello debate from, like, three years ago when they first announced the name. Get over it.

656
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm telling you what, I'm just gonna go buy a Wii, and then that way I can play, you know, the new Zelda game when it comes out.

657
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Is that Wii for you?

658
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
No, that's the original Wii.

659
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You know, because it can run the new Zelda game, right, in 1080p?

660
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Moving on. Dark Sakura, save us from this silliness.

661
00:40:48,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So there's a survey out that was put up by the video games analytics group Quantic Foundry that interviewed over 140,000 gamers for something called a gamer motivation profile.

662
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And it showed that basically the older that someone gets, the less appealing they find competition.

663
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So things like PVP or competitive gaming, things like that, basically just stops appealing to them.

664
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They're also saying that the big difference sort of hits right around age 35.

665
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You know, things start going further after they're, you know, it has an allegory to, like, life choices and the capacity the one has for wanting to compete more, like, in work and everything too.

666
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So I thought it was pretty interesting.

667
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So is this study proving that everybody's a goddamn wuss?

668
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
No, I'm not motivated to compete.

669
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'll tell you what it is, and I can completely understand because I am 35.

670
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So here's what it is, is you can't fucking compete.

671
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You can do it all you want, but it's impossible, and you know why?

672
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Because there are people that don't have jobs or don't have, you know, a life, or not a life, don't have family that they have to take care of, you know, a spouse, that type of stuff.

673
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So they have unlimited time to get at the top of these leaderboards.

674
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And by all means, it is impossible for you with your fucking two hours a day at the most playing these games to be able to compete on that level because you just don't have the free time.

675
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I'm looking at you, all you unemployed fucking retired people playing goddamn Ingress Rant.

676
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I knew this was an Ingress Rant, I knew it.

677
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I personally don't think that's the situation at all.

678
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
One of the notes on here, it says the appeal of strategy declined the least, but the motivation to compete with others did.

679
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And for me, I personally just think that I am more satisfied with what I have, you know.

680
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I don't feel any need. I know I'm good. I don't feel like I have to prove it, you know.

681
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's like, what's another one? It was like back when I was playing Busted Move all the damn time.

682
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I entered one tournament, you know, and just kicked ass the entire hour before the tournament.

683
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And I was kind of like, I had a broken controller, so I didn't win my fourth match.

684
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And I didn't carry even really. I mean, I kind of didn't care.

685
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And it's the same thing now. I know I'm good at these games that I'm playing.

686
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I just don't feel a need to prove it to anybody.

687
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm somewhere in the middle because I totally get that whole element of I don't really want a PvP.

688
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And a lot of times I don't want a PvP because of some of the things we're low-key saying,

689
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
where it's just like you always get matched against people who are way outside of your bracket.

690
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And I feel like matchmaking in games, nobody's really perfected it yet because, you know,

691
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and the reality is it's not fun to lose over and over and over again.

692
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I get that, you know, sometimes there's winners and sometimes there's losers.

693
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But, you know, in some games you get matched up and it's like you just can't,

694
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
you're just banging your head against a wall. You don't go anywhere.

695
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But at the same time, I have a lot of fun when I'm playing like Rocket League with my friends.

696
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And so when it's kind of like when that PvP environment is friends versus friends

697
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and we're all kind of evenly matched, it's super fun.

698
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's also a lot of those competitive environments are toxic.

699
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's just very toxic people that you're playing with.

700
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's not like, you know, I remember like that was one of the things I used to do.

701
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I even still do that with my friends when I play like Call of Duty with them and stuff.

702
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's like I'm very like, hey, you know, great shot.

703
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You know, that was a great kill he got me and stuff like that and like very positive on that.

704
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But there's a lot of people.

705
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I mean, there's a vast majority of people you play with. They're fucking just toxic.

706
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You don't want to waste your eat.

707
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Like I said, you're talking about people that have very limited time in their schedule to play games.

708
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And this is the kind of shit that you're, you know.

709
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh, I spent two hours getting my ass kicked by someone that was just fucking yelling racial slurs at me the entire time.

710
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I really want to play more of this.

711
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I mean, that's kind of the problem is you have limited time.

712
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And so you want that quality of gaming to be there.

713
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And if that, you know, it's going to be impossible to make sure that, you know,

714
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
who you're playing with is going to be a very positive experience.

715
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I don't know. A little bit of trash talking is fine.

716
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But I mean, it's just when people take it way too seriously.

717
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Kaijuto in chat says, I disagree.

718
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
If you want to be competitive, you have to get out there.

719
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And I sort of like I kind of get that.

720
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But at the same time, I still feel like matchmaking and a lot of the games I've tried could just be better.

721
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And that you could still learn from people that are like, like, oh, God, Splatoon is a great example.

722
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I think like I I hit my head against a wall in Splatoon all the time because I keep getting matched with people that are way up here.

723
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And it's like I just I make no progress in it and I'm not learning anything.

724
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And I don't know, maybe it's just maybe it's just but but when I play Splatoon with friends, I have a great time.

725
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So I'd play more Splatoon if it had off screen play, but it doesn't.

726
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So I don't. Now you're you're getting into things that aren't even about the topic.

727
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You're just you're just finding new things to complain about, Loki.

728
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I want to like that game. I don't like it, though, right now. And it's because I don't play much of it.

729
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And that's the reason why right there, which is frustrating because they have it in offline mode.

730
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Why can't you do that online?

731
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, I miss hacked 64 player matches in Battlefront 1942.

732
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You know, cluster fucks can be kind of fun, like when the game is just one giant cluster fuck that actually like that.

733
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Just Cause 2 multiplayer right there.

734
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Or going back to like Duke Nukem 3D when it was like eight people on a match. It's just one giant cluster fuck.

735
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Like that's kind of fun. Like, you know, I don't know. I guess we should totally do that.

736
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I have Duke Nukem 3D and like all these different platforms. Like I know I have it on PlayStation 3 and Xbox.

737
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, I think I have Duke Nukem on PC for sure.

738
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And definitely PC reboot.

739
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We get some other stories we got to get to Loki.

740
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
All right. Sorry.

741
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So this is kind of cool.

742
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Lego Star Wars. They're going to be making an actual animated show that's coming to Disney XD this summer.

743
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's called Lego Star Wars Freemaker Adventures.

744
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's going to take place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

745
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
They're going to have some new heroes and villains that they're adding.

746
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Plus it's going to be kind of lighthearted like most of the Lego stuff is.

747
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And I'm totally down with this. I really wish they would do a Marvel show though as well.

748
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Because I'll tell you, we watch that Lego Marvel Superheroes Overload or whatever that's called.

749
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's like a little made of like four or five different clips that they have on YouTube that they made around the time of the previous Lego Marvel game.

750
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
My kids watch that show every day, at least once, probably twice or three times a day.

751
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And it's awesome. It's got, you know, Trey Baker as Loki in there.

752
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And the humor is just funny.

753
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So I'm really, if they can do that that well for just like 40 minutes and to the point where it's so rewatchable,

754
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm totally down with them doing a Lego show.

755
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I just hope that they follow it up with a Marvel show as well because I don't want to miss out on that.

756
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah, you know, the more you can tie into TVs and TV and get the kids hooked in, the more it's going to help the franchise.

757
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I think that kind of got them hooked in with the whole game in the first place because it was on there like a Lego show and we watched it.

758
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And, you know, that's one of the reasons also I was kind of disappointed that they didn't have the voice actors from, you know, the original game,

759
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
whereas all original voice acting doing the different characters, they just kind of splice it out of the movies

760
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
because the voice actors were the same in the cartoon as they were in the actual game.

761
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And I thought they were great. It's just, I don't know, now it's just clipped out voices and it doesn't make any sense.

762
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000

763
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Alright, well let's move on to your weekly Nintendo NX rumors because it seems like every week there's another damn NX rumor out there

764
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
as the hype continues to build for Nintendo's new platform.

765
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Well, here's your rumors for this week.

766
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Apparently, the Nintendo NX will support Unreal Engine 4 and Unity at launch, which, I mean...

767
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Phones support that, so it's not surprising.

768
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of something you're gonna have to support if you want to get into a lot of the indies and, you know, a lot of the different titles.

769
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So, this isn't exactly surprising, but the source that was talking about this says that Unity and Unreal Engine 4 will be ready in time for when developers outside of key partners are able to purchase dev kits of their own.

770
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
We may hear more about this at GDC, maybe?

771
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Maybe, but I still feel like it's gonna be early. I really feel like Nintendo's gonna do it at E3. I think that is what they're waiting for, for sure.

772
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But Nintendo, you know, in a separate report, Nintendo is still continuing their development and planning efforts for the NX in preparation for launch.

773
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And this was something that the president of Nintendo, the new one, Tatsumi Kimishima, said as he was talking to investors.

774
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,000
That development and planning efforts for the NX in preparation for launch are underway, but obviously he didn't say a lot more than that.

775
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:48,000
He did continue to say that previous and current fiscal years have been a period of preparation to launch a number of new endeavors, such as NX development, development for smart devices, and business using our character IP, in addition to driving our Wii U and Nintendo 3DS business.

776
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:57,000
At the same time, it's been our priority to take a close look at areas of our existing business where the revenue and expenses have become unbalanced and to make sure that we corrected this balance.

777
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
As I've said before, we will be launching many of our new business activities as we move from this fiscal year into the next.

778
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
The question was to pick one area with which we will be able to achieve Nintendo-like profits, but I would like to suggest two areas.

779
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
One is our NX business and another is our business for smart devices.

780
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I believe that keeping these two endeavors on track will be key to achieving Nintendo-like profits.

781
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I don't have any further details to share about the next fiscal year at this time, but we will explain our plan and what we will aim to achieve Nintendo-like profits at a future date.

782
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So, I mean, it's really all but a given that NX is going to show up at E3 this year.

783
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,000
If not sooner, but certainly by E3, I think we'll finally have a name and kind of know what the catch is with this.

784
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:52,000
If we haven't already figured it out, which a lot of folks speculating based on prior reports that it's going to be similar to a Wii U, but the tablet is simply a fully functional handheld system.

785
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And that is the NX ecosystem, essentially. And apparently it will run Unreal and Unity, because it has to.

786
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Well, Unreal is scalable, so that's the point. Hell, remember, there are Unreal games that are on Android devices and iOS devices, so it makes sense.

787
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And Dungeon Buster reminding us that Iwata, before he passed away, did ask everyone to look forward to E3 this year for NX news, so it would be, you know, on track for them.

788
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And SSG100Matt says Nintendo can take their time in releasing this. I'd rather they release it later and get it right.

789
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Well, you know, we had an earlier rumor, and this was even something I had thrown out there as a suggestion in early January, that maybe one will predate the other.

790
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
That maybe we'll have the handheld this year, but we won't necessarily have the console until later on.

791
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Why not split up when they're going to ask for your money?

792
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Instead of making you pay $600 all at once, or whatever it's going to end up being, get your $250 for the handheld and your $300 for the console, or whatever it is.

793
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm throwing arbitrary numbers out there. But get that separated a little bit so it doesn't feel like such a punch.

794
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I really feel like that's the direction Nintendo's got to go to get more people to adopt this, is basically sucker people into buying two systems.

795
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Which, to be fair, most Nintendo fans already have a Wii U and a 3DS. It's not going to be anything different. It's just that they'll work together.

796
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Logie, I feel like you're trying to start dying to say something over there.

797
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I just want the PlayStation VR this year, so, you know, I can play that.

798
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
There is that. That might be the thing you hear more about at GDC.

799
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I hope we get some sort of price for it soon. I mean, maybe, I think it's going to be close to the holiday that we hear the price about it.

800
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
We'll probably know the release date around E3 and maybe the price around the holiday.

801
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
See, the PlayStation VR is supposed to be out the first half of the year. So...

802
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I hope that's the case. I'd love to pick it up.

803
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I really think there's...

804
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Because that's a system I know that'll at least run VR, because my laptop ain't cutting it.

805
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
There's no other real time I can think of for them to say anything about it other than GDC.

806
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Or they're going to have to wait until E3. Or, you know, it's Sony.

807
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
They could throw another event whenever they want.

808
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Are they? I mean, can I order them?

809
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't believe so. I think a listing was spotted, and that's where the price supposedly leaked out from.

810
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But I don't think that was an intended mass thing yet.

811
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Because you can't really pre-order something you don't necessarily know the price for.

812
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Well, GameStop would disagree with you.

813
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
That's true, that's true.

814
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Alright, moving on. Before we get to release dates, start Sakura.

815
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Oh, I guess.

816
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So, for fans who love their old Windows 3.1 games, which are some of my very, very fond memories back on a 486.

817
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:58,000
The Internet Archive, which is a non-profit that's devoted to basically creating an online archive for anything digital, I guess.

818
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They've added a bunch of DOS games about a year ago up there.

819
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,000
But now they've expanded it to include over a thousand Windows 3.1 games and programs.

820
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Like the article that I got my information from shows a picture of Election 92 that you can play. Who remembers that?

821
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I don't, but I remember Minesweeper.

822
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But they have the various list of programs up there, and the entire archive is available.

823
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So I would most assuredly say, you know, check it out.

824
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
See what's up there, because you might find an old treasure that you forgot about, you know.

825
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Just looking through the archive list, and yeah, the website is at archive.org slash details slash software library underscore win three.

826
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Which they had previously already done a bunch of old DOS releases, you know.

827
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That's, yeah, about a year ago.

828
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So yeah, oh my god, that was about a year ago. So now we're moving into the Windows era, so that's pretty cool.

829
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Yeah, just looking at some of the ones on here, we have the Windows 3.1.1 stock installation.

830
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:19,000
We have Sea Battle, Travel and Ted, Pharaoh's Curse, 3D Maze, The Spooky Door.

831
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I don't remember any of these games.

832
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Battlestar, some of these I did play, Monopoly Deluxe, Windows Risk, TDK Pinball.

833
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Oh, I wonder if something like CivNet or one of those old Civilization games you have on there.

834
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Windows 3.1 WinTrek, remember that Star Trek game.

835
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Click and Play.

836
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
SSG100 Matt is asking if Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is on there. God, I hope so.

837
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I'm looking, Brainwave 2, RoboWin, Blob Factory.

838
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Alright, don't name all the games, I'll be here all night.

839
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
No, I'm just looking through it just to see if I can find any in particular that are, yeah, I should see if I can see them on there.

840
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
But yeah, there's just a ton of stuff on here, so.

841
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Go dig through yourself. Find a game to play for 30 seconds before you move on to the next one.

842
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Spooky Door.

843
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The Spooky Door.

844
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It actually has so many O's in both of them.

845
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Better than the Spooky Door.

846
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Better than the Poopy Door.

847
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Now this is funny, it has Autodesk 3D Studio 3 on it.

848
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Really?

849
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
That's old school.

850
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Very old school. I like the fact that there's just like the stock Windows installation.

851
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Hey, wanna play around with the Windows 3.1 desktop just for fun?

852
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It was the 3.1.1.

853
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Oh, excuse me, DarkSagra. 3.1.1 installation.

854
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Actually, Wheel of Fortune's on here.

855
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Wow.

856
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
You have the old Windows Wheel of Fortune. I'm just trying to see.

857
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Do they have Jeopardy 2 so you can get all the 90's answers in there?

858
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Try going back and playing a game like Jeopardy on an old system. It asks you questions from that era.

859
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And it's like, oh my god.

860
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Dan was doing that with Puzzle and Dragons.

861
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Or playing The Price is Right will fuck you up.

862
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Tamagotchi for Windows.

863
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Alright.

864
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Crazy.

865
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Let's move on.

866
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:09,000
We're gonna talk about what games you can play in the here and now this week as we travel around the world and look at release dates. Loki starting in the US.

867
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Alright, so this week, quite a bit of stuff's coming out.

868
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So, let's see. Let's start with Street Fighter V. That'll be coming out on Playstation 4 as well as PC.

869
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Then we've got Project X Zone 2 on 3DS.

870
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And Return. Let's see. That's not coming out this week.

871
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It's not even in order. That makes no sense.

872
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
On Friday, we have Fire Emblem Fates Conquest.

873
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
With, let's see here.

874
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Bayonetta 2 is getting re-released, looks like, on Wii U.

875
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't know if that's a price drop, maybe.

876
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It looks like a price drop.

877
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And Fire Emblem Fates Birthright and Fire Emblem Fates Conquest.

878
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Both coming out on Friday.

879
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And that would be it.

880
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Alright, let's go over to Japan where Street Fighter V is also coming out over there.

881
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And I know a lot of people are very excited about that.

882
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
That will be on February 18th for Street Fighter V.

883
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
On the Playstation 4, there's also a hot package which I think just has some of the extra skins like Daddy Ryu and stuff.

884
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
There's also a full system bundle that's gonna be coming out with Street Fighter V included.

885
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So I'm sure some people are very much looking forward to that.

886
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
But that's not the only release on the Playstation 4 in Japan this week.

887
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You can also get Shingeki no Kaioujin is coming out this week.

888
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
That is Attack on Titan.

889
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yay! I want that, like, a lot.

890
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Playstation 4 region free, right?

891
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
So that's something you can do.

892
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah, I got Puyo Puyo.

893
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
That's right. So you can do it if you wanted to.

894
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Puyo Puyo.

895
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Going over to the Wii U.

896
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Nothing.

897
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
For a long time.

898
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So let's go over to the Vita, which, the Vita has more releases than the Wii U in Japan.

899
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That Shingeki no Kaioujin is also out on the Playstation Vita.

900
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Kankole- what?

901
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Kyojin.

902
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
One of these days.

903
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Kankole Kai comes out on the Vita as well.

904
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Ikene Tu Yuki no Setsuna also comes out on the Playstation Vita.

905
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So a little bit of a busy week over there in Japan, especially with Street Fighter V.

906
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Let's go over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

907
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I don't wanna go.

908
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
We're not physically going there, we're just mentally going there.

909
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I know, I actually lost my place on the webpage.

910
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
To talk about their release date.

911
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Excuse me, princess.

912
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Okay, so on the 16th, we have Layers of Fear for the Mac.

913
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And then The Escapist, The Walking Dead for PS4.

914
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,000
On the 17th, Californium on Mac and PC, and Rainbow Moon on PS4.

915
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And that's it for the week.

916
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

917
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But first, Loki.

918
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Alright, so I think we talked about this before, but Ubisoft has confirmed that there will not be a new Assassin's Creed game this year.

919
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And instead Watch Dogs will be coming, which may not necessarily make it out this year as well.

920
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's supposed to be out by March of 2017 though, so expect that.

921
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And basically saying, this year we are stepping back and reexamining the Assassin's Creed franchise.

922
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
As a result, we decided that there will not be a new Assassin's Creed game in 2016 since the release of Assassin's Creed Unity.

923
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
We've learned a lot based on your feedback, because it was really terrible.

924
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:44,000
We've also updated our development process and recommitted to making Assassin's Creed a premier open world franchise, blah blah blah blah blah, PR speak.

925
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Okay, so that's all you need to know about that.

926
01:01:47,000 --> 01:02:08,000
What is on their table though, between now and the end of March 2017, For Honor, South Park, The Fractured But Whole, Ghost Recon Wildlands, and of course the new Watch Dogs game, and some other AAA titles.

927
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I am excited about the South Park game.

928
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, South Park's game is definitely one I gotta check out.

929
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It reminds me, I gotta go back and finish the South Park game.

930
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And yeah, a lot of people picked up that other South Park game, The Stick of Truth. It's pretty amazing.

931
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Speaking of which, South Park, The Stick of Truth, has sold 5 million copies.

932
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
5 million copies. So, maybe we can sell a few more in anticipation of the sequel.

933
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Definitely play it if you haven't yet, because it is a fantastic game. It is basically the show. I mean...

934
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's a really long episode of the show.

935
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Really long episode of the show. I mean, it is fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about the game.

936
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Alright. Well, moving on to one more story here that's actually a really big deal that happened in gaming this week that we should talk about.

937
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And that is that Amazon has released a new game engine, and they've released it for free.

938
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So, right now out there, you hear a lot of people often talking about Unity or they're talking about Unreal Engine.

939
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Well, a new 3D game engine was released by Amazon, and it's called Lumberyard.

940
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And this is going to allow you to create games for the PC or consoles and mobile.

941
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It is based in part on the CryEngine, but there's other tech and code that comes from Double Helix.

942
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I believe Amazon had acquired them some time ago, who had made Killer Instinct on Xbox One.

943
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:40,000
There's also some Amazon AWS code, and it's really going to focus on multiplayer and social games and where online instances are important.

944
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And that's pretty cool because that is how Amazon is essentially quote-unquote monetizing it.

945
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Because by them integrating the Amazon web services into it and the whole cloud and using that for the multiplayer,

946
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:03,000
that's how they're essentially making money off of it is because if you use the easily built-in multiplayer stuff, it's going to integrate with Amazon.

947
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And not just that, but the whole social element where Twitch TV, you're going to be able to have your game have those interactions with Twitch very easily.

948
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And I'm not just talking about streaming the game on Twitch.

949
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm talking about like when people type things on chat and it does things in the game, that is all integrated into Lumberyard as well.

950
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
So this is interesting how Amazon is using a game engine to essentially bolster their other properties.

951
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I almost have to wonder at some point if, I don't want to necessarily say the word antitrust, but it's going to come to a point where there's too many hands-in-hands going on in Amazon.

952
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I think this might be about the limit. So we'll see.

953
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,000
But I mean, I don't see this as negative necessarily. I think more options are a great thing.

954
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And having this engine that's going to be completely free is going to be extremely competitive and probably get more people out there actually making games.

955
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:01,000
By the way, Gamelift is the other side of this and that is where you actually create the session-based multiplayer games.

956
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That's not necessarily directly in Lumberyard, but obviously those two are pretty much hand-in-hand.

957
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So Lumberyard will support PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Supposedly mobile and VR support also coming to Lumberyard.

958
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Akuma JP points out in chat, Lumberyard is basically CryEngine equals UI disaster.

959
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So it may be something you, I don't know if Amazon's polished it up or what, but it may be something you have to spend a little bit of time learning.

960
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I can't imagine Amazon wouldn't put something out there though that they don't have a really good support at like teaching people how to use.

961
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But I think at the end of the day, you know, different programmers are going to prefer different things.

962
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And it might be really hard to pull somebody who's been doing Unity off of that into Lumberyard.

963
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I don't know, Loki, you use these things way more than I do. What do you think when you hear about this?

964
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Is this something where you're like, hmm, I want to check this out or nah, I need to look at it.

965
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I know Crytek was available for a while. I mean, it's still available, but like, I don't know if I would try to use that.

966
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I mean, it's free. I was going to download it, but it's 10 gigs right now, so obviously I'm not going to download that right now.

967
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
But I'll take a look at it, I guess. I mean, it just depends on what it looks like.

968
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And I don't really have anything that would necessarily need to use this to make.

969
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I mean, like, I don't know. I'll stick with what I'm comfortable with for right now.

970
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But it's good to have alternatives, I guess. I like the Twitch integration thing. That's kind of cool.

971
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah. It'd be very interesting to see what Twitch looks like a couple years from now, where it's not just watching people playing games, it's interacting with people playing games.

972
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It's going to be very, very, I mean, that's already out there in some capacity.

973
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I want to say right now, or in the very near future, is when Twitch is celebrating the Pokemon, or Twitch plays Pokemon, things like the second anniversary of that whole thing.

974
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And that was kind of the little pebble that started the avalanche of more interaction in streams.

975
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Yeah, that was ridiculous. Who would have thought that you could have had a group of people just play Pokemon in that manner?

976
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And played through, like, most of the games.

977
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Yeah. I think they beat it. I'm pretty sure they beat it.

978
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Did the fish ever play in Pokemon ever finish Pokemon?

979
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I don't know if any of those other, I mean, there was a lot of knockoffs after that, and I didn't really follow any of those.

980
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Alright, let's move on. Let's go back to a simpler time where, you know what, the internet, there was no internet, actually.

981
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:41,000
There was no internet, so there was nobody to yell at you at what you were doing wrong while you were playing a game besides, you know, maybe somebody who was sitting in the room with you.

982
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The classic game of the week.

983
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Darsakha's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, put down, get out of the lumber yard.

984
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Get over here and check out this classic before you start a new game.

985
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Darsakha, what did you choose for the classic game tonight?

986
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I chose Chubby Cherub, which is stupid because it's not even a love game.

987
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
But I was like, Dan, pick a game that has a Valentine theme.

988
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Chubby Cherub? I'm like, no, but it'll work.

989
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So, Chubby Cherub was known in Japan as...

990
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Sorry, here's the music. Sorry, I did the wrong part there.

991
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It has cute music because it's a cute Bandai game.

992
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But in Japan it was known as Obake no Kyutaro 1-1 Panic, which translates to Kyutaro the Ghost Bow-Wow Panic.

993
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And I'm gonna stop there and tell you what Obake no Kyutaro is.

994
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So, basically Obake no Kyutaro was a comic from like 1964 and then again in the 70s and it had a couple of anime series

995
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:53,000
about a ghost that likes to go around, scare people, and steal food.

996
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And he's very, very afraid of dogs.

997
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And he hangs out with some human kid.

998
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I gotta look up the name again.

999
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Named Shota. So, that's where that comes from.

1000
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
In the US, of course, no one knows who Kyutaro is.

1001
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So, they remade the game into Chubby Cherub with a cute little naked blonde cherub baby running around.

1002
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Of course, with that old school 80s Bandai artwork.

1003
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Okay, maybe I'm an idiot, but I don't know a lot about this game.

1004
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I always thought it was a tongue-in-cheek reference to Chubby Checkers.

1005
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
No. Nothing to do with it.

1006
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
This whole time, I always thought Chubby Cherub was a silly little play on, you know, the famous, you know, from the 50s.

1007
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Chubby Checkers.

1008
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Come on, baby.

1009
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah, and I thought...

1010
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Let's do that, please.

1011
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Exactly! Everybody knows that, right?

1012
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yeah.

1013
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Oh my gosh.

1014
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Not Chubby Checker.

1015
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So, now that you stand corrected, you know, 30 years later...

1016
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I gotta be honest, though.

1017
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's a stupid little game.

1018
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You know, I love and respect your opinions, DarkSakura, but this game kind of looks like shit.

1019
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
It is shit.

1020
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But it's classic shit.

1021
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And it's like in Valentine's Day, and Dan picked...

1022
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Proof that Dan can pick a shitty game.

1023
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I would have thought that, you know, a good pick would have been Chulip, which is a kissing game.

1024
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Maybe next time.

1025
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I don't think that's even old enough.

1026
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
It's 2002, actually.

1027
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Oh, maybe next time.

1028
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Maybe next time.

1029
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
No, that's alright.

1030
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So, anyway...

1031
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
This is the game, too, that...

1032
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Maybe we're gonna say it.

1033
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

1034
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
The misspelling.

1035
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Can I say that?

1036
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Do it.

1037
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
The congratulation.

1038
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Because I actually see that on the screen right now.

1039
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Anyway, basically, to go back to the original game, Kyutaro's friends are kidnapped by burglars.

1040
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And so Kyutaro has to save them.

1041
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But there are many dogs in the way, and that's why I went back to say things about Kyutaro.

1042
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
He is afraid of dogs.

1043
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So, basically, he has to cross 12 levels, and at the end of each, he's got a protagonist...

1044
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Wait, why did I say protagonist?

1045
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
An antagonist.

1046
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
A different, you know, fight he has to do.

1047
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
He saves his friends.

1048
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And he eats food that keeps his flight up.

1049
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But if the flying meter goes all the way down, he'll have to stay on the ground and walk around.

1050
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
And he can bark at the dogs before they bark at him.

1051
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And if his bark hits the character...

1052
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
If the bark hits Kyutaro, then he dies.

1053
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
There are heaven and hell stages.

1054
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So when he goes down on one of the stages when there's a down, he goes to hell.

1055
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And it's dark and he can't see anything and he can't fly.

1056
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Or when he touches a dog...

1057
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
When he gets touched by a dog, it acts like a miss.

1058
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
But it keeps going until he gets to the exit.

1059
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So, I mean, the game is, like, not very well put together.

1060
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
The heaven stages basically are scrolling stages.

1061
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And he gets warped all the way through the levels.

1062
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So, anyway, like I said, it's not a very good game.

1063
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So, their main character is Kyutaro, or in the US, Chubby Cherub.

1064
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And they fly through the air or walk on the ground.

1065
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Flying has a meter, which, like I said, if it drops low, he has to walk around.

1066
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Lollipops give him the ability to shoot four shots at the dogs and other food replenishes the meter.

1067
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And it's funny, though, because the person who did Kyutaro was Huchiko Fujio.

1068
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And I think it's cool that the original artist for Kyutaro no Obake did the drawing of Chubby Cherub.

1069
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
So that was pretty cool.

1070
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Beagles are the main enemies in the game.

1071
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
They also have bulldogs. They're not very fast, but they bark a lot more.

1072
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Damn those bulldogs.

1073
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And there's cats.

1074
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Cats are really not so much of a threat, but they're pretty much impossible to get rid of.

1075
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
They just kind of get in the way.

1076
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Yeah.

1077
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Meow, meow, meow.

1078
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
As cats tend to do.

1079
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Yeah.

1080
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
They're just kind of sitting there wanting to be fed.

1081
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:13,000
This was listed as the 50th worst nest game of all time.

1082
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Sean Riley, the reviewer, said that the graphics were-

1083
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Is that Sean Baby?

1084
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I guess.

1085
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It might be. I just remember when that guy was everywhere.

1086
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Hold on. Yeah, Sean Baby.

1087
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1088
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Described the game as ugly and that the cartridge was a waste of plastic and could be used for many other things.

1089
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So, thank you, Dan, for this suggestion of an awful game based-

1090
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,000
That was a revamping of another really awful game based on an actually pretty cute manga series.

1091
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Well, what a shitty way to wish everybody a Valentine's Day.

1092
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Have a shitty Valentine's Day, everybody.

1093
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
At least it didn't tell them to play Back to the Future.

1094
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
That would be pretty bad.

1095
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I can't believe that this playthrough-

1096
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
But it has really cute music.

1097
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,000
It does have cute music for an 8-bit game, but I can't believe that this playthrough that this person's doing goes on for an hour and 20 minutes.

1098
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I would not be able to tolerate this for an hour and 20 minutes.

1099
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
But then again, our tastes were so different back in the day on the NES, you know?

1100
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Like, repetitive games, it's all good.

1101
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
You know what game that I actually- I haven't done a review of it yet, I think.

1102
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But it just used to piss me off so much because I'd play it for like 5 minutes and be like,

1103
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
There's no end to this game ever, was MagMax.

1104
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Did you ever play that?

1105
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Oh, God.

1106
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Hated it.

1107
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yeah.

1108
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But I would play it because I'd be like, I'm done with Dr. Mario and I'm gonna play MagMax.

1109
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And it was only when I was visiting my family in Dothan.

1110
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1111
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And you know what? Sometimes games are classically bad, okay?

1112
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
You know what?

1113
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Chubby Cherub.

1114
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
If I were to do, like, my Jamie explains you a thing podcast, I'm just gonna have this section that's called Game Shit.

1115
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Where it's gonna be- it's gonna have the GameStop logo on it, but it'll be Game Shit.

1116
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Or the Smashburger logo, you mean?

1117
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Whatever. Smashburger took it from- GameStop had it first.

1118
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
No, I know. But you could do Game Shit while eating Smashburger.

1119
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
No...

1120
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
The problem is Smashburger doesn't accept my trades, so, you know.

1121
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm just- yeah, I'm gonna have a segment called Game Shit and Girl No.

1122
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Alright, we're gonna take a break, guys.

1123
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
We have had a lot of show so far, but we've got plenty more to come, including when we come back for the quick break.

1124
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Rapid Fire News, we're gonna do, as well as talking about a potential sequel to a game I really didn't think was going to get a sequel, but it might.

1125
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And a very interesting movie and game tie-in, and then your calls as well over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1126
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Or the old-fashioned way, 1-877-GAME-OLR. We're also gonna get to your emails when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1127
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 631 for this February the 14th of 2016.

1128
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Happy Valentine's Day to all of our listeners, or, you know, Singles Awareness Day, whatever it is that you're celebrating out there, but hope you have a good day.

1129
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Happy Deadpool Weekend.

1130
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Happy what?

1131
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Happy Deadpool Weekend.

1132
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Happy Deadpool Weekend, which apparently is doing huge at the box office, from what I'm hearing, so.

1133
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But, you know, I feel bad because Alan and I did a really nice Valentine's Day dinner on Friday.

1134
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And then after that, he was like, well, so do you wanna go see a movie? He's like, I wanna go see Deadpool.

1135
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And I was like, ugh. Now, I wanna see, don't get me wrong, I wanna see Deadpool, but I don't wanna see it opening weekend with all the kids.

1136
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
We're going tomorrow.

1137
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And all the frickin', you know, noisy teenagers. And I tell you about how I hate seeing movies with noisy teenagers, and you know there's gonna be a ton of them at Deadpool, so.

1138
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Well, you're such an old man now.

1139
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I really am. Damn those kids!

1140
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Except I'm the one who's having the old birthday, but oh well.

1141
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Whatever. But, hey, I'm looking forward to your birthday celebration, so I can't believe how fast this year is moving already. Crazy.

1142
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And, of course, I just keep wishing that the 2016 Angel of Death would go visit Ted Nugent.

1143
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
You know. As long as you're getting rock stars, go after Ted.

1144
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Alright, look, let's move on. We gotta get some rapid fire news here in gaming, so let's start off with Loki.

1145
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Alright, so Sega, they're releasing a collection of their Sega 3D Classics as part of the Sega 3D Classics collection on 3DS.

1146
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And along with that, if you happen to be one of the first ones that purchases the game, you'll get some stickers!

1147
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:55,000
So they're gonna have a decal sheet with, like, Mega Drive, Genesis, some weird bunny, which I have no fucking clue what that's supposed to be for.

1148
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I'm assuming something has to do with the Genesis and Mega Drive, but who knows.

1149
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
But that's cool. And then, oh, here we go. It's probably gonna tell me right here.

1150
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Professor Asobin. I guess he was in the manual for the SG-1000.

1151
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Okay. Well, didn't know that. Cool. And, yeah. So when is that coming out? No fucking clue.

1152
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:29,000
But soon, though. April 26th. $29.99. 3DS. Pick it up.

1153
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:37,000
This is kinda cool. And I may have to plug my internet back in on my PlayStation 4, but Earth Defense Force 4.1 has some DLC out.

1154
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And the best part about it? It's free! For the first two weeks.

1155
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:49,000
So with that, you're gonna get a couple missions. So they've got the Mission Pack 2 Extreme Battle and Time of the Mutants.

1156
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And that's gonna be 23 new missions. I guess 26 in the first add-on. And that's pretty awesome.

1157
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And after the two-week period, it's gonna be $10. So pick it up now.

1158
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And then finally, Mega Man is gonna be coming to Nintendo Badge Arcade.

1159
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Oh, yay. That shit.

1160
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So you can waste virtual currency getting badges for your 3DS if you really want to dump that money on that kind of stuff.

1161
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I still don't understand the point of that stuff. I really don't. And I know people that are really into it.

1162
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And it's like, I can't. I can't with that badge arcade thing on 3DS. It seems like the biggest waste of money.

1163
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:38,000
But you know what? Spend your money. If it makes you happy, go for it. Go for it.

1164
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Alright, moving on. Let's talk about Pokemon. Because you know it is the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.

1165
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So Nintendo is rolling out lots of different celebrations for the Pokemons.

1166
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And Super Mario Maker is going to be getting some Pokemon-related content.

1167
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle, which as you may recall were the original three Pokemon before Pikachu and the cartoon and all that stuff.

1168
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And they had to do Pokemon Yellow. Those are the starter Pokemon.

1169
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
There's an event course and you can unlock Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle costumes.

1170
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:19,000
They are three separate costumes and they actually will provide retro sound effects when you complete courses and things like that.

1171
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Keep in mind, you know, if you want to get a Pikachu skin, there already is a Pikachu amiibo you can use to get it.

1172
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Or playing through the courses as many times as it takes to unlock it, you can do it that way.

1173
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
My understanding is you have to actually beat this course three separate times to unlock each costume.

1174
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
So that's kind of a neat little twist in that for what it is.

1175
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Speaking of Pokemon, a lot of people looking forward to Pokemon Go.

1176
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I have to admit, I was really nervous about Pokemon Go when I first heard about it.

1177
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
But the more I think about it, the more excited I think I am for Pokemon Go.

1178
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But there's a lot of beta scams going on for Pokemon Go.

1179
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:05,000
So there's been kind of a push to let people know that if you see a beta sign up out there for Pokemon Go, it's fake.

1180
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Now Niantic did say, Niantic of course, the developers of Ingress, which we've talked about also on this program before,

1181
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
even though Niantic has said that there is going to be a closed beta that will take place in the winter,

1182
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
they haven't really given any updates since then.

1183
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So my advice, if you see a Pokemon Go thing on Facebook that sounds too good to be true, it is.

1184
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Wait and look for something official to come from Niantic or to come from Nintendo themselves.

1185
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And you know when this news comes out, it will be all over Twitter.

1186
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
It will be all over the gaming news sites.

1187
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Everybody's going to tell you about the official beta once it's out.

1188
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Niantic will say something under Google Plus and it will be out everywhere.

1189
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And also a couple of the Pokemon fan sites have said that there's indications that the game's release is going to be in mid-March anyway.

1190
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
So I just found a post on it just a moment ago.

1191
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
That would be great because I know not everybody knows the inner workings of Ingress necessarily unless you've played.

1192
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But a lot of people in Ingress are going to be getting a very important badge right at the end of this month.

1193
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
It's a badge called Sojourner and it means that you have hacked every single day for an entire year.

1194
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And that's what they call a black Sojourner badge. You're going to get that at the end of February.

1195
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I'm not.

1196
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And I know, well, because you're newer to the game and so is Loki.

1197
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But when I know when I and I've been hacking every single freaking day and you better believe I looked up.

1198
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
OK, when I go to Magfest, are there portals nearby? Am I going to be OK? Yes, I am.

1199
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Once I get that black Sojourner badge, it's going to be like relief.

1200
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Now I now I can now I can put the game away for a few days.

1201
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I can take a well-deserved vacation from Ingress until the bat phone goes off.

1202
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Rob, can you drop this link somewhere in the middle of nowhere?

1203
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Oh, OK. Anyway, I'm still looking forward to Pokemon Go.

1204
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Let's talk about Silent Hills. Yet again, the game that never was still continues to show up in the news somehow.

1205
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Like at least every month we have some damn story on Silent Hills.

1206
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But this is a pretty good one and it's a Twitter story, but it comes from Cliffy B.

1207
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And Cliffy B had tweeted earlier this week that Kojima once told me he wanted me to do a new Silent Hill with him together out of L.A.

1208
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I was flattered, but declined. And he replied when somebody asked him about it, saying,

1209
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I don't like L.A. I love new IPs and I would have fucked up Silent Hill.

1210
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So interesting that he confesses that I would have fucked it up.

1211
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You know what? He'd probably be actually pretty good about doing a new zone or was it a Zone of Enders game?

1212
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Because I think, you know, the combat and gears is pretty awesome.

1213
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And that's more of a combat focused game. I think pretty sweet. Right.

1214
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
So, yeah. And then if you can imagine, he might have joined that Dream Team lineup.

1215
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I mean, this would have been a really kick ass game.

1216
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Maybe that's part of what was making it so damn expensive and why Konami pulled the plug on it.

1217
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I don't know. But then again, that would be trying to apply logic to a Konami 2015-2016 scenario, which I don't think is possible anymore.

1218
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So...

1219
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I just don't care anymore.

1220
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yep.

1221
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And let's say the Onu DDR announcement, in which case I still don't care because it's probably going to be mobile or arcade game I'm never going to play.

1222
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Yeah. How about Dark Sakura? What do you have for us before we get to the Fugu question?

1223
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Well, there is Hatsune Miku news.

1224
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Basically, our favorite virtual idol is going to be going around with...

1225
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Anamanaguchi. I'm going to mispronounce this. Anamanaguchi.

1226
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Anamanaguchi. Yeah.

1227
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Anamanaguchi.

1228
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I'm a little gooey.

1229
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Just think of Anamanapia, but with Gucci at the end.

1230
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
But without an O in it either.

1231
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yeah.

1232
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So basically, the tour is going to start off in Seattle on April 23rd, right after my birthday if someone wants to take me to the San Francisco one.

1233
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And going to be going around with a really awesome chiptune band.

1234
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And she's got that makeover from Nomura, which is pretty cool too.

1235
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Future of the Final Fantasy All-Star Carnival has a teaser out and about.

1236
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's going to be...

1237
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Is this an arcade game?

1238
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah, it's an arcade game.

1239
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
That's going to have two buttons and two joystick sliders.

1240
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And it will let you play across the country, of course, in Japan.

1241
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:34,000
So you can enjoy the game with other people with cute little chibi versions of all your favorite characters.

1242
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And Zoe Quinn, which we know her for being a big icon with this whole, I guess, gamer gate deal, has dropped the harassment suit against her ex.

1243
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And she actually put out a statement that said, ironically, getting a restraining order against him was the least effective thing I could do in terms of getting him out of my life for good and for protecting myself.

1244
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
When you seek charges, you're on trial as much as the other person, if not more.

1245
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:24,000
And then she's also saying that there was the near impossibility of how to create a case for online harassment when basically all the people in the deciding capacity, they don't know how the internet works.

1246
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And one person told her to give up her career and stop going online if she didn't like the abuse, which is stupid, absolutely stupid.

1247
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:49,000
She put out everything publicly, so it's basically done. But she says she's still going to work for trying to educate and reform so that the next person who experiences won't have the same thing happen to them.

1248
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Sometimes you're just done with bullshit.

1249
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Yeah, sometimes you just gotta say, I'm just cutting this fuck, I'm just severing this limb. I'm cutting this fuckery out of my life. Done.

1250
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we would be moving on to the FUGL Question of the Week.

1251
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Thanks for having a good home.

1252
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

1253
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And we read some selected answers to a question that I forgot to post.

1254
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Oh, Rob.

1255
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Good job.

1256
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I was so busy preparing the clips and all that stuff for the announcement show tonight that I was like, I feel like I'm forgetting something. You ever have that feeling when you're like leaving the house, like I'm forgetting something, I'm leaving something at home?

1257
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Did I leave the stove on?

1258
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Yeah, did I leave the stove on?

1259
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Did I feed the cat?

1260
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Did I post the FUGL question?

1261
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Did I leave the stove on the cat?

1262
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Did I leave the cat on the stove?

1263
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Well, sg100matt in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com actually says, I thought you didn't put one up because of the delayed start due to the announcements between shows.

1264
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Yes, that is it. Thank you.

1265
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
sg100matt, you read my mind. That is it.

1266
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That is why there is no FUGL question this week.

1267
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Alright, here it is.

1268
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:24,000
No, I actually had thought of a question, so we're going to do this the Bill O'Reilly way, the classic YouTube clip.

1269
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Fuck it. We'll do it live.

1270
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So we're going to do a little bit of a live way of doing this in our chat room.

1271
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So, here's the question I was going to ask.

1272
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Since it is Valentine's Day, I wanted to know what is your favorite couple, romance, love story type of thing in a video game?

1273
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
What's your favorite romance, love, awe?

1274
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And it could even be, I would say that a close friendship type of love.

1275
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:57,000
It doesn't necessarily have to be like, you know, hearts in the eyes love, but it could be like a deep, deep friendship love too.

1276
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
What is your favorite kind of love story in a video game?

1277
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
So, if you guys want to answer in our chat room, I'll read some of those answers live.

1278
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
What do you guys think? Loki, you're laughing over there. What is it?

1279
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Oh, Bobby.

1280
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
What? Oh, God. Bobby. Oh, God. Bobby.

1281
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Black Wolf says, Custer's Revenge.

1282
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It was a forbidden love.

1283
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Are you trying to get this show canceled?

1284
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Bobby Black Wolf.

1285
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
That's not okay. That answer is, that is stricken from the list.

1286
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
A Dark Sakura. I have a feeling I know where you might go with this, but I'm going to ask anyway.

1287
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Favorite romance in a game? Favorite romance story?

1288
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Getting boned by Cullen on a table.

1289
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
That's pretty romantic.

1290
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
For Dragon Age, right? Or Dragon Age Inquisition specifically.

1291
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:53,000
All the Garris romance. I mean, I like that our games these days, you know, give us the option for who we want to romance and how we want to romance them.

1292
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And then how much crying we want to do at the end when, I'm sorry, not Solas. I'm not going to talk about Dragon Age.

1293
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:11,000
But, you know, if you have your classic games where it was written into the story, there was, and I took it as a full on canon romance, was Selleys and Locke in Final Fantasy 6 slash 3.

1294
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:18,000
You know what? My answer actually, it's funny you bring up the Final Fantasy series because my answer, not to totally cut you off, but I'm just piggybacking on it.

1295
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:28,000
My answer would be from Final Fantasy 4, Cecil and Rosa. I mean that, I mean, and that was like growing up as a kid when it was Final Fantasy 2 to me.

1296
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,000
That was like one of the first games I really remember having such a rich story. And I think that's why I'm so attached to it.

1297
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:43,000
But that, you know, love plot that went in between Cecil and Rosa, that's always going to be like, they're my, what do they call it? It's my original OTP. What do they call that?

1298
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It's your OTP.

1299
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Yeah.

1300
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
One True Pairing.

1301
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:53,000
One True Pairing. That's it. That's my OTP. In video games, it's Cecil and Rosa. Sorry, Dr. Stalker, I didn't mean to cut you off. Did you have a further thought with what you were saying?

1302
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
See now the love theme is in my head from the Celtic Moon CD.

1303
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Oh, good call because that actually had a romance theme that went, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1304
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Yeah.

1305
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,000
The Celtic Moon version was wild cats sing the Final Fantasy 4 soundtrack.

1306
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And anywho, even though Final Fantasy 8 was not the best of games, I will say that it did like Leon and What's Your Fuck.

1307
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Actually, no, I'm going to take that back. I'm going to take that back. As much as I liked Rinoa, I really, really liked Mr. Annoying, Tidus, and Yuna.

1308
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Yeah.

1309
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Especially the reunion, if you got the good ending for 10-2, because what can I do for you?

1310
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
That was, you know, that was like the Final Fantasy series and a whole other cinematic level.

1311
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I bawled my freaking eyes out when I saw the ending.

1312
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Yeah.

1313
01:31:51,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And then like the whole, you know, the fact that she's going through the whole game based on having seen a glimpse that he might still be around.

1314
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You know, it's just a thing that, you know, just because the person in your life is gone doesn't mean that you stop loving them.

1315
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
You know, for her and not all intents and purposes, he died.

1316
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Yeah.

1317
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:19,000
But that doesn't mean that you still might seek things that remind you of them or, you know, keep that memory alive for you.

1318
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And that was really what got me about 10-2.

1319
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
You know, just riding this Final Fantasy wave because, you know, when the stories are done right, they're right.

1320
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:34,000
But I will say without, I mean, honestly, this is a how many year old game at this point. I have total license to spoil this game.

1321
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
But Final Fantasy 13, without saying too much, you know, and talking about, I said the relationships don't necessarily have to be romantic, right?

1322
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
What about the relationship between Lightning and her sister Sarah in that game?

1323
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Yeah, totally.

1324
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And then the ending of that game. And then I would argue in that game, and I've talked about, I've alluded to this before, but I didn't get into such spoiler territory.

1325
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I would say Fang and Vanille, if they weren't having a romantic relationship, they definitely had a deep love for each other.

1326
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And like all those, and then you have the Saz and his son, there's so many different love subplots in the game that like the ending of that game.

1327
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And I've said this before, the ending of Final Fantasy 13 specifically, I think because so many people poo-pooed that game because it was running down a giant hallway.

1328
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
A lot of people didn't get to the ending, but the ending for that game is short, but perfect.

1329
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I mean, it is, I love the ending. And it's also one of those cases where I think the US, where they actually put in the US music because they had the Leona Lewis song, was perfect.

1330
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It really was. I love 13's ending.

1331
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
What about the type of, what's a good word I'm thinking of, dutiful love?

1332
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
A bromance.

1333
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Not a bromance. Where like Snake and Big Boss.

1334
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Oh, okay. Okay.

1335
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Or not Big Boss Snake and whoever, what was her name? God, I can't remember now.

1336
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:04,000
But I'd almost say that when you have someone that you look up to that much, it's a type of love all on its own.

1337
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:12,000
It goes beyond respect. It's almost like a parental love, if that makes sense.

1338
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
You know, and funny enough, Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vonganetwork.com says, does it have to be male and female?

1339
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
The Japanese game makers then tend to sneak in some male on male stuff.

1340
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
No, I mean, you're asking a gay host of a video game podcast if it has to be male and female?

1341
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
No, I think love is all different types of forms and genders and everything.

1342
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I think you, not you, ActDeafed, I think that you actually missed me correcting myself.

1343
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So, whatever.

1344
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It's delayed, don't forget.

1345
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yeah. Anyway, I'm just trying to think of, because I, the term bromance, I hate, and I'm going to stop and take a quick rant.

1346
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Oh, dear.

1347
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Quick rant.

1348
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I hate shipping in some cases, because they will take characters who have a very good, close friendship.

1349
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
You know, I would even say that the friendship that borders on romantic or has romantic elements.

1350
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But, you know, just because there are two characters who have that deep and abiding thing, they got to be fucking.

1351
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
No, they don't have to be.

1352
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
They don't have to be.

1353
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It's because deep down inside, a lot of people really like porn, Dark Sakura.

1354
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And so, for some people.

1355
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It's over sexualizing in society.

1356
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I know.

1357
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You know, two people.

1358
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Well, I mean.

1359
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It doesn't take two people to over sexualize, though, either.

1360
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Well, I mean, I'm just saying, like, you know, there are even those deep friendships, you know, in our history, like Eleanor Roosevelt.

1361
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And my brain is not working history right now, but they wrote themselves, wrote a wonderful loving letters back and forth.

1362
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Yet now people saying, were they lesbian lovers?

1363
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
No.

1364
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
When did they meet up and scissor?

1365
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
That's what people want to know, right?

1366
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
No, I get it.

1367
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I get it.

1368
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Because by what you're saying, essentially, is that when people make these things about sex, it is invalidating that people can have a romantic relationship.

1369
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
A romantic relationship that doesn't involve sex.

1370
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Exactly. Exactly that.

1371
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I get it. I get it.

1372
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
And I mean, and there even is, you know, for like for the ace people out there, right?

1373
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
You can the type of.

1374
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Well, it doesn't even have to be about like for me.

1375
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Sorry, it doesn't even have to be about asexuality.

1376
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I mean, it can be.

1377
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,000
But like, you know, like for I can love a woman and still be comfortably gay.

1378
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:49,000
No, I mean, my my point is not necessarily like even an ace person will have a person, you know, can have a person that they are deeply in love with, you know, like their romantic partner.

1379
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Right.

1380
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Even if they have no interest in sleeping with them, that's still a different thing than a romantic friendship.

1381
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Does that make sense?

1382
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Yeah.

1383
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
It's a different kind of romance.

1384
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Just because two people love each other, it doesn't mean that they want to be in an eternal relationship and cohabitate and, you know, look at adopting cats together.

1385
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
But you know that Mario and Peach are fucking and toad watches, right?

1386
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
All right.

1387
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Anyway.

1388
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Pons006 in chat suggests bromance, Ken and Ryu.

1389
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
SSG100 Matt, interesting.

1390
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Top Gun was a dude movie back in the day.

1391
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Now people think that it's a gay themed movie.

1392
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Top Gun.

1393
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Thank you Cards Against Humanity for the sexually charged volleyball montage.

1394
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
You know what? That was around before Cards Against Humanity.

1395
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I know, I know, I know.

1396
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
All right.

1397
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
We didn't we didn't get an answer from Loki.

1398
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
What's your OTP for video games when it comes to romance and all that?

1399
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Probably the Heterolife partners of Sam and Max.

1400
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Because they're insane.

1401
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Of course, a Jay and Silent Bob style relationship.

1402
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Absolutely.

1403
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Heterolife mate.

1404
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Yeah, exactly.

1405
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I think that's awesome.

1406
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You got some laughs from our chat over there over at live.voggenetwork.com.

1407
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Sam and Max.

1408
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Or like, uh, Klonoa and Q-Pal.

1409
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
They were, you know, they were just, they were buds.

1410
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
They were buds.

1411
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
That's right.

1412
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
All right.

1413
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
There you go.

1414
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Our impromptu foogle question of the week there.

1415
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And I apologize to our fan communities there.

1416
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
But I will be more diligent about posting that in the future.

1417
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
When I'm not trying to multitask hopefully next week.

1418
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Or two weeks from now because there is no show next week.

1419
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1420
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1421
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Let's get back into some other news.

1422
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Loki.

1423
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,000
So apparently there is evidence that there is going to be a sequel to Knack coming out.

1424
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And this is coming from...

1425
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Why?

1426
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Because, I don't know.

1427
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It's a first party title and they wanted to, you know, give it another shot.

1428
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Maybe, you know, more people like it now.

1429
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
You never know.

1430
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,000
But this is coming from a LinkedIn resume for Mindy Liang.

1431
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And she's an animator basically crediting different things she's worked on.

1432
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
So Knack 2 is listed there.

1433
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Animated 3D character motions and cutscenes for PlayStation 4.

1434
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Including a screenshot.

1435
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
And so there's a screenshot of a Knack like character on fire.

1436
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So maybe that's something we're going to see.

1437
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:30,000
And hey, if you want to check out Knack it's only $8 right now on sale until the 15th I think.

1438
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I'm really surprised they still haven't made that a PlayStation Plus game.

1439
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I'm surprised too.

1440
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And maybe they will.

1441
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Probably the month before Knack 2 comes out.

1442
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Well, I don't think the month before but maybe like if they announce it during E3 or something

1443
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
they'll put it out for like, you know, free.

1444
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
To build hype a little bit.

1445
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Yeah, I mean it does.

1446
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I don't think it was a terrible game.

1447
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
It's just maybe not one people are necessarily interested in.

1448
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Maybe.

1449
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
And who's to say they can't fix it?

1450
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Just because one game is bad doesn't mean the next one's going to be like terrible as well.

1451
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
That's true.

1452
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I mean there are other games out there where the first one maybe wasn't so great

1453
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
and the second one greatly improved on it.

1454
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Of course I can't think of any in the moment but I know it's happened before in games where the sequel really...

1455
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Well, okay.

1456
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Some would argue, I don't know if I necessarily agree with this, but some would argue Mega Man.

1457
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Mega Man 2 outshined the original in many different ways.

1458
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
But see, the difference is I don't think the original Mega Man was a bad game at all.

1459
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Dance Dance Revolution, Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix.

1460
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Okay.

1461
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Or Beat Mania 2DX.

1462
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Only got better with Beat Mania 2DX way better than the original Beat Mania.

1463
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
So there are some games that age very well.

1464
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Oh, you never know.

1465
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Alright, anyhow.

1466
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Let's move on to somewhat of a sadder announcement.

1467
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
We have another gaming industry closure to talk about this week.

1468
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And that is the website GameTrailers.com closed its doors after 13 years this week.

1469
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Which, hmm, that means...

1470
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
That's shitty.

1471
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
They also started in 2002.

1472
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
And we started in 2002.

1473
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
And we outlived them.

1474
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Which I'm not saying that to be a bitch.

1475
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I'm just saying it's kind of humbling in a way.

1476
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
But yeah, Game Trailers unfortunately is shut down after 13 years.

1477
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And what was kind of shitty about it is that they were just told in the news the day it happened.

1478
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
They were given no notice.

1479
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Just that the lights went off, basically.

1480
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And so you had a lot of very confused people posting on Twitter.

1481
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Now, it should be noted, you know, Viacom sold it off a year ago.

1482
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And I think it went to a company that didn't really know what to do with it.

1483
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
So they kind of just ran it into the ground, unfortunately.

1484
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
That doesn't mean the people working there were pretty talented.

1485
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I distinctly remember as of recently, there's a clip going around from this past year's E3.

1486
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And it was from Game Trailer.

1487
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
And it was four individuals on the panel.

1488
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
One gal and three men.

1489
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And it's kind of like a reaction video.

1490
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
They're reacting to the press conference and the Final Fantasy VII Remake.

1491
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I swear, all these dudes are breaking down and crying while the girl's kind of watching and laughing at them.

1492
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,000
They're crying at the Final Fantasy VII Remake and then Shenmue 3.

1493
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And they're literally dancing and cheering and they're acting like kids.

1494
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
And I say that in a very positive way.

1495
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I think a lot of us were kind of feeling that watching that press conference this year.

1496
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:34,000
So I just know that's a recent Game Trailers thing that they've done very recently that was very well received out there.

1497
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Unfortunately, one moment like that wasn't really enough to carry the website.

1498
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Especially when Game Trailers kind of founded itself on, well, providing Game Trailers.

1499
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
When there was no YouTube.

1500
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
When there wasn't really a way to get video on demand.

1501
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
When trailers weren't built into the damn consoles.

1502
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Unfortunately, Game Trailers didn't really evolve the way it needed to.

1503
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
And they lost a lot of visitors as a result.

1504
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
But hopefully the talent there will be able to bounce back and find new work quickly.

1505
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Kind of shitty that they got no notice.

1506
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
They really got no explanation either.

1507
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
They're just kind of left to figure out what happened.

1508
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1509
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
DarkSagra.

1510
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Well, sorry.

1511
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
It's a deep word.

1512
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Yeah. Well, I was actually reading the email.

1513
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
The FBI.

1514
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
They suck.

1515
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Well, and what I mean by suck is they actually suck at creating games.

1516
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Or whoever they hired to make the game sucked at making the game.

1517
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
So they made a game that's called Don't Be a Puppet.

1518
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
And it's to encourage teens to think for themselves.

1519
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And display a healthy skepticism as they come across anyone who appears to be advocating extremist violence.

1520
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
But yeah, it's pretty much a crappy game you play as a goat.

1521
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And not a very well designed goat.

1522
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:07,000
So basically, the lesson learned from this game is hire a better designer or FBI.

1523
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
So basically, they are as good making video games as PETA.

1524
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Which is not very good because I've played the PETA game.

1525
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I actually have that on my Playstation 4 and it's fucking terrible.

1526
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
That's right! I forgot they put out a game on Playstation 4.

1527
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It's fucking terrible.

1528
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I just remember like so super...

1529
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Okay, because PETA is fucking terrible.

1530
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Super Tofu Boy and all that stuff that they do.

1531
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
But you're saying that their games may actually be of a better quality than the FBI's games?

1532
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Maybe.

1533
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Alright. Let's move on. Loki.

1534
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
So this is kind of cool. This is also from some tweets.

1535
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
They're talking about DLC. Not too far off for Fallout 4.

1536
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Probably something they're going to announce at E3.

1537
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
You know, a couple tweets from Bethesda Game Studios.

1538
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
We know you're ready to learn what's coming for Fallout 4 DLC.

1539
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
We're not far off and we think you'll be excited.

1540
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Which I'm assuming also E3.

1541
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Also, they're going to be doing a complete overhaul on the Fallout 4 survival mode.

1542
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Food, sleep, diseases, danger, and more.

1543
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
So that'll be a tweet that's coming out as well.

1544
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
They're also saying that there's going to be a $30 season pass.

1545
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
So it'll save you $10 on the DLC.

1546
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So I'll be interested to see what it is.

1547
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I don't know. I played a lot more of it this week.

1548
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I'm down.

1549
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I definitely need to play some Fallout 4.

1550
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
You do.

1551
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I keep waiting for Alan to buy it.

1552
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Just get it on console. I mean, you play on PC.

1553
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I don't think that Dan's actually playing or a copy if you want to play the PS4 one.

1554
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Ooh, yeah. I'd totally be down with that.

1555
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I'll ask him if he can borrow it.

1556
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Sweet.

1557
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Then I don't have to pay for it. Awesome.

1558
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Alright. Let's talk about World of Warcraft, believe it or not.

1559
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:53,000
If you have yet to be sucked into the World of Warcraft, you may get your opportunity when you go to see the Warcraft movie.

1560
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Assuming you're going to go see the Warcraft movie.

1561
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
See, now here's the thing.

1562
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I figured most people that were going to go see the Warcraft movie were World of Warcraft players.

1563
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:10,000
But in order for this movie to be successful, they're going to need to do a good job of appealing to people who don't play World of Warcraft.

1564
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
How about the people that actually liked Warcraft?

1565
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:20,000
There's people that see movies that don't read books for those said movies, so maybe it's not reading the book.

1566
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And on top of that, I know a lot of people who hated World of Warcraft that love Warcraft and vice versa.

1567
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
You can still love the lore and hate the game. For sure.

1568
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:39,000
But anyway, apparently Blizzard is considering offering World of Warcraft free for people that have their ticket stubs to the Warcraft movie.

1569
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:47,000
There's apparently a World of Warcraft Ultimate Movie Edition that will have the MMO and all expansions besides the newest one, Legion, that's not even out yet.

1570
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:53,000
That will be included at no cost and there will be one month of game time that will be free on the house.

1571
01:46:53,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Apparently it has been confirmed on Reddit. This is something that's going to happen when Warcraft hits theaters on June 10th.

1572
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:13,000
With World of Warcraft, Legion is supposed to be out before September 21st, but a lot of people are speculating they're going to launch Legion around the time of the movie to try to get the hype train rolling for Warcraft.

1573
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:23,000
But again, to reiterate, I think if they don't do a good job pushing this movie, it's a given that most hardcore Warcraft players are going to make time to see this movie.

1574
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:29,000
But they need to be able to convince other people that aren't familiar with the source material to be able to see this and the movie is not going to be successful.

1575
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
So it will be very interesting to see how they market it and so on.

1576
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:41,000
So it would make sense that if somebody who had no idea what Warcraft was about enjoys the movie, decides to play World of Warcraft.

1577
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And I said for a long time on Horde House, World of Warcraft, Summit version of it ought to be free anyway.

1578
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Yes, I'm aware of the one that they have where you can play up to level 20, but let's be real, you can't do shit up to level 20.

1579
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:01,000
They should really just give base Warcraft away for free and do nothing but charge the subscription fee.

1580
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:06,000
If they want to keep gold spammers out or whatever, then fine, charge the subscription fee or whatever.

1581
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I don't understand why they're still charging for base Warcraft. I think the price of entry is too high.

1582
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Because people know they've got to buy the game and they've got to pay a monthly fee on top of it.

1583
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
So this just makes logical sense to me. I don't know.

1584
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Alright. Let's move on. Oh, I want to mention this real quick too.

1585
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Blizzard also hit their 25 year anniversary this week, believe it or not.

1586
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Blizzard has been around for 25 years, so they celebrated that little birthday this week.

1587
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Congrats. Let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.

1588
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1589
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and picks the email she's going to read on air.

1590
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Got my tongs ready.

1591
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I was going to say last week I think we complained about not getting a lot of emails.

1592
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
We got quite the response because of it, right? We have a lot of emails tonight, right?

1593
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Yeah.

1594
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Alright, let's get to it.

1595
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
This comes from Robert M. Again, this is likely a topic you've already covered in the announcement.

1596
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:11,000
But I am somewhat obsessive over the VoG network metagame and entering the podcast code words.

1597
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Though I freely admit I could be and should be doing more to participate beyond that.

1598
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Since the program started, two shows whose codes are tracked on the site,

1599
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
USL and Hoard House, have sunsetted.

1600
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Will any of the new shows be using the password system?

1601
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Not, of course, that I would make that my sole reason to subscribe or not subscribe to any of VoG's podcasts.

1602
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Great question. Admittedly, any show on VoG is able to do this.

1603
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
And I think it's just been a while before we've kind of approached the shows going who's on board and who wants to do this.

1604
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
So I don't really have a definitive answer for you on that now.

1605
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
But we probably are going to re approach the shows in the network and say, hey, who's interested in doing it?

1606
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And then take it from there. So we'll see who signs on for that.

1607
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I think the gamification is fun and it's part of what makes VoG a little different.

1608
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:10,000
And, you know, yeah, and I agree, it kind of stinks that two of the shows that were doing it have unfortunately sunsetted for various reasons.

1609
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
But it happens. VoG has been around for a few years now, so shows are going to come and shows are going to go.

1610
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
So I hope to have an update for you on that in the future.

1611
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
But at this time with the new shows, there's nothing yet.

1612
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I will say, though, that the new shows are all three of them going to premiere on VoG network.

1613
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
You hear them here first before they actually hit the podcast feed.

1614
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
So be ready for it.

1615
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Good morning, which is not morning for us, but oh well.

1616
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:47,000
When the weather is stagnant in the Salt Lake City valley for a lengthy amount of time, air pollution that is emitted from many various resources has no way of clearing out.

1617
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:58,000
As a result, the air pollution congregates, accumulates and just plain sits in the air above the valley, eventually creating what is called an inversion, which is a cute way of saying smog.

1618
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
By the way, the title of this is God damn it, I'm a video game.

1619
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:10,000
When these small conditions exist, not only is the sky overcast in a way that is visually depressing, a light haze settles in near the ground.

1620
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:19,000
This isn't like the fog that you'd see in London, but the kind of like the light haze you see in certain survival horror video games franchise,

1621
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
developed by a certain company that has earned much scorn for its preference of slot machines over Snake.

1622
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
On Wednesday morning, such conditions existed in the Salt Lake Valley.

1623
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:36,000
On Wednesday morning, I looked out of my window and thought to myself, if I hear a high pitched whale come out of my radio, I'm getting the fuck out of here.

1624
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Has this ever happened to you? Have you ever looked around at whatever environment you find yourself in and thought, God damn it, I'm in a video game.

1625
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Stay black or entertainment.

1626
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
And don't you know, if you hear the whale on the radio, it's already too late. You're not getting out.

1627
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Just beware of the sirens.

1628
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I was going to say, there are definitely places that remind me of scary video games and Silent Hill.

1629
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,000
And I've even texted Shane before. I think I'm in Silent Hill right now. Like I've sent him texts like that.

1630
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I do that all the time. So yeah.

1631
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Now when, this is before Silent Hill was out, but I mean, what was funny is that when I lived in Alabama,

1632
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:18,000
we had this little Grove that was outside the dorms and it would get super foggy and we'd play hide and seek in the fog, which is pretty fun.

1633
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:25,000
The first time I saw Silent Hill, I was like, Oh, Hey, it's like when I was in college. So it was sort of the reverse for that.

1634
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Anyway. So moving forward, this is from...

1635
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I'll just say though, until I see the world in pixels, though, I don't think I'm ever going to say I think I'm in Minecraft.

1636
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I don't think that's one that's ever going to come to mind.

1637
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
So this is from AZHP. It's kind of long.

1638
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Hey, well, our crew AZHP here. I haven't been writing in lately because I've listened to every episode.

1639
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Just wanted to let you know that even though we quiet people don't say anything, we're here and we listen.

1640
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Smiley!

1641
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Appreciate it. I know that's true. Thank you.

1642
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So several years ago, there was an indie film called The FP, which revolved around post-apocalyptic Frasier Park.

1643
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
No, I know what they're talking about.

1644
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
He talked about that movie on a show.

1645
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I haven't watched it though.

1646
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
A tiny burb just north of the grapevine on I-5 in California.

1647
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And the turf wars over the only liquor store in town.

1648
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:26,000
What made the movie special was that the turf wars were fought using the ancient sport of beat beat revelation.

1649
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,000
All of my DDR friends and even some of the people who never touched a dance pad in their life loved the movie.

1650
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It was really well written for the tiny budget they had and we all wanted to see more.

1651
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Apparently the creator also wanted to see more because the film was a flop financially.

1652
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Though a cult success among the nichest of video game players, he's had to do random movie gigs just to stay afloat these last few years.

1653
01:53:52,000 --> 01:54:00,000
But DDR and the FP was his passion and he really wants to see his new script be made reality and I want to help him do it.

1654
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:07,000
He started an Indiegogo campaign to raise the money to make this movie the best star movie about smashy arrows it can possibly be.

1655
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
As indies who got your start with DDR as well.

1656
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I hope you all can sympathize with an indie visionary's plight and help spread the word.

1657
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:24,000
You can find the campaign by searching for Beats of Rage The FP Part 2 on Google.

1658
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And if you have never heard of the original movie before the FP can be rented on Amazon video for just four dollars or bought on Amazon or iTunes for 10.

1659
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:41,000
You have plenty of time to you'll have plenty of time to see if you enjoy the original movie before kicking in for the new one.

1660
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,000
As of this writing February 11th there are two months left in the campaign.

1661
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:52,000
The creator's brother was actually the cinematographer for quite a few Hollywood productions like Nick Cage's Ghost Rider.

1662
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:59,000
So the actual filmography is pretty darn good. It's definitely a good weekend slash sorry weekend drinking slash party movie.

1663
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:04,000
So grab Shane and a few bottles of wine and make an I don't think you'll regret it.

1664
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:11,000
You OK. Side note. Yeah. I found the bottle of shining Blanc that you gave me years ago and I opened it.

1665
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Did you drink it was still delicious. It's in my fridge right now. That's awesome. OK.

1666
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Anyway I hope you don't mind me asking you to spread the word on this movie.

1667
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I've had annual viewings of this movie at my house for the last years a few years and we've never we never get tired of it.

1668
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I don't have any stake in this financially. I just really love this movie and DDR and want to see a new movie come out of it.

1669
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Sorry for the long email and thanks for reading. Once again you can find the campaign by searching for beats of rage the FP part 2 on Google.

1670
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And there's the URL which I will copy into the chat room. Yours truly is HP.

1671
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:53,000
P.S. I listen to your podcast in my new cart and for some reason it tries to override album art with whatever it finds when it searches for the artist's name of its album art database.

1672
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Here's what it gives me whenever I put an in line image.

1673
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I'll let Rob paint a picture with his words but like to imagine this is what you all look like when you record this podcast.

1674
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
If you scroll down you can see the attachment that has the image and I did look at it.

1675
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I was like what the hell? Which is weird because we put album art inside every episode.

1676
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I have to do that manually in iTunes so I forget once in a great while but usually the album art should be in there.

1677
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:27,000
So it's weird that you're I'd be curious what you're using to listen to podcasts because I wonder why it's still going out to get album art even though we put it in there.

1678
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
That's weird. Anyway real quick though about the movie. That's awesome that you have the passion for that and you know what?

1679
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:41,000
It's expensive enough to do the podcast that we do. I can only imagine how expensive and how excruciating it is to do a movie.

1680
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:47,000
So I'll say this much. I don't know how accessible those guys are but I'll email them and see if we can get them on the show.

1681
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I think they'll be hilarious. We'll talk DDR stories. See what happens. I'll let you know.

1682
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Okay well I also put the link in the chatroom. I couldn't get the image up but I'll just look at it later.

1683
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It's okay.

1684
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Come on there we go. So this one's labeled commercials.

1685
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Okay.

1686
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Does the email get a load? And it's by YYR.

1687
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Yay.

1688
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Hello LR. In last week's and last episode's kickoff topic you guys discussed video game commercials once again.

1689
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
My favorite of these is actually little known and generally not well remembered.

1690
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I can't remember if these ran on Saturday mornings or weekend afternoons but back in the days of the NES I saw this ad several times.

1691
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,000
It was for a game I'd never heard of anywhere else called Mendel Palace.

1692
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:36,000
The game was developed by Game Freak, the same Game Freak that would later develop Pokemon, and published in North America by Hudson Soft.

1693
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Its advertisement was different from most others you might remember. Around ten whole seconds of it consisted of gameplay footage.

1694
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I never understood why so many video game ads over the years showed little or no footage of actual gameplay from the games they were supposedly advertising.

1695
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Because usually they look like shit on TV. But I remember this ad actually. I remember Mendel Palace.

1696
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Sega's ads for Dreamcast games were absolutely awful in this regard. Most ads contained only a few seconds of footage or less.

1697
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,000
On the other hand, Mendel Palace looked so interesting to me that I specifically sought it out.

1698
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
All these years later it has remained one of my favorite NES games of all time.

1699
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
It's a sort of action puzzle game where you need to eliminate the enemies on the screen to move forward.

1700
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And the enemies come in many different types.

1701
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Similarly to Bubble Bobble, but with a different style of action.

1702
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys arcade style action games and I hope some of you check it out.

1703
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And there's a link to the commercial which I will put in the chat room as well.

1704
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I suppose I haven't mentioned it previously, but multitasking is now out on Xbox Live Indie games.

1705
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Next stop, Steam Greenlight, and I hope to be on there by MAGFest.

1706
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Well I know what I'm gonna buy soon.

1707
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Alright, I know what I'm doing later.

1708
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Oh, and the new yyrgames.com has launched.

1709
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Go there and play Pixel Poops if you want to be on the brand new Super Poopers leaderboard.

1710
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Super Pooper, Taco Bell's gonna blind me. I don't know, that's all I got.

1711
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
By the way, did you see the thing that I linked you?

1712
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Yes, I did.

1713
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
That was pretty cool.

1714
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Anyway.

1715
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Okay, to tell people.

1716
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Which literally none of the listeners know what you're talking about.

1717
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,000
There's a singer who has a big band orchestra that covers popular hits.

1718
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
But he sings like the old 20s and 30s style warbler, so it's pretty cool.

1719
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
It was a little weird, but it was cool.

1720
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
It's like Max something. Anyway, I'll look up later. For all of y'all.

1721
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I will mention that I was asked whether I wanted to be notified if a spot opened up in the MAGFest Indie Showcase at the last second.

1722
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I said yes, but at this point I'm assuming I will not be a part of it.

1723
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Despite this, I hope to see some of you at MAGFest anyway.

1724
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:44,000
It's a fantastic experience, and if I don't get to show games, it just means I'll have more time to play them.

1725
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Happy Valentine's Day, and have fun. Aaron Yyr.

1726
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Well, thank you very much for the email.

1727
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I look forward to seeing you at MAGFest, for sure.

1728
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I don't even think my Xbox 360 is hooked up right now.

1729
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I really wish Indie Games somehow was backwards compatible on Xbox One.

1730
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I know I'm asking for a lot, but whatever.

1731
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
That's exciting, though, about the Steam Greenlight.

1732
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I'll be looking for that.

1733
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Okay, we have one more email.

1734
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Alrighty.

1735
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Okay. Hello, OLR. This email is addressed to Rob in reactions to what he said last week.

1736
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
In regards to what he said last week.

1737
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:30,000
This concerns what I can honestly say is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever happened upon, and that is Undertale.

1738
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Yeah, I know, I hear his eyes rolling already.

1739
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Wait a minute, did I bag on Undertale last week?

1740
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I don't know.

1741
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I don't remember doing that.

1742
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I don't remember you doing that either.

1743
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Oh, you know what? Maybe I referenced, you bought it for me on Steam and I still haven't played it.

1744
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
But that doesn't mean I'm rolling my eyes.

1745
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Just to be clear, I just haven't played it.

1746
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
But really, please give the game a chance and I know you'll fall in love with it.

1747
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:59,000
The characters in the game have a way of making you feel attached to them in a way that made it hard for me to even consider a genocide run.

1748
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
This is why I'm doing it on a different computer.

1749
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
And your interactions with them break the fourth wall like the Hymen of Zeus.

1750
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Okay.

1751
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
What?

1752
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
The gameplay is addicting and just a lot of fun.

1753
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Most importantly, the story. I'm not going to spoil anything, of course.

1754
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:23,000
I just want to state this game uses a particular method of storytelling at one point of the game that caught me off guard completely, and it moved me to tears.

1755
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,000
In fact, the game as a whole did it multiple times.

1756
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Please, I'd be so happy to hear your thoughts on it in a future OLR episode.

1757
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
What if I hate it? You're not going to be happy to hear it.

1758
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I don't think you'll hate it.

1759
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I don't think I will either.

1760
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Undertale is something special that I'm not going to forget for the rest of my life.

1761
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Sincerely, Garth Wolf.

1762
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,000
P.S. Have a Valentine's Day fursuit photo of myself. Have a good one.

1763
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
What?

1764
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Yeah, there's a picture attached where he's wearing the whole...

1765
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
If it'll load.

1766
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
If it'll load. Attachments are not working for Dark Sakura today.

1767
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
No.

1768
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
It was just...

1769
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
There we go.

1770
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
It was him being a fursuit.

1771
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I keep wanting to say theme park character, but is that an insult?

1772
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I don't want to be insulting.

1773
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Mascot.

1774
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Alright.

1775
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Mascot sitting on a park, just chilling on a park bench.

1776
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I love, I love, I love furries. I really do.

1777
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
You know somebody's going to cut that out and use that against you someday, right?

1778
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Fuck them, then. I don't care.

1779
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I love, well, especially furry cosplayers.

1780
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
People who take the time to make their fursuits like that.

1781
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
It's a lot of craftsmanship.

1782
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
You know what? I will say this.

1783
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I realize that that whole scene gets their shit and all that stuff,

1784
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
but I will say they are dedicated to their craft,

1785
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
and the cosplay that, you know, they pull off is pretty fucking impressive

1786
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
when you realize they are not Disney or a theme park operating company

1787
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
that just can, you know, crank these suits out in a factory like they make them.

1788
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So I'll give you that.

1789
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I'll tell you this. If you kind of want to have an idea of what goes into

1790
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
making a fursuit, there's actually an episode of How It's Made

1791
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
where someone makes like a game mascot,

1792
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:02,000
and they go into like how the entire body of it is stitched.

1793
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
How they keep them cool enough is what I want to know.

1794
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Because those things look hot.

1795
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Sometimes they put fans in them.

1796
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Some do put fans in them, but I've also seen some that have like

1797
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
ventilation built in at key places.

1798
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And then there's like, I call them the hybrid fursuits

1799
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
where people will do like the appendages and whatnot,

1800
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
like another type of anthermorph, so.

1801
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
And well done. I really, really, really dig your fursona.

1802
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
And I will play, and I'm getting yelled at by Act Deft in chat, too.

1803
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Play Undertale. I will. I just, you know how it goes.

1804
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
When Alan's home from work, we want to just chill in Diablo III.

1805
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
So I will get around to it. I will.

1806
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
But not this week, because I'm going to MAGFest.

1807
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Unless somebody makes me play it at MAGFest, which might happen.

1808
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I don't know. Do they have the whole...

1809
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I'm going to ask SSGA 100 Matt.

1810
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Black Wolf says Undertale and chill, maybe.

1811
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Do they at MAGFest, do they just have like places where you have

1812
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
like old school Nintendo Entertainment Systems

1813
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
and you can like rent games? Like they have at PAX.

1814
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Because that was some of the most fun I had at PAX East last year,

1815
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
was like, what the hell do you mean, Bobby Black Wolf?

1816
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
You haven't played the Guardian Legend.

1817
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
We are fucking fixing this right the fuck now.

1818
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
We marched into that room and checked out Guardian Legend

1819
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
and had a good time just playing that.

1820
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I hope they have some of that at MAGFest.

1821
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Oh, thank God. Everybody's telling me yes. Yay. I'm so excited.

1822
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Okay, that's happening then.

1823
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Yay. Dan and I may sit through and have me make him sit down and play through the Guardian Legend.

1824
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Oh, good.

1825
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Because he's never beaten it.

1826
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
You should stream that or something. It'll be fun.

1827
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I have beaten the shit out of that game. I can't do it anymore.

1828
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
It's hard. It's a hard game.

1829
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
It is.

1830
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Let's see. AkumaJP in chat is asking naked pics from fans.

1831
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Um, no.

1832
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
No.

1833
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I... Yeah, let's keep it professional.

1834
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Unless you're really hot.

1835
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
No.

1836
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1837
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Keep that in your trousers.

1838
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Direct message me on Twitter.

1839
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Is that it for email tonight?

1840
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1841
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
This is the place to send emails.

1842
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1843
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Every week we get a little bit angsty on this show.

1844
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Because, rawr.

1845
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
This is bad.

1846
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Here is justice.

1847
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Here is punishment.

1848
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Here...

1849
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
This is fucked up.

1850
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
FU to making a valve with a situation.

1851
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Um, I made a valve that I was gonna, for everything that I was gonna cook,

1852
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I wasn't gonna go out and buy anything new.

1853
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I was gonna use this in the fridge, right?

1854
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
You know, I've got frozen vegetables.

1855
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I have konnyaku. I have noodles.

1856
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I have different stuff.

1857
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And then I realized this morning

1858
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
when I went to go fix coffee

1859
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
and use the last of it, I'm not a creamer.

1860
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
So I have to go buy creamer.

1861
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
So it's just stupid.

1862
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
It's not like I can drink Irish cream before, you know, work every day.

1863
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
I mean, I could.

1864
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
But I would not.

1865
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Because I don't want to, you know, be a drunk driver.

1866
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I wouldn't be drunk either, but you know what I mean.

1867
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I know what you mean.

1868
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Setting a bad example.

1869
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
It's all about you.

1870
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
And also in FU, to me having missed the FUs

1871
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
for this whole past schedule of mine,

1872
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I go back to closing shift again,

1873
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
the week of the 20th?

1874
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
March 20th?

1875
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Oh, March 20th.

1876
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
So we still have a few shows of early Dark Soccer departures.

1877
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Yeah.

1878
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
But it's gonna be nice to be back on a Monday through Friday again

1879
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:48,000
and not have, you know, my days off split.

1880
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Not tonight because of the holiday.

1881
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Yeah. Well, tomorrow I requested off and I got off.

1882
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Cool.

1883
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
And yeah, I missed having two days in a row.

1884
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
It's really hard to feel rested with one day

1885
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
and then having to go right back to work.

1886
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
It doesn't feel like I have any real gap in my week.

1887
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
So nice.

1888
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Very happy.

1889
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
All right.

1890
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Loki, your FU of the week.

1891
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
My FU to my ankle for still hurting

1892
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
from me stepping on it funny

1893
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
when I was playing Ingress and FU to my arm

1894
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
for hurting for, I don't know,

1895
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I must have slept on it weird, but it's hurt,

1896
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
it's been hurting for two weeks now and I can't like

1897
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
move it in certain directions, which is weird.

1898
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
But, but,

1899
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
you know, one of my previous FUs

1900
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
has been FU to Red Bull for not

1901
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
getting me my free Red Bull, but I finally got

1902
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
my fucking free Red Bull.

1903
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
So I'm happy about that.

1904
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Finally got that sweet,

1905
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
sweet settlement Red Bull.

1906
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
The taste of an agreement.

1907
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Which, by the way, I registered

1908
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
for myself and for my wife.

1909
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
So she's like, why did I get one in the box

1910
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
with my name on it too? Because I wanted two of them!

1911
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Is why.

1912
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
I can't just see

1913
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
that conversation between you and Nelly too.

1914
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
All right, my FU of the week.

1915
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Honestly, I don't have a lot to be

1916
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
angsty about because I've had a pretty good week.

1917
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I will say this, FU to the fact that

1918
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
every time I host Rocky, which I did

1919
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
last night, I managed to throw out my voice.

1920
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Although I'm doing pretty good through

1921
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
today's show, but like last night,

1922
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
like this morning, I couldn't talk.

1923
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Like Alan said, good morning,

1924
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
and I said, I couldn't

1925
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
talk. Thankfully, thanks to

1926
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
hot liquids and drinking a lot of water today,

1927
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I have my voice back. But FU to the fact

1928
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
that I don't know how to not

1929
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
throw my voice out at Rocky and I need to stop

1930
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
yelling as loud as I do

1931
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
and throwing out my voice. But the show was really

1932
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
great last night. If you're local

1933
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
and you weren't there, you missed it.

1934
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says he squawked

1935
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
like a goose. I really did. It was

1936
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I couldn't talk. It was scary.

1937
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
It was scary. Can you imagine if I

1938
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
lost my voice, like for a long time?

1939
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Oh my god, what would I do

1940
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
with myself? I would be able to podcast.

1941
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I would be able to teach.

1942
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Oh my god.

1943
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I guess I'd finally play games like Undertale

1944
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
because I have nothing else to do.

1945
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Alright, just a couple more

1946
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line.

1947
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1948
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
But first, Loki.

1949
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Alright, so Minecraft Windows 10 edition

1950
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
is getting yet another update. They're finally

1951
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
getting closer to being like the PC version.

1952
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
So with this,

1953
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
they've gotten some more updates

1954
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
to the Redstone stuff. So for example,

1955
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
different mechanical contraptions

1956
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
you can make. The

1957
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
compactors, repeaters, suspencers, droppers,

1958
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
hoppers, trap chests,

1959
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
etc. are now available to build.

1960
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Also, they added witches

1961
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
and item frames.

1962
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
So those are available for the Pocket edition and

1963
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Windows 10 beta edition as well.

1964
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Slime Blocks, wearable pumpkins,

1965
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
and Red Sandstone

1966
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
have been added, as well as

1967
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
chicken jockey mobs.

1968
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I still haven't seen that yet.

1969
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Awesome.

1970
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I can't wait to check that out.

1971
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I guess eight more achievements

1972
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
as well.

1973
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Alright, I'll have to check that out.

1974
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
It runs really well, I think.

1975
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Oh yeah, I've played it on Windows 10 before

1976
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
and I love that you can see

1977
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
it endlessly in that game.

1978
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I mean, it renders the new areas

1979
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
so fast.

1980
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I know that they have all those different

1981
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Sonic Ether, really awesome

1982
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
shaders and stuff for it.

1983
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
That's what I wanted the PlayStation 4

1984
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
and Xbox One versions to have.

1985
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Keep it the blocky stuff,

1986
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
but make it look extra nice.

1987
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And maybe do the water differently.

1988
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
But unfortunately,

1989
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
that's not what we got.

1990
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Minecraft 2, I guess.

1991
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Unfortunately, tonight, in the Department of

1992
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Things We Didn't Fucking Ask For,

1993
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
somebody,

1994
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
somebody, Dark Soccer laughed at that,

1995
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
somebody has recreated

1996
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
the Nintendo Classic

1997
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
game, I use that term very loosely,

1998
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
because you all know how I feel about this game.

1999
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Somebody has created the Nintendo game

2000
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Duck Hunt in VR.

2001
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And the criminal responsible

2002
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
for this is Joseph Delgado,

2003
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
who actually did this during

2004
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
the Global Game Jam

2005
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
2016 last month.

2006
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
And I say this very

2007
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
tongue-in-cheek, because I'm just not a fan of Duck Hunt,

2008
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
but honestly, this guy did something

2009
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I can't do, so I'm just saying that tongue-in-cheek.

2010
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Awesome work, dude.

2011
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
He is actually studying computer science at

2012
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

2013
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
And

2014
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
he built the game in a single

2015
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
day, and then he uploaded what he did

2016
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
in his YouTube channel, and it actually

2017
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
kind of like, you see the little orange

2018
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
gun kind of floating in space that you

2019
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
kind of use, and then the

2020
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
ducks, and it's almost like you're actually in the

2021
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
environment, and you can like look around and see

2022
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
that little shitty dog and everything else.

2023
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
He also made a game

2024
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
oh, I'm sorry, he actually put in the Game C

2025
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
minigame where you can shoot the little

2026
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
clay pigeons and all that stuff.

2027
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
The game is planned to be released for

2028
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
free for the HTC Vive VR

2029
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
platform when that comes out in April.

2030
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
But that is, of course,

2031
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
hoping that Nintendo

2032
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
is not going to do anything to shut it down.

2033
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Although, when I looked at it, I mean,

2034
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
yeah, okay, it's really similar and has a lot of

2035
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
the same stuff, but if Nintendo wanted him

2036
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
to shut it down, I'm pretty sure he could just change

2037
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
some of the sprite art, and it would

2038
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I don't know, if he's willing to do it, we'll see.

2039
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Who knows.

2040
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

2041
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Bobby Blackwolf saying,

2042
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
someone did this early on

2043
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
in the DK1 lifespan, it just

2044
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
didn't make the news sites. Maybe,

2045
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I'm assuming this one did because it came out of a

2046
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
game jam, so maybe it was kind of faster.

2047
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I don't know.

2048
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I don't know with the DK1 if

2049
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
they really had good controller support

2050
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
as far as using the actual

2051
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
controllers that they have

2052
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
to manipulate

2053
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
stuff in space.

2054
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I mean, that's what it has on there. It looks kind of cool.

2055
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
The floating gun and everything.

2056
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster

2057
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
says, now everyone can have that dog

2058
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
laugh at them in VR.

2059
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Tigerclaw says, I can never play a game

2060
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
like Duck Hunt. Ducks are cute and stuff.

2061
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Why would you want to kill them?

2062
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
And my favorite, SSJ100

2063
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2064
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
of course, something this crappy

2065
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
would come from New Jersey.

2066
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
That's not nice.

2067
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
It doesn't look bad. I think it looks pretty cool.

2068
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Okay, that was funny though.

2069
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Sorry to any of our New Jersey people listening,

2070
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
but you know, just tongue in cheek.

2071
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
It's funny. Alright. I'd play it.

2072
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Yeah, I mean, as much

2073
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
as I hate on Duck Hunt here

2074
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
on the show, you guys know it's a little bit of an in-joke.

2075
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I would check it out just for laughs, but

2076
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
again, we don't need to shoehorn

2077
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
everything into VR, okay?

2078
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Totally cool with new

2079
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
VR experiences, but this

2080
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
guy's a student. It's part of a

2081
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
game jam. Scenario's a little

2082
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
different here. I think it's okay. Alright.

2083
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Let's get into

2084
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
the Skype line tonight.

2085
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
We're going to take your calls. OrangeLoungeRadio.

2086
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
All one word on Skype. Old school.

2087
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
1877 game OLR.

2088
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
While we wait for some calls, I should say.

2089
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Do we have any last minute stories here over from Loki?

2090
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
No.

2091
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
What?

2092
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Sorry. There's something going on.

2093
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Alright. Well, we'll see if we get any calls then.

2094
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Again, that's OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word on

2095
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Skype. TigerClaw on chat

2096
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
says, what if they recreated Super Metroid

2097
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
in VR? Do you think that draws the line?

2098
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Yes, because

2099
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
It wouldn't be the same game. It would not be the same game

2100
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
whatsoever. I mean, a game

2101
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
like Metroid Prime

2102
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
might work a little better in VR.

2103
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
But even then, I'm like, you know,

2104
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
these experiences weren't really created

2105
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
for VR. So I'm just

2106
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
It's kind of like when you see the movies that were

2107
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
like converted into 3D

2108
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
post-production. It can be really

2109
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
hit and miss. I'm sure there's going to be

2110
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
something out there that gets converted for

2111
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
VR that works out pretty well. But

2112
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I just don't really have an

2113
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
interest in trying to shoehorn classics

2114
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
into VR. Now, if Nintendo

2115
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
one day was like, we're going to make a

2116
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Metroid game for VR. And I don't

2117
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
fucking know why they do that. But if they

2118
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
did it, I would be like, okay,

2119
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
fuck yeah, let's check this out. How cool

2120
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
is this going to be? But I just

2121
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
don't really see that happening unless the

2122
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
NX is going to adopt VR. I do have a couple things.

2123
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
So first off,

2124
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
according to NECA Toys,

2125
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
they're saying that Sony is bringing back

2126
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Crash Bandicoot

2127
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
because I guess they would have some sort of in on

2128
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
that. Meaning that, you know, they'd be

2129
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
making toys for it.

2130
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Also, apparently

2131
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
they're bringing back that really shitty

2132
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
PC gaming show to

2133
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
E3 again. Which I will not

2134
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
watch this time. Oh. I didn't realize

2135
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
that was happening. Interesting.

2136
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Yes. When did they do that? That was like a... It was

2137
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
a live broadcasting. It was like three

2138
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
hours long or something. When did they do that?

2139
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
It was so fucking boring. Was that the

2140
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
second night? Not even the first night? I don't know.

2141
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
But this time it's supposed to be June 13th

2142
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
at noon.

2143
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Oh.

2144
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I don't know what the... I don't know.

2145
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
It was so boring last time. I am not

2146
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
watching that thing.

2147
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Oh. Did they snag the

2148
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
EA spot? I bet

2149
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
that's what it is. They probably

2150
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
took the spot that would have usually been EA.

2151
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Yeah. It was just a big advertisement

2152
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
fest last time. I mean,

2153
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
no thank you. I'm not gonna

2154
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
watch it. I think they showed like a new Heroes

2155
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
of the Storm map. There was like a couple little things

2156
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
here and there, but it wasn't a lot.

2157
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
S200Matt says, oh, that

2158
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
was a PC show. God, that was a waste of time.

2159
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
People really thought they were gonna announce

2160
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Half-Life 3 during it. Hey, you know what?

2161
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
If they did announce Half-Life 3

2162
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
this year, no one is ever gonna bag on that show

2163
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
again. I'm just saying.

2164
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I'm just throwing it out there. They wouldn't...

2165
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Yeah, it wouldn't be done at that show.

2166
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And I would think if you're gonna launch

2167
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
or do Half-Life 3

2168
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
that it would be console as well.

2169
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Honestly, I think that they would wanna capitalize

2170
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
on as many people as possible

2171
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
on that. Yeah, I agree.

2172
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I think Half-Life 3 will ultimately be console

2173
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
as well. Even though they might do like a

2174
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
It's On Steam first

2175
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
because they can. Oh yeah, I can see that.

2176
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
We'll see. Anyway,

2177
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
putting out one more call for calls.

2178
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on

2179
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Skype if you wanna give us a call.

2180
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Otherwise, I do wanna remind our podcast listeners

2181
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
the show is probably gonna feel a little short this week.

2182
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
We did get a 30 minute late start tonight

2183
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
because we did the special announcement

2184
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
show live at the Boyziques Network, so that's why if

2185
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
things seem a little shorter tonight, well, they were.

2186
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
But it is already, believe it or not, 9 o'clock

2187
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
on the West Coast.

2188
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Again, there is gonna be no live OLR

2189
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
next week because I'll be at MAGFest.

2190
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Although, and it sounds like Loki and Dark Soccer

2191
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
are gonna have a ball without me here

2192
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
going to see Dead School and playing Egress. We'll see.

2193
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
We'll see what happens. We'll see.

2194
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
But I will be at MAGFest.

2195
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I will be tweeting.

2196
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I really, you know, I've been putting together

2197
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
the guidebook app, the things I wanna do.

2198
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
And I have left myself a lot of free time.

2199
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
But I did find, surprisingly, there is

2200
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
a lot I wanna see, so I'm just

2201
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
irritated that I didn't realize MAGFest

2202
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
started as early as it did. When they said it was

2203
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Thursday through Sunday, I thought

2204
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
that meant like Thursday night. But it actually

2205
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
meant like, it actually starts at like 2 o'clock

2206
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
on Thursday or something like that. It starts like really

2207
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
early. And I don't

2208
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
even get into DC until 3

2209
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
or 4 o'clock local time on

2210
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Thursday, so I'm gonna miss

2211
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
a little bit. But as long as I don't miss the VCR

2212
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
clue thing, that's why I'm praying

2213
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
my flight doesn't get delayed because I'll be so mad.

2214
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
So mad if that happens.

2215
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Alright.

2216
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
And Bobby Blackwolf

2217
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
is saying follow him on Twitter

2218
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
with the hashtag RoadToMAGFest

2219
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
and you can

2220
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
check that out over on

2221
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Twitter. He'll be posting about that

2222
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
as he's going to MAGFest.

2223
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Our phone is ringing, so

2224
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
let's get to it. We're gonna go to the phones

2225
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
and take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

2226
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Who's this? Hi, it's

2227
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Derek H. First time listener,

2228
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
long time listener.

2229
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
First time listener, long time

2230
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
listener. Derek,

2231
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
it has been a very long time, my friend.

2232
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
How are you?

2233
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I've been better. I've been worse.

2234
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
You know what? I was about to

2235
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
ask how you guys are doing, but

2236
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
listening to the show, I can tell you're doing awesome.

2237
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Congratulations on another

2238
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
great Rocky Horror Picture show. I probably

2239
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
will never see it because

2240
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
you're not across the street from

2241
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
me, but I know that I'm

2242
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
missing something good. Thank you very much.

2243
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I appreciate that. They do some showings in L.A.,

2244
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
but it's different no matter where you go.

2245
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
But how are you, my friend?

2246
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
What do we owe this phone call tonight?

2247
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I was listening to the show and I heard

2248
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
the call. You said, call in.

2249
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
So I was like, I don't think I've called

2250
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
into Orange Lawn's Radio in a while. I will

2251
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
call in because I actually would like to

2252
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I would like your guys' take on

2253
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
something that I've been mulling

2254
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
over

2255
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
for the past few weeks now.

2256
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Okay.

2257
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
This mini

2258
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
PC deal that's going on

2259
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
where you can get a full-fledged

2260
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
PC. At first it was

2261
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
the Raspberry Pi

2262
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
for $35.

2263
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
And I was

2264
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I want one, but I was able to say

2265
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
nah, what can I really do with it?

2266
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
But you can do a lot of stuff with it, but still

2267
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I was like, yeah, it's a toy.

2268
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And then the Kangaroo

2269
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
PC came out. That's $99

2270
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
and you can do whatever you want with it.

2271
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Play games and everything.

2272
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
And it's kind of getting hard for me

2273
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
to

2274
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
dismiss it like I had before.

2275
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
And even worse

2276
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
it's hard for me to justify

2277
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
spending any money on my

2278
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
big, giant, old-fashioned, stupid

2279
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
computer now. When I looked

2280
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I was like, well

2281
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
there's one that does like 90% of this stuff

2282
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
for $100.

2283
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
And I spend that much on

2284
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
a mouse.

2285
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Isn't it amazing

2286
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
how technology

2287
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper?

2288
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Well there's that one that they included with a magazine

2289
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
too.

2290
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
They had like a whole PC that was with a magazine.

2291
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
That's right, they had like a magazine they were selling

2292
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
and it was like the little, like back in my day

2293
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
it was a demo disc for PlayStation

2294
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
games and now it's like, oh hey,

2295
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
now you get a whole freaking PC

2296
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
included with the magazine.

2297
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
That stuff is crazy, but you know

2298
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
when we talk about this kind of stuff

2299
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
I'm reminded of, I remember

2300
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
a few years ago, when I say a few years ago

2301
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I'm talking like 10 years ago, I remember when

2302
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
like the Mac Mini had first come out

2303
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
and that was like, hey, you have

2304
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
this kind of like, for all practical purposes

2305
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
bare bones computer that's

2306
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
a cheaper price. Now granted

2307
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
you know, it was the Apple, still the

2308
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Apple premium Mercedes Benz

2309
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
brand and all that stuff, so it's not like we're talking about

2310
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
$99, but it was still that

2311
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
whole, hey we're going to strip out a lot of the fluff

2312
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
and do this very like bare bones PC.

2313
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
So, I don't know, I mean a lot of

2314
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
this stuff is,

2315
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
it's not surprising necessarily

2316
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
but it is just fascinating

2317
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
like how much more we can do with it.

2318
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
You know, I know a lot of people

2319
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
get those Raspberry Pis because you can

2320
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
install emulators and play

2321
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
games for days on there.

2322
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I actually have a project right now because

2323
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
I have a non-functional

2324
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Mac SE

2325
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
that I'm going to put

2326
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
a Raspberry Pi in and a small

2327
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
LCD monitor and

2328
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
just use it as you know, a little

2329
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
emulator.

2330
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Crazy. I think

2331
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
the whole, I think phones

2332
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
have kind of opened people's eyes

2333
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
to what they really need

2334
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
a computer for because I remember

2335
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
when I was

2336
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
back in the good old days when I was young

2337
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
we would look at laptops

2338
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
and say well, laptops are okay but

2339
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
if you want a real computer to do real

2340
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
stuff then you need a real computer.

2341
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
And then laptops got more and more

2342
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
powerful and then tablets came out

2343
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
and was like, well tablets are okay

2344
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
but if you need a real computer you need at least a

2345
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
laptop. And now people are

2346
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I see a number of people

2347
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
plugging

2348
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Bluetooth keyboards into their

2349
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
phones and they're like, well

2350
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
it does everything I need it to do.

2351
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And I think that's kind of

2352
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
opened people's eyes to say, I

2353
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
don't really need one of these

2354
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
big honking dinosaur computers

2355
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
when everything I need

2356
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
is in this

2357
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
can fit in the palm of my hand. So why am I

2358
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
spending $2,000

2359
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
$2,000, $1,500 on a

2360
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
computer when I don't have to.

2361
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
You know what's interesting about all this

2362
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Derek is that, and I feel like it's

2363
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
actually, I feel in a way even though

2364
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
this is going to kind of sound cold but it's not

2365
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
because I'm in the same boat. But I

2366
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
think it's a sign that we're just getting old.

2367
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Because we remember

2368
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
the way computers were when we

2369
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
were younger. It's funny because somebody's making a joke in chat.

2370
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Tiger Claw says, remember the days when a

2371
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
computer magazine would have codes you type in a basic

2372
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
to run some program. Yes, I love those

2373
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
things. I want those things to come back.

2374
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Right, me too. It's like I love that stuff.

2375
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
But the reality is it's like you think

2376
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
about now what teenagers

2377
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
and kids today are growing up

2378
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
with. See the difference here is we have

2379
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
different expectations of what a computer

2380
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
should be. Kids that are growing up

2381
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
today it's like they get cell phones

2382
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
when they're like 10 years old

2383
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
and they have this completely different perception

2384
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
of what technology is and how

2385
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
technology affects their lives.

2386
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I remember when technology was

2387
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
like an enrichment class you took in high

2388
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
school. It was not something that was necessarily

2389
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
mandatory or what have you. It was

2390
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
like you know maybe you had basic

2391
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
word processing skills or whatever but

2392
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
like computer skills were an elective.

2393
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
They weren't a necessity. That is so not the

2394
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
case today. So I just, the reason

2395
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
why I bring that up is I just think it's funny

2396
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
when we talk about like our perception of

2397
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
what is a computer? What is

2398
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
technology? And what you know what do

2399
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I take with me on the go? What do I have

2400
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
in my living room? It's changing. It's

2401
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
changing by the year.

2402
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
And now we're on this verge of VR.

2403
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
How is that going to change things?

2404
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I mean maybe it'll end up being nothing

2405
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
like it was in the 90s. But I

2406
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
don't know. I was around with that

2407
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
first VR and trust me

2408
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
you guys aren't missing nothing.

2409
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
But it was

2410
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
kind of shitty then and now it's

2411
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
it's come a long way. It really has.

2412
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I don't know. You know and

2413
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I've said this on the show before. If

2414
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
VR has its Wii Sports

2415
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
it's going to do huge.

2416
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
But if they don't have that must have thing

2417
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
it'll be another flash in the pan.

2418
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
And when was the last time you got

2419
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
well you guys are, well I don't know

2420
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
when was the last time you guys played one of those

2421
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
motion control games that were all the rage

2422
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
a few years ago that were gonna

2423
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
revolutionize

2424
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
and revitalize

2425
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
the industry. They're all gone.

2426
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
They were the flash

2427
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
in the pan. I got a feeling

2428
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
VR is gonna be huge for

2429
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
six to eight months

2430
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
and then people are gonna say yeah no

2431
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
give me 4K. Well

2432
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
for what it's worth I did just play Just Dance

2433
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
2014 earlier this week. But I

2434
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
realized I'm the exception to the rule.

2435
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
It's not really for everybody.

2436
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
And I totally get that point. And it's you know

2437
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I think with a lot of those

2438
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
motion games it kind of became the same thing over

2439
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
and over and it didn't evolve.

2440
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
And as we were talking about earlier tonight

2441
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
with the unfortunate closure of game

2442
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
trailers if things don't evolve

2443
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
they're not gonna necessarily

2444
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
make it sometimes. And so VR is

2445
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
gonna need that too. Anything.

2446
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Unfortunate. I laugh at that.

2447
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Look we

2448
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
both run the same thing.

2449
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
VOG and along with all games we

2450
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
outlasted them. Screw those

2451
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
people.

2452
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
What do you call it? The establishment

2453
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
where there are big giant companies behind

2454
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
them. Independent networking.

2455
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
That's what it's all about.

2456
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I'm with you and we're I mean not

2457
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
to sound all ego-y but we're the

2458
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
people putting them out of business. Not you and I

2459
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
specifically. No you and I.

2460
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
You, me, Black Wolf.

2461
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
There are

2462
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
people at the

2463
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
unemployment line because of us.

2464
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
And I say more power to them.

2465
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I'll double that number if I could.

2466
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Even worse their unemployment

2467
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
line is monitored by

2468
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Bea Arthur like in History of the World

2469
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
part one.

2470
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
It's my wine break.

2471
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Derek it is

2472
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
so good to hear from you here at OLR.

2473
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I know you're working on various projects.

2474
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
You wanna drop a few quick plugs before I let you go?

2475
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I will drop one plug

2476
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
and one plug only because

2477
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
I don't wanna over

2478
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
stay my welcome. My one plug

2479
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
is AllGames.com

2480
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Look we're all one big happy

2481
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
family. We may be estranged

2482
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
but I still see everybody

2483
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
as one big happy family. We're fighting

2484
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
against demand. We're keeping

2485
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
independent podcasting alive.

2486
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
You don't have to be a big time

2487
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
comedian or a

2488
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
pop star or have a talk show

2489
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
on TV to have a podcast.

2490
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
We can do it still. We don't need

2491
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
big giant companies behind us.

2492
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
OLR, Bobby Black Wolf Show,

2493
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Electric Sisterhood,

2494
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Dead Pixel Live,

Bomb Submitted, R9cast.

2496
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
We're all in this together

2497
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
and by that I will say just please

2498
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
go to not only vognetwork.com

2499
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
just remember to

2500
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
click over on AllGames.com

2501
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
also. I will cosign what you

2502
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
just said Derek. You're always welcome here at

2503
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
OLR. Oh thank you.

2504
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
I'll give everybody a big hug.

2505
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Alright sounds good. Have a good one Derek.

2506
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Thanks so much for the call. Bye guys.

2507
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Take care my friend.

2508
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
I'm surprised. Derek, I don't think

2509
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
he's been on this show since we were over

2510
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
at AllGames and that was a while ago

2511
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
at this point. That was 22.

2512
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Or 2012, 22.

2513
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
In the year 22. You know

2514
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
right after all the Jesus stuff.

2515
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
But anyway.

2516
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
No in all seriousness I cosigned what he said.

2517
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
That's why I don't sit here on this show

2518
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
and bash other indie podcasters.

2519
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
And I know for some people that's what they

2520
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
do is they like to do drama.

2521
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Stir the pot on and stuff. I don't like

2522
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
all in this together. We've got no room for that.

2523
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
And yes sometimes we're going to have

2524
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
different ideas and we do things a little differently

2525
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
and try new things or whatever.

2526
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Try to find the best way the puzzle pieces

2527
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
fit together. But that doesn't mean

2528
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
you completely turn your back on your roots.

2529
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
So I

2530
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
I cosigned what he said.

2531
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I'm going to do one more courtesy shout out for calls

2532
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
but then I'm going to close up the Skype line.

2533
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on

2534
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Skype. Or 1877

2535
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Game OLR if you want to do it the old fashioned way.

2536
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I don't know if you pulled up any other last minute stories

2537
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Loki. Can I just say

2538
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
here at the end of the show then some big

2539
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
kudos to Akuma

2540
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
JP. I want to thank our pal Akuma

2541
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
JP. I said so in the chat room today.

2542
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
We were talking earlier. Oh good.

2543
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Well he deserves some public kudos as well.

2544
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Totally thank you for sending me Toda KK.

2545
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
And I got to go grab. Loki doesn't know that he

2546
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
had something in the box too. I got to go grab it.

2547
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Well for those

2548
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
who don't know Toda KK

2549
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
was named after

2550
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
one of the big

2551
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
sound designers for Nintendo games.

2552
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
You might have also heard

2553
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
either KK song or Toda KK

2554
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
song.

2555
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
But KK Slider

2556
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
in the US version

2557
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
is Toda KK.

2558
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Nice.

2559
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Nice. A villager amiibo.

2560
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
That's funny. Yeah. I just got

2561
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
a villager amiibo which by the way you know those

2562
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
are very hard to find here in the US

2563
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
or at least you know I know they had a quick reprint or whatever

2564
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
but they're still very hard to find. I stood in line with Shane for one.

2565
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
And Animal Crossing is

2566
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
a great memory for you know

2567
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
all of us here at OLR so I thought that was awesome.

2568
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Thank you. But anyway another call is

2569
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
coming in so I want to get to it. Hi Aaron

2570
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
who's this? Hey it's Strelok.

2571
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Hey Strelok how you doing buddy?

2572
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Pretty good. Good to hear from you. What's on your mind?

2573
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Not too much.

2574
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Just kind of wanted to mourn

2575
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
the death of game

2576
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
trailers.

2577
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
And what was a memory

2578
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
or an impact that that site had for you?

2579
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
I

2580
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
really liked their reviews.

2581
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Brandon Jones

2582
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
has an amazing voice. I hope he

2583
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
continues to

2584
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
do stuff somewhere.

2585
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I could listen to that guy all day. He's

2586
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
awesome.

2587
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I was also a big fan of

2588
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
their pop fiction series.

2589
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
If you don't know

2590
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
what that is basically they would take

2591
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
like gaming

2592
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
myths like

2593
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
you know bringing

2594
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Aris back in Final Fantasy

2595
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
7 and once and for

2596
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
all you know debunk

2597
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
that kind of stuff.

2598
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
All those things that Electronic Gaming Monthly in April

2599
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
would try to say is true that wasn't really true

2600
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
and all that other stuff I'm sure. Yeah.

2601
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
That's awesome. Like I'm liking

2602
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Simon Belmont and

2603
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
TMNT2 for NES.

2604
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
You know

2605
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I know a lot of these folks

2606
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
that have found themselves out of work whether

2607
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
it be by choice or by

2608
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
you know being laid off or what have you

2609
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
a lot of them have turned to sites like

2610
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Patreon or Kickstarter

2611
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
to actually fund future projects.

2612
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Like I remember when

2613
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
not Joystiq but their

2614
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
WoW Insider

2615
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
they lost that arm and then they lost the

2616
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
MMO what was it

2617
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Massively. They cut loose.

2618
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Both those sites went to Patreon

2619
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
and you know I mentioned

2620
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
the Blizzard community is very

2621
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
very very rabid

2622
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
fans and I'll tell you that

2623
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
WoW Insider thing got which I think they

2624
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
call now Blizzardwatch. I think it's a

2625
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
tongue in cheek thing for Overwatch.

2626
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
That got funded like

2627
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
a ton of times over and you know

2628
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
they were able to continue doing that for their

2629
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
jobs. Now you know you guys

2630
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
know that when it gets into crowdfunding

2631
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
and podcasts it's a little bit of a gray

2632
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
area for me because I don't

2633
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
want to do it for OLR

2634
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
because I

2635
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
just feel like if you give money

2636
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
to us there's a

2637
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
certain expectation that I need

2638
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
to be able to turn around for you guys

2639
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
and when I do have a normal day job

2640
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
and all this other stuff like I really worry about

2641
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
putting myself in that position. Like if I'm gonna

2642
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
put myself out there and say this is my job

2643
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
then I'm gonna have to treat it like my job

2644
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
and be willing to learn my day job to do it.

2645
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Yeah. But

2646
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
for these guys that have done it professionally

2647
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
and maybe want to continue to do it

2648
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
maybe they're in a different position than I am

2649
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
and if they're able to deliver something

2650
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
worthy of your monthly fee

2651
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
or your yearly fee or whatever it is then

2652
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
you know Patreon might be a way to do that.

2653
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Yeah.

2654
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Also it really sucks

2655
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
the way it happened

2656
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
like they literally

2657
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
had like zero

2658
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
warning that

2659
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
that sucks. So I hope they can

2660
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
find work. But I will say

2661
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
with all of that too never say never

2662
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
I'm just saying you know

2663
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
for this show

2664
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
right now

2665
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
I would have to be able to

2666
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
produce a lot more if that makes sense.

2667
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Yeah. So.

2668
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
But anyway for game trailers

2669
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
you know I think they are still probably all

2670
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
recovering from the shock and I'm sure

2671
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
some of them will brainstorm some ideas

2672
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
and see how they can maybe move forward.

2673
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
And I wish them the best of luck.

2674
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
I wouldn't be

2675
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
surprised if we see like a smaller

2676
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
you know like

2677
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
I don't know what you would call it

2678
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
but you know like a spin off

2679
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
site with like a

2680
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
bunch or a few of the guys

2681
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
from game trailers

2682
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
pop up and maybe like a

2683
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Kickstarter or Patreon or something.

2684
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
They just have to figure out what are their

2685
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
strengths and what can they really offer

2686
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
people that other sites don't

2687
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
do and obviously that's not going to be true.

2688
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I love their reviews. Like their reviews were

2689
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
actually really well done and there actually

2690
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
weren't like

2691
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
perfect 10s across the board

2692
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
like you see a lot. They were pretty fair.

2693
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
It's a good call out.

2694
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Well I hope they're able to continue

2695
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
one way or the other. Yeah.

2696
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Any other thoughts for us, Sturlock?

2697
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I know

2698
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
this is Dan and

2699
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Red Entertainment's line but stay black.

2700
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
I'll try. Thank you very much

2701
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Sturlock. Alright. Take care my friend.

2702
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Bye.

2703
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Alright. I think that's

2704
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
going to do it for the Skype line tonight. It's about 9.15

2705
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
so we need to wrap up the show tonight but

2706
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I really want to thank all you guys who participated with

2707
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
the show tonight. Again I'll be at

2708
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
MagFest next week so there is

2709
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
not going to be a live Orange Lounge

2710
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
radio but we will be back in two weeks

2711
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2712
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
and I do have and I pimped this earlier

2713
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
in the show. I do have guys

2714
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
on a show is back and we just

2715
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
dropped three episodes out there so a little something

2716
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
to hopefully fill the gap for you

2717
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
before we come back in two weeks although that show is

2718
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
really really explicit so it might not be for everybody.

2719
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
But you know another great

2720
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
video game based show we talked about

2721
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
earlier tonight was Game Buoy

2722
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
who just joined the Voice of Geese Network and they do

2723
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
a great job talking about video games in depth

2724
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
so you know you could

2725
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
check them out on the week that we're off for sure

2726
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
and you know if you're into Power Rangers

2727
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
maybe Ranger Pride

2728
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
is where it's at for you and you can listen to them

2729
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
talk about the latest in Power Rangers

2730
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
and Super Sentai so congrats to

2731
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
those guys for being a part

2732
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
of the network and appreciate that. Anyway that is

2733
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2734
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting the show

2735
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
hey if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio

2736
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
tell a friend or two about the show

2737
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
your voice goes a long way

2738
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
in helping to spread

2739
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
the word and like Derek

2740
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
said on the call there we gotta

2741
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
support each other and continue

2742
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
to spread the love amongst the indie podcast

2743
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
so word of mouth is the biggest way you can help.

2744
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
A five star review goes a long way on

2745
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
whatever site it is you learned about this show

2746
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
possibly iTunes or

2747
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
some other type of podcasting app

2748
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
a five star review would go a long way

2749
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
in your support as well

2750
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
we would appreciate that.

2751
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
That is going to do it however

2752
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
tonight for the show

2753
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts

2754
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Dark Sakura we'll see you in two weeks

2755
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000

2756
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000

2760
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000

2765
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
