Club Nintendo Returns! My Nintendo debuts for many countries next month. Along with rewards, My Nintendo also marks Nintendo's expansion into social and gaming apps for phones and tablets. There's plenty to explain, along with some changes of heart and so much more, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Tonight, February the 7th of 2016, episode number 630 of our show.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Rob Roberts, also on Twitter at Skie, joining you in Sacramento, California Studio N7 with my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello and welcome back. You were absent last week. I know you had some other stuff coming up last minute, but we're glad to have you back.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So how you doing?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Alright.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's been a little while since you've been here because I was sick like two weeks ago.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, way to go Rob.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, we've been Jamie-less for a little while. I did tell the listeners that even though you missed last week, you were the one host that was good to go two weeks ago. And it was almost the Jamie Summers show for three hours.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dude, that used to happen.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What would happen on the Jamie Summers show for three hours?

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, I know, I know. You said it earlier when you came into the studio that yesterday you were having a bunch of sweet food. Today you're having a bunch of savory food. The three hour Jamie Summers experience would be salty.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So...

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You like that?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, I honestly don't know what the Jamie show would be. It's basically just me going, screw the format. I'm going to talk about, let me explain you a thing. That'll be my show. Let me explain you a thing.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's hard to do a show by yourself. Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, we are on of course 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern every Sunday night live at the Voicy Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com, immediately after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, he does do the solo thing and it's not easy. It's not. He does calls, so at least he has that at the end of the show, but he does a good 40 minutes or so by himself. So it's something that takes time to develop, I'm sure.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
See, I miss my music streaming show.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because then I could just play whatever the weirdness I had in my directory was.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, I miss the day when the legal legalities were much more blurred than they are today.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You know what I could do is I could do nothing but playing turntable.fm and stream it.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh my gosh, I miss that site. Turntable.fm was awesome. Did they ever get like a suitable replacement for that site? I don't remember what happened.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I thought it was still going.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, turntable.fm shut down some time ago.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, that sucks.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because then they were going through SoundCloud and then things happened and yeah.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh well. Anyway, also joining us in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hello.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
When OLR was a network, he actually had a show that was like turntables. It was two turntables and a microphone with Loki. So that wasn't the name of the show.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What was it, Friday Night Live?

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It was Livewire.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Livewire. Oh, that's it because the Mountain Dew joke.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yep.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good times. So have you mixed anything lately?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, DJ Loki's gone.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No, it's just having felt like it.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sure, I understand. Replaced with an indie game developer, Loki, which he also has.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Which he also hasn't really felt like doing. No, actually, funny enough, this week actually, I was super excited about it on Twitter.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Like, I have been having the hardest time getting Unity 5 to work on my PC. It just, for whatever fucking reason, it would just crash whenever I would try to change the color of a texture or whatever.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Whenever I go to that color picker, just the whole thing crashes. And I can never get it to work.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And it's fucking Windows 8's fault. Like, way back when I had Windows 8, it was that fault because, for whatever reason, that version of Windows I had kept having problems where it would take off file ownership.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So, like, you'd create a file or something and all of a sudden you can't read it, can't write to it because just all the owner properties are gone.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And you just randomly do that with pretty much anything that's being created.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, apparently, there was a file or a settings file that was hidden deep within the computer for Unity that still had that problem.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I, just out of a whim, I was like, you know, I was gonna install virtual machine to get it installed on there and see if that would work.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And I was like, you know, I should see about actually uninstalling it properly. Let me make sure I'm doing this right.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And it's like, oh, yeah, check in this folder, delete all this stuff. I'm like, I've done that. And I went into this other folder. I'm like, oh, hey, there's stuff still there.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry, but this sounds like when I had that Skype debacle a week, like a month ago on the show. Remember that?

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where the missing piece was, I needed Internet Explorer 8. Not 11. I needed Internet Explorer 8 specifically.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There was a file that was sitting in, like, one of the Unity 5 setting things that I went and deleted.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then it wouldn't delete. I'm like, why is this not deleting? And sure enough, the file was called, like, color setting something something.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm like, oh, son of a bitch. And so I deleted it, uninstalled it, reinstalled it. Oh, hey, it works now.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But that's great, though. So now I have Unity 5 working and I can make my game look much better.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And, yeah, all the fun bells and whistles I couldn't access with Unity 4 without Pro.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Alright, we do tape live, of course, at the Voice Geeks Network on Sunday nights, like I said earlier.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But if you are listening live, and thank you, by the way, if you are live tonight. I mean, we love the podcast people as well. Don't get me wrong.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We do the podcast because we love you guys, too. But I know, especially today, there's a little football game going on about a two-hour drive from here that has everybody going crazy.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So thank you, guys, for choosing OLR tonight. I very well realize some of you have OLR in the left ear and, like, the TV on speaker.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So you can kind of do both. Hey, that's okay. If you can multitask, you're still okay by me.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But if you are listening live, join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com. VX JasonXVR, our pal that does the voiceovers here on the show, says,

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
dubtrack.fm is the standing site of the turntable or plug DJ ilk, though there is no dance floor or user representation.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So, and that, you know, that was part of the best thing about turntable and why I love that site, which I can't believe we're doing, like, the retro thing for something that really was, well, it was only about two or three years ago that was the thing.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I really discovered a lot of great music through that. And that was even, like, we used to do, like, the post-OLR. We would kind of go on turntable for a little bit.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And, like, you would have five people on the stage and, like, I'd play a song, then Jamie would play a song, then whatever random listener got up there, like, Dark Tetsuya or Misty or something would play a song.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And, yeah, it was just, that was a lot of fun. So I missed that. I understand legally it's probably a bitch, but that was a great music discovery site.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So, anyhow, joining us in studio tonight, welcome back this week, someone else who I think joined us on many of those turntable nights, but is joining us here in studio for yet another bottle of wine.

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Say hello to Shane.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I said it early.

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How are you? Yes, you did. You're going to town on that wine early, aren't you?

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, from earlier, too, but no, I haven't, I'm taking this at a decent rate.

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah?

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah.

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think we had wine here in the studio, and today, Shane was like, I want more, so we need to go to the winery.

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It tastes like juice.

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What wine?

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, and Dark Sakura just finished her glass, by the way.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, I'm, like, losing right now, but there's plenty of night left.

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Did you have fun at the wineries today?

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, I did.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Good times.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And one tasted like Frutopia.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And you said it, right?

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And I said that to the wine people, because what are they going to do? Be horrified that I said that? It was a compliment.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I just, I don't know if, do we have any winemakers out there who listen? Would you enjoy having your drink compared to something you could get at McDonald's in the 90s?

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, but it was good.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mmm, this tastes like Dippin' Dots.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, that was good, too. So, yeah, you should take that and be proud that I said that, and I didn't say it tasted like a shoe like most wine does.

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You just don't like reds. You like whites.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, no, they also had that red that was good, too.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Because it was a sweet red. Anyway.

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In our chat room, we have Agent Pothead, who says, first time listening live ever for me. Well, you picked a heck of a night to do it. Thank you for being here. Appreciate that.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And anybody else who might be listening to OLR for the very first time.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Shane, I would ask what's new with you, but we just really got all that out of the way last week.

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because nothing happens in the span of a week.

103
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, do you want to talk about this new little toy you're playing with right now?

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, I finally got my Apple Pencil for my iPad Pro, and it's freaking amazing.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And I don't even want to touch my screen anymore. I'm just going to touch it with the pencil.

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're the only person I know, first off, with an iPad Pro, which is the gigantic one.

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not even that big after you play with it for a while. Like, I need a Pro Pro now.

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But you said something to me. Speaking of gaming and all this stuff, you said something to me earlier today. Like, how much are those things retail? Those Pros? Like $1,000?

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The one I got retail normally is like $1,100.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, my God. All right.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But I did not pay that, nor nearly that much.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, all right. We won't get into that.

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Exactly.

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, so these things are usually about $1,100, but you have one. And you said something earlier that, what was it? DJ Max Technica.

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, yeah, Technica. Yeah, what about it?

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Like, justified your purchase.

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, yeah, because I can't quit playing it. I absolutely love it. It's my Technica iPad. That's all it is.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But now with your pen...

119
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Now it's my drawing slash Technica iPad. But Technica's probably still a little higher on the list.

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I didn't even know you did art for yourself.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yep. There you go.

122
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because I would think if you were an art guy, you would have done the album art for your show yourself.

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I didn't have anything to even do that with, though, until now.

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Gotcha. Well, thank God Cody helped you out, huh?

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, and his album art is fantastic.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Quick plug for your show. Since we at least have one person who's listening for the first time tonight. Quick plug for your show.

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't know how to do that right now because I'm drinking.

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You say the name of the show.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ranger Pride.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And what it's about.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Power Rangers and Super Sentai.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And where they can find it.

133
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
On the Internet.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Very good. Very good.

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And iTunes.

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Just say available, just like on RuPaul's Drag Race, your favorite show.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will not. That is not my favorite show.

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Available on iTunes. Wink. That's how you do it.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That is not something I'm going to say like that.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
All right. All right.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Agent Pothead is pointing out, I've been a listener for about six years. Just my first time in chat.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, welcome all the same.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's a heck of a long time to be listening before you do the live thing.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You know what? I actually, I hear that quite a bit from some of the live people.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's like, you know, I've been listening to this show for years and I just, it just occurred to me you guys are live right now.

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I'm not doing anything for a change on Sunday night.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, no, we welcome everybody who likes to participate.

148
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So, anyhow, we're going to get into some gaming news for the week, of course.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And there's a lot of it going on, despite, you know, whatever football game's on the TV right now.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But I didn't want to get into a kickoff topic tonight, which, you know, there is a game on TV.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But there's some people that instead of watching the game that's on TV, well, they'll watch the game on TV,

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
but they want to watch it for the commercials.

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And, you know, Super Bowl commercials are pretty legendary.

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm hearing this year's, I mean, of Twitter, I don't know how much I trust Twitter to be the gauge of everything social in the world.

155
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And especially if they're going to fuck up the timeline order, which I've heard is a thing.

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know if that's Opt-In or whatever.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Apparently it's supposed to be Opt-In, but hopefully they don't go the route of Facebook.

158
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But anyway, I digress.

159
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Twitter is, you know, sometimes my gauge, that sort of thing.

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And I'm hearing the commercials this year are not that great.

161
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But some of the commercials in the past have been amazing.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For example, the year Betty White did the Snickers ad, I think that kind of put her back into the mainstream.

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And let's all be thankful for that, because Betty White should have never really left the mainstream.

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And if you saw a movie called Lake Placid where she had amazing cameo, she never left the mainstream.

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But anyway, I want to talk about commercials, and specifically a little bit about video game commercials.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because, say what you will about the commercials that are on during the Super Bowl this year.

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But we know that there's a big one for the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We already talked about that a little bit on last week's show, I think, because the commercial was already out on the internet.

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't think we talked about that last week at all.

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Did we? I thought we did.

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Nope.

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We talked about it. I haven't seen it.

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You haven't seen it?

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's what I would have said. No, I have not seen it.

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You still haven't seen it now?

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, I heard about it. It's got Generation 1 Pokemon and Lucario.

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And that's all I heard about it.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, it's got this really weird intermix, real life stuff.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It even shows a guy at a football game getting prepped, ready to go out on the field.

180
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And as he walks out, you know how football players will tap the ceiling type thing?

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The ceiling says, I want to be the very best.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's a whole bunch of little Easter eggs in that commercial.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Exactly.

184
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But then the other part is that a lot of the Pokemon that are in it just look like they're fucking real.

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like there's a Pikachu chilling out in somebody's living room that just looks like it's the family cat.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And everybody, of course, is going, this is what Pokemon Go is going to be like with stars in their eyes.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And it's like, no, if you've ever played Ingress, Pokemon Go will be nothing like what you think it's going to be.

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Just like the trailers for Ingress, it's like this big epic thing.

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's like, dude, this is going to be so awesome.

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You'll be sitting there on my cell phone and saying, no, it's not awesome. There's nothing.

191
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I love Ingress. I've met many amazing people playing Ingress.

192
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a great game, but it's nothing like the trailer.

193
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The trailer, it's not any more close to that. People do not do that at all.

194
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I encourage you to watch the Ingress trailer and then watch the Pokemon Go trailer and look at the fast one they're pulling on you.

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And again, that's not a slam on Pokemon Go. I can't wait to play it.

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think it's going to be the MMO that everybody's been waiting for.

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But anyway, so this Pokemon commercial has been on TV and I know a lot of people are talking about that.

198
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But how about video game commercials in general?

199
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I personally don't see as many of them as I used to.

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And that's probably because, well, I don't watch as many TV shows in general.

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Or if I do, it's on Netflix, so there are no commercials.

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Or I think a lot of people have the power to fast forward commercials.

203
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But I certainly know that video game commercials were a huge part of my youth.

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And I want to know from the crew in here, and for those of you in chat,

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
if you remember any epic video game commercials and how it might have sold you on the game or maybe made you want the game even more.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So, video game commercials. Anybody? Want to start us off, Loki?

207
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Video game commercials? I don't know. I think a lot of the ones for Grand Theft Auto were pretty cool.

208
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Just they set them to music and stuff. Like, I remember San Andreas, you know, that was pretty awesome.

209
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Even Grand Theft Auto 5. But Grand Theft Auto 5, I just watched the trailers like crazy anyways before the game came out.

210
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I can't really think of any 80s commercials or anything for video games that just kind of got me hyped up about them or anything. I don't know.

211
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
In chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, I still see Call of Duty commercials and they show review scores from all these tiny sites that gave them great marks.

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Which is the exact same thing that happens with movies. And they'll cut things completely out of context and all this other stuff too, right?

213
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Bobby says, we could get into a Call of Duty commercial if VOG wants to give Call of Duty a high rating and submit it to them.

214
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We're not going to sell out like that. If somebody on our staff happens to truly enjoy a Call of Duty game, then so be it.

215
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We'll give it a 10. A 10 out of 1.

216
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You want to be a 10 out of 100?

217
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It would just be like, you know, we'll just reverse the order. 10 higher the number, worse the game is.

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
10 out of 10. It's okay.

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's a 10th place position.

220
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And he's the one person not drinking wine. Just, you know, Dark Sakura.

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Four words. Your vision is our vision.

222
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What was? I don't remember that.

223
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
ColecoVision.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh! I'm too young for that.

225
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Was that weird baby commercial in the Super Bowl at all?

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Like for the Playstation 3, did they start doing that around that time? Or was that way...

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So it was ColecoVision for you, Dark Sakura?

228
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I just remember that being the first video game commercial I have a memory of.

229
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Sure.

230
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And it was only 1982, which I think you existed.

231
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I did exist. I'm just giving you crap.

232
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I remember the Atari 2600 kiosks at Thrifty's Payless or whatever.

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think it was just Payless at the time.

234
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The item that Dan and I sat and cleaned up on the kitchen table a few days ago was the same ColecoVision I owned as a kid.

235
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Wow. And it still works?

236
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Still works.

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's amazing.

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
On top of that, it still had the little technical advice safety sticker on the top of it.

239
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
With adhesive that never died or something.

240
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So we actually did save the sticker and put it in the bottom of our Frogger box full of annuals.

241
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's awesome.

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So, we've got pictures of it. I'll post it somewhere.

244
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The one that always comes to mind wasn't necessarily the video game commercial, but it was the Nintendo cereal commercial.

245
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Because Nintendo is for breakfast.

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Now, who doesn't remember that song?

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, it's our age. That's our age.

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay. I was like, I don't remember.

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Did you ever have Nintendo cereal?

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm pretty sure I did, but I don't remember having a commercial for it.

251
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It wasn't terrible, but it was pure sugar.

252
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It was pure sugar.

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It was awful.

254
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That sounds really good.

255
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I ate as a kid was like grape nuts and total.

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I hated kid cereals.

257
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I like that.

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Except for Rice Krispies.

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I didn't like total, but I like Chex.

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's what I like.

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Chex is the bomb.

262
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's why they still make mix out of it.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't they still sell Chex?

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, but you take Chex and you just cover it in cinnamon.

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Sounds good to me.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And then you add this stuff to it.

267
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Like real cinnamon and not that fake cinnamon crap they put on.

268
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

269
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Chex, I was going to say, Chex was cinnamon. Isn't that just Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

270
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Because the Cinnamon Toast Crunch was not good or real cinnamon.

271
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Cinnamon Toast Crunch is also not good if you put it in milk.

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Nasty, nasty, nasty crap.

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Golden Grahams is like crack.

274
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That was awful too.

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Instead of Cheerios.

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
As soon as they eat one, I'm like, I got to consume the entire box.

277
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I am actually one of the crazy people that hates the taste of Cheerios.

278
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I like Honey Nut Cheerios, but not...

279
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The sweetest thing that I liked as a kid was Frosted Mini-Wheats.

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Wait a minute.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The kick off topic was supposed to be...

282
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Cereal.

283
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Commercials, not breakfast, cereal.

284
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We can do that another time.

285
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Shane, okay, so you're a whopping five years younger than me.

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So what do you remember?

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't remember any commercials.

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Like I'm literally racking my brain.

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But they still show them today.

290
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I know, but I don't...

291
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The last time I remember seeing one was during South Park.

292
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sure there's like...

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I've seen like Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty commercials.

294
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But I can't think of a single commercial right now that I've seen at all.

295
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't know why.

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I remember a commercial for Link's...

297
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The Link game that was on Super Nintendo that was...

298
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Link to the Past?

299
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, Link to the Past.

300
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It was pretty amazing.

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't know.

302
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I have nothing.

303
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Absolutely nothing for commercials.

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I had that when it came out.

305
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

306
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, it was good.

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So I just don't think they ever existed at this point, because I can't remember it.

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Did you watch TV as a kid?

309
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I feel like I probably did.

310
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What shows were you watching, though?

311
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Because if you were watching like adult shows...

312
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Like adult shows.

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's say when you were 10.

314
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Power Rangers.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay, will you show...

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And X-Files.

317
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What?

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's just a funny combination.

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Power Rangers and X-Files.

320
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I remember.

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's like two of my favorite shows when I was a kid.

322
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That commercial was lame.

323
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, the Pokemon one?

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You just watched it?

325
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, I just watched it.

326
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Which thing is lame?

327
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why was it lame?

328
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's just stupid.

329
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's just like, oh, I can do that.

330
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I can do that.

331
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then they're training to be the best, I guess, in whatever crap that they're doing.

332
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And then it's just some random Pokemon shit.

333
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I never got my video game desiring stuff from commercials.

334
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Because I had subscriptions to Nintendo Power and GamePro, so I saw print ads.

335
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And I never really saw TV ads for games.

336
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There were a lot of legendary print ads, though.

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I can't even remember those, but I have no idea.

338
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Genesis does what Nintendo does.

339
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That was epic.

340
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I had GamePro, and that was all just one ad.

341
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That was a TV commercial, right?

342
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The Dark Side was just seeing the little jingle over there.

343
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's how they showed off that Street Fighter Championship Edition was going to be a thing

344
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
on Genesis, right?

345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And having the long-term argument over which version of Samurai Shodown was better.

346
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Which, by the way, was the SNES version.

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Alan Alchemy is off work tonight and wanted to make a quick cameo on the show to talk

348
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
on this topic.

349
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If you guys mentioned this previously, I apologize.

350
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm going to look really stupid.

351
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But who remembers the Legend of Zelda commercial that had nothing to do with Legend of Zelda?

352
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It was a guy in the turtleneck in a maze.

353
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Zelda!

354
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He was like, Octorot!

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And he's shouting the names of the monsters, and then they showed a little gameplay footage.

356
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And you had no idea.

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It was the weirdest commercial.

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You can probably find it on YouTube.

359
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I feel like that commercial came up on the show not even a month ago.

360
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean, yes, that was an epic commercial.

361
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But yeah, I think we played it.

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Epicly stupid.

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It was pretty stupid.

364
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think we watched it going, what does this actually have to do with the game whatsoever?

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay, I thought of one for Shane.

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Because I know when I was young.

367
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Here's the thing.

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Maybe it wasn't video game commercials.

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And we'll end on this, and we'll go into our gaming week.

370
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Maybe it wasn't video game commercials.

371
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But it was product placement for video games that was a big seller.

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And what I'm talking about is, when I was young, and when Jamie was young,

373
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
they had a show on TV called Starcade.

374
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And that's where...

375
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Starcade was great.

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah, they would play the actual 80s arcade games.

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And GameProTV.

378
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Like Kongo Bongo and shit.

379
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And trying to set the high scores.

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But now, five years later, probably when you were younger, around that 10 age,

381
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Nick Arcade was the thing that was on TV.

382
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Now, do you remember seeing stuff on Nick Arcade going, I want to get that?

383
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No.

384
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Really?

385
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
No, I didn't.

386
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, that was anticlimactic, wasn't it?

387
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You want to know what's great, though, is that I remember on GameProTV,

388
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
they had that one kid who was...

389
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It was hosted by J.D. Roth.

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, no, no, no.

391
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Funhaus?

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, who was the Funhaus guy.

393
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But no, J.D. Roth didn't do this one.

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He's the producer of The Biggest Loser.

395
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

396
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Fun fact. Anyway.

397
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But, well, it was when they showed the Neo Geo.

398
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ah.

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And had the cards and everything.

400
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I was like, I need this in my life.

401
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I made it my dream goal as a gamer to own a Neo Geo.

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And then when you got an income...

403
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No.

404
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You bought a Neo Geo, right?

405
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
When I got with Dan, he had a Neo Geo.

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And I knew he was a keeper.

407
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Some women, they want some flowers.

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
They want a diamond ring.

409
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Dark Sakura wants her man to have a Neo Geo.

410
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I love it.

411
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, and I honestly, I kind of put the goal off for a while because I worked at an arcade

412
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and we had all kinds of Neo Geo cabs and everything.

413
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And it were all the games that I wanted to play.

414
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We had a Metal Slug.

415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We had the widescreen Samurai Shodown 4 and everything.

416
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I was happy.

417
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And then I moved out here and Dan had a Neo Geo and a Sega CD.

418
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I was like...

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm moving in.

420
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Well, and the thing is, when I shipped my stuff ahead of time so that when I...

421
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The day I arrived, actually my big thing of luggage arrived.

422
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And in it was my Super Nintendo and Dan knew I was a keeper.

423
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You know, Nintendo did a great job of advertising kind of by using commercials in a way.

424
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It was like, if you had Nintendo Power, sometimes they would send you video tapes, VCR tapes

425
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
of upcoming games.

426
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And I got one for like...

427
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Videos.

428
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I got one for Donkey Kong.

429
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I remember that.

430
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Donkey Kong Country.

431
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I believe I got one for Killer Instinct.

432
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There was one for Killer Instinct.

433
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah.

434
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Because didn't it also come with the Killer Cuts album?

435
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No.

436
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That was when you bought the Super Nintendo game.

437
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

438
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay.

439
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Which I got mine at Montgomery Wards.

440
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I got several games from there too.

441
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That's right.

442
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
My Nintendo came from Sears.

443
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I paid 60 bucks for it.

444
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Back when Sears was a major player in gaming.

445
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And I still have my Killer Cuts.

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I got Einhander from Montgomery Wards.

447
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Remember when we were all kids, there was no GameStop.

448
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
There was a...

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Funkoland was in a magazine.

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I remember that.

451
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I didn't have Funkoland.

452
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But that was KB Toys.

453
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, it was like KB Toys and Toys R Us.

454
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I had Electronics Boutique and software, et cetera.

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Remember when we went to the Toys R Us and Chico and they still had the pull caps?

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That was so cool.

457
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That was so cool.

458
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh my God.

459
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's like a Toys R Us of the 90s with the pull slip.

460
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes.

461
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Babbages.

462
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And our Babbages was, we had a Babbages in the mall and we had a software, et cetera,

463
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that was part of Barnes and Noble, like in the back.

464
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And that was also the first Starbucks I ever went to.

465
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I used to get all my stuff for half price there.

466
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

467
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Dungeon Buster says, if I recall correctly, there was a Neo Geo ad comparing itself as

468
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
a fully loaded hot dog versus a plain boring one, all the other consoles.

469
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I remember that actually.

470
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I, that is true.

471
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That was a, that was a real thing.

472
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This hot dog costs $500.

473
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This hot dog, not $500.

474
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But the $500 one is fully loaded.

475
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It better be for $500.

476
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
All right.

477
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, uh, let's see.

478
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
NSJ100Matt says Toys R Us and Sears were my local game stores as a kid.

479
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, um, I used to go to Fry's.

480
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I remember like, uh, Street Fighter II came from a software, et cetera, but that was,

481
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
mine came from a pawn shop.

482
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I used to pre-order my games at both software, et cetera, and Electronics Boutique in the

483
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
same mall.

484
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And then just like decide later which one I wanted to go to.

485
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Cause I could never remember which one was upstairs or downstairs.

486
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So I was just like, I'll call in and do it over the phone.

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Wow.

488
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

489
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Wow.

490
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It didn't matter.

491
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It didn't matter.

492
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
All right, let's get into our gaming week.

493
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So we've had a fun walk down memory lane, but let's talk about the types of video games

494
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
that we have been playing a little more recently, such as this week.

495
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Uh, Dark Sakura, you got a couple of weeks to catch us up on.

496
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
How was your gaming week?

497
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It was actually kind of eventful because I was sitting down to play Dragon Age Inquisition

498
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
today and I just got this random thing.

499
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I was looking at different mods and decided that, um, these screenshots that someone posted

500
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
of Dragon's Dogma actually looked kind of cool.

501
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And so I, you know, it was on sale for that, whatever Steam thing sale they're doing is.

502
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Um, and so I decided that I was going to buy it and I started playing it and it was

503
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
actually super, super nice.

504
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I see Shane's iPad, so I'm going to airdrop him a picture of a Cliccovision.

505
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I had a Cliccovision.

506
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I, um, before I left Kansas, I found it and tried to turn it on and the only game I could

507
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
find the scary cat in the hat mix up game that just, I hate so much and it wouldn't

508
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
work.

509
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I was okay.

510
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Well, we also had Tecmo Bowl going on today because Dan wanted to see which team Tecmo

511
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Bowl would pick and they picked the Panthers.

512
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Um, uh, but Dragon's Dogma is pretty neat so far, but it really felt like a knockoff

513
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of Origins at first.

514
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And then, um, it actually got better after character creation.

515
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It, it, the story definitely veered, but I forgot that it was, um, uh, Capcom that was

516
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
the, uh, uh, producer.

517
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So I was a little surprised and kind of dismayed with myself for giving Capcom money, but oh

518
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
well.

519
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Um, and then, um, I've been playing some more, um, Animal Crossing, Happy Home Designer,

520
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
which that game makes me happy in my heart.

521
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Does it make you a home designer in your heart too?

522
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I guess.

523
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
A virtual home designer.

524
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You know, I, I, I broke out my, um, amiibo, uh, the, the, the amiibo and, uh, made Cyrus

525
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
a home today.

526
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I love Cyrus.

527
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I figured if I do kicks, it's just going to be nothing but like shoes all over the place.

528
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And I'm going to put a big sign in front of his house that says OMG shoes.

529
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Um, uh, Shane sent me a dog.

530
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah.

531
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I, well, you sent me a picture, so I was like, I need to return the favor.

532
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So here's a puppy.

533
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Nice.

534
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We're air dropping here in studio.

535
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Um, I also cleaned out a bunch of games out of my steam library that I'm not playing because

536
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm going to be changing out my hard drive in my PC for a terabyte hard drive soon.

537
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And, um, Dan and I are actually going to be doing the full home rig switch over to max

538
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
after, uh, income tax comes back in depending, depending cause we also wanted, you know,

539
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
actually clean up the game room and do stuff to it.

540
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We're also going to be selling off some of the vault.

541
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You've been threatening to do this for a while.

542
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
No, it's starting.

543
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We've actually gone to see how many duplicates of things we have.

544
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Do you know that we own six Nintendos?

545
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Wow.

546
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I think six.

547
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Well, one of them's loaned out.

548
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
One of them is the really crappy one.

549
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Two of them are fine decks.

550
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Two of them are in the box and one of them's a top loader.

551
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I love that you have it all detailed that much.

552
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That's what you said.

553
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
One of them's the crappy one.

554
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Like it's broken.

555
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oh, it's broke.

556
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Okay.

557
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This still, it still works cause it's Nintendo.

559
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean, um, we also were probably going to be selling off my super Nintendo cause it's,

560
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
it's got, it was, it's got the stain on it and we've got, you know, one that's really

561
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
pretty.

562
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And then we have, uh, the new style, one of those as well.

563
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Um, so anyone out there interested in buying a piece of the vault, let me know cause I

564
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
will give OLR people first crack.

565
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Um, other than that, um, haven't really been, oh yeah.

566
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Heroes of Dragon Age.

567
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This is my, my drug now because I want Cullen and the stupid game won't give, give me, it'll

568
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
give me a million reanimated Leandras, but no Cullen.

569
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Although I do now have a King Galister and that makes me happy too because he's precious

570
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
King cinnamon roll and now I'm done.

571
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
All right.

572
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Let's go over to Loki.

573
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
How was your gaming week?

574
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Um, my gaming week was pretty much consisted of, uh, Lego Marvel Avengers.

575
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I played through the rest of the mission.

576
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I think it's all story missions now.

577
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I have to go back and check.

578
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Um, but basically the main game, the main portion of that is just the first two Avenger

579
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
movies and they have three separate missions that cover the other movies that are kind

580
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
of in between Avengers and Avengers two.

581
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So there is Thor Dark World, Captain America, Winter Soldier and Iron Man three, all of

582
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
which I've not seen the movies yet for those, but it played through all the levels for me.

583
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Kind of a gist of what kind of happens now on this.

584
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So I finished all those and unlocked a bunch of characters and all that fun stuff.

585
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Still really frustrates me that the cars drive like shit and also that the, um, map

586
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
for whatever reason, they got rid of the map and it's this really small radar screen that

587
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
they have now that makes it fucking impossible to find anything you're looking for in the

588
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
game is super easy.

589
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Like in the old game to kind of eliminate, okay, here's all the different things I've

590
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
already unlocked.

591
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Um, you know, I need to figure out which character I'm missing.

592
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh, okay.

593
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
He's up here in the corner of the screen or something like that.

594
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Now you can't.

595
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You just have to run around randomly to all these colored dots and hopefully one of them

596
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
is the same is what you're looking for.

597
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's just really frustrating the way they decided to do that and for no apparent reason,

598
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
because all that they did was like the, the button that was the map before, which was

599
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
like the touch pad on the PlayStation four now is a go to space button, which actually

600
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
they have that in the pause menu as well.

601
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So it's stupid that they got rid of it.

602
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Uh, that being said, also played, um, what was it?

603
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
My son played a little bit of Lego, Marvel, um, superheroes.

604
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So I played a little bit of that as well.

605
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm very bored of that game since we've over 200 and like 30 hours into it.

606
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I will play that game with your son because they put Wiccan in it now.

607
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes.

608
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yes.

609
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We have Wiccan already from a Lego vendors, so that's pretty cool.

610
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Um, still disappointed.

611
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Spiderman's not in it though.

612
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Um, they have all the other ones from ultimate Spiderman, but not Spiderman.

613
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And then what else did I play?

614
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I also played ingress.

615
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm about 500,000 away from level 11.

616
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So, so just kind of playing it on my compute and commutes and stuff.

617
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And also, you know, on my way to the show today, I knocked down two big fields and stuff.

618
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So did that.

619
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And then what else?

620
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What else did I play?

621
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Um, I know there's something else I played.

622
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I bought some more games, I thought, on the PlayStation four because they were having

623
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
some sales and everything.

624
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So I want to say I was playing one of those, but yeah, apparently it was so awesome that

625
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I completely forgot about it.

626
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So I think maybe some follow up.

627
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's it.

628
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I did disconnect myself from the internet though, because they're going to patch out

629
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
one of the glitches I've been using and I don't want that to happen.

630
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Like, no.

631
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
All right.

632
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Um, my gaming week was, um, pretty, uh, I really only played Diablo three.

633
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I've been playing a lot of Diablo three seasons and I'm sure this made up the bulk of Shane's

634
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
week as well.

635
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Uh, but it's kind of like a thing like now, like, cause Diablo three, I feel like spoilers

636
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
for my week.

637
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Well, I feel like we've played a lot.

638
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Like last night we played a ton and then like there was another day this week we played

639
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
some, but it's like me, you, our friend Dom, and then Alan will all play online.

640
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So it's like a perfect, like a little four player set up and we're all different classes

641
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
in the season.

642
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So, uh, that's been kind of fun to progress in the rifts and all that.

643
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So I'm having a great time with Diablo three.

644
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I, a little, I still been dabbling a little bit in fall of SE 14.

645
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I did sign on enough to do the holiday event cause they have the Valentine's, but they

646
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
call it Valentine or something.

647
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
They call it something different in the game.

648
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Um, and I did that event real quick just to do that.

649
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Uh, I'm more kind of waiting for the content patch though, which I think is while I'm at

650
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
magfest is when, or like right when I get back, it was in that content patch comes out.

651
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So, um, there's that to look forward to.

652
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Otherwise I, I honestly didn't play a lot of stuff.

653
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm sorry guys.

654
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
A little bit of fall of SE explorers, but, um, I, I kind of slacked off on gaming this

655
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
week.

656
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Uh, Shane, how was your gaming week?

657
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Um, so I played a little bit of Diablo.

658
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I didn't, I don't think it's as much as you are kind of exclaiming, but mostly I played

659
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
more than you because Alan and I will play without you and without Dom.

660
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So there, there is more that I played a bit of explorers.

661
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Explorers still really love that game.

662
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Mostly, mostly DJ Max Technica on my iPad.

663
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Like I can't get enough of it.

664
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's so good.

665
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I wish they would update it, but it hasn't been updated in over a year, but I want more

666
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
songs even though like technically I think it has like a hundred, but you have to pay

667
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
for them.

668
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So I'm not going to get most of them, but it's really fun.

669
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I love it.

670
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I also, um, got a fan translation for the second Ace Attorney Investigations game.

671
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And so I started playing that cause I love the Ace Attorney games, but I didn't even

672
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
make it past like the first examining stage before I was like, I'm too tired to keep playing.

673
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's a lot of reading, but it's good.

674
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I like, I like the music a lot.

675
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So, um, that's all the games I played.

676
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Technica, some Cytus.

677
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That's it.

678
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
All right.

679
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Uh, before we get into tonight's gaming news, I want to just do some quick housekeeping.

680
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Uh, we will be here live next week in seven days, but we will not be here live in two

681
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
weeks.

682
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That is because I'm going to be in the Washington DC area at MagFest.

683
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm very excited to be there.

684
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Um, OLR and VOG Network, we're not really doing anything in an official capacity.

685
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We're just going because honestly, um, a lot of our listeners have been saying you should

686
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
go.

687
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And, um, after last year when I, I wasn't really, I'm in all honesty and transparency,

688
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I wasn't really feeling PAX East and I'm sorry to all the fans there.

689
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And, and I know there's some great people that still go and so forth, but I just, I

690
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
wasn't feeling it quite the same way and I wanted to try some different shows.

691
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So, um, a lot of folks were like, you should try MagFest.

692
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So I said, okay, so we're going to do MagFest this year.

693
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So I'm really excited to go and check that out.

694
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Um, so I will be there in two weeks.

695
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So that is very exciting.

696
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Bobby Blackwell from the Voice of Geeks Network also going to be there.

697
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I know some of our listeners are coming as well.

698
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Um, and, uh, my buddy who is on the Koopa Club podcast is going to be there.

699
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So, uh, I'm sure there will be no shortage.

700
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I saw some podcast panel.

701
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We have nothing to do with it, but there was some gaming podcast and I apologize.

702
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I forget the name of the moment of who you were, but, um, there, there's, there will

703
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
be no shortage of podcasters I'm sure at, uh, MagFest.

704
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So I'm looking forward to having a very good time there.

705
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Uh, stay tuned to our forums for more information on any, uh, potential meetup at the show.

706
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Uh, we're hoping to do like an unofficial type of meetup there, but I'll be really easy

707
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
to find.

708
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Just, uh, look for like, look, look for a Tron machine.

709
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Uh, look for Dig Dug cause I'm really, you know, I play that and I'm, I like that game

710
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a lot.

711
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Uh, or look for, um, like a classic Star Wars.

712
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
If they have like one of those Star Wars caps, especially if you can sit in it, like they

713
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
have at, um, California Extreme, I will definitely be playing that.

714
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So, all right.

715
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Uh, so I'm excited about MagFest.

716
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
SSG100Matt says, I'm getting really hyped for MagFest.

717
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I mentally packed this week.

718
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Hey, when I saw that schedule come out and I saw that they are actually screening a Clue

719
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
VCR game documentary, that's when my hype began because that, that was like my childhood

720
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
right there.

721
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's, that's why I didn't see commercials cause I was watching that damn Clue VCR game

722
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and that's in addition to the movie from 85, like over and over and over again on my beta.

723
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Um, anyway, so, uh, another big, uh, thing to mention here on OLR, we mentioned this

724
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
on Bobby's show before we started tonight, but I think it's appropriate to mention here

725
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
too.

726
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Uh, this affects the voice of geeks network, uh, in seven days.

727
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So next Sunday at six o'clock right in between Bobby's show and our show, we're going to

728
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
be doing a special, uh, quick little state of the station update where we are going to

729
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
be announcing not one new show, not two new shows, three new shows joining the voice of

730
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
geeks network, uh, effective next week.

731
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And you'll get to hear a preview of at least one of them, if not more right after OLR next

732
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
week.

733
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Um, so I'm very excited about that.

734
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We're going to be making that announcement, um, next week.

735
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So stay tuned.

736
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Uh, meanwhile, we're going to get into some gaming news.

737
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I think it's that time.

738
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Let's talk about what happened to video games this week, much more than football, right

739
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Loki?

740
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Uh, yes.

741
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So there's a rumor.

742
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Well, I should say there's always a rumor about this, but hopefully a little bit more

743
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
to it, uh, that Nintendo is going to be finally localizing mother three.

744
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And this is coming from Emily Rogers, um, who is, I guess, a Nintendo focused writer

745
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
who's made different predictions in the past.

746
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It basically has a source that has come forward, adding, um, some more evidence to this, basically

747
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
saying that, you know, the 10th anniversary of the game, um, on, since it's launching

748
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Game Boy Advance in Japan is coming up soon.

749
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And they're saying that it's probably going to be released as like a virtual console game.

750
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So that'd be interesting.

751
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Well, it took them long enough.

752
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Jesus.

753
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Um, it's about to, I hope, I hope this is true.

754
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Um, it makes a lot of sense though.

755
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Um, I can't, okay.

756
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Again, I can't imagine the virtual console thing really costs him a lot of money.

757
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Um, especially that they could just take the ROM from Europe and put it out here.

758
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I mean, yes, I know that there was different, actually, no, cause it was a handheld game.

759
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I don't think the resolutions would have been any different.

760
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I know for some older games, you have different resolutions on that games.

761
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You literally, well, Game Boy Advance is a region free.

762
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I think you can just pop one in.

763
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So, there's no reason why this game shouldn't make a virtual console.

764
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't know if they did.

765
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
They actually have a ROM though in Europe for that.

766
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It was released in Europe.

767
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah.

768
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't think it was it.

769
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm, I'm almost positive.

770
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It was three.

771
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No, you're up.

772
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Didn't get it.

773
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I know nobody's got happen.

774
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah.

775
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
They had a, an English translated one already in Europe.

776
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't think people would give a shit because they would just be importing that.

777
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But this is, no, they don't have an English version of this aside from the one that has

778
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
been fan made.

779
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Well, but it's not, okay, so clearly I'm crazy, which is fine.

780
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But, um, the, it's not completely crazy that they would have like a prototype that they

781
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
could just like finish up with minimal resources because that's what happened to Earthbound

782
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Zero.

783
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And my assumption is they made a good chunk of change from Earthbound Zero, um, or Mother

784
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
One as the case may be that they were, uh, able to justify doing this.

785
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Now it'll be interesting to see what they sell it as.

786
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Are they going to put it out as Earthbound Two and really confuse people?

787
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Are they just going to put it out as Earthbound Lucas's story or something?

788
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Earthbound The Final.

789
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Earthbound The Final.

790
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't know.

791
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Call it Mother Three or Earthbound Mother Three or something like that.

792
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah, maybe Earthbound Mother.

793
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I don't know.

794
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
We don't know what it really was called.

795
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Yeah.

796
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Now it's kind of like it's square eventually.

797
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah.

798
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
With, you know, Final Fantasy.

799
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Exactly.

800
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Square eventually kind of said, all right, we, everybody knows what's going on, but there

801
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
still is a part of me that will call Final Fantasy Four, I guess.

802
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I will still call it Final Fantasy Two, but when I am specific, specifically speaking

803
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
about the US version, which was kind of different, it was dumbed down, right?

804
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I can't think of it that way because I've spent a lot of time playing the Japanese Two

805
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and Three.

806
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah, I know.

807
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And I love Three with the job system in it and everything.

808
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I know.

809
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I usually mention what system, like if I'm saying Final Fantasy Two on the Game Boy Advance,

810
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
that's one game.

811
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But if I say Final Fantasy Two on the Super Nintendo, that's another.

812
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
He goes, I don't know.

813
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's just how I tend to label things.

814
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I've never played any of the Earthbound games, so.

815
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
They're good.

816
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I mean, as far as RPGs go, I mean, you might have a hard-

817
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Be the game with prayer.

818
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You might have a hard time going back now, like, and this happens a lot with retro games,

819
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
right?

820
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You kind of go back and you're like, what did I really see in this as a kid?

821
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Well, one of two things can happen.

822
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You can kind of have that approach.

823
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Or sometimes you really, like when I go back and play an old Mario game, like especially

824
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
like Mario Two, I'm right back to being, you know, ten years old.

825
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah, like I think like when you go back and play like Final Fantasy, like the Super Nintendo

826
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
games, they still hold up for me, but like going back and playing Final Fantasy Seven,

827
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I was like, uh.

828
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah.

829
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's a little rough.

830
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's a little rough.

831
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
This isn't quite as good as I remembered it.

832
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That shit was, uh, that was like cutting edge at the time.

833
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Like, yeah, I was like super hyped about it because I love, like before that was, you

834
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
know, Final Fantasy Three.

835
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I was like, dude, all this is so awesome.

836
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And then even still, I kind of remember how I felt playing it for the first time.

837
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It was just super, like, I love that whole just kind of, you know, futuristic tech and

838
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
kind of that fantasy world type setting.

839
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I really liked that about six and seven had that all over the place.

840
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And so I was really hyped up about that.

841
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
All right.

842
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, moving on to where, where this could possibly be announced.

843
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I mean, Earthbound Zero was an E3 thing last year, so why not Mother 3 for E3?

844
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
If not sooner, maybe they'll do a direct.

845
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I mean, June is a long time to wait after all, and June will probably be dominated with

846
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
NX conversation.

847
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But anyhow, let's talk about Bethesda and what they are planning for E3.

848
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You might remember last year, Bethesda actually cut into our show and we, like for the first

849
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
time ever, we had to be like, all right, well, we know how it really goes.

850
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I mean, as far as gamers go, a press conference is bigger than the Super Bowl, right?

851
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Some people even call E3 the Super Bowl for gamers, right?

852
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So whereas I think there's plenty of you that will listen to this show as opposed to the

853
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Super Bowl, I don't know if there's people that are willing to miss press conferences

854
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
to listen to this show.

855
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Although I know there's a few of you that would say I would.

856
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Depends if it's that PC gaming centric one from last year.

857
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yes, I'm willing to miss that for the show because that was really lame last year.

858
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah, but who knows?

859
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Maybe this will be the Skyrim HD year or I was hoping it would be the, you know, the

860
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Half-Life 3 here.

861
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But no, no, no, no.

862
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Or it'll be a new Elder Scrolls one these days.

863
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Gaben's going to be on the stage and everyone's going to lose their shit.

864
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's going to be rolled down as life support Iron Lung, but it goes half life and die.

865
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But here's the thing.

866
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Bethesda, it is confirmed it is happening again this year.

867
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And it is on Sunday and it's going to be seven o'clock the same time.

868
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The save the dates went out and they did have the characters from Skyrim, Doom, Dishonored

869
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
all showing up there.

870
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So I'm sure Dishonored 2 is a part of, you know, what they're going to be talking about.

871
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Skyrim HD! Skyrim HD!

872
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Maybe Fallout DLC, wherever that is at that point.

873
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We'll probably hear more about that.

874
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
What's interesting though is that this year they're not going to be the first because

875
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
as you remember us talking about last week with the whole E3 has just decided to literally

876
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
do their own thing.

877
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
They're not going to participate in E3.

878
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Instead they're going to be across the street and they're going to do their own conference.

879
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Well, I mean, they always did their own conference, but now they have to fire the first shot because

880
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
their thing is opening a day earlier.

881
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So they're going to go Sunday at 4 Eastern.

882
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So they're not even going to be first.

883
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Sorry, EA is going to be first.

884
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Bethesda will not be.

885
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So when's Bethesda 7 PM?

886
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I believe Pacific.

887
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Alright.

888
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.

889
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So there's a big gap between them, but still.

890
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You know, now E3 has spilled into Sunday because you're going to have those guys on Sunday.

891
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Presumably you're going to have Microsoft and Sony again on Monday.

892
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And then you'll have Nintendo Tuesday morning, unless now that there's a gap with EA,

893
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
somebody may fill in that gap.

894
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I don't know if that will be Nintendo.

895
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's going to be Konami.

896
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
They're going to have so many things to not talk about.

897
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Could be Square Enix.

898
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Remember Square Enix did their own thing last year, but it was kind of a, it was a direct like Nintendo.

899
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And I should say, even though I'm saying Nintendo conference, we all know they switched to the direct style.

900
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Although, I mean, if a console is showing up, this might be the year to go back to the old school way.

901
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I don't think a direct is necessarily a given.

902
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
We'll see.

903
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I think a direct would still be nicer just in general.

904
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Nintendo's directs are always really straight to the point.

905
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And you can't have, you know, errors that happen on stage.

906
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Like when they were trying to target with Link and the Wii remote for Skyward Sword.

907
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
They can cut all that out and just show what they want to show.

908
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yeah.

909
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Not worry about that stuff.

910
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But you know, it does, it does lose a little something.

911
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I mean, I, you know, and I.

912
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Well, it'd be on the show floor.

913
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So why do we need to show it in front of an audience in an auditorium when people can just go see it on the floor?

914
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Why do people go to see artists live when you can listen to the CD?

915
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
No, no, no.

916
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That's what I wondered to myself.

917
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Because going to.

918
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I understand what you're saying, Shane.

919
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
He's basically saying that, you know, why bother just demonstrating it live in front of an audience when.

920
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
When that same audience would be on the floor.

921
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah, they're going to be seeing it live anyway.

922
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Do it there.

923
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
There's something about it.

924
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Don't get me wrong.

925
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm not saying I'm like anti direct or anything.

926
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm not.

927
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
No, there is something about like losing out on that essence of Nintendo.

928
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Like when they're demonstrating Wii music and having a guy drum.

929
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But you guys are fixating on their shittier years.

930
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No, no, no.

931
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
No, I remember the year they opened.

932
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That was the year I met Koji Kondo and that was great.

933
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Remember the year they opened with the Zelda Symphony and all that.

934
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I mean, like I was.

935
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Reaction from the audience.

936
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I was.

937
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Wasn't that the year I was actually at their press conference?

938
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That was the Wii U demo on the screens and stuff.

939
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And then you could go play it on the show floor.

940
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I still think even being at a good Nintendo press conference that getting all the good

941
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
information out in a direct is better than having an auditorium full of people who in

942
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
like 10 minutes after that thing ends are just going to go play it anyway.

943
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So it makes no sense to me.

944
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
All right.

945
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Well, that's the 100 Matt with a good tinfoil hat theory in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

946
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You have to think Square Enix is doing something unannounced with Nintendo.

947
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
They seem to be buddy-buddy lately.

948
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, remember those rumors from about a month ago that Nintendo is in bed with some particular

949
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
company for NX and through the process of elimination.

950
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It seems like Square Enix is a very likely candidate for Nintendo to be in bed with.

951
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Although we don't know.

952
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It could be nothing.

953
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
We'll see.

954
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It could be Sega.

955
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Maybe Phantasy Star Online 2 will be on the NX.

956
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Maybe that's what they've been waiting for this whole time.

957
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Maybe not.

958
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
All right.

959
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Anyhow, we'll see what happens as the other pieces fall into place.

960
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I imagine we're going to hear more save the dates in the coming days.

961
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
As far as this show, I don't know what we're going to do yet.

962
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So don't ask because I'm saying save the date like it's going to be a wedding.

963
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I know.

964
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Right.

965
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I don't know.

966
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I think it wasn't Shane.

967
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Last I checked, Shane was going to try to convince me to go to the EA thing to play

968
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Mass Effect.

969
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Oh yeah, because I want to go play Mass Effect.

970
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I wouldn't go to that.

971
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
See, two people will convince you.

972
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Have fun.

973
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I can't take all that time off work.

974
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That's my problem.

975
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's like two days because we don't have to go every day.

976
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Do you just want to just drive down there and hang out at EA and come back?

977
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Yeah.

978
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That is exactly what I would like to do.

979
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Have a great date.

980
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
With a stop at Disneyland and then come back.

981
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Take pictures.

982
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
As long as I still have time for Power Morphicon, yes.

983
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Alright, priorities.

984
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Priorities.

985
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Well, those tickets are already gone.

986
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I have a priority.

987
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Alright.

988
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
What is your priority, Darcyra?

989
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
My priority is...

990
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Disneyland?

991
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah, actually.

992
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Tea cups?

993
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You know, I took a video just for you.

994
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Shedding a single tear at the former site of Bucket of Meat?

995
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I actually did cry a little bit into my stolen bucket.

996
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Aw, had you been drinking, though?

997
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
No.

998
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VoGnetwork.com,

999
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
use the passphrase, sing.

1000
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Alright, moving on.

1001
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Next story, Darcyra.

1002
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Okay.

1003
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So, I know that you talked about the Fine Brothers last week.

1004
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah, we talked a little bit about this, but...

1005
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
About the whole trademarking the React thing.

1006
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And actually, Dan and I watched their response video about that.

1007
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
It was pretty...

1008
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I didn't see it.

1009
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I only heard about it.

1010
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But the response hadn't happened last week, because it wasn't just that.

1011
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
We talked about another trademark thing that was going on.

1012
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I don't know if it was the Sony Let's Play thing.

1013
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah, it was.

1014
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah, so...

1015
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Which has already been determined that it couldn't be trademarked.

1016
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yeah, it was that.

1017
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
It's, yeah, so it's like something in the common vernacular, so...

1018
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, anyway, so the Fine Brothers, they had a lot of backlash.

1019
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
They lost like a million subscribers.

1020
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Wow.

1021
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And tons of dislikes on videos related to that whole thing.

1022
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And so they finally, I guess, realizing that people do not like this course of action,

1023
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
no matter what they may think of it, decided to go back on it and say that they weren't

1024
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
gonna do it.

1025
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
In fact, they released a statement saying...

1026
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm just gonna read this.

1027
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
We realized we built a system that could easily be used for wrong.

1028
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
We are fixing that.

1029
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
The reality that trademarks like these could be used to theoretically give companies the

1030
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
power to police and control online video is a valid concern.

1031
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And though we can assert our intentions are pure, there's no way to prove them.

1032
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So, yeah, they pulled it back.

1033
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They are actually going to rescind the trademark filing, discontinue the licensing and tools

1034
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
plan, which they were calling the React World program, and release all past content ID claims

1035
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
on YouTube.

1036
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Can I say something about this that might be a little bit unexpected and maybe, I guess,

1037
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
a little tinfoil haddish, but maybe like a moral of this story, perhaps?

1038
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Because I kind of feel like...

1039
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And I could be wrong.

1040
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And I realized I was critical of this whole thing last week, as we all were.

1041
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But kind of hearing about this and thinking about how did we get from point A to B and

1042
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
all that, do I really think the Fine brothers themselves, those two guys that do this whole

1043
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
thing, do I think that this was actually their idea?

1044
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I kind of don't think it was.

1045
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And so I think the moral of the story is you need to watch the people that represent you.

1046
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And I think this goes true for a lot of people that are looking at developing indie games

1047
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and trying to get that out there and hooking up with publishers and all this stuff.

1048
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I think you really need to watch the people that represent you because I have this weird

1049
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
feeling that the lawyers for the Fine brothers, I mean, they probably had to sign off on it.

1050
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
They probably like, uh-huh, yeah, good idea.

1051
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But I had this weird feeling that somebody planted the seed in their head that they just

1052
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
kind of went along with.

1053
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm not trying to absolve them of guilt or whatever, any of the fallout.

1054
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I'm just trying to say I had this feeling this was not their idea, but they're the ones

1055
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
on video now having to apologize for it.

1056
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Does that make sense?

1057
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I don't think it was.

1058
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I think that it's something that they had to have had quite a bit of a hand in, even

1059
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
if it wasn't their idea to begin with.

1060
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It just seems like it's too common an occurrence trying to...

1061
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Sure.

1062
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
...trademark things on.

1063
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, I'm not absolving them of all guilt, but I'm just saying, like, you know, maybe

1064
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
if somebody different was directing them, this wouldn't have happened.

1065
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Does that make sense?

1066
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I mean, if they were trying to do trademarks for, like, elders react to as their statement

1067
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
or kids react to as their statement, you know, the actual phrase.

1068
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Right.

1069
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Narrow to YouTube usage or whatever.

1070
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
That can be branding right there.

1071
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And then in that case, it would be protecting their brand.

1072
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
However, just the word react, it's like just the word crush, you know.

1073
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Or saga.

1074
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Or saga or candy.

1075
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I think it would be very hard to trademark candy.

1076
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I think Hershey's and Mars, I think Cadbury, they'd all have some problems with that.

1077
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
You mean all of this...

1078
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Willy Wonka would fuck you up if you tried to trademark candy.

1079
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Well, that's okay, because Nestle is evil anyway.

1080
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I forgot.

1081
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I didn't know those two companies were connected.

1082
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
No, it's Nestle, Mars.

1083
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
There's a few other companies that participate in using underage child labor.

1084
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And you have to be careful who is representing you.

1085
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Because, again, these are probably suppliers that they have no idea.

1086
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
They don't know how the sausage is made.

1087
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Nestle knows.

1088
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Oh, that's too bad.

1089
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah, the people who say that water isn't a right, it's a marketable thing.

1090
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
On the contrary, though, I think they're fully to blame.

1091
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm sorry.

1092
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
There's nothing that was all...

1093
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And here's why.

1094
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Just the way they've reacted to other people doing similar react-type videos, not even calling it that.

1095
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And they're fucking like coming out saying, oh, everybody better gang up against these guys,

1096
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
because they didn't even ask our permission to do this sort of thing.

1097
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Fuck them, seriously.

1098
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
This entire thing just...

1099
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
They had content claims on them.

1100
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, I'm talking about like Ellen and fucking Jimmy Kimmel do similar type of things.

1101
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And he's having like...

1102
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They go out on their social media pages and tell everybody to go let them know how dare they use it without our permission.

1103
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But the two of them are sitting there filing all these content claims?

1104
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That's my whole thing.

1105
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
No, they're not filing those content claims.

1106
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Their company that they work for or whatever is...

1107
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Or they have people that go out and file those type of claims.

1108
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But it's their intent.

1109
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
They thought what they were doing was actually helping everybody.

1110
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
They thought that this was the greatest thing for these people to get a piece of this react market

1111
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and get a piece of their content, because damn, look at what they're doing to the internet.

1112
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I mean, that's why they came out with a fucking video that said, in 100 years from now,

1113
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
people are going to look at this and they're going to be like, whoa, what did people think about this?

1114
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And they'll be able to find out because of these react videos.

1115
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
They literally thought that.

1116
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
They thought that they were such hot shit with this.

1117
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So that's why they thought that, well, why is everybody reacting this way to this?

1118
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
What the hell? We're doing you guys a favor.

1119
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
To be fair, they probably only show you extremes.

1120
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Whereas the majority of people probably don't react in such an extreme manner.

1121
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
When you edit it down to a 10-minute video, it's any reality TV.

1122
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You show the extremes.

1123
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You show all the fights that happen on Survivor.

1124
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You don't show the boring stuff about day-to-day surviving. Does that make sense?

1125
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Sometimes they do on Survivor.

1126
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Do they actually show somebody pooping in the woods?

1127
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Because I would think that would be kind of boring.

1128
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
More interesting if someone didn't survive on that show.

1129
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
There's lots of downtime they show on that show.

1130
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You should watch Survivor again. You would know.

1131
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I know. It's been a while. I'm waiting to be honest.

1132
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm sorry. And here's the thing, too, about it, too.

1133
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
They went ahead and rescinded all these things.

1134
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Not to say that the next time they go to attempt this,

1135
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
they just won't tell anybody that they're doing it beforehand.

1136
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
All right. A couple more comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1137
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
SS 2100 Matt says, Blaming in on lawyers would certainly attempt to fix their image.

1138
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Still, though, trademark filing is a douchebag move all around.

1139
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Dark Tetsuya brings up the whole Tim Langdell had a little trouble getting edge,

1140
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
although things may be different now.

1141
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
That was another one along that whole saga and all that stuff.

1142
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Dungeon Buster says, It sounds like the Fine Brothers were given bad advice.

1143
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
If they didn't make such a huge announcement,

1144
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
they probably would have gotten the mark without anyone knowing

1145
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
because they had already gotten a few.

1146
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Then it would have been harder to challenge the mark if it were given.

1147
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That's another interesting perspective on

1148
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
maybe if the people who were represented them had been a little smoother,

1149
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
they could have been absolutely evil.

1150
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids.

1151
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I also consider that trademark filing is public.

1152
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So anyone can find that information.

1153
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And SS 2100 Matt points out, fact of the matter is that trademark laws suck and need to be changed.

1154
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
That is probably also true.

1155
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But the public part is important.

1156
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
All right, let's move on.

1157
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
We have plenty more to cover about games.

1158
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Loki.

1159
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
All right, so speaking of kind of douchebaggery,

1160
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:33,000
22Cans, they have decided to finally remove microtransactions from Godus Wars.

1161
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And I guess this is launched as a single player version of Godus on Steam Early Access.

1162
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And I guess because of that, you had to actually pay for microtransactions for different things.

1163
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Like, for example, there's a $4.99 microtransaction to add a whole new continent with 40 missions to the game.

1164
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And it's just, I don't know, people didn't like it.

1165
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Well, I think it's mainly because the game was early access also.

1166
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Because of that, though, they have decided to remove the microtransactions.

1167
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And they're going to have the extra content that you would normally pay $4.99 for as free.

1168
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So basically it said, in the meantime, it's been brought to our attention that the extra content being premium add-on isn't really a popular choice.

1169
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:34,000
While we think it does represent good value, especially considering that Godus Wars has been delivered as a free update to hundreds of thousands of users.

1170
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And the lower price of the main game, we understand the previous Godus owner's frustration with this.

1171
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah, trying to nickel and dime your earliest adopters may not always be the best idea.

1172
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
DungeonBuster bringing up an interesting point.

1173
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I think you were talking about this a little bit before the show, Loki.

1174
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's interesting to note that with Godus included in Godus Wars, they're retiring the store page for Godus and essentially wiping the negative reviews that were there.

1175
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And I really think it's pronounced Godus, but I always think of the showgirls.

1176
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Well, and you pronounce a lot of things wrong, so it's okay.

1177
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I do. So why not? I'll just stick with Godus.

1178
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But I think it's supposed to be God, us.

1179
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You should ask PewDiePie what he thinks about Godus.

1180
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Shut up.

1181
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Anyway, I just like emphasizing the die in his name. Is there anything so wrong with that?

1182
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
You just can't read. I need to hold up a sign.

1183
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Cat. Cat. Cat. Cat.

1184
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Not enough spit is coming out of your mouth right now.

1185
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And I'm reenacting a scene from Strangers with Candy. If anybody thinks I'm being insensitive, it's actually that show that's insensitive.

1186
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh, it's so good.

1187
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It's so good. Alright, anyway.

1188
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
There's something that needs to come back.

1189
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah.

1190
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I think Stephen Colbert might be a little busy now.

1191
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I don't care.

1192
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
He's gonna get cancelled soon enough.

1193
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
He's not gonna get cancelled. Don't say that.

1194
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Not doing well.

1195
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
If you put it as a sketch on your show, it's perfectly fine.

1196
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Mr. Jelly Nick and Jerry were on an episode of that not great show, Difficult People.

1197
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, that Hulu one that I never finished.

1198
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah, I don't like that show.

1199
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I watched like half of it.

1200
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Didn't you like it?

1201
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You were trying to tell me it was good.

1202
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Like the first episode was good and then the rest of it was not.

1203
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I tried. I really tried to like it, but I couldn't.

1204
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's just not great.

1205
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I couldn't deal with, and this isn't video game, but let's be real. It's probably more interesting than Godus.

1206
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Godus.

1207
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Now I'm going to say it wrong on purpose.

1208
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
This made me think of goat.

1209
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's spelled like POTUS, so it's go to.

1210
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I know this is a bad tangent.

1211
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
No, because if it had a T in it, it would be go to us.

1212
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
All right. I've been drinking and I'm trying to say something, so I'm going to get real belligerent here.

1213
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You have something to say?

1214
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I got something to say.

1215
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Girl, say it.

1216
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Now I forgot what I was going to say.

1217
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You're dumb and drunk.

1218
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Hey, Shane. Hey, Shane.

1219
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah.

1220
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Do you remember that party like back, back, back in the day when-

1221
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
The dunk.

1222
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
The dunk thing.

1223
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Yeah.

1224
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
We were trying to say drunk and nothing but dunk would happen, so dunk means drunk.

1225
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Oh, I was going to tell you why I didn't like Difficult People.

1226
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Because although the plot lines would be kind of funny and-

1227
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't get any of the jokes.

1228
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
What's Her Name That Played Precious was hilarious in that show.

1229
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah, she was really good in that.

1230
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And it was great to see her in there.

1231
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And I like the two actors that are in it. They're funny. What's his name? Billy-

1232
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Billy Eichner.

1233
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
He's funny. But the thing is, they would just be talking and there would be this random obscure-

1234
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It was like the Family Guy, but instead of a cutaway that's funny and animated, it would be this random obscure pop culture reference.

1235
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Yeah, I understood the Family Guy references more even if they didn't show me the clips.

1236
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
But Difficult People is like, what? I just don't understand anything.

1237
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah.

1238
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Dark Tetsuya is saying, has Rob been hitting the wine again?

1239
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah, did you miss the- Dark Tetsuya, did you miss the beginning of the show? Were you tardy tonight?

1240
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yes. Shane only shows up to the show now when he hears that wine is involved.

1241
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
So if you hear Shane's voice, there's probably a bottle of wine open somewhere.

1242
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And yes, we're having the same wine that we had last week because Shane is incapable of trying new things.

1243
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yep. It's true.

1244
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Why do you think I have had Taco Bells for so many years?

1245
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, the creator of the GIF format- I'm not going to say it the other way.

1246
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So again, you're saying it wrong.

1247
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Wants to know why you suddenly care about proper pronunciation.

1248
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Well, when you start saying giraffics, I'll start saying GIF.

1249
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
What's a giraffic?

1250
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Exactly.

1251
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
No, is that like giraffics?

1252
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Are you saying giraffics wrong?

1253
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That's how they draw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.

1254
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's just like when you pronounce, you don't pronounce it guy-ant, you pronounce it giant because it's GI.

1255
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
But English is a stupid language, period.

1256
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But it stands for graphic interface.

1257
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Thank you! GIF. It's GIF. It's one letter short of a GIF.

1258
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It's fucking grammar. Learn to speak your own language.

1259
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Moving on. Next story. God, this shows a hot mess. Oh, it's my turn. I got to do the next story.

1260
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Hot mess.

1261
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Let's talk about Nintendo.

1262
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Of course, I'm over here looking to see who the what lady is.

1263
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Why don't we just call them just GIFs then, because it's just a fucking acronym anyways.

1264
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
It doesn't fucking matter how we pronounce it.

1265
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
No, because then like ABC will come and be like, you know, we had TGIF, so you can't have GIF.

1266
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That's what they used to have.

1267
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Oh my god, they found the what lady.

1268
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Did she die?

1269
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
No, no, there's a picture of her right here.

1270
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's the what lady with her granddaughter.

1271
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Is that really the what lady?

1272
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That's the what lady.

1273
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Can we force that in chat?

1274
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Sure.

1275
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I think this is a...

1276
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's the what lady.

1277
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It is her.

1278
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And if someone made a meme out of that picture that says what lady is not amused.

1279
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Is this from Reddit or something?

1280
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah, Bee found her.

1281
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Of course they did.

1282
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
All right, can we move on?

1283
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Nintendo!

1284
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
It's for breakfast!

1285
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I remember the fruit snacks commercials, but that's only because of Power Fest.

1286
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm disabling everybody's mics.

1287
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Do you know what's funny is that I've got to like leave in 45 minutes.

1288
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
No, I don't.

1289
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
My Nintendo is going to be kicking off next month in 39 countries.

1290
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Let me name them all for you right now, starting off with the United States, Canada.

1291
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I don't know the rest.

1292
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's 39 countries.

1293
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You can't read again apparently.

1294
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's not listed.

1295
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I'm just guessing those are two of the countries.

1296
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Australia?

1297
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I can guess.

1298
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Anyway, Nintendo's first goal for the program is to get at least 100 million people registered.

1299
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
That's a lot of people.

1300
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Isn't that like a tenth of Facebook?

1301
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
How many people are on Facebook?

1302
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
A lot.

1303
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
My Nintendo is going to have a points program, coupons for downloads, emails.

1304
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I bet you can't wait for all those sweet emails you're going to get from my Nintendo.

1305
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I get a lot from the Japanese.

1306
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Can I send emails to other people?

1307
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Can I get Princess Peach to send Shane an email that says,

1308
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
you a bitch, sign Princess Peach.

1309
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I don't think that's going to work.

1310
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Because that I will pay points for.

1311
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I don't want your goddamn emails, Nintendo.

1312
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
All right, digital content and more.

1313
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Platinum points get original goods.

1314
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Gold points get coupons.

1315
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
So there you go.

1316
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Whoo, coupons.

1317
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Hey, you know what?

1318
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Considering Nintendo games never go on sale, although there is an eShop sale,

1319
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
but it's like January, right?

1320
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But it's usually not the games you want.

1321
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah, and it's not the games you want either.

1322
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It's not much of a sale.

1323
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
1% discount.

1324
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
All right, so hey, I'll take it.

1325
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It's something.

1326
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So there is that coming.

1327
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I noticed, though, physical goods kind of went away in that whole thing.

1328
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Not sure what that's all about.

1329
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But anyway, I'll still sign up for it because, I mean,

1330
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
say what you will about Nintendo, but their games are so fucking good,

1331
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'm going to buy them anyway.

1332
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Mario Kart 9, sign me up.

1333
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Zelda Wii U, I'll get that.

1334
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Whatever Mario stars in.

1335
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Mario saves this world.

1336
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I'm down with that too.

1337
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So whatever.

1338
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You're making a face, Shane.

1339
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Why are you making a face?

1340
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I have all these things to say, but not on this show.

1341
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Because it doesn't matter for the show.

1342
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
What kinds of things?

1343
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
There's like breaking Super Sentai news that's freaking me out right now that I love.

1344
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Well, nothing else has been on topic.

1345
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Is the ship real?

1346
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
You want to blurt it out?

1347
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Did Chylee finally get married?

1348
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
No, no, no.

1349
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's Power Rangers.

1350
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
This is Super Sentai.

1351
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Oh.

1352
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So the new one that's coming out.

1353
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
That's the one Spike watches.

1354
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You watch Power Rangers.

1355
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
No, I watch Super Sentai too.

1356
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Oh, okay.

1357
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Only when it's a good season, I think.

1358
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I got it.

1359
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
But the one that's coming out with all the animals and Minecraft looking stuff,

1360
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
they just leaked the sixth ranger.

1361
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And for one thing, he's not named, you know, it's Red Ranger or stuff like that.

1362
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
In this one, it's called Jew-o-ger.

1363
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So it's like Jew-o-shark is the blue one.

1364
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Did you say his name is Jew Shark?

1365
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Jew-o-ger.

1366
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Yes.

1367
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Okay.

1368
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I was going to say, that might be insensitive.

1369
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
But this one's called Jew-o-the-world.

1370
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I don't know why that's just the name of the guy, but he's so cool looking,

1371
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
and I want all his toys now.

1372
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Like all of his toys.

1373
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Jew-o-the-world?

1374
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's Dark Sakura.

1375
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
She just wanted it to be so hard.

1376
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Well, maybe if you hold your microphone up to your eyes,

1377
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
they can hear your eye roll right now because it's pretty much like the loudest thing in this room.

1378
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
He has three different colors.

1379
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
He has three different animals.

1380
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
He has three different helmets.

1381
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I am excited.

1382
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And three new shows coming to VOG next week.

1383
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Does he wear all the three helmets at the same time?

1384
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Yes, he actually does.

1385
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
He just slides different pieces.

1386
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Is it like the manticore ranger?

1387
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
No, it's alligator rhino wolf.

1388
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Man bear pig?

1389
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
They really are under the mask.

1390
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It's another mask.

1391
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It just keeps sliding up like that.

1392
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Back to video games.

1393
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited right now.

1394
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I'll give you this.

1395
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
At least the Super Sentai has the Minecraft-y tie-in.

1396
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I just, because of how excited I am,

1397
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I just went to this import site and put the megazords that they have coming out in my cart to get later.

1398
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
How much money in the past 12 months have you spent on Power Rangers toys?

1399
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I don't know.

1400
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
70,000.

1401
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
You don't even make that much money.

1402
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Come on.

1403
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I don't know.

1404
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh, it's just Power Ranger toys.

1405
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Oh, it's so hot in here.

1406
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Dark Sakura, you want to get to another story?

1407
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I guess.

1408
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well, we have a reunion of sorts with Kojima and Del Toro.

1409
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yay!

1410
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
But they're not doing a game, boo.

1411
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
They're keynote speakers at the Dice Summit.

1412
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:03,000
This is confirmed by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences that they're going to be there this year.

1413
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And that Kojima will be inducted into the Academy's Hall of Fame.

1414
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So they are both there to offer their insight into creative vision and artistic pursuits.

1415
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Can they stealth announce something at Dice? Is it possible? Have they done that before?

1416
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Can we really just hope something gets announced like TP or something?

1417
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
TP? It's the toilet paper ghost.

1418
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
She died in the toilet. No immortal's revenge.

1419
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Well, that thing in the sink looks like it may have came from the toilet, so...

1420
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
TP. It'll scare you shitless.

1421
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
There you go. Tagline right there.

1422
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It did come from someone's neither regions.

1423
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
What if you had a spinoff of that game where you're just taking care of the poor sink baby or something?

1424
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Like a Tamagotchi thing.

1425
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Meanwhile, it talks to you in a radio announcer voice the entire time.

1426
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
A Canadian radio announcer voice?

1427
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Are we disturbed or what?

1428
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
We just missed PT.

1429
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1430
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
We're going to go to the US first. Sorry, we won't be going to Canada, but we'll go to the US first.

1431
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
We actually do have a few things coming out this week.

1432
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Naruto is shipping in Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 coming out on PlayStation 4 and I believe Xbox One.

1433
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And we also have Unravel coming out, also PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1434
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And let's see what else here.

1435
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Arslan, The Warrior's Legend. That's on PlayStation 4 as well.

1436
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Assassin's Creed Chronicles. That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1437
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Also, it looks like Arslan, The Warrior's Legend, also on Xbox One.

1438
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And The Dying Light, the following, coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One as well.

1439
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And...

1440
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That's it.

1441
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Alright, going over to Japan.

1442
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And on the PlayStation 4 on the 12th of February, Senjou no Valkyria remaster.

1443
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Is that Valkyria Chronicles? I think it is.

1444
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I didn't even realize they were remastering that for the PlayStation 4. I think that's what that is.

1445
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And that's really exciting. Yeah, that's it. This is...

1446
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Do you not hear gaming news ever? Because that's been announced for a while.

1447
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Well, you know, I have the PC one, so...

1448
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Anyway, going to the Wii U and this week.

1449
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Nothing. It is still another slow week on the Wii U. You get a lot of those, actually.

1450
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:41,000
On the Vita, however, you have this week Eikoku Tantei Mysteria The Crown in regular and limited edition.

1451
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
That comes out on the 11th.

1452
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And on the 3DS, Eterion... Oops, sorry, that's not this continent.

1453
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Shin Megami Tensei IV The Final comes out in a regular and Famitsu pack this week.

1454
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
So there's that to look forward to.

1455
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
But that's really it in Japan this week.

1456
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
In our chat, Bob Coffee says, yes, it's Valkyria and we are getting it in America also.

1457
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Yes, Shane, in his usual manner, decided to correct me at as soon as possible opportunity.

1458
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah, well, no, I'm just saying, you would have known that there's a PS4 version had you been following the news.

1459
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I didn't say it wasn't coming here. I was just saying, learn to read.

1460
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Whatever. Dark Sakura, how about Europe?

1461
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah, some stuff's coming out.

1462
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,000
On the 9th, we have Arslan the Warriors of Legend for PC.

1463
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia for PC, Xbox One and PS4.

1464
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime for PlayStation 4.

1465
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.

1466
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
The series that will never die.

1467
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,000
On the 10th, we have Gravity Rush Remastered and on the 12th, Eterion Odyssey 2.

1468
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And that's it.

1469
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

1470
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And then the classic game of the week, but first, Loki.

1471
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Alright, so there's been some reports coming out that people are able to play certain games on the Xbox One backwards compatibility that quite haven't been announced yet.

1472
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And some pretty big titles among that as well.

1473
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Red Dead Redemption, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Halo Wars and Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1474
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
To download those games right now, it's a little bit difficult.

1475
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
You actually have to have a digital version of the game.

1476
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And it won't work with a physical disc for it.

1477
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And then basically, you'd have to download it if you have a digital version of the game.

1478
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And you have to specifically go to download that.

1479
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But nothing's been announced so far.

1480
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Maybe we'll get an announcement soon, but Red Dead Redemption is pretty awesome.

1481
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Go play it.

1482
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Awesome game.

1483
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Alright, and lastly, let's talk a little more about Pokemon Go.

1484
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Because I don't know about you guys, I'm really excited about that, to try that.

1485
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And how did Pokemon Go come to be anyway?

1486
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Well, you guys remember a few years ago, there was the April Fool's Day joke where you could actually see the Pokemon on Google Maps.

1487
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Guess what?

1488
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
That was part of the reason why we're getting Pokemon Go.

1489
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:24,000
This was an interview that happened in Famitsu Magazine in Japan with the president of Niantic Japan and Kento Suga, who's the marketing manager of Niantic Japan.

1490
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So in this interview, they actually set us apart of it.

1491
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That Pokemon challenge was a chance for us to be able to build relations with people at Pokemon.

1492
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:40,000
And then, Pokemon president Suenaku Ishihara and John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, were able to meet and talk.

1493
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
At that time, both of their thoughts and visions were also very close.

1494
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
And as a union of their spirit, the talk became, let's do something together in the future.

1495
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And then they talked about, in Google, there's a culture where the staff releases ideas for April Fools, then they make their own teams to realize those.

1496
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,000
But for the Pokemon challenge, it was a staff member named Tatsuo Nojima who pulled out that idea, and he became the center of development.

1497
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So, you never know, if a Google April Fools joke is loved well enough, it just might come true someday.

1498
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
As Pokemon Go is apparently coming true.

1499
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Even though that will be on your smartphones and not Google Maps, but hey, still pretty cool.

1500
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Well, let's go to the classic game of the week and take a step into the vault.

1501
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And find a game where DarkSakura says, hey, you know what, get off your April Fools Day jokes on the interwebs.

1502
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Because this is a game that existed before any of that stuff became games. This is a simpler time.

1503
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
DarkSakura is going to step in the vault and find a game she thinks you guys should be playing this week.

1504
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1505
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I have no idea why I've never done this one before.

1506
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Me neither, to be honest.

1507
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Lunar the Silver Star. It was a role play game that came out by Game Arts and Studio Alex.

1508
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It was released on the Sega CD, or as it was in other countries, the Mega CD.

1509
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And the first publishing was by Game Arts in Japan in 1992.

1510
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And then it was translated and localized for the US by Working Designs.

1511
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And it had that crazy ass rock opening song.

1512
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
The re-release didn't have this, but the soundtrack that came with it had this on it.

1513
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:37,000
So it is one of the greatest RPGs of all time with little argument.

1514
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And I'm saying one up.

1515
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I disagree.

1516
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
One up.

1517
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And of course it's also one of the games that really cemented things for Working Designs.

1518
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
As far as being known for its high quality localization of top rate games.

1519
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So it had a sequel. It was Lunar Eternal Blue that came out in 1994.

1520
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And there have been three enhanced remakes.

1521
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
There's Lunar Silver Star Story Complete, Lunar Legend, and Lunar Silver Star Harmony.

1522
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
So all of those versions have been out.

1523
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So basically, it's a traditional top down role playing game.

1524
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You have the 2D characters and environments.

1525
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
You have the towns, fields, different places.

1526
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And you have NPCs and you do quests and do things.

1527
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
However, because it was on the Sega CD, you actually had short videos.

1528
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
You actually had different really good audio segments.

1529
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Really great music on top of it too.

1530
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And you saved your game to the Sega CD's internal RAM.

1531
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Or you could use the RAM cartridge that came with it that you could choose.

1532
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
So that's pretty good.

1533
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It was definitely one of those games that made having the RAM cartridge worthwhile.

1534
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Because those lithium batteries, they kind of went after a bit.

1535
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So anyway, you also have turn based combat based on which has the higher speed rating.

1536
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And then you give them commands.

1537
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I mean it's RPG stuff.

1538
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:24,000
But the thing that's about this that was pretty cool is that the characters were designed by a manga artist, Toshiki Kabuka.

1539
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And it was really, I think, the stuff that, in fact I'm pulling up the list of some of the other things he's done.

1540
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Because looking at the art style, you can probably tell he did, as far as anime, he did Nadia, The Secret of Blue Water, Giant Robo, Time Jam, Berserk, The Golden Age Arc.

1541
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
For other games he did, he did The Idolmaster.

1542
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Of course, Albert Odyssey.

1543
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
So that's all stuff that sounds familiar, right?

1544
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So, um, but moving on, you know you had all of your characters, they're all classic.

1545
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
But this was the other thing that was really neat about this.

1546
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Is that the plot, well most of the plot, was written by a novelist named Kei Shigema.

1547
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Who did, um, it was meant to have a different story for high fantasy.

1548
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Something a little bit more unique.

1549
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And it was such a really rich story, you know, you can really see a lot of the amazing writing that went into it.

1550
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And the whole point was that they wanted a role playing game that would focus on having good animation and really good storytelling.

1551
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:51,000
So, um, they didn't want it to be just a hack and slash, they wanted it to have something immersive.

1552
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But also, um, really just be something that would keep the characters going on this.

1553
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And of course, the Lunar English version was done by Working Designs.

1554
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Um, and it was at the time their biggest project.

1555
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,000
The whole thing was headed by Victor Ireland, which for the record, we own his Twilight Zone.

1556
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Um, we actually bought one of our pinball tables for him.

1557
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Um, but yeah, it was just pretty epic. Pretty, pretty epic.

1558
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,000
The English script was one of the biggest ones that, you know, had been provided for games at the time.

1559
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Um, the music was pretty amazing. Of course, it was CDDA on the desk.

1560
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And, um, there was a soundtrack that was released in 1992 that came out two months before the game did.

1561
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Which was, of course, all the Japanese versions and karaoke arrangements.

1562
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Um, and then with the Lunar Silver Star story complete, it came with that soundtrack.

1563
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
So, um, it's pretty, pretty amazing.

1564
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Yeah, the game itself in Japan sold 100,000 copies in its entire production run.

1565
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Which was, uh, pretty, pretty good.

1566
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And then the US version, it sold about as well and got pretty excellent ratings across the board.

1567
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,000
So, um, of course, it spawned a sequel which gave us Lunar Eternal Blue.

1568
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And then there were follow-ups. Like, there was Lunar Walking School and Lunar Dragon Song that were prequels to the game.

1569
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:42,000
So, of course, we also had the remakes Lunar Silver Star story complete, uh, Lunar Legend and Lunar Silver Star Harmony.

1570
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
So, there you go.

1571
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
There it is. I'm listening to a little harmony right now.

1572
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Lunar the Silver Star.

1573
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
There it is. Your classic game of the week, Lunar the Silver Star.

1574
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Which, I admit, I just never played it. Never got around to playing it.

1575
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Sorry. I can't play all the games.

1576
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I might loan you a Sega CD. We've got a couple.

1577
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Yay, that'll be fine. Do you have six of those, too?

1578
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
No. No, I do not. So, you'll have to just, I guess, live in the vault for a weekend.

1579
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I'm moving in. I'm moving in.

1580
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Alright, uh, we're gonna move on to the second half of our show.

1581
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
My understanding is that the little game that's on TV is now over.

1582
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
So, we might have some more people start showing up live, which is great.

1583
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Apparently, some donkeys won.

1584
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Apparently, a bunch of asses won.

1585
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
But, anyway, you can-

1586
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Although, I will say, just because I think it's his retiring year, is Peyton Manning.

1587
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It was, like, his last game.

1588
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Who?

1589
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Big sportsball guy.

1590
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Oh, okay.

1591
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I know of him just because I know people who have followed-

1592
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
You heard stories.

1593
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
His career.

1594
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
There's folklore.

1595
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I'd say winning a Super Bowl right before you retire is pretty remarkable.

1596
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Oh, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that, but mine will be in Tecmo Bowl.

1597
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Yeah.

1598
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Alright.

1599
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Uh, you can give us a call. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1600
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, the old-fashioned way.

1601
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Uh, we're gonna take some calls when we come back, but we also have more news to get to.

1602
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Rapid Fire News, Fugu Question of the Week, your emails.

1603
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
There is plenty more show to come, so don't go anywhere.

1604
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
We'll be right back, right after this, with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1605
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And yes, maybe some more wine, too. Oh, God.

1606
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode 630 of our show, already in progress.

1607
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And, uh, having a good time here tonight with our pal, Shane Alinko, joining us in studio.

1608
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And, uh, of course, the, uh, regular cast all assembled tonight.

1609
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
We're all here, and plus one, we're having a good time.

1610
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And, uh, I may have been having a little bit to drink with Shane Alinko.

1611
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
For some reason, it's hitting me harder.

1612
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
But probably because I see that Shane still has a full second glass.

1613
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I've already drank two glasses.

1614
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Well, I had an emergency, so I couldn't drink so much of it right now.

1615
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Okay.

1616
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
My emergency has to do with pre-ordering toys.

1617
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Very important. Sorry, I forgot. I forgot.

1618
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Toys takes precedence on that whole thing.

1619
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Alright, uh, let's get into some rapid-fire news.

1620
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And then now we'll get to the FUGL Question of the Week over on Facebook and Google.

1621
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Uh, Loki.

1622
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So this is sort of back in August, where you can vote on which game you want to be included in the PlayStation Plus lineup as one of the free games.

1623
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And now they're doing it again.

1624
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,000
So you can vote for three different games to be free among PlayStation Plus for March.

1625
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Um, the ones that don't get picked get put on sale.

1626
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
So that's pretty nice.

1627
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And actually, the choices aren't too bad either.

1628
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So we've got to choose from, um, Action Henk, which is a racing game.

1629
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And then we have Assault Android Cactus, which is a twin-six shooter.

1630
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And of course, Broforce, which is just like an all-out side-scroller shooter that's pretty awesome.

1631
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So, um, I know at least two of the three of those I want to get.

1632
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Um, I will say that, uh, Extifer is a big fan of the Assault Android Cactus.

1633
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
He'll probably cut somebody that he knows if they don't vote for that one.

1634
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Exactly.

1635
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So I have to vote for that one.

1636
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,000
In full disclosure, I think I have a guy on Twitter who either worked on that game or has a relative who made it or something.

1637
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
So, um, but I have checked out.

1638
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I played that game at last E3. They had it.

1639
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So it's been a while.

1640
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
It's another Unity game.

1641
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Yeah, so, um, I hope that one wins, personally.

1642
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I would vote for either Broforce or Assault Android Cactus.

1643
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I kind of think Broforce has it.

1644
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Broforce is pretty awesome.

1645
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
But either one. Whatever one doesn't win, I'll end up buying the other one.

1646
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So that's both winning in my book, I guess.

1647
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Speaking of winning, one game that I was super hyped about and for some damn reason still haven't played in a very long time.

1648
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I do need to fix that maybe this week.

1649
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 has sold 60 million copies.

1650
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
That's ridiculous, the amount of copies that they've sold.

1651
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Um, apparently that's down a little bit, though.

1652
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It's exceeded expectations, but the revenue has dropped a little bit.

1653
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
22% in the last quarter.

1654
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
So, basically, 414.2 million.

1655
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And then, of course, they're confirming that Mafia 3 is going to be coming out in 2016.

1656
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And, of course, that Battleborn will be launching May 3rd.

1657
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So, that's all coming from Take-Two's report earnings meeting that they've got.

1658
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Um, I would love some DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5.

1659
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
That would definitely get me back into playing that game.

1660
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Please.

1661
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And then, finally, Titanfall 2 is going to have a single player campaign, which probably means I'm going to have to buy it.

1662
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Because that's one of the reasons I didn't buy the first one.

1663
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
But that game was pretty awesome, even though it did melt my last laptop.

1664
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
But that's just how awesome it is, because it melted my laptop.

1665
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And then, on top of that, they're also going to be getting some sort of TV spinoff to that as well.

1666
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So, that looks pretty exciting.

1667
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,000
If it's anything like the little live action trailer commercial thing that they did, I'd be down to watch that.

1668
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And, um, yeah.

1669
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So, no set date yet when we can expect it.

1670
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Hopefully in some time...

1671
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Oh, no, it looks like March 2017.

1672
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Sometime before that.

1673
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So, before the end of the next fiscal year.

1674
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Hopefully holiday.

1675
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But maybe not.

1676
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I'm sure that'll be a holiday release for sure.

1677
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And it's tough, because, you know, they're going to have Battlefield, probably.

1678
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
So, Titanfall, it's kind of weird.

1679
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
It's... not sure where that would fall in.

1680
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Unless they want to directly compete with Call of Duty.

1681
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
One will be September, and the other November.

1682
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I think they could do it, since Call of Duty had to totally crib a bunch of stuff from Titanfall anyways.

1683
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Alright, let's talk a little bit about Guitar Hero.

1684
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And one of the most epic songs that was ever in Guitar Hero is coming back for Guitar Hero Live.

1685
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And that is Dragon Forces Through the Fire and the Flames.

1686
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I think all of us music game people remember playing that song for the first time in Guitar Hero.

1687
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
No, because I didn't play Guitar Hero.

1688
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Really? That song was awesome, though.

1689
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
It is an awesome song, but yes, I'm with you on that. I never played that song.

1690
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Ugh, you guys.

1691
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Alright, well anyway, it is coming back to Guitar Hero.

1692
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And it's going to be part of a five-track celebration event for the Guitar Hero TV.

1693
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Because, you know, it's different than Rock Band.

1694
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
You don't just download songs, you have this whole kind of, like, live TV element.

1695
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
So, Through the Fire and the Flames from Dragon Force is going to be part of this.

1696
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But then, after this event is over, where some other hard songs will be featured as well.

1697
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
They're going to put it into the normal rotation on Guitar Hero TV.

1698
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
But it should be noted that, you know, now the Guitar Heroes are different guitars.

1699
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So, they have to basically go back and redo all the key patterns.

1700
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Because now you have the whole, like, three up and three down.

1701
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
It's a little different now than it used to be.

1702
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So, I don't own Guitar Hero yet, but I did think it was pretty cool, the little snippet I've played.

1703
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
So, I really need to get on buying that.

1704
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I would like to get it, too, just to support the developers, because it's a DJ Hero developers.

1705
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
So, I love them. They're so good.

1706
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I feel like the public shits on them constantly, too.

1707
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Because DJ Hero deserved to do way better than it did.

1708
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
DJ Hero is goddamn amazing.

1709
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Yeah. I'll support that.

1710
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Like, immediately it will pre-order DJ Hero 2. Or 3, the amount.

1711
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
The next DJ Hero game.

1712
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
If they ever do another one.

1713
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Whenever, you know, that happens. If ever.

1714
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
You know, I'd be totally down for that.

1715
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Well, a new trailer was released for Mirror's Edge Catalyst this week.

1716
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
It's a little story trailer for the game.

1717
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:53,000
But it also, in addition to EA saying they will talk a little more about Faith's story and the world and so forth.

1718
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
They are saying that a closed beta is going to be coming.

1719
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And it will be available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and of course, via Origin on PC.

1720
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:08,000
The dates are not announced yet, but they do say you will need an EA Origin account in order to participate.

1721
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And I imagine this is true on console as well, because...

1722
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Yeah, you have to sign in on games like we did for Mass Effect.

1723
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And Dragon Age.

1724
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Dragon Age, yeah.

1725
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Inquisition, anyway.

1726
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And again, Origin, not bad anymore. It's a good service.

1727
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Mirror's Edge Catalyst, by the way, this is not something you're waiting for the holidays for.

1728
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
It is supposed to come out on May 24th.

1729
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
So, this is a little...

1730
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
The day after my birthday.

1731
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So, if you thought, well, what a great...

1732
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
No, I don't care about Mirror's Edge. I want Power Rangers stuff.

1733
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So, don't pay attention to Mirror's Edge at that time.

1734
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
All right, well, what about Dark Souls 3? Do you care about that?

1735
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Nope.

1736
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
All right, then plug your ears.

1737
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Because our next little snippet here is about Dark Souls 3.

1738
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
And apparently there was a livestream that From Software did recently about this.

1739
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
But for some reason, the stream was private.

1740
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
So, people didn't even really know it was going.

1741
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So, I don't know if that was intentional, like maybe it was like a media only.

1742
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
But it didn't seem to have that type of vibe to it.

1743
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Well, of course, you put something on the internet, it's never gonna go away.

1744
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So, there was a YouTuber out there who was able to make an archive

1745
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
of several minutes of the gameplay from Dark Souls 3.

1746
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And I gotta say, it looks really good.

1747
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Although, I really tried with Bloodborne, you guys.

1748
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I tried and it's just...

1749
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
It's too much. I can't.

1750
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So, we'll see. I don't know.

1751
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Maybe Dark Souls 3 will do something different to the formula, like make it a little easier.

1752
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Something I feel like I actually progress in.

1753
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I don't know. I guess I'm that wimp.

1754
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
That ruined all video games.

1755
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Because they're too hard.

1756
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1757
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Well, for fans of Pokemon, you can get the original Pokemon Red and Blue music on vinyl.

1758
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:59,000
There's a record album that is being published with 500 copies.

1759
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And it looks like everyone signed up, but you can register to let them know you're interested to see if they'll print more.

1760
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But it's about 50 bucks.

1761
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I don't really understand the whole...

1762
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
As a collectible thing, I think that's cool.

1763
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:19,000
But I don't understand releasing records with things anymore.

1764
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
That's cool. I like Pokemon.

1765
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It's got a nice cover.

1766
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Yeah, that's awesome. But are you gonna listen to it?

1767
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
That's not probably what it's for.

1768
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I guess. But with Super Beat Zonic, the collector's edition came with two records.

1769
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I'm like, cool. Won't be able to do anything with those now.

1770
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
But thank you for the records.

1771
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Well, you can get digital albums.

1772
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Sorry, digital record players.

1773
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Oh, I think I've seen those at Fry's.

1774
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yeah.

1775
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I just even have those at Hot Topic sometimes.

1776
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Really?

1777
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
No, seriously. I've seen USB record players there.

1778
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
That's hilarious.

1779
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Interesting.

1780
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Well, my eyes were just open to something I had no idea about.

1781
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I'm assuming that's all for mixing, though.

1782
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I think the USB ones were mainly for ripping vinyl to digital formats, I guess.

1783
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That makes sense. Fair enough.

1784
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Also, there is going to be a new arcade game coming out that will be between Nintendo and Capcom.

1785
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,000
That will be Mario Party Arcade so you can have your hissy fit in front of everybody.

1786
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
You can actually punch a kid in the face at the arcade.

1787
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I don't know if that would work well as an arcade game.

1788
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
You'd have to kind of go around to punch them, though.

1789
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It looks awesome. Just the setup looks really nice.

1790
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I would rather play Animal Crossing, Amiibo Festival, than Mario Party any day.

1791
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Oh, those are strong words.

1792
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Those are very strong words.

1793
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I think if you want a good arcade game experience, Smash Bros. arcade would be perfect and throw more Capcom characters in there.

1794
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Nintendo needs to sell more Wii's.

1795
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Wii U's. They don't need to sell Wii U's.

1796
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Wii U's.

1797
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And then last, and definitely the least awesome news ever, is that Warner Bros. actually cancelled the Mac and Linux ports of Batman Arkham Knight.

1798
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Is that awful news, though? Because look what happened to the PC one.

1799
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
It wasn't crap.

1800
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I mean, maybe they're just sparing the rest of us from, you know...

1801
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I think it was a mercy killing.

1802
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I guess so. I mean, dear people on Unix-based systems, we will not subject you to this terror.

1803
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,000
You mean we have to actually go through the even worse terror of playing it in boot camp?

1804
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Well, there's VMware. Ugh! And that's what every Mac user and Linux user said ever.

1805
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Well, thank you for that perspective.

1806
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Unfortunately, they just figured how many people game on Mac and Linux, and they're just like, eh, it's not worth it.

1807
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Which is actually a pretty big number of people.

1808
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Not worth it? You mean by putting it out, then pulling it, and then re-releasing it again?

1809
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Yes, in that sense, because they're gonna half-ass put it out, and it's still gonna be all fucked up, and they're like, eh, fuck it.

1810
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:16,000
You guys are funny. Alright, let's move on and get to the FUGL question of the week.

1811
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the show.

1812
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Or we'll read them all, as I think I'm gonna... I'm feeling nice, I'm gonna do that tonight.

1813
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,000
And this week, we decided to ask in honor of Superb Owl Sunday, we're gonna talk a little bit about...

1814
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Well, because most people right now, they're not talking about the game anymore.

1815
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
They're talking about that halftime show, for better or for worse, with Coldplay, Beyonce, Bruno Mars, right?

1816
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,000
So that had us thinking about breaks, because every year when the Superb Owl comes up, we ask a sports game thing.

1817
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
That sounds like you're saying Super Bowl.

1818
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Super Bowl, I kinda like that though, the Super Bowl.

1819
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:03,000
But you know, that's what people say to get around the trademark on Super Bowl, and that the NFL will come after you.

1820
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I had no idea.

1821
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah, you can't, like if you're a pizza place, you can't have like a Super Bowl discount thing.

1822
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
That's why everybody does the big game, or...

1823
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Oh.

1824
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Yeah. Anyway.

1825
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Let's talk about breaks.

1826
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So we wanted to know, do you regularly take breaks when gaming, or have you ever binged to the point where you ever thought, maybe this is dangerous.

1827
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
So taking a break from the game, as they do in sports, we need to do it with video games as well.

1828
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You know, it is recommended, what, for every two hours of games, you take a fifteen minute break, something like that?

1829
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So, let's get to some answers over on Facebook.

1830
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Jose Osumuwagawa says, I usually have to, because I'm a smoker, and there's no smoking in the apartment I live in.

1831
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Well, that's, I guess, a way to force yourself to take a break, I guess.

1832
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Fabrice A says, I once played Sega Rally for twenty-four hours straight.

1833
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Other than that, I do take regular breaks, if only to rest my eyes.

1834
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Whenever I feel I'm going in the red, I just stop altogether.

1835
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:07,000
William Murderface says, I've played for eight to twelve hours straight a few times, like Final Fantasy 14 around Reborn.

1836
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But my eyes usually start bugging me after a few hours, and I have to get up and take a walk.

1837
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Generally speaking, I try to get up once an hour and take at least a five minute break.

1838
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Retertainment says, I rarely do anything straight, though.

1839
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:28,000
At the very least, I like to get myself another bottle of Heineken about every hour or so while I'm playing Fallout.

1840
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Degenerate Johnny says, my gaming sessions end when either I empty the bottle of wine I started with, or when I pass out, whichever comes first.

1841
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Winston H says, usually I don't do too many binges of gaming, but when I do, I would take a break to either go to the washroom,

1842
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
eat, or drink something in two to three hours.

1843
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Andy R says, I don't actively seek to take breaks, but usually the bathroom snack breaks do serve some of that role.

1844
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I don't think I've ever made it to the dangerous point.

1845
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Dark Tetsuya says, depends on the game, of course.

1846
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Obviously, I've got to mention the DDR games.

1847
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Now, taking breaks is pretty much mandatory, as with any workout, you don't want to over-exert yourself, or you'll be in serious trouble.

1848
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Though, usually my breaks come when I've hit a wall in a particular RPG or something, and I don't know what to do or how to beat a particular enemy.

1849
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
It's nice to walk away and come back refreshed.

1850
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Fifth Dream says, I don't specifically take time out for breaks when I game,

1851
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
but I am such an unintentional multitasker that the amount of time I get up for a drink or something to eat, check email or instant messages,

1852
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
or generally get distracted by something else, probably adds up to way more than 15 minutes per hour anyway.

1853
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
But the day I got Skies of Arcadia on Dreamcast, I played it 15 hours straight,

1854
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
and I probably ate once and took a couple of bathroom breaks.

1855
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
That was a great day.

1856
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Chad B says, I have some problems with one of my legs, so I generally can't sit comfortably for a long period of time anyway,

1857
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,000
but instead of a 15 minute break every few hours, it's more like a few minutes of getting up two to three times per hour.

1858
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,000
As a kid, however, I never had an issue playing games for hours on end.

1859
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And just, I think, one or two more on Google+, just one on Google+.

1860
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Act Def says, the longest I played a game was Super Smash Brothers Melee.

1861
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
My brother, my nephews, and some friends played for like 12 hours straight.

1862
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
We unlocked all the characters and stuff.

1863
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
After that, the GameCube got busted and had to be replaced.

1864
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Good thing it still had warranty. Not too tiring though.

1865
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
My second longest was playing the endless set list on Rock Band 2 on Expert.

1866
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Now that was tiring as hell.

1867
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Those are some good answers. What about you guys?

1868
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Do you take breaks when you game?

1869
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And has there maybe been a point in the past where maybe you did a little too much binging on a game?

1870
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Dark Sakura?

1871
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I take a break when I gotta pee.

1872
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And your watch pokes you and tells you to get up, doesn't it?

1873
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yeah, now it does. I mean, if it hits like the 50 minute mark and I haven't stood up,

1874
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
then I get that little tap on the wrist. It's time to stand up.

1875
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Shut up, watch. Don't tell me how to live my life.

1876
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Actually, I do say that at my desk and Shane can attest to that, I'm sure.

1877
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Don't tell me what to do.

1878
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I play, you know, I pass out asleep.

1879
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I remember though when Final Fantasy III on Super Nintendo, Rob, came out.

1880
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I had the quote flew, quote, for a week until I beat it.

1881
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,000
So I didn't go to school. I just stayed home and played Final Fantasy the entire time.

1882
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I've heard you tell that story before, the binge on Final Fantasy that you had.

1883
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I had to re-rent it at the time. I didn't own the copy.

1884
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Nice.

1885
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I was gonna say I completed Grand Theft Auto 4 100% to try to get the keys of the city

1886
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
when I first came out and then required me staying up very late at night for a few days.

1887
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
My friend and I, when I was younger, we stayed up all night beating.

1888
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
We did it once with Super Mario 3 without warping and we did it again with Star Tropics.

1889
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
We played Star Tropics like almost all in one sitting.

1890
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,000
But as far as, again, I can't do those types of binge sessions.

1891
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Maybe I'm just old or whatever and I gotta pee a lot or I gotta eat.

1892
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I think the fact that I really like food makes me stop and get up and be like,

1893
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
ooh, I'm gonna raid the fridge. I want a cookie.

1894
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So that helps with those breaks.

1895
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Shane?

1896
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I'm sure I did it for various MMOs but the one game I remember not getting up until I beat it

1897
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
was Portal 2 when that came out.

1898
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Oh yeah.

1899
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Got that on PS3 and at the time I would play in the living room and I'd just lay down on the floor

1900
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
and look up at the TV and I just kept playing until it was done because it was so good.

1901
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And at least that's something you can kind of feasibly, it's like what, a five hour game?

1902
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
That's like watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

1903
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I did the same with, oh god, Bioshock Infinite too.

1904
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Oh wow.

1905
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And Heavy Rain. I did not stop playing Heavy Rain until I finished it.

1906
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Alright, there you go.

1907
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Some of our answers there over at our Facebook and our Google Plus pages.

1908
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And let's see, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1909
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf with a great answer here.

1910
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Civilization always makes me play for a binge which is why I never play it often

1911
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
because I never have binge time anymore.

1912
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Oh god, that's so true.

1913
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I remember playing online matches in Civ Net which was the online Civ one

1914
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
that would go like all fucking night.

1915
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And I think we did this with Civ 4 once too.

1916
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Like the Civilization is some serious like, yeah, there's just one more turn.

1917
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
There would be the hours of me playing Dr. Mario.

1918
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
No, seriously.

1919
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I could play Dr. Mario from level one to whatever level.

1920
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Those puzzle games were especially something, especially when they were first coming out

1921
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
because Dr. Mario was kind of like in a way was the follow up to Tetris and that whole craze.

1922
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Except Dr. Mario to me was much easier than Tetris.

1923
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Yeah.

1924
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Because I mean I don't know what it was but my, I guess my reaction time was a lot faster on Dr. Mario than it was with Tetris.

1925
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Sure, but you've heard those stories of people that would play Tetris that usually don't play games.

1926
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Like back in that day, right?

1927
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Like, oh my gosh, the mom who doesn't play games, I'm being extremely stereotypical of what we saw on the news back then,

1928
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
is binge playing Tetris and can't put the Game Boy Advance down.

1929
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Do you know the first place I ever learned about Pokemon, by the way, on a tangent,

1930
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:36,000
was from a bunch of like mother types at work who got this game for their kids and they couldn't stop playing it.

1931
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I just thought, just kind of like a funny aside, that like one of them would talk about Pokemon like non-stop

1932
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
and she was playing it on her breaks. She had her Game Boy at work and I kind of thought it was cool.

1933
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And that, you know, it wasn't really until the anime when I got into it but it was interesting.

1934
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I would only play Pokemon at the gym.

1935
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Alright. Anyhow, let's see, let's get on to some more gaming news. Loki!

1936
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
So this is kind of disappointing because I actually follow this guy on YouTube a bit.

1937
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:12,000
So Eric, I'm going to try to not butcher his last name, Tarasinski.

1938
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:19,000
He goes by Etitski, I guess, on YouTube.

1939
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
He did like a bunch of Unity tutorials and that type of thing.

1940
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
One of the things he was working on was actually a game called Ant Simulator.

1941
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:32,000
And I believe it had been Kickstarted and he's been working on it for a while now.

1942
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Apparently he just put up a YouTube video saying that the game has been cancelled.

1943
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And this is because, as he puts it, that his two business partners that he was with have spent the money that was from the backers

1944
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:52,000
to fund the game and they spent it on bar tabs and hookers.

1945
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Hookers? Oh for real?

1946
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Or not hookers, but strippers and food and that type of stuff.

1947
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:11,000
And so because of this, he's trying to find a way to refund everybody and basically just trying to salvage everything.

1948
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It wasn't too much that he had raised, it was $4,459 from 149 backers.

1949
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And apparently of that, it's been spent now.

1950
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Although, his two business partners also came out to defend themselves and basically saying that,

1951
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:41,000
no, we didn't spend this on unnecessary things, that this was all approved business transactions,

1952
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:48,000
and that actually the developer was separating from the company and actually took control of the funds

1953
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
and has moved those all into a personal account type of thing.

1954
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So a lot of drama, but it kind of sucks to see this guy's hard work.

1955
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Basically he's not allowed to release the game now without these guys and he doesn't have the money to release it

1956
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,000
because they've used it all. And if he tries to release it without them, they will sue him.

1957
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
So yeah, that kind of sucks.

1958
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
What a mess.

1959
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
But whenever I think of Ant Simulator, I think of SimAnt. That game was so awesome.

1960
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Yeah, and the game does look pretty awesome.

1961
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I mean, I've seen videos on his channel for a while now regarding that,

1962
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
and I didn't realize he'd actually had a Kickstarter for it.

1963
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I thought it was just kind of like a little project he was working on.

1964
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:37,000
But it looked pretty cool, and fortunately now there's not really much he can do with it.

1965
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:45,000
All right. Well, moving on to, I guess, a bit of an OLR dream game-esque sort of thing,

1966
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
perhaps being realized a little bit. I don't know.

1967
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
But you know we've talked about, and it's been a little bit of a long-running joke here on OLR,

1968
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
that they really should make a video game out of Battle Royale.

1969
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
That's not what's happening. I'm not trying to get your hopes up,

1970
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
and it's not that they're making one out of Hunger Games either,

1971
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
but the whole concept of the fact that 16 people enter one survives.

1972
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Now, to be fair, I believe H1Z1, there's a mode like this in that game,

1973
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
but there's not really been a game where, at least that I can think of,

1974
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,000
where that's really kind of been the focus is that sort of storytelling

1975
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
that you see in a survivor-esque type of narrative.

1976
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Anyhow, there is a new game, though, that has come out on Steam Early Access,

1977
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
or I'm sorry, will be on Steam Early Access early next month called The Culling,

1978
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
and you're going to be participating as one of 16 contestants,

1979
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and you have 20 minutes to explore the surrounding, craft weapons,

1980
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:43,000
and kill the other players. You can scavenge various items, build traps,

1981
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
and that will allow you to kill the other contestants

1982
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,000
and win the right to live before the next round of play begins.

1983
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
The Culling is going to be a standalone experience with 16-player Battle Royale modes.

1984
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
March 8th is when the game comes out on Steam Early Access.

1985
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Oh, I'm sure there's other games like this that kind of already exist,

1986
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
but I don't know. When I heard about this, I was like,

1987
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
oh, remember when we had the Battle Royale live on OLR

1988
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
and somebody got cut with a paper plate or something? I don't remember.

1989
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I was the victor of that one. That was great.

1990
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Russ sort of reminds me of DayZ.

1991
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
It's more of where you just get plopped down into the middle of everything

1992
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
and you have to survive against other players.

1993
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:28,000
This almost sounds like the Hunger Game mods that they do for Minecraft and stuff

1994
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
where you basically have a certain set time limit and you have to survive and that type of thing.

1995
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
But hey, whatever. That's cool. All those concepts are fun.

1996
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Dart Tetsuya says, in the description, they do specifically say Battle Royale multiple times,

1997
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
so it was probably a heavy influence.

1998
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
And obviously, for obvious reasons, they can't exactly release their game as Battle Royale,

1999
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
but it probably is where most of their inspiration comes from.

2000
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Very cool. I'll have to see if that game looks like something I could actually play

2001
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
or if it's going to be yet another first-person shooter I'm going to be awful at.

2002
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

2003
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Well, you know, I love my Neo Geo Pocket color, and this makes me think of it.

2004
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,000
It's another early access game called Pocket Rumble,

2005
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
and basically it looks like old Neo Geo Pocket fighting games,

2006
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
like Gals Fighters and the KOF games.

2007
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I think I have both of the Last Blade games, so it's pretty fun.

2008
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
This looks very interesting. I watched the trailer for it,

2009
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
and right now I think they've only got two characters right now,

2010
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
and they're supposed to be releasing more characters as it goes out,

2011
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:47,000
but it's $9.99, and there is a preview of the upcoming games on their Kickstarter page,

2012
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
and I'm going to have to go pick this up when I get home.

2013
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Yeah, when I heard about that, I definitely thought of you,

2014
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
because you have a lot of love for those pocket fighting games.

2015
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
That's pretty cool somebody's making a tribute.

2016
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I love the Last Blade ones. Those were always fun.

2017
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Yeah. All right, just a couple more stories, and then we'll get to tonight's mailbag,

2018
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
which DarkSakura may be able to attend to tonight, it looks like.

2019
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
She won't have to leave studio before then.

2020
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Logie.

2021
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
So Cartoon Network is kind of expanding beyond just cartoons.

2022
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
They're actually going to get into the...

2023
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
They've been sort of working on different video games and stuff,

2024
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
but they're actually creating their own video games now,

2025
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
aside from just kind of doing licensed stuff.

2026
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:31,000
So one of the first original games that they're putting out is called OK KO, Lakewood Plaza Turbo,

2027
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
and it's, I guess, some brand new game.

2028
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
It looks pretty cool. It's kind of a brawler game that's basically an anime world.

2029
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:46,000
So their quote from Chief Content Officer Rob Scorcher, or Sorcher,

2030
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
is, we're no longer just about creating TV series.

2031
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
We're really about creating animated worlds,

2032
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,000
and we really want the ability to unfold those worlds into any platform,

2033
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:06,000
and ultimately all platforms, including TV and mobile, console, that type of thing.

2034
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:11,000
It looks interesting. I mean, I like the style of it.

2035
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
All right. Sorry, I got distracted for a minute there.

2036
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
For our live listeners, it looks like we had a little hiccup in studio,

2037
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
so we may have lost audio. I got kicked from IRC. I don't know if you guys did.

2038
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I was still on, but I got the ops are warning.

2039
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Oh, so something weird happened there, so unfortunately...

2040
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
IP conflict?

2041
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Yeah, I think what happened is we all reconnected,

2042
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
and now it thinks there's too many of us on the net or something, so hopefully...

2043
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I didn't get any kind of disconnect notice.

2044
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I'm actually showing that our live stream just dropped again, and it's trying to reconnect.

2045
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
So it looks like we are having some internet issues.

2046
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
So for the sake of the show, I am going to keep rolling tape.

2047
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
The show must go on.

2048
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Let me try to get to the next story here.

2049
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I'm just going to hope that the stream reconnects for our live folks,

2050
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
but in the interest of the recording, I'm going to keep moving.

2051
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Hopefully it was just a little hiccup.

2052
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Hopefully everybody can kind of curb their internet activity here in the...

2053
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I'm not using the internet.

2054
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I know you're not.

2055
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I was just looking at pictures of cows.

2056
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I'm playing Final Fantasy Explorer.

2057
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I'm not sure that Alan is not running any torrents or anything like that.

2058
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I don't know.

2059
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Anyhow...

2060
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
That's not what you say on the air, Rab.

2061
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Sorry.

2062
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
All right, moving on.

2063
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Let's talk about Star Wars The Force Awakens.

2064
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,000
There is going to be a Lego game coming out for Star Wars The Force Awakens,

2065
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
and there was a teaser that happened with the Lego folks that came out earlier this week,

2066
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
and it said that, yeah, they're going to be coming together,

2067
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
which makes sense because there's already Lego Star Wars games.

2068
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
So we kind of knew a Star Wars Force Awakens was kind of a given,

2069
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,000
but it had actually been leaked previously due to an Xbox Store product page

2070
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
that actually came out a little earlier than it was supposed to.

2071
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
So, yep.

2072
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens will have new gameplay mechanics,

2073
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
building, battling, and flying through the galaxy.

2074
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Interesting that they are making a whole separate game for this

2075
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
and not just adding it into Lego Dimensions,

2076
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
but at the same time, it's not like they don't make stand-alone Lego games still.

2077
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Well, yeah, Dimensions, I don't think they would do that because it's a...

2078
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:18,000
But I would think that, you know, I'm surprised that they're putting it out now

2079
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
because with the original trilogy and everything,

2080
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
they had kind of like three games in one or three movies.

2081
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I just hope that there's enough content in The Force Awakens to make a game out of,

2082
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
which I don't know if it might be.

2083
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
The trailer was super adorable.

2084
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Like, even I kind of want to play it just by watching that trailer.

2085
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I'll have to check it out whenever, you know, we actually have a game.

2086
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Maybe that's a holiday release, I imagine.

2087
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
June, actually.

2088
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Oh, wow.

2089
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Oh, maybe timed for the release of, like, the Blu-ray.

2090
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Maybe. I don't know.

2091
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I don't remember when the Blu-ray's coming out, but, yeah,

2092
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
June is when it's supposed to be coming out.

2093
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Cool.

2094
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
All right, let's get into the mailbag.

2095
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

2096
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2097
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and find some emails

2098
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
that she thinks, hey, these are worthy of reading on the show.

2099
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Although I believe there's only one email one night, right?

2100
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Unless the late one's here.

2101
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
It's a big one.

2102
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
One email.

2103
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
One. One email.

2104
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
One email.

2105
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Ah, ah, ah.

2106
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
DarkSakura.

2107
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
This comes from...

2108
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
He put his full name on there.

2109
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I'm just going to say Andrew.

2110
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Very interesting discussion last week about how Shane hates E3,

2111
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
and I thought I would chime in since I went in 2015.

2112
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I don't think Shane's the only one that...

2113
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Yeah.

2114
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Hate's a strong word.

2115
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
But, anyway, go ahead.

2116
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I get a lot of the complaints Shane and Sky had.

2117
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Activision was still a lot of closed-door stuff,

2118
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
though I recall Skylanders being playable on the floor

2119
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
with a several-hour wait because they were giving out

2120
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
an exclusive Skylander.

2121
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Konami's presence was a huge boost just for two screens,

2122
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
one Metal Gear Solid and the other for...

2123
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
PES?

2124
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Pro Evolution Soccer.

2125
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Okay.

2126
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Game I don't care about.

2127
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
And nothing playable on the floor.

2128
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Plus several games I saw were just demoed to me

2129
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
in a theater setting as Sky complained about.

2130
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
For example, I saw Dark Souls 3 but didn't even end up

2131
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
writing an article about it because by the time

2132
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I would have done so, most of what I had seen

2133
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
was already online.

2134
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
However, there was also a huge indie presence.

2135
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Last year was my first year, so I didn't know how it compares,

2136
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
but both Sony and Microsoft were lined with demo stations

2137
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
for all the indies they'd been courting,

2138
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
and many of the devs were on hand to talk to people

2139
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
playing their game.

2140
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
It was easy to simply walk up and start playing

2141
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Rocket League or Cuphead.

2142
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Oh, man, I want to play Cuphead.

2143
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Oh, yeah.

2144
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I watched the little gameplay trailer of that recently.

2145
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
They were showing that.

2146
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
That looks fantastic.

2147
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And several times I had the developer come

2148
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
and chat me up while I was playing.

2149
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
On to the news about EA.

2150
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I do like that they are opening up of their stuff

2151
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
to the public.

2152
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Like Shane, I really enjoyed the PSX I went to

2153
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
as a fan and not media.

2154
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
But as someone who may be going to E3 again this year

2155
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
as media, can I say fuck you EA for putting their thing

2156
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
across the street?

2157
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
It's already a, it's already a betch, B-E-T-C-H,

2158
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
but when you've got five minutes between appointments

2159
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
and they're in opposite halls,

2160
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
but now there's also this to contend with.

2161
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
That's my F-you of the week.

2162
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Wink.

2163
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
You know, back in my day at E3,

2164
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
the only thing across the street were like hot dog vendors

2165
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
and balls.

2166
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
And balls.

2167
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
That was what my E3 was like, too.

2168
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
And then, of course, you had the EEE booth

2169
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
where you got root beer balls.

2170
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I remember the one year I went and I didn't see anything

2171
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
but the Ouya thing.

2172
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I think I was picking up Bobby Black Wolf

2173
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and we went to Disneyland.

2174
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Oh, and they had the one year where, um,

2175
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
what's the game called now?

2176
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Um, the Rez spiritual successor.

2177
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I don't remember what it's called now.

2178
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Oh, Child of Light?

2179
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
No, that's the Ubisoft game, isn't it?

2180
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Yeah, but it was by Mizuguchi.

2181
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2182
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Oh, no, no, no.

2183
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
You're right.

2184
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
No, no, no.

2185
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
It was something like that, yeah.

2186
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Yeah, because I was going to say Child of Light,

2187
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
but it's not that.

2188
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Child of Eden.

2189
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Child of Eden, yes.

2190
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
That was across the street one year, too,

2191
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
and I played that.

2192
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I was like, ooh, interesting.

2193
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And Bobby is pointing out, though,

2194
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
that EA is not going to be across the street for media

2195
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
because the meeting rooms, they will still have upstairs

2196
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
at the LA Convention Center.

2197
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
And a lot of people who've even been to E3

2198
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
don't ever think to walk upstairs,

2199
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
and that's because I think you actually,

2200
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I don't think a general badge gets you up there.

2201
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I think you have to have a media badge to get up there.

2202
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
But we actually, I went up there

2203
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
when I had some appointments a couple years ago

2204
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
the last time I was there, and I was like,

2205
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
wow, there's a lot more you don't even see that's up here

2206
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
because that's how I played.

2207
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I want to say how I played a lot of the Bandai Namco stuff

2208
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
was actually upstairs.

2209
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It wasn't even on the show floor,

2210
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
but we had an appointment to see the Tails game

2211
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
that was coming out that year,

2212
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
and we got to play some of the other stuff.

2213
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
My first year, I just managed to piggyback into media events,

2214
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
remember?

2215
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

2216
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And then my second year, I managed to, again,

2217
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
piggyback into media events and convince the people

2218
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
at Capcom to let me in

2219
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
because that's when they were being really rude to people.

2220
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Yeah.

2221
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
But I got into something.

2222
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
The best badge you can have was the one year

2223
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I had the exhibitor badge,

2224
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
and I just went everywhere whenever I wanted.

2225
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I went there a day early, and it was just playing games

2226
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
that were already on the floor.

2227
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
It was so good.

2228
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,000
The third year is when we had media passes,

2229
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
and that was pretty fun.

2230
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I just remember hanging out in the Bethesda room for a while

2231
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
with that Call of Cthulhu game

2232
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
that I wanted to play so badly.

2233
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
The reality is times have changed,

2234
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and it's a new media now than it was ten years ago

2235
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
when we were all first going,

2236
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
so we'll see what happens and what changes in the future.

2237
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
All right, that is it for our mailbag tonight.

2238
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
All right, participate at orangeloungeradio.com

2239
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
if you want to send an email for a future week.

2240
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
In the meantime, let's get into the FUs of the week

2241
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
because we get angsty here on the show once in a while,

2242
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
and so we're going to take it out on all of you.

2243
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:50,000
This is FU2, and it's not like anyone's fault or anything,

2244
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
so I'll say FU that my friend's cat got out

2245
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
and has now lost everything.

2246
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Poor baby, I hope you can find your baby.

2247
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
There's a poor little hurt cat too.

2248
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
There's cold, poor baby.

2249
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I hope they come back soon.

2250
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,000
And also FU2 having migraines at work.

2251
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Um, Loki.

2252
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I'm FU2 myself for twisting my ankle

2253
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
while playing Ingress this week.

2254
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
It's a dangerous sport.

2255
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Yes, dangerous, no, it's more like me being a dumbass

2256
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
and walking along the edge of a road and stepping on it.

2257
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Was it even a dangerous portal?

2258
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Were you going into the ditch by the movie theaters?

2259
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
It wasn't that, or it was just like over?

2260
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,000
No, it was the entrance to a park,

2261
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
and there's no place to park right there by the portal,

2262
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
so I had to park and walk to it, and I did, and I hit it.

2263
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
So you tripped over your own two feet?

2264
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
No, I didn't trip over my own two feet.

2265
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I tripped off the curb funny and twisted my ankle,

2266
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
and I looked like a dumbass because I fell on the ground,

2267
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
and then had to hobble around for a couple days.

2268
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Alright.

2269
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
My FU of the Week goes to, oh my god,

2270
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
the sickness that would not go away.

2271
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I was waking up for like two weeks.

2272
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
You remember when I missed a show a couple weeks ago?

2273
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Like, I think today is the first day that I woke up feeling symptom-free.

2274
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Knock on wood, cross my fingers, all that stuff.

2275
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
FU did the sickness that would not go away. It was awful.

2276
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
And FU did the fact that I walked six miles yesterday,

2277
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
but that's actually a good thing. I needed the exercise.

2278
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
But I walked six miles for Ingress First Saturday,

2279
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
and I came in sixth place, but that was out of 72 people,

2280
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
so it's not too bad actually, so I'm happy.

2281
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I really wanted to go to that. I wish I could.

2282
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It was fun. There was a lot of people there.

2283
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
It's fun to meet the people that you only talk to online usually.

2284
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
So were there a lot of people from the other faction there?

2285
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Yeah, but I don't want to say it gets high school,

2286
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
but people definitely kind of hang with their crew,

2287
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
and I didn't meet a lot of people. I'm always nice.

2288
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
There's a couple, but usually they're out of area.

2289
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
You know, so there was a couple that I met that were nice.

2290
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Was Pepper there?

2291
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
No, she wasn't. I like her. I would have said hi to her if she was there.

2292
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
See, my thought was if I had been able to go to a park or something like that,

2293
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I was like, well, everybody's going into this thing.

2294
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I'm just going to go hack your crap while you're away.

2295
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Yeah, right, so it was fun, but I did a lot of walking.

2296
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,000
It was like I got to come home and take a nap because that was too much walking.

2297
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,000
All right, moving on. Shane, do you have any FUs of the week?

2298
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:37,000
FU2, deciding I wanted that Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comic book way too late

2299
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
because now you can't find it.

2300
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I guess I'll have to wait for the third reprint that comes out in March,

2301
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
but I really wanted the Blue Ranger cover, and I won't be able to find that.

2302
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Well, maybe there's a listener that can save the day and cross our fingers and our toes.

2303
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Let Shane know. Reach out to him on Twitter.

2304
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Yes, I just want the Blue Ranger cover.

2305
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
If you have one in your area that's not the Blue Ranger,

2306
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I'll just get it off of the Internet version or something.

2307
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
All right.

2308
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
But thank you in advance.

2309
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Tigerclaw in chat wants to know, specifically for you, Shane,

2310
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
speaking of Power Rangers, what are his thoughts on Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa?

2311
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
You could go listen to Ranger Pride and find out, but spoiler.

2312
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
That's how you plug a show. Good job, but spoiler.

2313
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I love Elizabeth Banks.

2314
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
All right.

2315
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
So that might give you a clue as to how I feel.

2316
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:33,000
All right. Let's do a couple more stories here, and then we're going to open up the phone line.

2317
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Gosh, we're running a little ahead of schedule tonight.

2318
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
It's weird, but I guess when there's less people because the whole football game and so forth,

2319
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
some nights we're done early, some nights we're not.

2320
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Loki, what do you got for us?

2321
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
All right.

2322
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:55,000
So there was going to be an iOS version of binding of Isaac Rebirth,

2323
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:00,000
but now it's not going to happen because it's been rejected from the App Store.

2324
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:09,000
And I guess this was due to an issue of depictions of violence towards or abuse of children,

2325
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
which is pretty much the foundation of this game.

2326
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And so it's going to be kind of hard to fix that.

2327
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I love the response by the actual developer, Tyrone Rotter.

2328
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:27,000
It's like he posted the whole, what was it, the rejection notice thing,

2329
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
and then he's like, come on, what the fuck, Apple?

2330
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So that was very funny.

2331
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:37,000
But yes, usually he's, I guess, had the problems with other games in the past,

2332
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:45,000
but it's going to be hard to kind of censor that to where it'd be acceptable on the store, I guess,

2333
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
because, I mean, it's the whole foundation of the game.

2334
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
It is a little dark, let's just put it like that.

2335
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,000
I can see when I kind of heard this, I was like, well, it is a bit much,

2336
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
and it didn't get on Nintendo's platform.

2337
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
But it's not necessarily, I mean...

2338
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
It is on Nintendo's platform.

2339
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Is it? I thought they ended up...

2340
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
No, it's on, you have to, you can only play it on new 3DS.

2341
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
That's right, that's right.

2342
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I mean, it's not a realistic depiction of a child.

2343
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I mean, it's just a cartoon character.

2344
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I mean, come on.

2345
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
It's hard to just say he's 18.

2346
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Just change the graphics.

2347
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Alright, well, you know, one game that people would love to see on a Nintendo platform is Undertale.

2348
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,000
You know, this game has been a runaway indie success,

2349
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:41,000
and apparently, developer support at Nintendo of America has reached out to Toby Fox,

2350
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
who is the creator of Undertale.

2351
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
That's what some outlets are reporting this week.

2352
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And this is all through Twitter, for what it's worth.

2353
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
So, you know, that's why people can see those tweets.

2354
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
And the tweet actually said,

2355
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Hey, are you available for me to reach out to you when you get a chance?

2356
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Let me know if that's cool.

2357
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
So now a lot of people are saying like,

2358
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Oh, is Nintendo trying to chase down Undertale for their platforms?

2359
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
They'll buy it and call it Earthbound 4.

2360
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Anything's possible.

2361
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
But, you know, Undertale isn't on consoles,

2362
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
and I bet Nintendo would love to have that under their belt.

2363
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
You know, I don't see why they wouldn't go for that.

2364
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
So we'll see what happens with that.

2365
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I still need to play my copy.

2366
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,000
It was, I believe Dar Sakura bought that for me for the holidays,

2367
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
and I still haven't played it yet, because I'm a bad person.

2368
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
I've only played the demo partially.

2369
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Yeah, I need to get into that.

2370
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
But what bugs me is that I've already had,

2371
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I don't want to say the whole thing's spoiled,

2372
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
but I kind of know that you're supposed to play a certain way the first time.

2373
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
And I don't know, I'm kind of irritated that that got ruined for me.

2374
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
But, oh well.

2375
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Anyhow, sg100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2376
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I have to play Undertale at some point.

2377
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Sounds like I'm not the only one who's behind,

2378
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
but that happens with games sometimes.

2379
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line right now for you to call in.

2380
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
1-877-GAME-OLR is the old school phone number,

2381
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
but you can also call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2382
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Skype, of course, is something you can get on your PC,

2383
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
or it's an app on pretty much every smartphone that's out there.

2384
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:14,000
And you can just call us all one word on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2385
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2386
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Bob Coffey says, oh shit, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 is going to have the Technodrome?

2387
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
And Krang.

2388
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Yeah, it sounds like the second movie gives us a lot of the stuff we remember from the 90s cartoon.

2389
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
It looks pretty awesome.

2390
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Yeah, was the new trailer released today?

2391
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Yeah, Super Bowl.

2392
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I figured. A lot of movies. Didn't Independence Day get one too, or the new Independence Day?

2393
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
X-Men Apocalypse.

2394
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I don't know, but I'm going to have to go look for those now.

2395
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I think there was a new Independence Day one too.

2396
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
So there's a lot of movie stuff today.

2397
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I'm sure YouTube will blow up with all that stuff later.

2398
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Don't they compile all the official Super Bowl stuff into one YouTube playlist?

2399
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Maybe.

2400
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,000
You don't even have to really watch the game, you can just watch the YouTube playlist two hours after the game is over.

2401
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I don't know.

2402
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Speaking of movies, I do want to give a quick plug to Flaco Jones.

2403
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Because his winter movie preview just went up over at vognetwork.com.

2404
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,000
And you can check that out and tell us what winter movies you're looking forward to.

2405
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 not on that list because it's not a winter movie.

2406
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
But a little movie, I think it's called Skull Poople or something?

2407
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Is coming out next week and has a lot of people very excited about that.

2408
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
What?

2409
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Skull Poople.

2410
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
What are you trying to say? I don't understand.

2411
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Have you heard about the Deadpool movie marketing campaign?

2412
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Where they used the emojis and the emojis were the skull, the poop, and the letter L.

2413
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Because it's dead poo-le.

2414
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
But a lot of people were like, what's Skull Poople?

2415
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
And so they kind of like ran with it.

2416
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:44,000
And I think Ryan Reynolds actually did an interview where he's promoting Skull Poople.

2417
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
So, I think that's funny.

2418
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Obviously, Ryan Reynolds is a great fit for that character.

2419
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:55,000
He's apparently great for that role and just hearing one of the reviews for it today.

2420
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
It's getting a lot of positive press from what I'm hearing.

2421
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Yeah, I'm totally down to see this.

2422
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Yeah, I'll see that too.

2423
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Dark Soccer though, you're usually the one that jumps at the Deadpool stuff.

2424
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Are you going to be seeing Skull Poople or no?

2425
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Probably.

2426
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Yeah?

2427
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I mean, it kind of goes without saying.

2428
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Yeah.

2429
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I rarely make it out to movies anymore.

2430
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Remember, Shane, when we said we were going to go see one movie a week?

2431
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
You wanted to do that.

2432
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
How long did that last?

2433
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
No, because you said you were going to do it too, but then you changed mine.

2434
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But it wasn't on me to do it.

2435
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
It was on you to say something.

2436
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
And it happened one time.

2437
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
We went and saw one movie.

2438
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Now, granted, we saw Star Wars, which is pretty awesome.

2439
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
But it happened one time.

2440
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,000
I just want to point that out.

2441
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Again, that was on you though, not me.

2442
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Alright, another plug for calls.

2443
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Orange Launch Radio.

2444
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Although, again, our live turnout is a little less.

2445
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I'm thankful to you guys for being here live, but there are less than there usually are.

2446
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Orange Launch Radio on Skype, all one word.

2447
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
One eight seven seven game over.

2448
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Well, this stream did crash, and I think a few people crashed with it.

2449
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Yeah, that's true.

2450
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
The stream did crash, and some people probably thought we were done or something.

2451
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
So, I hate that, but some things you can't control, and that's one of them.

2452
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
They apparently had a new TV spot for 10 Cloverfield Lane.

2453
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
What was that?

2454
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
There was a TV spot for what?

2455
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Ten Cloverfield Lane.

2456
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Oh, yeah, the whole...

2457
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I'm so excited for that movie.

2458
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I kind of thought the original movie was super overrated, but...

2459
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I loved it.

2460
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Yeah, of course you did.

2461
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Let's see, in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

2462
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Xanos in chat says, and I hope I'm saying that right, sorry if I'm not,

2463
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
says, looking forward to Deadpool Thursday night on DLX.

2464
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Tiger call asking if we've seen the new Jason Bourne spot.

2465
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Is that the one where they don't have Matt Damon doing it anymore,

2466
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
but now it's what, Jeremy Renner?

2467
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
No, I think Matt Damon's back.

2468
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Oh, he's back? Oh, good for him.

2469
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I saw, like, the first one of those movies, and never...

2470
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:42,000
We also had the anniversary of Street Fighter II a few days ago.

2471
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
That did happen this week, didn't it?

2472
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
It did.

2473
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Street Fighter, quickly, since we're not getting any calls,

2474
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
favorite Street Fighter II memory?

2475
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
It wasn't Street Fighter II,

2476
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
but it was X-Men vs. Street Fighter,

2477
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,000
of beating Dan's ass with Kami and having him yell about how much he hates Kami.

2478
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
That was great.

2479
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Mine was being at a tournament at Blockbuster,

2480
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
when they were doing tournaments.

2481
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Awesome.

2482
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
And a guy saying he wanted to pick Guile,

2483
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
and I was like, who's Guile?

2484
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
One of the people who is Callum Cooley.

2485
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Is he the guy that does the Sanic Boom?

2486
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Sanic Bam!

2487
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Sanic Bam?

2488
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Let's see, my favorite memory was...

2489
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I was on a bus trip from...

2490
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
It's a button willow.

2491
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Well, funny enough, it was California to the United Nations in New York City.

2492
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I probably told this story on the show at some point.

2493
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
It was something I did through, like, a youth...

2494
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Well, it was actually...

2495
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Do you know what the Independent Order Odd Fellows is?

2496
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
It's kind of like Masons, like one of those types of organizations.

2497
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
They used to sponsor...

2498
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Sounds like a cult.

2499
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It's not a cult.

2500
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
It's an old people organization.

2501
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
They're all very nice people,

2502
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
and they paid for me to go to New York City,

2503
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
so there's not possibly a negative thing I could say.

2504
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
But I won the speech contest,

2505
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
so they did this thing where we went on a bus to the United Nations.

2506
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
The point of the story is, coming back,

2507
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
our last stop was in...

2508
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I want to say it was Ontario.

2509
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
That's where the airport is, down south, right?

2510
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
We stopped there the very last night,

2511
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:17,000
and there was some arcade next door to the hotel we were all staying at.

2512
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
So we went into this little arcade,

2513
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
and there was a bunch of people playing Street Fighter II,

2514
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
and I just was like,

2515
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Oh, yeah, Street Fighter II, I want to play,

2516
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,000
and I got on, and I was playing as Chun-Li,

2517
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
and that made all the bros who were playing the game

2518
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
kind of laugh like,

2519
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Oh, it's a guy playing Chun-Li or whatever.

2520
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I whooped them all.

2521
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I was on that machine.

2522
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I shit you not for an hour straight,

2523
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
just playing Chun-Li, kicking all their asses.

2524
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
That's my favorite Street Fighter II memory.

2525
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,000
So thank you, Chun-Li, for showing...

2526
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
for helping me out.

2527
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I had a moment like that with Tekken 3 back in the day.

2528
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Oh, yeah?

2529
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Playing, uh...

2530
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Weren't you kind of known locally as that girl who plays Tekken?

2531
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Who plays Tekken, yeah.

2532
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Well, the story is that I had gone back into the cyber station

2533
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
that I used to work at,

2534
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
because they had the deluxe Tekken 3 cab, so...

2535
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Nice.

2536
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Well, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

2537
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2538
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Who's this?

2539
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Hello, Rob.

2540
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Is this Marissa?

2541
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Yes, it is.

2542
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Yay, these are my favorite moments.

2543
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Hello, everybody.

2544
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
How are you, Marissa?

2545
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Marissa, come on in.

2546
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I tried to go outside to talk on the phone,

2547
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
because I live in a very small space,

2548
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
and my boyfriend now has to listen to me talk.

2549
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
There is a wind tunnel outside.

2550
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Anyway...

2551
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
We don't hear it, for what it's worth,

2552
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
but I'm sorry you're having to put up with it,

2553
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
but we can hear you just fine.

2554
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
What's on your mind tonight, hun?

2555
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Calling to say hi.

2556
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I noticed, you know, you're having a Super Bowl lag, right?

2557
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Yeah, I think a lot of people are feeling it.

2558
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Like, what can you do?

2559
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
This is the day where Bravo just plays Real Housewives all day long,

2560
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
because what can you do?

2561
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
They already do that.

2562
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

2563
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Chris just said to me, he's like,

2564
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
you can't say Super Bowl, it's the big game.

2565
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
We can say it's streaming, honey.

2566
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I think, technically, we're talking news,

2567
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and Super Bowl is news.

2568
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
We're not...

2569
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
If we had promoted tonight's show

2570
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
as the Super Bowl edition of Orange on Radio,

2571
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
then that's a problem.

2572
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I didn't even know anybody excited about this game in particular,

2573
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
but we went to the supermarket,

2574
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
and they were completely out of all chips and beer,

2575
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
so I guess it was just like, hey, let's eat and drink day.

2576
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Yeah, people, even if their teams aren't in it,

2577
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
people still watch it and get into it.

2578
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Like, well, usually, like our pal Bobby,

2579
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
he's not usually on Super Bowl Sunday,

2580
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
because it was like the one time a year

2581
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
he would see a certain group of friends,

2582
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
and they would hang out.

2583
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
And for whatever sad reason, unfortunately,

2584
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
that didn't happen this year, so Bobby was here tonight.

2585
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
But, you know, it's like one of those cultural things.

2586
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Some people do it for the Oscars, right?

2587
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
You might have a friend that has an Oscar party every year,

2588
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
and then suddenly one year they'll stop.

2589
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
They'll get sick of doing it.

2590
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
That's true.

2591
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Well, you know, if I'm down here in L.A., though,

2592
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
and like we only care, well, we don't have a football team right now,

2593
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
but we only care if our team is winning anyway.

2594
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Well, you're getting a team next year, from what I understand,

2595
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
so that's going to change a little bit.

2596
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Yeah.

2597
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Well, even then, the thing is, that's always funny.

2598
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
It's like, you know, we'll be bagging on,

2599
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
like we're never like, this is our hometown.

2600
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
We like support our home team.

2601
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
You know, it's like Dodgers suck, and then they win.

2602
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
We love the Dodgers, so that's it.

2603
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
You know, we never support them unless they're winners,

2604
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
but we always have our Oscar parties.

2605
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
And actually, Dark Soccer, I see you asking in chat,

2606
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
does anyone in here live in or near Denver?

2607
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I believe Jason.

2608
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Okay, just because my friend's kitten,

2609
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
she's actually put out a call for him.

2610
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
He's got a blue cast on.

2611
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,000
He's a black kitten, and his name is Logie.

2612
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,000
And I don't think, oh, is Denver where the kitty disappeared?

2613
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Yeah.

2614
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Oh, I don't think Jason is in Denver.

2615
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I think he's in like, Colorado Springs,

2616
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
or like, kind of out, like a suburb.

2617
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
It'll be easy to see.

2618
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
He's got like a light blue cast on his back leg.

2619
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I'm sure if Jason is still listening to the show,

2620
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
he's probably had to board up all the windows and doors at this point

2621
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,000
from all the rioting that is going on a mile high right now, so stay safe.

2622
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
You're gonna look up to a scared Tiny Tim of cats.

2623
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I hope he gets recovered.

2624
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Any gaming going on for you, Marissa?

2625
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I don't know if there's anything you're playing?

2626
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Not right now.

2627
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I actually went through Fallout again.

2628
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Oh, nice.

2629
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I can't wait to actually play Fallout 4.

2630
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
We still have a 360.

2631
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
We're gonna upgrade eventually, but in celebration of that,

2632
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I went through Fallout 4.

2633
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I mean, through the two previous games,

2634
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
and it's funny, you were talking about taking breaks in gaming.

2635
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
When I really get into a game,

2636
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
my break is finding up with some sort of lame save point excuse,

2637
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
even when you can save anywhere,

2638
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
to stall my boyfriend so I can continue to play.

2639
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
That's my break.

2640
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,000
It's like, honey, finish mission two hours later.

2641
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Oh, it's really tough.

2642
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I'm in a cut scene.

2643
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
It's still going.

2644
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
That's my break.

2645
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Get a drink.

2646
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Make an excuse.

2647
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
That's a good story.

2648
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Use the bathroom.

2649
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,000
You know what?

2650
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
You bring up a really good point, too,

2651
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
and something that came up this week

2652
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
when I was talking to somebody else,

2653
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
unaffiliated with the show or the network,

2654
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
but I was talking about, you know, like,

2655
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
oh, yeah, I play a lot of video games,

2656
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
and I do this podcast, and I'm a big gamer,

2657
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
and this friend I was talking to said,

2658
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
well, I'm a gamer, too,

2659
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
but I don't really own any of the news systems,

2660
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
so I don't know if you would really consider me a gamer,

2661
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
and I felt really bad because I was like,

2662
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
of course you're still a gamer.

2663
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
There's a lot of people.

2664
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I mean, PlayStation 4's only been out, like, two years, right?

2665
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Same thing with Xbox One.

2666
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Like, if you don't have the cutting-edge stuff, it's okay.

2667
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
People got their priorities,

2668
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,000
and there's a lot of people still loving their 360s

2669
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
and their PlayStation 3s,

2670
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
and there's a huge library on both those consoles

2671
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
to catch up on and the Nintendo Wii, to be fair.

2672
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
You can't get a lot of games for cheap now, yeah.

2673
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Yeah, exactly, and you can get them secondhand,

2674
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
and they're cheap.

2675
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,000
So I absolutely still consider everybody playing,

2676
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
even if you're a generation behind,

2677
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
or even two generations behind, screw it.

2678
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I want to say, when Raginator was first listening to OLR,

2679
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
he was like, can I talk about Nintendo 64 games?

2680
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Because I'm, like, really behind,

2681
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
and I'm like, of course you can,

2682
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
because some people love retro stuff.

2683
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Why not?

2684
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
That's true.

2685
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Like, if you get, like, you know,

2686
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:21,000
a Jamie level, you know, massive room of games

2687
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
and, like, museum type, then you're like,

2688
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
to music, like, what the vinyl collector is, you know?

2689
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
But, you know, I still think it's a conspiracy, though,

2690
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
because my, um, I'm not the only one,

2691
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
but, you know, our disk drive is starting to go.

2692
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I'm like, I swear to God, it's a conspiracy

2693
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
to make a spot on Xbox One.

2694
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Isn't?

2695
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Yeah.

2696
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
All of a sudden, now, it's starting to grind,

2697
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
and we might go in there and mess with the belt, but, yeah.

2698
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
And now they're coming out with all this new stuff, too,

2699
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
where, oh, more games are backwards compatible.

2700
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Now the secret backwards compatibility is being added,

2701
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
and I kind of can't wait

2702
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
for the Castlevania Symphony of the Night myself,

2703
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
because I would love to revisit that game again, but, yeah.

2704
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Funny.

2705
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Talking about cut scenes, I have to say this from chat.

2706
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Bobby in our chat room says,

2707
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I'm in a cut scene.

2708
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Oh, it's still going.

2709
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
No, it's not.

2710
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Yes, it is.

2711
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
This is Xenosaga.

2712
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Yeah, some games really do have, like, two hour cut scenes.

2713
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I would say Xenoblade Chronicles almost in that category

2714
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
with some of those cut scenes.

2715
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Good lord.

2716
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
No.

2717
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
I tried to, I was like, can I save the game now?

2718
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Jesus.

2719
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Anyway.

2720
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
That game is so good.

2721
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Yeah, it was pretty fun.

2722
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I was giving it a lot of shit in the beginning,

2723
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
and rightfully so, but once you stick with it,

2724
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
it gets pretty good.

2725
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Anyway, Marisa, always so lovely to hear from you.

2726
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Anything else you want to mention

2727
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
before we let you go tonight?

2728
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I don't know if you guys covered the Annie's,

2729
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,000
but, you know, that was more animation oriented.

2730
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
But that's an interesting thing to check out.

2731
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
That was last night.

2732
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Was it last night?

2733
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
I wonder if our pals at Anime Jam Session

2734
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
know about that, because that would be

2735
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
a little probably more up their alley,

2736
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
even though if it's more, if it's like,

2737
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
but they talk, they get into the other stuff

2738
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
just like we do here, too.

2739
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Especially since everyone is, you know, involved.

2740
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Especially, you know, the actors do both.

2741
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Yeah, true.

2742
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
That's true.

2743
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Anybody you know win anything?

2744
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Oh, well, I don't have any updates on any of our buddies,

2745
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
except I think you need to take classes, you know,

2746
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,000
with Greg and David, and Greg is a sweetheart.

2747
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,000
The most recent game that I know that he's done,

2748
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
although I do know that he's done things since,

2749
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,000
you know, is that he was in one of the loudspeakers

2750
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
in Dishonored.

2751
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:30,000
But there, you know, that's the luck of being where I live.

2752
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
You know, I've taken classes with Charlie Adler,

2753
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
so people could know his work from gaming,

2754
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,000
but in animation he's huge, and he's amazing.

2755
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,000
So, although I do welcome you to reach out to Andrew

2756
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
at any time, too, if you ever want to have him

2757
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
on the show again, or any guests.

2758
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Yeah, get some updates, figure out what's going on.

2759
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Yeah.

2760
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Absolutely.

2761
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
All right.

2762
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Well, Marissa, I'm going to let you go

2763
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
so we can see if we get any other callers tonight,

2764
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
but thank you so much.

2765
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Always a pleasure to hear from you,

2766
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
and I really, really hope to make it to L.A. soon.

2767
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
There's still time.

2768
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
All right.

2769
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Take care, my dear.

2770
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,000
My best.

2771
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Bye.

2772
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
All right.

2773
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
And there goes Marissa.

2774
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
We love hearing from her, though.

2775
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I am going to bow out.

2776
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,000
That's right.

2777
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
It is about that time.

2778
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
It is.

2779
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Have a wonderful week.

2780
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
How was I going to say?

2781
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Rest of your weekend, but there's not much left.

2782
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Enjoy the hour or two that's left.

2783
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:20,000
You mean like the 45 minutes I have left before I have to go to bed?

2784
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight before you go?

2785
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I wish I could sleep in tomorrow.

2786
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
That's really my final thought.

2787
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Me too.

2788
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
My strongest desire is to no longer be on morning shift.

2789
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Ah.

2790
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Well, hopefully you'll get to switcheroo it up soon.

2791
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
All right.

2792
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Well.

2793
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Mid next month.

2794
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
We will see you next week.

2795
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Maybe.

2796
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
All right.

2797
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
If I'm not dead.

2798
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Next week is a three-day weekend for me.

2799
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Lucky you.

2800
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I know.

2801
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Next Sunday is Valentine's day.

2802
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Oh, shit.

2803
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Oh, it's Valentine's day.

2804
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Are we doing a show?

2805
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I guess we're going to have to.

2806
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Well, I'll be here.

2807
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
You'll be here.

2808
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
I guess.

2809
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Will you be here, Loki?

2810
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Is life going to let you do a show on Valentine's day?

2811
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Probably.

2812
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
All right.

2813
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Cool.

2814
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Good.

2815
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
All right.

2816
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Well, because Alan and I always have the perspective of the restaurants are going to be a shit show

2817
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
on Valentine's day.

2818
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
So we'll go.

2819
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I took the day after off, so I can actually do the whole show.

2820
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Exactly.

2821
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:18,000
We'll go the day before two days before two, like we'll do a dinner and call it our Valentine's

2822
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
dinner.

2823
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,000
We are just fine with that.

2824
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
So that's what we do.

2825
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
So rock on.

2826
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
All right.

2827
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Well, thank you, dark soccer.

2828
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
We'll see you in a week.

2829
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
All right.

2830
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Bye.

2831
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
All right.

2832
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
And Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, yeah, I'll be here next week.

2833
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:33,000
My girlfriend and I will do stuff Friday and Saturday, and then we're going up to mag fest.

2834
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:37,000
So he's actually, I don't, have you mentioned that you're bringing your, your gal pal?

2835
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Uh, but yeah, they're, uh, they're going to be, uh, uh, at mag fest.

2836
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
So, um, that'll be a, a really fun trip for them.

2837
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Sadly, Alan cannot come to mag fest cause it's an election year and his industry involves

2838
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,000
selections and he's gonna be very, very, very busy.

2839
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
So very cool.

2840
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Uh, one more shout out for calls.

2841
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:59,000
One eight seven seven game of LR, excuse me, or I use him on Skype, orange lounge radio,

2842
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,000
checking in with Loki for any last minute stories possibly while we wait for calls.

2843
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Sure thing.

2844
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Um, track media turbo has a release date.

2845
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Now it's going to be coming out March 22nd on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2846
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
And I just caught up on the trailer cause I completely forgot about this game.

2847
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,000
And Holy shit.

2848
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Does that look amazing?

2849
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,000
So I'm going to have to probably pick that up when it comes out.

2850
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Um, GameStop is publishing a game.

2851
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
That's kind of scary.

2852
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Um, yes, apparently, um, they're going to be publishing song of the deep.

2853
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:34,000
It's a 2d underwater Metrovania game and it's going to be out on PC, PlayStation four and

2854
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Xbox one.

2855
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:39,000
And you saw who it's made by ratchet and clank people.

2856
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Yep.

2857
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Insomniac.

2858
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
So that's pretty cool.

2859
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Um, not so excited about GameStop being a publisher, but we'll see how that works out.

2860
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:54,000
And last but not least humble, but humble monthly bundle has 70,000 subscribers.

2861
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I didn't think there'd be that many people picking random games that are going to be,

2862
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:01,000
you know, in a bundle without being announced prior to that.

2863
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:05,000
But apparently people are excited about that.

2864
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And I guess the, let's see, which games do they have actually as part of the bundles?

2865
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:20,000
For example, February, they had alien isolation, Titan souls, broken age volume, um, Panaria

2866
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:26,000
dropsy and elephant in the room, I guess, which is a humble original.

2867
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,000
That's kind of cool.

2868
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Actually, I'm, I, if I was a fan of alien isolation, that'd be kind of worth it.

2869
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,000
But that's it.

2870
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Sorry, buy me a little time.

2871
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
All right.

2872
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Um, I'm one of the reasons I was getting unity kind of up and running again was I was going

2873
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,000
to be working on another concept game.

2874
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Cause like I said, I want to get done with just the whole, it's on the car thing and

2875
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
it's not quite to the level that I want it to be.

2876
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Maybe I might have to redo it in unity five, but I just kind of just want to get something

2877
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
done at this point so I can move on to something else.

2878
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I'm back.

2879
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Sorry.

2880
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Business things I got to do while the show's going on.

2881
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
I'm multitasking.

2882
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Unfortunately, one of those things is no more calls coming in.

2883
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
So sadly, uh, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2884
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Uh, but if you, uh, heard this, you know, later, you think of something later on, don't

2885
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
forget, you can always email us, participate at orange launch radio.com.

2886
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
You can always send us a tweet as well at OLR.

2887
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
I do read them all, even if I don't respond to each and every one here on air.

2888
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Um, that is going to do it though.

2889
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
For another episode of orange Laundrio, we say here every week, thank you for checking

2890
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
out the show.

2891
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
We really do appreciate you checking it out.

2892
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
All we ask, tell a friend about the show, help spread the word because that's all we

2893
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
have is word of mouth.

2894
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Um, you know, tell a friend or two about the show that's going to help us get our name

2895
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
out there and expand our family even more.

2896
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,000
We really appreciate it.

2897
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
A five star review on a site where you found this show, perhaps iTunes or stitcher radio.

2898
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Those go a long way as well.

2899
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
So we really appreciate those.

2900
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Um, anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2901
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Hey Shane, thanks for being here two weeks in a row.

2902
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Appreciate it.

2903
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Hope you enjoyed the wine.

2904
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I'm starting.

2905
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I'm still finish it.

2906
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
No, I'm still working on it.

2907
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I'm grateful.

2908
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
You're just waiting for spaghetti.

2909
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Yeah.

2910
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
All right.

2911
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Alan's making spaghetti tonight.

2912
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
A late dinner.

2913
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
So it's exciting.

2914
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
All right.

2915
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Um, like your final thought though, Shane, while you're still here.

2916
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Two things.

2917
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:27,240
One, Diablos and Bahamut are jerks in explorers because they're not giving me the ability

2918
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:29,420
to make my scythe in this game.

2919
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:31,480
And two, forget Valentine's day.

2920
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:35,880
That day is also the premiere of the new Super Sentai Ju-o-ger.

2921
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:38,000
There's just too much going on on Valentine's day.

2922
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Yes.

2923
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
New OLR.

2924
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Yeah.

2925
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Mostly Ju-o-ger.

2926
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,540
Which I guess also means, I didn't even think about this, that means the, uh, the three

2927
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:47,220
shows announcements is going to be on Valentine's day, but that's all right.

2928
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:49,820
We'll, we'll have more people there next week than we did tonight.

2929
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:52,980
So, uh, anyway, uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2930
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:56,980
Um, I got a lot of time to ingress now.

2931
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:57,980
Good.

2932
02:27:57,980 --> 02:27:59,660
Clean up the neighborhood.

2933
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:00,660
There's still some blue.

2934
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:03,180
Uh, I'll get you some, clean up my neighborhood.

2935
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:04,180
I'll get you some bursters.

2936
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:05,180
All right.

2937
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:07,620
Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.
