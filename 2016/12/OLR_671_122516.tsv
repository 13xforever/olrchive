0	17360	T'was the night of Christmas and all through the house, you tuned into VOG Network by clicking
17360	18360	your mouse.
18360	21920	There's news of Utada and Pokemon too, more C&D's delivered with the usual round of
21920	22920	boos.
22920	26360	We have lots of news from This Week in Gaming, come celebrate your geekiness, no one here
26360	27360	is shaming.
27360	31800	Orange Lounge Radio.
31800	35400	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35400	37280	where every gamer has a voice.
37280	45640	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 671 for this December the 25th
45640	48080	of 2016.
48080	50440	Kind of a big day today and I think maybe in the...
50440	51840	Yes, the second night of Hanukkah.
51840	56240	Coming up on 15 year anniversary of our show.
56240	59920	This is the first time I think we've ever done a show live on December 25th.
59920	65880	So Merry Christmas, or I'm sorry, as we were saying before the show, Merry fucking Christmas,
65880	70080	Happy Goddamn Hanukkah, and shit.
70080	72560	And fuck 2016 in the ear.
72560	73560	That's right.
73560	75560	With something hard and sandpapery.
75560	76560	That's right.
76560	77600	My God.
77600	84840	So horrible to hear about Carrie Fisher, although apparently she's in stable condition, and
84840	89560	if any celebrity was going to say, not today, Satan, it was going to be Carrie Fisher.
89560	92840	But then George Michael just gone today unexpectedly.
92840	93840	And it's like...
93840	95920	Is that what we had to sacrifice to keep our princess general?
95920	99480	I don't want to think about that because well, and it's okay.
99480	100480	Here's the thing, because there's...
100480	101760	By the way, I'm Rob Roberts.
101760	102760	She's Dark Sakura.
102760	103760	Hi.
103760	104760	If you didn't know that by now, I...
104760	105760	Where...
105760	106760	What rock have you been under?
106760	107760	Yeah, exactly.
107760	110500	Tech master Loki not here tonight enjoying the holiday with his family, obviously.
110500	114300	You guys there at VogueNetwork.com joining us live as you do every Sunday night, six
114340	119780	o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Dark Tetsuya
119780	125660	in chat commending Jason there on the intro, which Jason, our voiceover guy should be commended.
125660	127540	That was one of his best intros he's ever done.
127540	131260	I mean, he does great work, but that was one of my very, very favorites.
131260	133620	A great holiday present.
133620	134620	Anyway, where were we?
134620	135620	Oh, yes.
135620	136620	Dead celebrities.
136620	140020	So everybody on Twitter, you know, RIP George Michael, right?
140020	141020	Because it sucks.
141020	142020	He was only 53.
142020	143020	That's nothing.
143020	144020	That's nothing, right?
144740	145740	Still young.
145740	146740	So...
146740	147740	This year, though.
147740	148740	Yeah.
148740	149740	This year has been ridiculous.
149740	150740	Prince.
150740	151740	Well, yeah.
151740	152740	David Bowie.
152740	153740	But here's the thing.
153740	158840	So, of course, when people start eulogizing celebrities on Twitter, here comes the snark
158840	160340	police here.
160340	161940	And so here come the tweets.
161940	167260	Well, I'm really happy to hear that when 2017 starts, all those celebrities are going to
167260	175020	stop dying or, you know, something about like, you know, people die all the time.
175020	177780	It doesn't matter that it's 2016 and all this stuff.
177780	183980	And it's like, okay, first off, if you don't got nothing nice to say, don't say it at all.
183980	190580	But for you snarky bitches, take a seat, take all the seats, shut your mouth and listen
190580	191580	for a minute.
191580	193060	Get the tree out of your ass first.
193060	196340	This year, we've lost Prince.
196340	198220	We've lost David Bowie.
198220	202320	We've lost George Michael, among countless other celebrities.
202320	209140	But I named those particular ones in particular because as far as like gender bend, queer
209140	213900	rock goes, those are like some of the biggest names.
213900	217200	I mean, you know, Freddie Mercury, but we lost him a long time ago.
217200	221840	But out of what we, you know, what we had left in 2016, it really feels like mother
221840	223820	nature just, you know, just like...
223820	230700	Queer Lady Gaga, don't drive, don't go out in public, just stay in the safe little bubble.
230700	231700	Tim Curry.
231700	232700	Tim Curry.
232700	233700	Oh my God.
233700	234700	Do not leave your house.
234700	237940	Do not or, you know, leave your house to get a sufficient amount of air, but stay in the
237940	239140	plastic bubble.
239140	243140	But anyway, the point why I bring all this up is that, you know, these are, it's the
243140	247220	fact that we're losing all these iconic people back to back to back.
247220	251740	And we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago on the show before I inadvertently
251740	256960	condemned Zsa Zsa on the show was you were talking about, yes, somebody's going to have
256960	260840	to die in 2017 because that's just the way life is.
260840	265300	But who's 100 years old, Kirk Douglas?
265300	266300	Okay.
266300	269880	If Kirk Douglas passes away next year, I'm going to be sad.
269880	270880	But it's like...
270880	271880	But not surprised.
271880	272880	But he was 100 years old.
272880	273880	Right.
273880	274880	It was time.
274880	275880	Right.
275880	276880	Same thing with Zsa Zsa.
276880	277880	Yeah.
277880	278880	That's all I ever said about Zsa Zsa.
278880	279880	Pretty much dead already.
279880	280880	It's just officially.
281020	282020	He was in a coma.
282020	283020	Yeah.
283020	284020	Yeah, exactly.
284020	286700	So, you know, and somebody, somebody on my Twitter feed, I made a post about the bubble
286700	289860	and somebody on my Twitter feed said, put Carol Channing in that too.
289860	291740	She's 96 years old.
291740	295020	And yes, Carol Channing does belong in the bubble.
295020	302220	However, if Carol Channing passes away, I'm going to be like, she was 96 years old.
302220	303740	But she is a fan of Bob the drag queen.
303740	308500	So you know, you can, you can apply this to a lot of the 90 year old celebrities, except
308500	309680	Betty White.
309680	310680	Don't you fucking touch Betty White.
310680	312420	Betty White will cut a bitch.
312420	313420	That's right.
313420	314420	Anyway.
314420	315420	Death's gonna come for her.
315420	316420	She'll be like, ho!
316420	317420	Yeah.
317420	322300	Flaco Jones in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the older you get, the more famous people
322300	323300	you know die.
323300	324300	Ain't that the truth?
324300	327980	I mean, when you were younger and you heard about famous people passing away, it was like,
327980	329860	oh, it's old people anyway.
329860	333200	But now, yeah, it's, it's kind of like a reminder of our own mortality.
333200	337020	Not to get to a dark place here on Orange Lawns Radio, the show where every gamer has
337020	340280	a voice, but it is our special holiday episode.
340280	341900	It's our holiday episode.
341900	345800	And if it's your first time listening to OLR, I would really encourage you to go listen
345800	348720	to a different episode of OLR for your first OLR.
348720	349720	Not that tonight's-
349720	350720	I don't have enough wine in me.
350720	352720	Not that tonight's going to be bad.
352720	357280	Tonight's just going to be fun because Dark Soccer and I, I mean, it, this is what happens
357280	362960	on December 25th, Christmas, Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate, is that today you kind
362960	364640	of just don't give a fuck.
364640	365640	And so-
365640	366840	No fucks are given.
366840	367840	Exactly.
367840	369540	We are quite the chaste group tonight.
369540	370540	That's right.
370540	371540	That's right.
371540	372540	So what is this?
372540	373540	What is this?
373540	374540	By the way, you brought us to start off with.
374540	375540	Stroopwafel liqueur.
375540	377220	Does that mean it tastes like waffles?
377220	378220	Stroopwafel.
378220	379220	What's the Stroopwafel taste like?
379220	380820	It's those little flat waffle crackers.
380820	383780	I'm actually, if you can hear that clicking, I'm actually opening this.
383780	386420	This is that little like dollar store shot thing.
386420	389260	Although I bet this wasn't a dollar, but it was a little more.
389260	391060	It actually was a dollar.
391060	392060	It was a dollar?
392060	393060	Oh, well.
393060	394060	L'Chaim.
394060	395100	Ooh, it smells pretty good.
395100	396100	Here we go.
396360	398560	Winter holidays of your choice.
398560	399560	Fuck.
399560	400560	Okay.
400560	401560	Hold on.
401560	402560	Pardon the silence.
405560	406560	I drank half of it.
406560	407560	Oh my God.
407560	409560	It does taste like waffle, kind of.
409560	410560	Right?
410560	411560	I was not expecting that.
411560	412560	Holy shit.
412560	413560	This is good.
413560	414560	I'm going to get a big fucking bottle of this.
414560	415560	I'm not-
415560	416560	Contains caramel color.
416560	417560	This is good.
417560	418560	I'm not going to eat anymore.
418560	419560	I'm just going to drink.
419560	420560	You only paid a dollar for this?
420560	421560	For the little teeny ones.
421560	425040	The big bottle is like 11 at Total Wine.
425040	426040	That's a pretty good deal.
426040	427040	Let's go get some.
427040	428040	Wow.
428040	429040	All right.
429040	430040	Sorry, show's over.
430040	431040	We're going to get more Stroopwafel.
431040	432040	Anyway.
432040	436380	VXJ6V in our chat says, Stroopwafels are so good.
436380	437380	Yeah, this is-
437380	438380	Ooh, this is great.
438380	439380	This is amazing.
439380	441380	But it's also fun to say, Stroopwafel.
441380	442380	It is.
442380	443380	It is.
443380	444380	We are-
444380	445380	Get to the Stroopwafel.
445380	449100	We are going to give you a play by play of what we drink tonight.
449100	456240	So this first beverage was, hold on, Van Mier's Stroopwafel Liqueur.
456240	462080	Now we are also enjoying the Chenin Blanc of Charles Spinetta Vineyards.
462080	463080	Yes.
463080	464080	Winery.
464080	465080	There's wine here as well.
465080	466080	I'm not done with Stroopwafel, so.
466080	467080	Well, I drink mine.
467080	468080	All right.
468080	470080	Also, I had two shots of rum before I came over.
470080	471800	Does this girl know how to party or what?
471800	473520	Well, it was rum from Panama.
473520	475980	Well, you got to drink that.
475980	476980	You got to drink that.
476980	477980	Panama.
477980	480080	Anyway, where was I?
480080	481080	I'm going to be totally-
481080	482080	Stroopwafel.
482080	483080	I'm going to be totally scatterbrained tonight, you guys.
483080	490360	Oh, so part of the reason we're here on Christmas, second day of Hanukkah, whatever it is, is
490360	493960	the fact that we're actually not going to be live for a little bit.
493960	496120	We're going to be dead.
496120	497120	Stop.
497120	498120	No, not today.
498120	499120	Not today to make that joke.
499120	501320	I started to say it and I figured I may as well finish it because-
501320	502320	Today not the day to make that joke.
502320	503320	No fucks are given.
503320	505040	No, it is not.
505040	506780	So here's the thing.
506780	510840	We're going to be gone for the next two weeks live because next week is New Year's and a
510840	514520	lot of people are going to be recovering, out of town, all that sort of thing.
514520	519360	I'm going to be gone at MAGFest in two weeks, which I'm not really prepared for how early
519360	522780	MAGFest is this year, although everybody tells me, well, this is the normal time that they
522780	523780	do it.
523780	526000	And I'm kind of like, you know, I kind of liked that February day.
526000	529240	It worked out a lot better, but all right, this is the way they party in DC.
529240	532560	But I'm going to be MAGFest on January 8th, so we'll be off that week.
532560	534360	So we're not going to be back live until January 15th.
534360	535360	You have to see Tiara while you're there.
535360	536360	Hmm?
536940	537940	You have to see Tiara while you're there.
537940	538940	Is she going to be in MAGFest?
538940	542400	No, but she lives in Arlington.
542400	544980	The thing is, I'm going to be kind of on an island in National Harbor.
544980	546140	It's really separated over there.
546140	547460	She want to come do dinner some night or something.
547460	548460	I'd totally love to see her.
548460	549460	You should tell her that.
549460	550460	Yeah.
550460	552460	I'll have to hit her up on Facebook or something.
552460	556540	Anyway, Tiara hasn't been on the show in like 10 years.
556540	557540	Yeah.
557540	559140	Hands up and chat if you remember Tiara.
559140	561200	No, but she was fabulous.
561200	563320	She ran the Geek Dash life, right?
563320	564320	When that was still going.
564320	565320	Yeah.
565320	566540	She did the Monday Comic Insanity with her.
566540	567540	That other podcast she did.
567540	568540	Monday Comic Insanity.
568540	569540	Is that what it was?
569540	570540	Monday Comic Insanity.
570540	571540	That was a while ago.
571540	572540	Yeah.
572540	573540	That was a while back.
573540	574540	That was a while back.
574540	575540	Anyway.
575540	576540	And I'm planning to start that again.
576540	577540	Wink, wink.
577540	578540	Spike.
578540	579540	Nudge, nudge.
579540	580540	No subtlety here.
580540	581540	We've been talking about it.
581540	582540	All right.
582540	586140	And Spike only does this to...
586140	587140	What's the word?
587140	592760	Spike only does this to spite me because I'm the biggest podcaster, but no, Spike always
592760	595340	has to one up me with all the podcasts he has.
595340	598140	So you know, but Spike's amazing.
598140	601340	So I can't even joke about hating because I just can't.
601340	604340	I have one and I need more.
604340	605340	Don't we all?
605340	606340	Don't we all need more podcasts?
606340	607340	All right.
607340	608340	Good.
608340	612660	SSU 100 Matt is saying, so far the weather is showing it will be in the 50s that weekend.
612660	614020	That's warmer than it is here.
614020	615200	I'll take it.
615200	616980	It's 42 right now.
616980	618300	So the 50s?
618300	619300	Warmer than that.
619300	620300	Love it.
620300	621300	All right.
621300	622300	Anyway.
622840	623840	I'm ready because I've had rum and Stroopwafel.
623840	624840	I know right?
624840	628160	Like I'm already feeling this Stroopwafel.
628160	629160	You're buzzy.
629160	631160	Buzzy beetle with a penguin hat.
631160	632600	This is going to be one of those shows tonight.
632600	634120	I got Rob a penguin hat everybody.
634120	637680	And if you're on Facebook, you can look at it.
637680	639680	So did you put it on Facebook?
639680	640680	I did.
640680	641680	When did you take a picture of me with a hat on?
641680	645680	Like you were talking to Bobby and you're like, Rob's like, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,
645680	646680	bah, bah, bah, bah.
646680	647680	Wait a minute.
647680	648680	That's one nice CD.
648680	650680	She's, she's, she ninja'd a picture of me and didn't tell anybody.
650680	651680	It's a good picture.
652540	653540	It's just kind of.
653540	656540	Was I holding booze in my hand because my mother's on Facebook now.
656540	658540	No, it was before you poured our wine.
658540	659540	All right, good.
659540	660540	All right.
660540	661540	So, uh, let's see.
661540	662540	Where was I?
662540	663540	Oh yes.
663540	666220	No show over the next two weeks because this show will have killed the show effectively
666220	667220	for a few weeks.
667220	668220	No, but we'll be out.
668220	672540	We are looking though, however, we'll try to do like a pre tape thing, but I don't want
672540	673540	to promise anything.
673540	674540	That's all with it.
674540	675540	Tape before you tape.
675540	676540	I don't want to over promise.
676540	679700	I hear you like tape, so I'm going to tape before you tape.
679720	684560	So don't expect us to be back until the 15th, but you may get pleasantly surprised.
684560	685560	Sounds good?
685560	689220	Nobody expects the OLR Inquisition.
689220	690220	But it was weird.
690220	697520	It's weird to be thinking that by the time we're back, the switch will be, I can't say
697520	698680	the switch will be out.
698680	699680	That's not true.
699680	704920	But the switch information, all these mysteries, all the, did Zelda get pushed back or not?
704920	706880	Is the switch coming out of March or not?
706880	710500	All these questions are going to be answered by the time we're back on OLR and new ones
710500	715100	will be posed.
715100	716740	Why does it look like that?
716740	721700	You for a moment, I thought you said posed because your hand was out like you were posing
721700	724880	and I was like, Ooh, Rob, here's a quick, there's a question to pose.
724880	727700	Why isn't OLR on video yet?
727700	729900	Because reasons.
729900	732060	Because dark Sakura doesn't want y'all to see her pretty face.
732060	735320	No, you know what I was thinking though, you know, I was thinking though, um, there's that
735320	738540	software that, um, I think Tiger Claw or somebody showed it to me.
738540	739940	I don't mind my face.
739940	742260	Well, and you have a, you, you're a very pretty lady.
742260	748340	You should, you should, uh, embrace it for, but I was thinking, well, there's those programs
748340	752720	that will like turn you into a furry on your stream so you can actually sit there.
752720	755940	You could be a penguin or something that talks during the show.
755940	756940	We could do that.
756940	757940	I have a kigurumi now.
757940	763620	Do you, so wear that to the show and just have a different, I have a Pikachu kigurumi.
763620	764620	That could be your thing.
764620	766520	I have a different kigurumi every week to the show.
766520	769640	I can't afford that many.
769640	771280	Ask the listeners nicely to donate.
771280	775000	If we move over to Twitch, we can start collecting bits.
775000	782480	I want a red panda kigurumi and I wear the regular size from kigurumi-shop.com.
782480	783960	Tiger Claw says face rig.
783960	785120	Yeah, I think that's the name of it.
785120	786360	I think it is.
786360	789080	So I think that was the name of the software.
789080	796220	So anyway, the video question I will be tackling in 2017, I would expect something's going
796220	801220	to change with that because I'm realizing more and more each day, there's a huge untapped
801220	805340	audience out there on those streaming sites that we really need to get our faces in front
805340	806340	of.
806340	807340	Can we tap them?
807340	808340	So what's that?
808340	809340	Can we tap them?
809340	810340	Can we tap them?
810340	811340	Tap the faces?
811340	812340	Tap all the faces.
812340	814620	So we're going to figure out what to do about that in the coming, coming year.
814620	815620	Anyway.
815620	818060	I need to stop eating these things because they're amazing.
818060	819060	These truffle things?
819060	820060	Uh-huh.
820060	821060	These are really good.
821060	828240	This is the quintessential Christmas thing that shows up because let's say your aunt,
828240	832180	your aunt didn't want to buy you a big gift, but she had to get you something.
832180	834160	So she gets you these truffles.
834160	835160	That's what this gift is.
835160	837160	They're the Ferrero Rocher, isn't it?
837160	838160	Don't talk with your mouth full.
838160	839160	That's rude.
839160	840160	Fuck.
840160	841160	All right.
841160	842160	I can do what I want.
842160	843160	I'm a liberated woman.
843160	844560	Uh, let's talk.
844560	848320	Let's try to get into video games a little bit tonight.
848320	849320	Let's talk a little.
849320	852340	It is, by the way, we do have a, we're going to just run through the show and I have a
852340	853340	break tonight.
853340	857400	We're going to run through the show straight and we'll find, we're going to run through
857400	863260	the show Gailey and then, uh, then we're going to start this off with some gay.
863260	865340	Well, we're not getting into news yet.
865340	866340	I am.
866340	867340	Okay.
867340	870340	I don't care tonight.
870340	872160	Our soccer does what she wants.
872160	876580	She looks the show, roll heads and sees that there's a kickoff topic and how is your gaming
876580	877580	week?
877580	878580	I don't know.
878580	882280	I don't want to, I want to talk about, I want to talk about lesbians are fine.
882280	883280	Fine.
883280	884280	You know what?
884280	885280	I don't care.
885280	886280	Jamie do what you want.
886280	887280	Talk up.
887280	888280	Fine.
888280	889280	Start with this.
889280	890280	I've decided to do the kickoff topic.
890280	891880	Then what's tonight's kickoff topic?
891880	893720	Um, I have no idea.
893720	895840	Holiday gaming.
895840	898000	Did you get any presents?
898000	899000	I did.
899000	901480	You better say yes cause I bought you some.
901480	906280	My, my, my bestest friend in the whole wide world, dark Sakura bought me final fantasy
906280	911160	games on steam because she saw them on my wishlist by old games and so she bought me
911160	915780	the final fantasy 10 and 10 to remaster, which by the way, do you know why that's on my steam
915780	916780	wishlist?
916780	917780	Why?
917780	919820	Because it's the whole mass effect three thing.
919820	921040	What can I do for you?
921040	927520	So now I own the 10 and 10 to remaster on PlayStation three, PlayStation four and thanks
927520	931120	to friend, buddy, pal, Sakura, I own it on PC as well.
931120	934640	So I own the final fantasy and I have it on PlayStation two.
934640	938920	So I think I own final fantasy 10 on as many systems as I own mass effect three.
938920	939920	Yay.
939920	940920	Yay.
940920	943920	I got, I got Alan thingies.
943920	945560	What'd you get Alan?
945560	948040	The tales of symphonia and tales of zestria and undertale.
948040	950120	Oh, he'll like, Oh, you finally got him undertale.
950120	951120	Good.
951120	952120	Maybe he'll finally play that.
952120	953120	Undertale.
953120	954120	Oh, you got Loki undertale.
954120	957320	You bought, I got him some other game, but I need to find something else because I didn't
957320	958320	spend enough money.
958320	962040	You're buying, you're buying everybody, uh, undertale already have it.
962040	963980	I bought, I bought your undertale.
963980	964980	You did.
964980	965980	Fuck.
965980	968660	I'm a dealer and I haven't even finished it yet.
968660	971640	And then I bought you games and I bet you haven't touched him yet.
971640	972900	Do you remember what I bought you?
972900	973900	Disgaea.
973900	975060	I did buy you Disgaea PC.
975060	976480	Orrery in the blind forest.
976480	977480	That's right.
977480	979000	And I bought it on your list too, isn't it?
979000	980820	It is, but I own it on Xbox one.
980820	981820	Okay.
981820	983240	So it's another one of those things where it's like, well, I just kind of wanted it
983240	984240	on PC as well.
984240	985240	Finish Duncan Rompa too.
985240	988820	You, but at some point you really need to play or in the blind forest because or in
988820	992620	the blind forest is like super Metroid, but like cute and sad.
992620	993780	All right, I'll start it.
993780	998460	I wanted to play Disgaea and I'm glad it was on PC finally, but if Ultra Despair Girls
998460	1001580	comes out on PC soon, then I'm going to be all over that.
1001580	1005100	Cause I've been playing on a Vita TV.
1005100	1006180	I love Duncan Rompa.
1006180	1012500	I almost bought a Monokuma, uh, uh, Kigurumi, except I don't wear white things cause I can
1012500	1013500	help it.
1013500	1014500	Okay.
1014500	1015500	Okay.
1015500	1016500	That begs a whole nother question.
1016500	1017500	Question number one.
1017500	1018500	What is with the Kigurumi thing lately?
1018500	1019500	Like this came out of nowhere.
1019500	1020500	It's warm.
1020500	1021500	And comfortable.
1021500	1022500	And uncomfortable.
1023220	1024220	Okay.
1024220	1027020	What is the difference between a Kigurumi and a Snuggie?
1027020	1028020	Cartoon characters.
1028020	1029020	That's it.
1029020	1033620	Because when I was, when I was doing a Snuggie thing on OLR, I got teased relentlessly.
1033620	1034620	There's kind of pants.
1034620	1039380	No, there's no pants on a Snuggie unless you put your legs through the arm holes and then
1039380	1046420	find another Snuggie and then you're like, then you look like the biggest shit ever.
1046420	1051140	You look like a blind quilters creation.
1051140	1052140	That is not the same thing.
1052780	1057180	Kigurumi, first of all, Snuggies are also made out of the worst material ever to exist.
1057180	1058740	They're not, they don't stay cozy.
1058740	1063420	They're soft for like a day and then you wash it and then suddenly it's cardboard.
1063420	1067340	They are made out of that material that like grandma bought at Walmart in the crafting
1067340	1068340	section.
1068340	1074080	Kigurumi are nice and soft and fluffy and fleecy and it feels like you're, it does feel
1074080	1077300	like you're wearing a whole blanket if you get a good one.
1077300	1081400	You know, I have my Pikachu kigurumi, well it's Alan's Pikachu kigurumi, but what's his
1081400	1082400	is mine.
1082400	1083400	Right?
1083400	1084400	So I can steal it.
1084400	1085400	Should I wear that to magfest?
1085400	1086400	Yes.
1086400	1090080	Not just yes, but yes, yes, queen.
1090080	1091880	All right.
1091880	1092880	Let's see.
1092880	1094600	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1094600	1097280	Act Def says the booze got to Jamie hard.
1097280	1098280	Just Jamie?
1098280	1099280	No.
1099280	1101280	I haven't even finished the Stroopwafel and I'm already feeling it.
1101280	1107880	I am only vaguely buzzy right now, but it makes me more talky and, and yes, that's what
1107880	1109320	kigurumi means.
1109320	1114600	Like I said, if this is your first OLR, the other episodes of OLR are not quite this unorganized
1114600	1117360	or random, but it's the holidays.
1117360	1119080	So fuck it.
1119080	1120080	Kombai.
1120080	1122760	Uh, let's see.
1122760	1127220	Rageinator in chat says dark Sakura, wouldn't the worst material be a blend of sandpaper
1127220	1131600	and poison ivy and corn and corn.
1131600	1132600	Corn is awful.
1132600	1133600	Corn is terrible.
1133600	1134960	And corn gives me hives.
1134960	1140760	No, you know what would be, what would be worse if it was like, if it had a, um, uh,
1140760	1147760	a habanero glaze on it, that would make it the worst.
1147760	1148760	The worst.
1148760	1150180	Now I like mayonnaise, Rob.
1150180	1154880	And I will say that if you've accidentally burned yourself, mayonnaise is oddly comfortable.
1154880	1155880	Okay.
1155880	1159160	Why are we talking about wearing mayonnaise?
1159160	1160680	This doesn't make any sense.
1160680	1163600	You dismissed the greatest of all condiments, sir.
1163640	1165520	Uh, you can stop right there.
1165520	1168640	First off, ketchup, far more versatile of a condiment than mayonnaise.
1168640	1170240	Ketchup is nasty as fuck.
1170240	1172280	Yeah, but you can put it on hash browns.
1172280	1177120	The only thing ketchup is good for is meatloaf when you bake it into the meatloaf.
1177120	1178600	And I prefer to use tomato paste.
1178600	1180500	I don't even like ketchup that much.
1180500	1181500	You know what I like?
1181500	1182600	And some people hate this.
1182600	1183600	So trigger warning.
1183600	1184600	You ready?
1184600	1185600	You know what I love?
1185600	1186600	Mustard.
1186600	1192360	I could do French fries and mustard, but the best thing ever is the soft, soft baked pretzel.
1193320	1196280	You are doing your hand like you're squeezing someone's nuts.
1196280	1198480	No, it's a pretzel.
1198480	1200740	It's a pretzel you fucking pervert.
1200740	1202760	It's a pretzel that you dip in mustard.
1202760	1204560	You invited me into your home, sir.
1204560	1205560	I know.
1205560	1206560	And sometimes I ask myself why.
1206560	1211200	I am now two shots of rum, a bottle of Stroopwafel and a glass of wine in.
1211200	1215920	And I've had half the Stroopwafel, which this is so good.
1215920	1216920	Right.
1216920	1217920	I got to find more.
1217920	1218920	I'm going to have more wine.
1218920	1219920	Where does this come from?
1219920	1220920	Do my story for me.
1220920	1221920	Bye.
1222480	1224880	It's got a freaking Dutch name on it.
1224880	1225880	Product of Holland.
1225880	1228040	Oh, this is the product of my people.
1228040	1229680	I married a Dutch guy.
1229680	1231080	I am a Dutch guy.
1231080	1232080	I'm Dutch by marriage.
1232080	1234000	I need to call Cyl and see if she's got Stroopwafel.
1234000	1236240	I had a dream about Cyl.
1236240	1237240	Oh my God.
1237240	1238240	Okay.
1238240	1239240	Okay.
1239240	1243560	Cyl from the Geek Card, formerly Girls Gone Wow.
1243560	1245040	What's her other show she has now?
1245040	1246040	Battle Chat show.
1246040	1247040	Okay.
1247160	1252680	I had a dream that I was working somewhere and my current boss was my boss there, but
1252680	1256800	it was like a different place with like our computers laid out on like folding tables.
1256800	1258600	Excuse me.
1258600	1261000	And Cyl was my desk mate.
1261000	1265640	And we looked at each other and it's like, let's go, let's just go.
1265640	1272320	So we got up and called in sick from our desks and we went out in my little roller skate
1272320	1278160	Fiat and also the town kind of looks like Mobile, but a really weird version of it.
1278160	1283480	Like if Mobile had turned into Silent Hill-ish and we found an Indian buffet, like a hole
1283480	1289760	in the wall Indian buffet and we got, we got our fucking curry on and then the next thing
1289760	1292920	I know I hear, hello, which is the sound.
1292920	1296600	It's Vanellope saying hello from your iPhone, my iPhone.
1296600	1300760	It was my sister saying, uh, you want to talk to dad?
1300760	1301880	I guess.
1301880	1306160	And then I woke up all the way cause, but that, that, that dream could have happened
1306160	1310760	like, and I've never even, I've never even met Cyl, but this just sounds like something
1310760	1314080	that would happen if Cyl and Jamie got together like, Hey, we're podcasting.
1314080	1315080	You know what?
1315080	1316080	Fuck this.
1316080	1317080	Let's go get some curry.
1317080	1318080	It could happen tonight.
1318080	1319080	Fucking curry.
1319080	1320080	Yeah.
1320080	1321080	All right.
1321080	1322080	Anyway, look, before you leave, uh, I want to ask some questions here at the top of the
1322080	1323080	show.
1323080	1328960	So holiday gaming, great memories about holiday gaming presence.
1328960	1330720	And I opened this up to chat as well.
1330720	1333480	So I know I've told this story on the show previously, but I'm gonna tell it again cause
1333480	1334840	I'm a little do it.
1334840	1335840	Okay.
1335840	1338320	So when I got the super Nintendo, right?
1338320	1342000	I got a super Nintendo for Christmas when I was 12, I think.
1342000	1345680	So, um, it's the one thing I really wanted more than anything.
1345680	1349420	And I opened all the presence under the tree and it wasn't there.
1349420	1353220	And so I got sad, but it's like, what is, it's one of those things where it's like,
1353220	1356800	you want to be grateful for the stuff you did get, but you're still kind of, you're
1356800	1360680	still that like stupid spoiled horse, sad, you know, like, but I wanted it.
1360680	1362800	It's so bad, you know, type of thing.
1362800	1366960	So I'm, I'm trying to walk that fine line of not showing that I'm sad because I don't
1366960	1370080	want to be that ungrateful asshole, but I actually deep down inside, I'm sad because
1370080	1377040	I'm a nerd and I wanted the super Nintendo, but then miraculously a Christmas miracle.
1377040	1379400	My sister shows up who's 16 years older than I am.
1379400	1380400	My sister shows up.
1380400	1381400	She's really cool.
1381400	1382400	Have you met my sister?
1382400	1383400	Yes.
1383400	1384400	She's hilarious.
1384400	1385400	Your sister looks like Lori Petty in the tank girl era.
1385400	1386400	Yes, she kind of does.
1386400	1389940	Uh, anyway, so not, not the orange is the new black era.
1389940	1391180	Very important distinction.
1391180	1396460	Um, so, um, my sister shows up and she has just a tiny little envelope and she gives
1396460	1401020	it to me and the envelope says, go check in the closet and you go check in that.
1401020	1402220	There's another envelope in the closet.
1402220	1403260	Go check in the backyard.
1403260	1406420	So it's one of those fucking wild goose chase things that ends under the bed.
1406420	1407660	There's my super Nintendo.
1407660	1408660	Yay.
1408660	1409660	Christmas is saved.
1409660	1412940	So I get the super Nintendo and a super Mario world comes with it, right?
1412940	1419660	And my parents got Dracken on the super Nintendo, which I was like, the fuck is this?
1419700	1420700	I mean, you know, I'm still happy.
1420700	1421700	I got some new.
1421700	1422700	So I don't, I don't give a fuck.
1422700	1423700	I'm just like happy.
1423700	1424700	And I'm like, oh cool.
1424700	1425700	Another game.
1425700	1426700	I've never heard of this game, but whatever.
1426700	1428900	Super Nintendo, you know, I'm really excited.
1428900	1433920	But apparently the guy at Montgomery ward told my parents that it was like the game
1433920	1435180	everybody was buying.
1435180	1438660	Although I think he lied because I don't know anybody else that owned Dracken.
1438660	1443900	But any, but anyway, uh, I did, I didn't appreciate Dracken at first, but like it was one of those
1443900	1448100	games like a year later, I kind of went back and I said, why did I never play this game?
1448100	1449260	And I went back and I played Dracken.
1449260	1451180	It actually is really cool.
1451180	1457340	Um, it was like one of the, it was the, the overworld was in that nineties virtual reality
1457340	1458340	style.
1458340	1460380	Did you ever play Dracken?
1460380	1464220	It's kind of, I know of it, but the battles were all automated.
1464220	1467780	And that was the weird thing about it is that when you would run into a monster, your little
1467780	1470820	army of people would just, and they just start fighting on screen.
1470820	1473040	It was kind of like, you couldn't really control them very well.
1473040	1476300	So that was the weird part of it is it was very like not final fantasy, which is what
1476300	1479020	I was used to, but I came to appreciate that game a lot later.
1479020	1485140	And you know, it was really awesome was dragon's view, which was Dracken 2.
1485140	1489660	And what they did is they took out the auto battling and they put in more like Actraiser
1489660	1491700	style side scrolling things into it.
1491700	1494820	And that is like a really underrated gem on Super Nintendo.
1494820	1496640	Kind of like wonders from East.
1496640	1497640	I think so.
1497640	1499980	I haven't played wonders from East in years, but wonders from East was more, wasn't that
1499980	1503980	the more of the top down Zelda style top down, but when you went into caves or dungeons and
1503980	1506100	things, that's right.
1506100	1507100	That is right.
1507100	1508780	That is right.
1508780	1510340	So yeah.
1510340	1512000	Classic RPGs that I came to love.
1512000	1514580	So that was, that was a holiday gaming memory that I have.
1514580	1518140	I know I told this story just like a month ago on the show, but there was the time that
1518140	1522820	I got $200 for Christmas and I went and bought a PlayStation when my mom was pissed because
1522820	1525460	that's like the thing she didn't want me to have, but it's like, you give me money.
1525460	1526460	What'd you think was going to happen?
1526460	1527460	Yeah.
1527460	1529460	So anyway, uh, what about you?
1529460	1531260	And then I'll open it up to chatters over at live.
1531260	1536500	I got my Nintendo as a kid, my NES, and then my mom would like play it more the fuck than
1536500	1537500	me.
1537500	1541300	And every time she tried to put me on a restriction and hide it, I'd go get it and say, you didn't
1541300	1542300	buy this for me.
1542300	1543300	Daddy bought this for me.
1543300	1544300	So I own it.
1544300	1547340	I was that kid, but you're that adult.
1547340	1548340	Fuck.
1548340	1549340	Yeah.
1549340	1550340	I grew up that way.
1550340	1556300	Um, but the fun thing is that my mom pulls me aside and was like, okay, so I'm going
1556300	1557780	to get your brothers a gaming system.
1557780	1559060	You have to tell me which one to get them.
1559060	1561540	Do I get him a Genesis or super Nintendo?
1561540	1563700	And I was like, get him a super Nintendo.
1563700	1565420	Why better graphics?
1565420	1569900	He's got a better sound processor and dark soccer gets out like this, the whole table
1569900	1576500	that shows the pros and the cons is now you see here where Ninten does what Genesis don't,
1576500	1581300	I got that backwards, but you know, she, she has her whole charts and grass.
1581300	1586340	Plus you have to get them the legend of Zelda, a link to the past, cause that's the game
1586340	1587340	you want.
1587340	1588340	That is the asset.
1588340	1589500	That is the best game.
1589500	1593420	I've seen so many good reviews about it and you've played the first legend of Zelda with
1593420	1594420	me, right?
1594420	1595540	That's how good it was.
1595540	1597540	This was supposed to be going back to that.
1597540	1599980	Oh, that's a good idea.
1599980	1601200	So my mom buys it.
1601200	1606420	My brother's like, and then she got them home alone, which was awful.
1606420	1607420	Super Nintendo.
1607420	1609660	There's a home alone game on super Nintendo or several.
1609660	1610660	I remember one on NES.
1610660	1615020	I don't remember it on super Nintendo and then, and then, and then she got a super scope
1615020	1616020	six.
1616020	1617020	Yes.
1617020	1619300	And of course the game that came with it, I played a lot of blasters now.
1619300	1620300	Here's the kicker.
1620300	1622740	My brothers didn't have a TV in their room.
1622740	1624740	You know who had the TV in her room?
1624740	1625740	Me.
1625740	1626740	How did that work?
1626740	1627740	How did you get that?
1627740	1629740	My dad bought me a TV.
1629740	1633140	Well, he kept trying to bribe me for my love.
1633140	1638540	Somebody spoiled raw and no, he just was guilty and would buy me stuff to cover his guilt.
1638540	1639540	All right.
1639540	1640540	All right.
1640540	1641540	We're not going to go to a dark place.
1641540	1643180	It is fucking Christmas.
1643180	1645560	I can say it cause he admitted it when I was an adult.
1645560	1646560	So whatever.
1646560	1647560	All right.
1647560	1648560	And plus I was actually smart.
1648560	1650860	So anyway, I was like, okay, keep bribing me.
1650860	1651860	I don't care.
1651980	1652980	I'm not a statistic.
1652980	1657940	So anyway, so we hooked it up in my room and of course my brothers would be like, can we
1657940	1658940	play?
1658940	1659940	No.
1659940	1660940	I am almost unbeaten.
1660940	1665860	And I would scream at whatever, what was that thing that was the big round lizard that kept
1665860	1671860	knocking you off the platform and you had to keep either hitting it in the head and
1671860	1672860	it would turn purple.
1672860	1675700	The thing that was like a series of circles, like a centipede, I forgot what it's called,
1675700	1679380	but it was like one of the early levels and it was the only boss in there that was actually
1679380	1685900	hard and I would just yell at it and my brothers would say, they're going, Oh my God, can we
1685900	1687860	watch some more?
1687860	1690540	And then they'd go off to their dads and I was left with the super Nintendo.
1690540	1692940	So I was like, Oh, it's fine.
1692940	1696140	And then when they moved, they took it with them.
1696140	1703780	So but by then, then your strategy backfired, but by then I went to the pawn store and I
1703780	1707420	bought myself one for 30 fucking bucks.
1707420	1713980	And dated a guy who gave me super street fighter two and Kirby's avalanche.
1713980	1716180	You want to prove you love me?
1716180	1717180	Street fighting.
1717180	1718180	Seriously.
1718180	1719180	I was the only way to do it.
1719180	1722580	There was one night that when my brothers were visiting and we stayed up all night trying
1722580	1728040	to see if the 250 fight thing was immortal combat two and it wasn't.
1728040	1729660	And you're still scarred to this day.
1729660	1730660	No pong, no pong.
1730660	1731660	Okay.
1731660	1732660	I'm gonna have more wine.
1732660	1733660	You still have half the glass.
1733660	1735020	I'm getting more wine.
1735020	1737640	Because I've only drink in the Stroopwafel, but I finally finished it.
1737640	1740360	But I want to go to the chatters and here's some of your stories.
1740360	1744640	So vidpower in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says my most memorable gaming present was
1744640	1749740	me and my brother getting our super Nintendo and playing super Mario world all night long.
1749740	1753500	Fifth Dream in chat says my favorite Christmas was dreaming about getting donkey Kong and
1753500	1759860	Ms. Pac-Man on 2,600 on Christmas Eve and waking up and they were under the tree.
1759860	1760860	Let's see.
1760860	1763020	Dark Tetsuya says there was the year I got Chrono Trigger.
1763020	1766900	They hid it in a bigger box so I didn't suspect what it was.
1766900	1770940	Stoppy says getting an NES is my earliest Christmas gift memory.
1770940	1773460	Ragenator says I bought the Super Nintendo on my own.
1773460	1778500	The NES, the one that came with Rob the Robot was the only system that my parents got for
1778500	1783300	me, which I got 29 years ago today.
1783300	1788820	Dungeon Buster saying Draken was an interesting RPG and the Montgomery Ward guy was definitely
1788820	1789820	exaggerating.
1789820	1790820	Well, that's why they wouldn't.
1790820	1791820	Holy shit.
1791820	1792820	I remembered something else.
1792820	1793820	What?
1793820	1799500	When Dan owned a video game store, I forgot he owned a video game store at some point.
1799500	1800500	Yeah, Game On.
1800500	1801820	I created the name for that, you know.
1801820	1802820	Did you really?
1802820	1803820	I did.
1803820	1804820	I didn't know that.
1804820	1807740	So anyway, he gives me this huge box and I'm like, the fuck is this?
1807740	1809740	And I'm like, I thought it was a vacuum cleaner.
1809740	1810740	It was that big.
1810740	1814100	So open it up and open, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, and you know what was inside?
1814100	1816980	Popful mail for the Sega CD.
1816980	1817980	Nice.
1817980	1820340	So it was a gigantic box with a tiny CD in it.
1820340	1821340	Yeah.
1821340	1822340	Perfect.
1822860	1823860	Good on you marrying him.
1823860	1824860	I married well.
1824860	1825860	Let's see.
1825860	1826860	Why?
1826860	1829620	I'm going to chat as well.
1829620	1835980	Tars ZXF is in chat saying, I remember hours of Uncle Fester's quest on Rob's NES.
1835980	1839260	Yes, that was the Christmas I ruined because...
1839260	1841820	Okay, talk about the ruined Christmas.
1841820	1845740	Well, that's because, well, my parents to this day don't know it unless they're listening
1845740	1848140	tonight, which I doubt.
1848140	1853380	But my parents had gone to the store, like Bel Air or something, it was a local grocery
1853380	1854380	store.
1854380	1856260	And the big Bel Air bags were sitting on my mom's bed.
1856260	1860780	Well, me being the nosy kid I was, I went to go see like what candy did she buy because
1860780	1861780	I'm going to take it.
1861780	1866940	So I'm looking in the bags and I noticed in one of the bags was Uncle Fester's quest for
1866940	1867940	the NES.
1867940	1870100	And I'm like, oh shit, I put two and two together.
1870100	1872760	I'm like, wow, you just spoiled one of your Christmas presents.
1872760	1873940	So I didn't say anything about it.
1873940	1876460	So I just, I quickly left the room, went somewhere else.
1876460	1879300	And sure enough, what showed up under the tree that Christmas?
1879300	1880300	Uncle Fester.
1880300	1881300	But do you know what I did?
1881300	1882300	Okay.
1882300	1883300	So how old would I have been at this time?
1883300	1884300	Probably about 11.
1884300	1886140	This probably would have been like the year before the Super Nintendo.
1886140	1893100	So even from a young age, I like to fuck with my mother in a, you know, joking sort of way.
1893100	1897460	So what we did, you know how like you used to go out and rent games?
1897460	1900480	So I remember one time we were at the video store.
1900480	1904620	This was between the time I knew what I was getting and before Christmas, and we were
1904620	1908620	looking at games to rent and I saw Uncle Fester's quest on the shelf and I actually pulled it
1908620	1911100	down and I said, doesn't this game look really good?
1911100	1912300	I think we should rent this one.
1912300	1914940	I should rent this game and I should beat it this weekend.
1914940	1916060	Shouldn't we do that?
1916060	1918700	And my mom was just kind of like doing like that shifty-eyed thing.
1918700	1921820	Like she's just like, she's not even going to say anything because if she says anything,
1921820	1922820	she'll give it away.
1922820	1924700	She's like, I'm going to go look at new releases or something.
1924700	1928320	So I didn't end up renting that game and like you could beat that game in a weekend anyway.
1928320	1931580	But that's my story about how I was a little asshole on Christmas.
1931580	1932580	So there you go.
1932580	1933580	Or at least in the season.
1933580	1937340	That doesn't exactly ruin Christmas, Rob.
1937340	1938340	So yeah.
1938340	1939340	Only for yourself.
1939340	1942340	Uncle Fester's Quest was kind of an underrated NES game.
1942340	1946400	First off, the Addams Family movies were awesome that that game was based off of.
1946400	1952040	And second off, it was just, it was Blaster Master without the blast part.
1952040	1957020	It was just the overworld parts was all that Fester's Quest was.
1957020	1958980	So it was still a fun game, even though it was really, really hard.
1958980	1960240	Was it kooky?
1960960	1963880	It was mysterious and spooky.
1963880	1965560	Tarzy XF is one of my oldest friends.
1965560	1967840	I've known him since I was 12 years old.
1967840	1971220	I've known him for a very, very long time, since junior high school.
1971220	1976560	So I remember going to his house and this wasn't necessarily during the holidays, but
1976560	1981880	just whenever, and we would play Atari 2600 because him and his brother own like at least
1981880	1985160	what felt like at the time, every Atari 2600 game under the sun.
1985200	1990840	So I remember we would stay up till ungodly hours playing adventure Pitfall 2.
1990840	1994800	I think that's where I probably played more Pitfall 2 on the try to 800 than anywhere
1994800	1995800	else.
1995800	1996800	It's probably over there.
1996800	1999940	So do you have friends that you'd go over to their house and just play their games till
1999940	2000940	you beat them?
2000940	2001980	Like all night?
2001980	2007300	We did that with just about every Magnavox Odyssey 2 because my friend had that.
2007300	2009400	And then we had a Cliquavision though.
2009400	2014200	We had a Cliquavision before we had any Atari system at home.
2014200	2018800	RZXF in chat says, God world, we rated Denios regularly for cheap games.
2018800	2021800	Denios is like the flea market out in Roseville.
2021800	2024120	And we still do that today, or at least I do.
2024120	2026760	I'm pretty sure Neil does too.
2026760	2029400	Like I still like to go out there today and look for games.
2029400	2032600	Granted, most of the people there kind of that are selling them kind of know what they're
2032600	2033600	worth.
2033600	2035320	So you don't always really get a good bargain out there.
2035320	2040520	But I got, I got Goonies 2 for like eight bucks last time I was out there.
2040520	2043240	So, and that's a great NES game that I didn't own as a kid.
2043280	2045720	So good times, good times.
2045720	2046720	All right.
2046720	2048720	Anyway, that was a good trip down memory lane.
2048720	2049720	Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
2049720	2051720	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
2051720	2052720	Dark Saga.
2052720	2055160	I haven't really had a lot of chance to play much of anything.
2055160	2056360	Just World of Warcraft.
2056360	2063400	But I am now 30 lingering soul fragments in on my quest to save space demon husband elf
2063400	2066400	boyfriend.
2066400	2070620	In the game story, this fucking weird story.
2070620	2075540	And then I finally bought a chopper.
2075540	2079440	So I have the motorcycle and I have the sands of time.
2079440	2083620	So that's pretty cool.
2083620	2084620	That's really about it.
2084620	2085920	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
2085920	2086920	What did we play?
2086920	2090020	Oh, yeah, I'm playing Pokemon Go.
2090020	2092460	I finally got a Clefairy.
2092460	2093460	So yay.
2093460	2094460	That's it.
2094460	2095460	Me too.
2095460	2096460	Of course.
2096460	2097460	But that's it.
2097460	2098460	Really.
2098460	2101020	I'm still eating.
2101020	2102780	You got to make your gaming week longer.
2102780	2113920	I also played chase Midna all over the house and hiccup and OK, OK, I'm done.
2113920	2115620	Let's see my gaming week.
2115620	2118180	I played a lot of the same stuff as previous weeks.
2118180	2122380	I've been continuing with endgame and Final Fantasy 15, which is going back and doing
2122380	2124720	all the side quests I didn't do in the beginning.
2124720	2127340	So I'm making my way through that a little bit.
2127340	2128700	I've been playing other random stuff.
2128700	2132660	I was playing Crypt of the Necrodancer very randomly last night.
2132660	2136180	Played a little bit of Overwatch, even though I'm still terrible at that game, but it doesn't
2136180	2137740	stop me from being bad.
2137740	2140300	But I did play one new game.
2140300	2144620	So Alan bought me some games in the Steam sale for Christmas, and one of the games he
2144620	2147140	bought me is something that's been sitting on my list for the longest time.
2147140	2150100	It's a game called Grim Dawn is the name of it.
2150100	2154740	And it was on my wish list because it's a Diablo-esque kind of game.
2154740	2158980	And so Click Party, one of those types of games, click all the things and get the loot.
2158980	2160100	So I've been playing that a little bit.
2160100	2163180	I've always spent maybe like an hour in it, but it's pretty good so far, except for the
2163180	2167500	fact that it doesn't really handhold you very much, which I understand.
2167500	2171720	I think it's supposed to be more of a hardcore type of one of those games.
2171720	2176120	There's a lot of like veteran mode and difficult modes and stuff like that.
2176120	2179900	So I don't think the game is really meant to handhold you very much, but I would have
2179900	2185340	just liked a little more explanation to some of the stuff because I guess it's this thing
2185340	2189860	with those games, and this is true of Diablo as well, is that I want to spec my character
2189860	2194180	really well from the get-go, but you know you're going to fuck up your first character
2194180	2197220	really bad, and you're just going to have to play everything over again.
2197220	2200900	And I feel like that's what I'm doing right now with the current character that I'm running.
2200900	2202140	But that's okay.
2202140	2204380	I'm still having fun with it, and that's the important thing.
2204380	2208220	And sometimes you just want to pick skills because they're cool.
2208220	2211540	And I think that's important in a game too, is that you don't necessarily have to min-max everything.
2211540	2213780	You just want to sometimes play things because they're cool.
2213780	2219020	So like my character, I have a shaman, and my move is throwing bugs at people.
2219020	2220220	And that's cool.
2220220	2224300	So I kill people by throwing bugs at them.
2224300	2227540	And I don't even know, like when I try to look up builds for shaman, I don't see that
2227540	2230820	move listed anywhere, so it must not be a very efficient move.
2230820	2232500	But it's fun, and that's what's important.
2232500	2237820	So I'm throwing a lot of bugs at people in Grim Dawn and finding lots of loot to click on.
2237820	2242460	So I think that's really about it.
2242460	2248340	Probably Grim Dawn, and I feel like there's some other game I got into randomly this week,
2248340	2251100	and I can't think of it off the top of my head, and it's probably the alcohol kicking
2251100	2253420	in a little bit that's doing that to me.
2253420	2255600	But I feel like I was playing more classic games as well.
2255600	2256600	You know what it was?
2256600	2257600	What I also played?
2257600	2260180	Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 I played.
2260180	2265340	Which for some reason people give a lot of shit compared to the original and the DX Plus
2265340	2266520	and all that stuff.
2266520	2271720	Which I understand, because DX Plus is like modern day Pac-Man perfection.
2271720	2274720	It's frickin' amazing, and it's really hard to improve on that formula.
2274720	2280700	But I think there's a lot of flashiness, and music is really good in part two, and there's
2280700	2282800	a lot of stuff to really enjoy about too.
2282800	2287960	The one flaw is the part where you have to chase the ghosts around the board when the
2287960	2292200	ghosts are running on rails, and everything amps up at nitro speed, and it can be very
2292200	2294620	difficult to actually chase the ghosts.
2294620	2296120	But it looks really cool when you get them.
2296120	2299560	But that's the only thing, it does throw the rhythm of the game off, and I think that's
2299560	2301640	where a lot of people have a problem with it.
2301640	2303720	But otherwise, I like it.
2303720	2304720	Good stuff.
2304720	2305720	Alright.
2305720	2306720	So that's it for our Game of Weeks.
2306720	2307720	Yes?
2307720	2308720	Yes.
2308720	2309720	Nothing else to mention.
2309720	2310720	For now.
2310720	2311720	Alright.
2311720	2313600	So I will mention, of course, Twitter.
2313600	2314600	Follow us on Twitter.
2314600	2315600	Twitter.com.
2315600	2316600	Slash O-L-R.
2316600	2317600	We're also on Facebook.
2317600	2318600	Facebook.com.
2318600	2319600	Slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2319600	2322400	And as I mentioned earlier in the show, we are here tonight on December 25th doing a
2322400	2328960	live show for fun for y'all, but we will not be here for the next two weeks live, because
2328960	2334120	next week is New Year's, there's other stuff going on, and in two weeks, I will be at MAGFest.
2334120	2337920	So if you're gonna be at MAGFest in the DC area, I highly encourage you to pay attention
2337920	2343120	to our forums over at vognetwork.com, where SSU100Matt has already started a thread to
2343120	2345160	try to organize people.
2345160	2349300	Because I'm not, I don't have like a panel or anything like that, like I'm not, like,
2349300	2350300	nobody cares.
2350300	2351300	You're not doing a thing.
2351300	2352300	No, I'm not doing a thing.
2352300	2356340	So, but I would like to do some type of like unofficial meetup, or just, just kick back
2356340	2358360	and play old school video games.
2358360	2359360	You know what?
2359360	2363420	We need to just, we need to find a place to play the Guardian Legend and play it.
2363420	2364420	And cry.
2364420	2365420	And cry.
2365420	2366420	And cry.
2366420	2371820	Because that's what, the last PAX I ever went to, that's what happened, is that Bobby Blackwolf
2371820	2375180	made the mistake of saying, you know, I've never played the Guardian Legend.
2375180	2376180	Yes.
2376180	2378960	So I said, no, and I said, I looked him right in the eye and I said, we are fucking fixing
2378960	2379960	this right now.
2380320	2383200	And so we went to the classic game room because, you know, it was still early in the day.
2383200	2384920	So a lot of people hadn't opened yet.
2384920	2389000	And I was like, you know, one car, you have to trade your driver's license, one copy of
2389000	2390660	Guardian Legend, please.
2390660	2392000	And we went and I made him play it.
2392000	2393600	And a good time was had by all.
2393600	2394600	Yes.
2394600	2400840	And then I played Kid Icarus as far as I could, which I think I got to like the first dungeon
2400840	2404400	before I had to kind of give up my seat.
2404400	2405520	So we need to do that at MagFest.
2405520	2411040	I want to play some old school NES games because Lord knows I can't play the new ones.
2411040	2415120	We can try to play the new ones, but I'm trying to sing this song and I'm like losing my place.
2415120	2416120	That's all right.
2416120	2417120	Sorry.
2417120	2418120	You've had a little bit to drink.
2418120	2419120	A little?
2419120	2420120	Just a little.
2420120	2421120	Just a little.
2421120	2422120	Here, catch.
2422120	2423120	What are you throwing at me?
2423120	2424120	Balls.
2424120	2425120	More candy.
2425120	2426120	Eat it.
2426120	2427120	I'm into a story now.
2427120	2428120	All right.
2428120	2429120	Yes.
2429120	2430120	Let's get into some news.
2430120	2431120	Well, I was just going to see if our chat had anything to say.
2431120	2432120	Too bad.
2432120	2433120	Our turn.
2433120	2434120	Over at live.vognetwork.com.
2434120	2435120	You know what the story is about?
2435720	2436720	Pay attention.
2437720	2438720	Listen up.
2438720	2441720	If you play Overwatch UK.
2445720	2446720	Okay.
2446720	2448720	I'm sure everyone knows it by now.
2448720	2450720	Tracer's a lesbian.
2450720	2453720	She likes to munch carpet.
2453720	2454720	Jamie.
2454720	2457720	She likes fish tacos.
2457720	2459720	Jamie.
2459720	2461720	You're not supposed to say those things.
2461720	2462720	She's had a bit to drink.
2462720	2464720	I'm not.
2465320	2466320	I don't think so.
2466320	2467320	I think.
2467320	2469320	Well, we live in that culture where everybody gets offended really easy.
2469320	2472320	So you got to watch what you say.
2472320	2478320	Well, yeah, but I do too.
2478320	2481880	My favorite, my favorite thing I've heard from all this is cheers, love the Calvary
2481880	2482880	is queer.
2482880	2485000	That's, that's my favorite thing I've heard from all this.
2485000	2492480	And for the record, absolutely no problem with lesbians or anybody, the people I have
2492480	2495240	a problem with are assholes.
2495240	2496240	Assholes.
2496240	2501240	Well, Reaper's kind of an asshole, so does it balance itself out?
2501240	2502240	Okay.
2502240	2506000	And by the way, didn't we just have a big discussion at the end of last week's show
2506000	2507920	that was nothing but cunt.
2507920	2512240	I think that was after the show was done recording, but yes.
2512240	2513240	Oops.
2513240	2517880	Uh, anyway, uh, I would have mentioned this in chat cause I, I don't, I think this is
2517880	2520600	being said very tongue in cheek, but I'm going to address it anyway.
2520600	2524200	Santa and Chad over at live.vog network.com says, I read the comic.
2524200	2526400	I'm not convinced Tracer is a lesbian.
2526400	2528200	British people kiss each other all the time.
2528200	2529200	Wasn't that on a forum?
2529200	2532000	I think, I think it's tongue in cheek cause I think that was one of those forum posts.
2532000	2534040	Did you see the screenshot of the forum posts?
2534040	2536520	No, but I don't care because...
2536520	2537520	My favorite.
2537520	2543840	I'm a top 500 straight male Overwatch player and all the responses were like, how do you
2543840	2544840	measure that?
2544840	2547840	Cause what the guy meant to say was that he was a top 500 player and happened to be a
2547840	2549040	straight male.
2549200	2553000	But like all the responses were like, how do you prove that you're one of the top 500
2553000	2555440	straight males of the planet earth?
2555440	2556840	How do you, how do you prove that?
2556840	2559040	Is there a, is there a measurement system?
2559040	2561040	A dick litmus test.
2561040	2566280	Nope, no gay on this dick.
2566280	2568520	This dick has never been in a butt.
2568520	2569520	Wow.
2569520	2571200	Jamie cut back on the liquor.
2571200	2572200	Jesus.
2572200	2573200	We're going to get emails tonight.
2573200	2575880	This show is going to end up on tumblr and I'm going to be embarrassed.
2575880	2576880	All right.
2576880	2577880	Um, so let's see.
2577880	2578880	Okay.
2578920	2579920	Again.
2579920	2582920	Oh my God.
2582920	2583920	What?
2583920	2590320	First of all, you see now I'm sober again.
2590320	2591320	Okay.
2591320	2593920	Because it's like a switch so you just turn on and off.
2593920	2594920	It is pretty much.
2594920	2597280	I have to drink some more.
2597280	2604160	First of all, everyone who's listened to the show knows that I will say whatever I want
2604160	2607200	whenever I want for whatever reason I want that are only known to me.
2607200	2608840	That doesn't make it okay.
2608880	2609880	Number two.
2609880	2610880	You're problematic.
2610880	2615440	Number two, everyone who listens to this show knows that I am a very tolerant person that
2615440	2619280	judges nobody unless they have earned my judgment.
2619280	2620280	With bad grammar.
2620280	2623800	With bad grammar or for being a dick.
2623800	2632320	But there are certain things that people need to learn of intent.
2632320	2634280	So now I'm going to go back and talk about the lesbian.
2634280	2637200	Okay, wait, I have to address this comment in chat.
2637200	2641120	Barb, my favorite character from Stranger Things in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com
2641120	2646280	says Xtaphir is a top 500 gay, no T all shade.
2646280	2650920	Barb, although I appreciate you being here, let's be real, Xtaphir is not a top anything.
2650920	2654440	Oh, come on.
2654440	2655720	That comment invited itself.
2655720	2656720	Come on.
2656720	2657720	Come on.
2657720	2659280	By the way, if you want to edit all of that out.
2659280	2661040	I'm not editing anything.
2661040	2662040	Come on.
2662040	2663040	Whatever.
2663040	2665720	Anyway, let's talk about.
2665720	2666720	Let's talk about.
2666720	2667720	Tracer.
2667720	2668720	Yes, she's gay.
2668720	2669720	Oh, yeah.
2669720	2670720	The comment from Santa.
2670720	2671720	The foreign post.
2671720	2672720	Important.
2672720	2674000	But it's wrong.
2674000	2675000	One of the right.
2675000	2676000	No, it's not.
2676000	2677000	It's absolutely right.
2677000	2681600	One of the writers came out and said, Tracer identifies as lesbian.
2681600	2682800	Michael Chu said it.
2682800	2683800	There.
2683800	2684800	Thank you.
2684800	2685800	The senior game designer.
2685800	2686800	That's it.
2686800	2687800	Thank you.
2687800	2688800	He is her God.
2688800	2692240	And he made her gay.
2692240	2694960	She didn't choose to be gay.
2694960	2698040	She was born that way.
2698040	2701080	So fuck off.
2701080	2703080	Top 500 straight males of the world.
2703080	2706320	Top 500 straight.
2706320	2707320	Dick lit.
2707320	2708320	Miss test.
2708320	2709320	It's the Dick.
2709320	2711660	Well, this is okay.
2711660	2718480	So this is a big deal because Tracer is kind of the poster child for Overwatch.
2718480	2721160	I mean, there's a few things you can say about this.
2721160	2724440	I mean, one of my favorite comments I've seen on this is, well, isn't everybody in
2724440	2725440	Overwatch gay?
2725440	2728560	And, you know, that's probably true.
2728560	2734040	But the fact that Tracer is the one that's on the box and Tracer's, you know, was the
2734040	2737200	very first hero in one of the trailers, right?
2737200	2738200	Maybe Winston.
2738200	2739200	Maybe Winston.
2739200	2741760	But she's the poster girl for Overwatch.
2741760	2746720	And you know, Overwatch is the biggest game of 2016 in many different ways.
2746720	2750500	And for them to come out and be like, oh, by the way, Tracer just happens to be gay.
2750500	2756620	You know, I think was, was a great thing for, and people always want to have this fucking
2756620	2759740	argument about, does it matter?
2759740	2760740	You know, it doesn't matter.
2760740	2763900	Why can't she just stay in the closet and all this stuff?
2763900	2764900	No.
2764900	2768580	No one should have to fucking stay in the fucking closet, which is why I am being as
2768580	2771140	fucking crude as I can be.
2771140	2774060	Doesn't everybody like to see themselves a little bit?
2774060	2775620	Why don't you go back to your little closet?
2775620	2778660	Doesn't everybody like to see themselves a little bit in a game somewhere?
2778660	2780420	Do straight people have a basement maybe?
2781340	2785220	There are top 500 straights in almost every single video game.
2785220	2792520	So let the lesbian gamers out there, and believe me, there are some lesbian gamers out there
2792520	2793520	that will kick your ass.
2793520	2795720	Hey, we finally have ace representation.
2795720	2796720	Do we?
2796720	2797720	Maya.
2797720	2801060	In, um, uh, uh, Borderlands.
2801060	2802460	Oh, that's right.
2802460	2804220	I asked at gamer X.
2804220	2805220	Yeah.
2805220	2806220	And her God said.
2806220	2807220	Yeah.
2807220	2811680	Do you talk to, do you talk to gods often in your thoughts, um, created these worlds
2811680	2812680	there.
2812680	2813680	Let me finish my thought.
2813680	2814680	Well, fine.
2814680	2817700	My thought was seeing yourself reflected in video games.
2817700	2818700	Yes.
2818700	2819700	That's important.
2819700	2823860	Why do people have the whole create your character mode and why do people razz those, create
2823860	2827940	your character modes when it's missing obvious things like, you know, the ability to change
2827940	2831980	your skin color and things like that, because people want to be able to see themselves in
2831980	2832980	games.
2832980	2837980	Representation of sexuality is, is really a great thing.
2837980	2842100	Representation of different skin colors, men and women and gender and all that stuff.
2842100	2843420	These are all great things.
2843420	2848380	And again, and I can't stress this enough because people always think like, Oh my God,
2848380	2852580	they're taking over and there's not going to be any top 500 straight characters left.
2852580	2854980	And that's not the case.
2854980	2857980	Nobody is saying to take away characters.
2857980	2860340	You don't need to take away anything.
2860340	2864500	Just add a little bit of rainbow.
2864500	2867580	I like this one person's quote on Twitter.
2867580	2869060	I love Tracer's new voice line.
2869060	2871860	I am gay and playing as me makes you gay.
2871860	2875860	And how her alt sends an email to your dad that reads, dad I'm gay.
2875860	2880260	Well, and that's the other side of it is that, you know, if there's that whole perception
2880260	2883820	of, well, she doesn't need to announce to the world that she's gay or whatever, well
2883820	2888180	then by that same fucking matter, then by that same token, playing as her in the game
2888180	2894020	means nothing except you're a cheap motherfucker because I always get killed by fucking Tracer.
2894020	2897860	I can't stand her, but has nothing to do with the fact that she's a lesbian that just has
2897860	2900700	everything to do with the fact that she's cheap.
2900700	2906820	Well, and I mean, it's just, and this is the thing.
2906820	2913180	It's everyone needs to have something that's going to tie them to the world of the game.
2913180	2917740	Something that makes the characters live for them.
2917740	2918740	You know?
2918740	2920420	True, true facts.
2920420	2923860	The first time I played Mass Effect, I wasn't into it.
2923860	2927940	Like somebody, it must have been somebody driving the Mako in Mass Effect 1 or something
2927940	2931340	where I, you know, one of the like not so great parts of Mass Effect 1 where I must
2931340	2933740	have been like, eh, I'm not really into this game.
2933740	2939260	It wasn't until somebody said, did you know that in this game you can have like a male
2939260	2945260	male relationship and it's really well done and it's thought out and it's not like ridiculous
2945260	2948700	or you know, like totally like token or whatever.
2948700	2952340	It's just, it's something that feels very natural to the plot and all that stuff.
2952340	2956500	That made me interested in playing the game because yes, I wanted to see that represented
2956500	2957500	in a game somewhere.
2957500	2964020	I wanted to, I was like, wow, that's a story that I would like to hear more about, right?
2964020	2970380	So that got me to play Mass Effect and now I love Mass Effect and that's one of many
2970380	2972660	reasons why I love Mass Effect.
2972660	2976820	Mass Effect is a great fucking game for a variety of reasons.
2976820	2978420	That is one of them.
2978420	2987900	I also think that apart from just the representation factor, you know, the one thing that is going
2987900	2993100	to attract a person to the game or make someone go, Hey, this game has someone like me in
2993100	3004380	it is the fact that it's also acknowledgement that it's not abnormal, that it shouldn't
3004380	3005380	matter.
3005380	3009900	Now, Tiger Claw on Chat says, let's not forget, Tracer was the one who was in the middle of
3009900	3012020	controversy because of her butt pose.
3012020	3015620	You remember that a few weeks or a few weeks ago, a few months ago, it was actually before
3015620	3020340	Overwatch was out, but there was a pose that somebody had made a post and kind of complained
3020340	3021420	about it a little bit.
3021420	3024420	And Blizzard said, you know, we were kind of thinking about changing it anyway.
3024420	3025980	And they changed it back.
3025980	3031100	And then everybody, all of a sudden, everybody piped up out of, out of, out of all the different
3031100	3034660	ends of Twitter and stuff saying, you shouldn't change it.
3034660	3038020	Stick to your vision, stick to what you had planned and all this stuff.
3038020	3040900	And now Tracer comes out of the closet and it's like, well, maybe you shouldn't stick
3040900	3041900	to your vision.
3041900	3042900	And you know what?
3042900	3048260	People are going to be offended.
3048260	3049260	It happens.
3049260	3053780	And the things that you shouldn't, that you should take to heart for offense are when
3053780	3058260	people truly intend to be fucking offensive.
3058260	3061380	When people are trying to repress your rights.
3061380	3067500	When people are trying to tear down the programs that help us and keep us alive.
3067500	3071980	When people are trying to ruin the world that we live in and make it only safe for people
3071980	3074420	who fit one mold.
3074420	3078740	Those are the people that you should offend the ever living fuck out of.
3078740	3081860	So do it.
3081860	3083140	And you know what?
3083140	3090740	If they get offended by a lady in a fictional environment who loves other women and likes
3090740	3097460	to smooch and do other things in bed, put it, rub it in their fucking face.
3097460	3100900	Blizzard is never going to go into detail about that because it's, it's just not important.
3100900	3103380	But I can picture it and it's kind of hot.
3103380	3108820	So anyway, you take that and you rub it in their fucking face.
3108820	3110660	This is your reality.
3110660	3116040	You cannot live in your little closed bubble, closets don't exist dream.
3116040	3117340	Fuck you.
3117340	3120860	That's how I feel.
3120860	3121860	I was going to say something.
3121860	3123580	I was just going to rile you up even more.
3123580	3124580	Do it.
3124580	3125580	Rile me.
3125580	3126580	Here, I'll drink some more.
3126580	3133900	But Dark Sakura, in my America now, I get to build a wall and I get to wall off those
3133900	3136180	images.
3136180	3138620	And make Mexico pay for it.
3138620	3139620	Moving on.
3139620	3146620	Havoc978 in chat says, if only people cared about the payload this much, amen.
3146620	3149060	Amen.
3149060	3150060	You know what?
3150060	3151060	Two glasses in.
3151060	3154400	All right, let's move on to another story.
3154400	3158640	Let's move on to something else that talks about, hey, the Legend of Zelda, Link to the
3158640	3159640	Past.
3159640	3160640	That's right.
3160640	3161640	This hot new game.
3161640	3164440	This hot new game that all the kids are getting under the trees this Christmas.
3164440	3166220	All right.
3166220	3167940	So here's the thing.
3167940	3172880	This I don't know why this is making the rounds this week on the blogs, but it is because
3172880	3177840	it comes from an interview from January 1992.
3177840	3183160	But people unearth things and it is kind of cool and it's worth talking about because
3183160	3185520	this is a legendary game.
3185520	3186520	So here it is.
3186520	3192600	This was a Famicom Soushin interview with Shigeru Miyamoto.
3192600	3197000	And they were talking about what other ideas for Link to the Past had to be cut because
3197000	3199080	of the eight megabyte limitation.
3199080	3200760	Miyamoto says a lot.
3200760	3203260	You can't just throw every good idea you have in a game.
3203260	3206720	The idea has to connect up with something else in the game and there needs to be consistency
3206720	3207720	between the ideas.
3207720	3209920	There was a ton more we wanted to do.
3209920	3213640	And when pressed, Miyamoto said, one idea was with the lantern.
3213640	3218400	If you used it on a grassy area, it would cause a huge brush fire.
3218400	3223440	If you cut a little circle of grass around you, you could safely stand there in the middle
3223440	3224440	of it.
3224440	3225600	That sounds kind of cool.
3225600	3231060	I'm all for starting fire in games.
3231060	3236120	And then when pressed further, anything else, Miyamoto said in swamp areas, you could use
3236120	3238240	a shovel to dig a ditch.
3238240	3243480	And then if you bombed the swamp breakwater, it would cause the water to rush in the hole
3243480	3244600	you dug.
3244600	3246720	The idea was actually half complete.
3246720	3250360	If we had another six months, we might have been able to make it a reality.
3250360	3256720	So kind of neat, and I just like these sorts of tidbits because I like to hear about what
3256720	3258200	really went into these games.
3258200	3262920	This reminds me of a story a couple weeks ago about how Super Mario Brothers 3 was originally,
3262920	3264440	they were designing it as overhead.
3264440	3266000	You remember we talked about that on the show?
3266000	3270920	So I like these little tidbits about old games and hearing how things transformed and things
3270920	3273580	that had to get cut and all that stuff.
3273580	3278220	It's the type of stories I'd like to hear also about Final Fantasy 15, because we all
3278220	3281120	know stuff got cut in Final Fantasy 15.
3281120	3284840	So I'd kind of like to hear about some of the decisions they made and why they did it.
3284840	3289240	So anyway, just kind of a cool, like, this is something that could have been, but it's
3289240	3291880	not type of story.
3291880	3292880	That's it.
3292880	3293880	Dr. Sakura.
3294320	3298040	Valve owes some money.
3298040	3299040	Money.
3299040	3301400	Valve owes us any game starting with the number three.
3301400	3309840	Valve owes us a freaking Half-Life 3 already, but they have actually been found guilty by
3309840	3316680	the Australian Federal Court by the, well, at the Australian Federal, I can't make words
3316680	3322280	happen, Rob, by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC.
3322280	3326600	They were guilty of violating consumer law in Australia.
3326600	3338400	And so now they, last month, they said that Valve's fine for the breaches should reach
3338400	3344280	around three million Australian dollars, which is about two point fifteen million United
3344280	3346000	States dollars.
3346000	3350680	And the judge basically is like, yep, we think that's right.
3350680	3359640	So now they have, have to make that payment for it.
3359640	3367400	So it's like, basically what happened is that if a game or a product is deemed effective,
3367400	3373720	defective or not acceptable quality or unfit, then the consumer is entitled a refund.
3373720	3380380	And so there were many refunds that Valve did not allow through or did not process.
3380380	3382980	And so that's where all that money has to go.
3382980	3391760	So and then along with the fine, Valve actually has to put up a link on the Steam homepage
3391760	3395580	in a typeface of at least 14 points, times New Roman.
3395580	3398420	Who the fuck uses time to New Roman?
3398420	3399420	Seriously?
3399420	3400420	Romans.
3400420	3401420	They're dead.
3401420	3402420	New ones.
3402420	3403420	Oh, New Romans.
3403420	3404420	Okay.
3404420	3406460	You know, you know where that font came from?
3406460	3407460	Rome?
3407460	3408940	Supposed to be for the New York Times.
3408940	3409940	Oh, okay.
3410500	3411500	Anyway.
3411500	3412500	True story.
3412500	3417100	So anyway, they have to make that visible to anyone who opens that page within Australia.
3417100	3429220	So but Valve hasn't been sentenced to any kind of death, booting, as they call it.
3429220	3432780	So whatever.
3432780	3438660	They are, but they have implemented a refund policy in August as of last year.
3438660	3441100	You know, we were just talking about this a little bit last week on the show.
3441100	3445860	The whole backlash against Valve, which I guess, I don't know if this really plays into
3445860	3450940	that or not, but it's just very interesting to see how like Steam kind of, and especially
3450940	3454180	with the sale just having happened on Steam, I mean, a lot of people are participating
3454180	3459560	and involved, but I don't know, it hasn't felt like the big event that it used to.
3459560	3462560	And I don't know if that's because of Humble Bundle or Good Old Games, the fact that there's
3462560	3466860	other options now, or just the fact that, you know, I think people are starting to get
3466860	3472820	a little irritated that Valve will not make a Half-Life 3, a Portal 3, a Left 4 Dead 3,
3472820	3477260	or really anything at all that isn't Dota.
3477260	3481580	Or the Vive stuff, which, you know, funny because now I'm naming all these things that
3481580	3487340	are out there, but if you can't afford a Vive, then that stuff might as well not exist.
3487340	3493740	And Dota is a very kind of specific sort of game that not everybody's into, so, you know,
3493740	3500180	I just feel like Valve really needs to, needs to come back and do a game that everybody
3500180	3501180	can get into.
3501180	3502180	You know what I mean?
3502180	3503180	Yes.
3503180	3508100	Well, Valve has until February 20th to appeal.
3508100	3509100	Whether or not they will.
3509100	3510100	Which they probably will.
3510100	3511100	Everybody appeals.
3511100	3512100	Yeah.
3512100	3515340	I will appeal to you for crackers if you have any.
3515340	3516340	I don't, I don't know if we do it.
3516340	3517340	You'll have to bug Allen.
3517340	3518340	Why don't you have crackers?
3518340	3519340	We might.
3519340	3520340	There might be like-
3520340	3521340	You knew this was happening.
3521340	3522340	There might, go raid that little-
3522340	3523340	Waffles!
3523940	3524940	Stoop waffle?
3524940	3525940	No I don't.
3525940	3526940	Because that shit was good.
3526940	3527940	Alright.
3527940	3528940	I don't want to drink the rest of the wine bottle by myself.
3528940	3535020	VXJ6V in chat says, everybody didn't get into Half Life, nor Portal, not Team Fortress 2,
3535020	3537060	nor are they all into Dota 2 either.
3537060	3540060	Was there nothing in the orange box?
3540060	3542560	Nothing in the orange box to satiate you?
3542560	3547220	But if, okay, maybe if that's the case though, then you're not also chomping at the bit for
3547220	3549140	Valve to make something new.
3549140	3552820	I mean, when was the last time Valve put out a console game?
3552820	3556220	When was the last time Valve put out a console game?
3556220	3557220	Portal 2, right?
3557220	3558220	Yeah.
3558220	3560220	Now how long ago was that?
3560220	3561220	A while.
3561220	3562220	A while.
3562220	3563220	So, just saying.
3563220	3564220	It's been a little while.
3564220	3566220	It was first Xbox, wasn't it?
3566220	3567580	Uh, Portal?
3567580	3568580	Portal 1 was-
3568580	3569580	The orange box.
3569580	3570580	Oh, the orange box was first Xbox.
3570580	3571580	Yeah.
3571580	3572580	Well, and PC.
3572580	3573580	And then Portal 2.
3573580	3574580	PC.
3574580	3575580	Obviously PC.
3575580	3576580	But, yeah.
3576580	3577580	Alright, anyway.
3577580	3578580	Uh, let's see.
3579020	3580020	Let's talk about.
3580020	3583540	I want to talk about streaming software and websites and stuff.
3583540	3586100	Because, you know, all the talk is always about Twitch.
3586100	3587580	But there's other stuff out there.
3587580	3589060	You know, YouTube gaming.
3589060	3592020	And this other new site kind of caught my eye this week.
3592020	3593940	Which I thought was interesting.
3593940	3596740	And I'm curious what you guys think about this website.
3596740	3598140	I want to talk about Beam.
3598140	3600580	Have you heard about Beam?
3600580	3605020	Beam is a newer video game streaming website.
3605020	3607820	It's beam.pro is where you can find it.
3608060	3612060	And Beam was bought by Microsoft not that long ago.
3612060	3614700	So Beam is now a Microsoft property.
3614700	3617660	And Beam did these big updates today.
3617660	3622940	Or, not today, but in this past week, saying that they are readying their live streaming
3622940	3625460	service for Xbox and Windows.
3625460	3627940	And I guess that went out in beta.
3627940	3629780	Although I haven't seen it yet.
3629780	3635600	I've just seen what's on their website and on their iPhone app and all that stuff.
3635640	3640200	But Beam's big thing, if you don't know, and this is why I'm kind of into it.
3640200	3642200	They're really big on interaction.
3642200	3645120	They want to really be about interactive streams.
3645120	3651600	So they're testing this low latency thing where, you know, just within seconds, not
3651600	3655920	even seconds, what you see on the video, you can respond to and chat and you can have more
3655920	3656920	of a real...
3656920	3659560	It's kind of like the way Twitch used to be back when it first started until they got
3659560	3660560	really big.
3660560	3662680	But then, as I understand it, Twitch kind of...
3662680	3665800	You can enable a mode now on Twitch where you can kind of go back to that.
3665800	3668840	But I think there is still a latency of probably like 10 seconds.
3668840	3671580	Beam, I think, is trying to get it lower than that.
3671580	3677800	And then, as you watch these streams on Beam, you get little credits, like little lightning
3677800	3681360	bolt credits, that you can then use to interact with streams.
3681360	3685760	You can play little sound clips, or I don't know what all goes into it.
3685760	3687520	But you can do these little interactions.
3687520	3693120	But then, as I understand it, they're also encouraging game designers to design games
3693120	3696400	where people could make things spawn in the game.
3696400	3700620	And you've seen a little bit of this already with stuff, and again, over on Twitch, with
3700620	3705680	things like the Jackbox Party Pack, what, Tomb Raider had some of this as well, right?
3705680	3711240	So you're seeing this already, but Beam really wants to kind of focus that and play it out
3711240	3713000	in a very low latency environment.
3713000	3714000	So I just...
3714000	3715000	I think it's interesting.
3715000	3717280	The competition stuff is very interesting.
3717280	3722280	Beam is also talking about that the max bitrate is now 10 megabits per second and supports
3722280	3729720	60 frames a second rendering speed up to 2,560 by 1440 resolution.
3729720	3731360	So whoo.
3731360	3736040	Also a new homepage and all this other stuff, HTML5 player that eliminates Flash, better
3736040	3738280	video on demand playback, and all this stuff.
3738280	3743040	They are saying that Xbox One and Windows support is coming sometime in the winter,
3743040	3747160	and there will be new hybrid applications to mobile in 2017.
3747160	3755520	Beam right now, 100,000 monthly users as of August, Twitch, 100 million.
3755520	3759240	So there's quite a few more people on Twitch than Beam.
3759240	3762180	But the competition stuff is always interesting.
3762180	3763960	It's interesting to see what they might come up with.
3763960	3764960	I've used the website.
3764960	3769200	I actually signed up for an account over there just to check it out and poke around.
3769200	3770680	It's a slick interface.
3770680	3771680	It's very flashy.
3771680	3773360	I like the interface over there.
3773360	3776520	And I do like the gamification of the streams.
3776520	3780240	I do think that's a neat concept, and I really want to see what they do with that more.
3780240	3785560	Because I feel like, you know, yeah, Twitch supports it, but Beam feels like it's built
3785560	3786560	around it.
3786560	3787720	So I think that's kind of neat.
3787720	3791320	I want to see what they do with that.
3791320	3793320	Over in chat, everybody in chat is like, BLEAM?
3793320	3794760	Are you talking about BLEAM?
3794760	3798080	No, I'm not talking about a fucking emulator on the Dreamcast.
3798080	3799080	It's something else.
3799080	3802660	BLEAM was an up-rezzing thing.
3802660	3805640	And Tekken 3 for BLEAMcast was pretty cool.
3805640	3806640	So there you go.
3806640	3807640	Let's see.
3807640	3810080	AkumaJP in chat says, bought by Microsoft.
3810080	3812560	Another great software going into the abyss.
3812560	3817480	Look, you knew Microsoft was not going to sit by and watch Amazon run the show.
3817480	3819600	Amazon and Google, I guess, because YouTube gave me.
3819600	3821960	They're not going to sit by and watch those two run the show.
3821960	3826800	And yes, I know there's other things like Hitbox, but I would bet the user numbers of
3826800	3830640	those bases are probably similar to where Beam is at, right?
3830640	3835400	So Dungeon Buster says, the delay is noticeably lower versus Twitch.
3835400	3839200	VXJ6V says, I expect very little to come out of those features on BLEAM.
3839200	3842480	And Kaijuto says, BLEAM sucks too.
3842480	3844600	I'm assuming Kaijuto thinks they all suck.
3844600	3845600	I'm just assuming.
3845600	3846600	I don't know.
3846600	3848800	You just can't please some people.
3848800	3854280	Dungeon Buster says, a streamer I used to watch went over to BLEAM because of the community
3854280	3855720	tools alone.
3855720	3861640	See, that's going to be what's interesting, because if BLEAM can woo the big Twitch people
3861640	3864700	over, at least enough of them, that's how you're going to really get competitive.
3864700	3866620	Same thing with YouTube gaming, right?
3866620	3870460	So I'm just, I'm curious to see how this plays out.
3870460	3875800	You know, like back probably what, three years ago before YouTube got into this, I know I
3875800	3880400	sat here on the show and went, why is nobody trying to compete against Twitch?
3880400	3883280	Why does Twitch run this show all by themselves?
3883280	3885000	What is, what's going on here?
3885000	3889820	So I kind of think a lot of these people are showing up late to the party, but if you can
3889820	3896180	woo people over with the right features, hey, MySpace, we all thought that was going
3896180	3900140	to be a thing forever at one point, and LiveJournal, we all thought that was going to be a thing
3900140	3901140	forever.
3901140	3902940	And well, LiveJournal still exists.
3902940	3905460	Not that I'm saying Twitch is going to suffer the same fate.
3905460	3910300	That's not what I'm saying, but I'm just saying none of this stuff is invincible, right?
3910300	3914780	With the right features and all this stuff, it could be a different internet tomorrow.
3914780	3916740	So I'm going to keep my eye on it.
3916740	3917740	I'm just curious.
3917740	3921900	I'm still, I don't know, I'm still into Twitch, but I like what I'm seeing at Beam.
3921900	3926140	I'm just kind of curious what develops when they put out the Xbox app and all this other
3926140	3927140	stuff.
3927140	3928140	They'll grow up.
3928140	3929140	We'll see.
3929140	3931140	We'll see what happens as they, as they age and all of that.
3931140	3932140	Oh.
3932140	3933140	Let's move on.
3933140	3935140	How about something that has nothing to do with aging?
3935140	3936140	Dragon Quest.
3936140	3938220	Well, that series is getting older.
3938220	3939220	Well, yeah.
3939220	3940220	So are we all.
3940220	3946380	Anyway, Dragon Quest is actually going to be involved with the Universal Studios Nintendo
3946380	3948380	thing that's going to happen.
3948380	3952180	They're doing something called Real Battle Attraction that will involve getting weapons,
3952180	3956380	going into dungeons and battling monsters.
3956380	3964780	It's also going to be, I guess, overseen by Ryutaro Ichimura, who is the general producer
3964780	3967320	of the series so that it's authentic.
3967320	3970020	So it'll be great.
3970020	3971580	It'll be fun.
3971580	3973300	And I want to go.
3973300	3975200	So someone send me a ticket right now.
3975200	3977440	So you need kukurumis and a trip to Japan.
3977440	3978440	I need.
3978440	3980280	Oh, I'll just deal with the trip to Japan.
3980280	3982160	And then we can have Orange Lounge video.
3982160	3983160	Yeah.
3983160	3985960	It'll be Orange Lounge Travelo.
3985960	3988520	All right.
3988520	3992720	Moving on to an article about the NES Mini, which obviously has been a big thing this
3992720	3994020	holiday season.
3994020	4000460	The NES Mini has sold in 30 days what the Wii U sold in six months.
4000460	4001460	That's right.
4001460	4009380	The NES Mini has sold 196,000 units were sold.
4009380	4010640	That's just in November.
4010640	4013260	That's not even counting December.
4013260	4016140	And of course, I'm going to make the obvious reference here.
4016140	4019740	Just imagine how many more of these they would have sold if they could have kept these fucking
4019740	4025280	things on shelves and actually made the amount of NES Minis to match the demand for the Wii
4025280	4030500	or to match the demand that was out there, basically.
4030540	4036920	So yeah, by comparison, Nintendo shifted 220,000 of the Wii U's in a six-month period.
4036920	4041480	So a little bit more of the Wii U, but honestly, that's pretty crazy.
4041480	4049880	Also, by the way, 261,000 units of the Mini Famicom sold in Japan in one week.
4049880	4050880	Crazy.
4050880	4052960	Well, we'll see.
4052960	4058880	I'm curious to see what this plays out in in January or in February or so forth.
4058900	4062640	If they're able to keep these things on shelves, if people are still buying them, what it looks
4062640	4063780	like.
4063780	4068800	But it does have me thinking, you know, if Nintendo really wants to sell a lot of these
4068800	4075840	Nintendo Switches, maybe they should consider, maybe not necessarily building in the classic
4075840	4082260	NES Mini, but maybe they should just consider bundling in 30 classic games into the Switch
4082260	4083260	by default.
4083260	4088580	And yes, look, I understand Nintendo can make a lot of money off virtual console games because
4088580	4092400	people are still going to buy Zelda Link to the Past no matter how many times you put
4092400	4093400	it out there.
4093400	4099800	But just imagine if Nintendo would just reach to their catalog, pull out 30 games from the
4099800	4106860	NES and package it all into the Nintendo Switch and say, hey, and it's part of being an early
4106860	4111000	adopter of the Nintendo Switch, you know, kind of like the 3DS Ambassador thing, I guess,
4111000	4115000	even though the Ambassador program was to save that console from flopping.
4115000	4118280	Imagine if they just said with the Nintendo Switch, hey, if you buy this console in the
4118280	4123380	first year, you're going to get 30 games free, classic.
4123380	4128180	I mean, I think the Switch would stand to sell very well, just like the NES Mini, because
4128180	4133680	again, these strong games clearly are pushing the consoles.
4133680	4137960	It's really just blow my mind that the classic NES Mini sold as well as it did.
4137960	4143500	And I think a lot of that is probably, you know, 30 something parents who grew up with
4143500	4148300	these systems buying this stuff so their kids could play the same games they did when
4148300	4149300	they were their age.
4149300	4151480	I think there's a lot of that going on.
4151480	4159120	So actdeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Switch is $300 and for day one buyers
4159120	4161780	you'll get 30 NES classics for virtual console.
4161780	4164380	Honestly, that's the way for Nintendo to do it.
4164380	4169340	Although I wouldn't do day one buyers, because you know they're not, that you know, you know
4169340	4171040	there's going to be stock problems.
4171040	4173660	Don't make the stock problems worse.
4173660	4181860	But maybe like, for the rest of 2017 or something, through holiday 2017, all those people are
4181860	4184340	going to get the classic games.
4184340	4186620	But vidpower in chat brings up another good point.
4186620	4190600	The NES Classic Mini is also attractive due to its price point, right?
4190600	4192160	It's only 60 bucks.
4192160	4195360	You know, the Switch is going to be like 250, $300.
4195360	4199560	But again, I think at least if Nintendo, you know, can throw in some of their back catalog
4199560	4205280	to really sweeten the pot, Nintendo really needs to stop this shit of one to two virtual
4205280	4206280	console releases a week.
4206280	4210600	I mean, they can continue to do that, but they need to launch their system.
4210600	4215440	The Switch ought to fucking launch with 50 virtual console games in the pool.
4215440	4220320	Even if they don't give them away, they ought to have like 50 games waiting to be picked
4220320	4221320	up.
4221320	4225000	Like, don't, and they did this on the Wii U, they waited way too fucking long on the
4225000	4226440	Wii U for this.
4226440	4231860	Switch needs to do this day one virtual console and a lot of games and some free games to
4231860	4233600	sweeten the pot.
4233600	4236480	And if that sells more hardware, then you know what?
4236480	4238360	Nintendo's going to win in the long run.
4238360	4239360	So.
4239360	4240360	Nintendo already wins.
4240360	4241360	In my heart.
4241360	4248200	Tarsi XF in chat says, also appliance-like nature, instant play, no updates.
4248200	4249460	Great point.
4249460	4255140	If this Switch is at home and connected to Wi-Fi, it should download the fucking updates
4255140	4257940	while it's sleeping and then update itself.
4257940	4262100	I mean, the 3DS kind of does this, so we know Nintendo is capable.
4262100	4265580	Except even with the 3DS, you have to wait.
4265580	4268840	Like you have to acknowledge that the update's about to begin and you have to wait.
4268840	4273180	And I'm assuming the reason they do this is because many people put their games right
4273180	4275780	in the middle of the game and then sleep their 3DS.
4275780	4278180	And if it were to do a system upgrade while you're right in the middle of a game, you'd
4278180	4279880	lose your progress in that game.
4279880	4284140	So I can kind of understand that, but I think the Switch should have something set up so
4284140	4288780	that if you're not in the middle of a game or you're on the main menu or something, that
4288780	4290100	it should update automatically.
4290100	4291900	It should just do it.
4291900	4293540	That would be very important.
4293540	4296900	Dark Tetsuya says, I think the Wii U kind of does it too.
4296900	4299540	It does, but not with the software.
4299540	4303740	And I know this because I actually, I forgot to mention this earlier, I played Super Smash
4303740	4307780	Brothers on Wii U for the first time in months this week.
4307780	4312500	And we put in the disc, we were ready to play, and had to wait for it to update.
4312500	4316940	Now granted, it didn't take very long for it to update, thank gosh, but it's no fun
4316940	4320520	to sit there and wait for the fucking thing to update when you're ready to play.
4320520	4324420	So yes, these things should do it while the device is asleep.
4324420	4325420	I like that.
4325420	4326420	Appliance-like nature.
4326420	4328420	That is important.
4328420	4329960	All right.
4329960	4330960	You know what?
4330960	4331960	We need to take a trip back.
4331960	4334580	We need to go back to a time when it was simpler.
4334580	4336700	And there was no updates.
4336700	4340220	You got what you got with your system, and if you didn't like it, too bad.
4340220	4346660	Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,
4346660	4349900	you need to play this game, or I hate you.
4349900	4352140	I hate everybody anyway, Rob.
4352140	4355060	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4355060	4356480	The game is Tapper.
4356480	4360380	I figured it was appropriate for tonight, even though we have drunk no beer at all.
4360380	4361500	No, this is a great choice.
4361500	4362500	I love this.
4362500	4363500	This is one of my favorite classic games, like ever.
4363500	4366500	I'm surprised I haven't done it either, but I'm getting to that point, you know?
4366580	4371180	I'm also very surprised that I recognize the name of this game when it's not Root Beer Tapper,
4371180	4374260	because all I ever played was Root Beer Tapper.
4374260	4376540	I don't think I ever played just Tapper.
4376540	4383380	Well, the difference with the two, I mean, Tapper came out in 1983 by Bally Midway, and
4383380	4388020	basically you play as a bartender, and you have to serve your patrons and collect the
4388020	4390700	empty mugs and your tips.
4390700	4396340	Tapper was called Tapper because it was associated with Budweiser.
4396340	4405300	When the Budweiser branding expired in 1984, they did Root Beer Tapper, and it was developed
4405300	4412220	specifically for arcades because the original version was considered advertising alcohol
4412220	4413220	to minors.
4413220	4416780	Yeah, I always thought that's why they did Root Beer Tapper in the first place.
4416780	4418220	I never realized it was a licensed thing.
4418220	4419780	I mean, I figured the licensing came into play later.
4419860	4423940	It was apparently a licensed thing, but they also did it so that it would be able to be
4423940	4431980	had in more arcades, or as Tapper was supposed to be more like four bars or adult-oriented
4431980	4434420	locations, you know?
4434420	4436060	Like titty bars.
4436060	4448180	I guess, but it was, the patent for it was filed in 1984 covering the game and its variants.
4448380	4455780	Tapper was also ported to the Atari 8-bit machines, the Atari 5200, Atari 2600, BBC
4455780	4464740	Micro, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, and IBM PC and Amstrad CPC.
4464740	4472820	Most of the home versions had a Mountain Dew logo, but had the bartender of the original
4472820	4477840	arcade game instead of the soda jerk from Root Beer Tapper.
4477840	4485440	It had four different bars that you would play in, and so patrons would basically arrive
4485440	4489280	at the end of the bar and then want their drink, and then you have to serve their drink.
4489280	4496000	They slide their mug back, and you refill the mug, and you go serve more booze, or root
4496000	4497000	booze.
4497000	4498000	Root beer.
4498000	4499000	Root beer!
4499000	4500000	Did I say root booze?
4500000	4501000	Oh my god.
4501000	4507680	So anyway, your goal is to push the customer completely off the screen, but if they are
4507680	4511840	not they will stay and drink their drink where they are.
4511840	4516720	And so when the customer finishes the drink, he slides the mug back, and you keep going.
4516720	4522440	So you basically have to keep taking care of all of your customers.
4522440	4529360	You have different settings, you have the western bar with a couple of cowboys, and
4529360	4534920	you have a sports bar with athletes, a punk bar with punk rockers, and a space bar with
4534920	4535920	aliens.
4535920	4538600	It's like, really.
4538600	4543720	I think I've seen the alien level one time on the 360 version of this game.
4543720	4548040	Well and of course the first version of the game was sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, so they
4548040	4556480	had the Budweiser logo in the back, and the machine was supposed to be sold to bars with
4556480	4558160	the cabinets that looked like bars.
4558160	4564060	And actually, if for anyone who's ever watched John's Arcade, he has a tapper behind him
4564060	4569100	that has the classic side panel art that looks like the old school, or the old timey
4569100	4570100	bartender.
4570100	4575500	You know, like a saloon bartender.
4575500	4580900	And they also, some of the machines were designed to look like bars with brass rail footrests
4580900	4582860	and drink holders.
4582860	4589180	And the first machines had controllers that looked like Budweiser beer tap handles, and
4589180	4595740	then they were replaced by cheaper beer taps with the Budweiser logo on them.
4595740	4606260	The music, though, was created by Ricky Cardo, who was the sound designer, who also was supposed
4606260	4613740	to be a pretty talented musician, and he used a proprietary sound synthesizer that was developed
4613740	4617700	at Marvin Glass and Associates for all the sound effects and music, and it was called
4617700	4626460	the Synclavier 2 Sound Synthesizer, which was pretty much a professional synth that
4626460	4630500	contained a 16-bit computer and synthesizer keyboard in it.
4630500	4637620	So it was pretty crazy, for its time, sound design that was with it.
4637620	4646300	And this one was, instead of creating the music by a molten code, it was actually recorded
4646300	4651180	on the keyboard first and then recorded directly into memory and burned directly into the ROM.
4651180	4662620	So it had different versions of Oh Susanna and Buffalo Gals and The Can Can.
4662620	4666700	So the music in that was fairly unique for its time.
4666700	4673900	It had re-releases for the Midway Arcade Treasures for PlayStation 2, Xbox GameCube, and PC,
4673900	4677100	and Midway Arcade Origins for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4677100	4684100	Rootbeard Tapper was released on Xbox Live Arcade for Xbox 360 in 2007 and has since
4684100	4685660	been delisted.
4685660	4690660	And there's a modern interpretation for mobile devices called Tapper World Tour.
4690660	4693180	They came out in 2011.
4693180	4699220	And the style in the art was almost identical to an earlier game called Domino Man, and
4699220	4702500	then another game after that called Timber.
4702500	4703500	And in fact-
4703500	4704500	I love Timber.
4704500	4712700	The main character for Timber is a rework of the main character in Tapper.
4712700	4716300	This whole era of Bally Midway Arcade games is some of my favorite stuff.
4716300	4717300	Like for real.
4717300	4721980	Like I love those Midway Treasure games that existed that have this and Timber and so like
4721980	4724860	Satan's Hollow and some of the other games that are like around the same time.
4724860	4725860	Yeah.
4725860	4728060	This is a great era of gaming.
4728060	4730940	This game was an inspiration for Plants vs. Zombies.
4730940	4731940	Get out, really?
4731940	4732940	Yeah.
4733380	4736980	To having to defend against a constantly approaching thing in all these lines.
4736980	4739300	Wait, is Tapper the reason we have tower defense games?
4739300	4741340	Because if so, I'm a little upset.
4741340	4742340	I'm just kidding.
4742340	4744540	Well, and Tapper was also featured in Wreck-It Ralph.
4744540	4745540	Yeah.
4745540	4750980	But the world record for Tapper was set on December 5th, 2015 by Kelly Tharp of Louisville,
4750980	4751980	Kentucky.
4751980	4754380	Sorry, Louisville, Kentucky.
4754380	4756300	Apologize to Brad from Pod Culture.
4756300	4757300	Louisville.
4758300	4763260	And it was set in Humboldt, Texas at Totally Amused.
4763260	4768540	And it was a Twin Galaxies Golden Age Showdown event that this happened at.
4768540	4770100	And then, there you go.
4770100	4775500	There is a clone by the way called Brewmaster that came out on the TRS-80 color computer.
4775500	4776500	Cool.
4776500	4777500	Now we're done.
4777500	4780540	There it is, your classic game of the week, Tapper.
4780540	4782740	Or as I remember it, Root Beer Tapper.
4782740	4784220	But tonight, it's Tapper.
4784220	4785780	Yeah, tonight it's Tapper.
4785780	4787620	I would love to have a cabinet of this actually.
4787620	4793740	You know, I kind of got that whole like itch like, I want to get a cabinet in the house.
4793740	4798860	Like even though we totally don't have room for it, and Alan is going to judge me so harshly.
4798860	4802100	But I'm thinking like, you know, if we were to arrange things a little bit and move like
4802100	4805580	this little thing on the cart here, I know this is great, we don't have video, but with
4805580	4810060	this thing on the cart here into the back room, I could put a cabinet right there.
4810060	4813100	And you know, I want to baby pack my machine more than anything.
4813100	4815300	Could have made that happen.
4815340	4820340	I know there was one here locally, and I almost pulled the trigger on it, but it just, it
4820340	4823300	just sometimes sometimes it's not right.
4823300	4824780	I know you were trying to enable me so bad.
4824780	4825780	I almost bought it.
4825780	4828260	Because I told you that we would buy it if you decided you never wanted it again.
4828260	4829260	I know.
4829260	4830620	But then I was like, giving you an outro.
4830620	4832780	But money and responsibility.
4832780	4834900	Fuck money and responsibility.
4834900	4838220	The purpose of money is to spend it.
4838220	4843340	But 401ks and saving and retirement and adulting.
4843340	4844340	It's really hard.
4844380	4847380	I don't have stock options.
4847380	4849300	I'm supposed to get stock options too?
4849300	4850780	I don't like crackers.
4850780	4854260	Alright, let's travel around the world and do some rapid fire news.
4854260	4857580	Again, we're gonna do kind of a shorter, just one segment show tonight.
4857580	4859220	I'm not used to this layout.
4859220	4860220	What?
4860220	4862140	The one, the one half show?
4862140	4866740	No, to Loki's thing and now it's gone.
4866740	4867740	What Loki's thing it's gone?
4867740	4868740	No.
4868740	4869740	What are you talking about over there?
4869740	4870740	You're skipping things.
4870740	4871740	No I'm not.
4871740	4873300	You're skipping to release dates.
4873300	4874300	I'm not doing release dates.
4874300	4875300	I'm doing rapid fire news.
4875300	4876300	Oh, whatever.
4876300	4878300	Can you read Dark Sagra?
4878300	4879300	No!
4879300	4880300	Hey!
4880300	4883140	Let's talk about Final Fantasy XV's latest patch.
4883140	4884140	No.
4884140	4889300	Yes, the 1.03 patch hit this past week which adds New Game Plus to the game.
4889300	4890300	Why?
4890300	4891300	I don't know.
4891300	4892300	New Game Plus.
4892300	4895580	You can go through and play it again at the level you left off at if that's what you want
4895580	4896580	to do.
4896580	4899900	I guess it would make it easier for you to hit level 99 if that's, you know, what you
4899900	4900900	want to do.
4900900	4907300	Anyway, it's a 3.2 gigabyte update and contains that as well as the holiday pack which I did
4907300	4912360	also actually buy this week while I got the season pass so that you got the holiday plus
4912360	4916380	and those are some really helpful items that you get with that to gain AP.
4916380	4919800	So it is a little shitty that it's in a pack that's for sale, although I think one of the
4919800	4922900	items is in the free pack so there's something in that.
4922900	4927800	So anyway, let's see.
4927800	4938840	So the other stuff that's in this patch, outfits, more photo borders and more photos, the ascension
4938840	4942920	grid is all unlocked and all that, oh that's, I'm sorry, that's in New Game Plus.
4942920	4947800	But you get all these little updates in the patch that came out this week.
4947800	4952700	Also, more information on Final Fantasy's 30 year celebration.
4952700	4955880	It will be kicking off on January 31st.
4955880	4959360	That is Final Fantasy VII's 20th anniversary.
4959360	4964200	We may already know the plans for that if we are to believe rumors and things that was
4964200	4969360	talked about a couple weeks ago here on the show, but we'll get the official unveil of
4969360	4972920	the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary plans on January 31st.
4972920	4974120	That's not too far away.
4974120	4978760	Anyway, they'll be holding this unveil at Toho Cinemas in Tokyo.
4978760	4984500	They'll be guests and multiple talks and a raffle is being held for 200 Square Enix members
4984500	4985840	to attend.
4985840	4991260	So if you are in Japan and you want to go, nearby Tokyo, where this is being held, you
4991260	4992260	should check that out.
4992260	4995260	Dar Sakura, how about you for rapid fire news?
4995260	4996260	Stuff.
4996260	5000860	Well, H2 Interactive is bringing out a new Kunio game.
5000860	5008060	We're getting River City Melee Battle Royal Special, which in Japan was downtown Rantou-kyo-
5008060	5014820	I'm gonna mispronounce this- Kyoushin Kyoku Kachinuki Kakuto SP.
5014820	5015820	I can't read.
5015820	5017260	Actually, I can't.
5017260	5018260	I'm blurry.
5018260	5026860	Anyway, so they are- it's actually being localized by the developers for BlazBlue, so we're gonna
5026860	5029420	see a fun little game come out.
5029420	5037780	And in Japan, it's out actually probably today now, December 26th, as it likely is in Japan.
5037780	5040620	And hopefully we'll be getting it out soon, over here in the US.
5040620	5046540	Because if there's a game series my hub's like, it's the Kunio games.
5046540	5049740	And Otada Hikaru, yay!
5049740	5053300	Will be working on some Kingdom Hearts 3 music.
5053300	5054300	Waaaaay!
5054300	5056540	That's exciting.
5056540	5060460	So that means that we will have her for Kingdom Hearts 3, because apparently Square can count
5060460	5062180	to three and beyond.
5062180	5068820	Well, nothing's confirmed until, you know, we get a game on the shelf.
5068820	5069820	Yes.
5069820	5070820	Anyway.
5070820	5075980	VidPower in our chat over at live.vognetware.com, speaking on the Kunio game, saying Kunio games
5075980	5077780	are so underappreciated.
5077780	5078780	I agree with that.
5078780	5084500	I think it'll be nice to have a modern Kunio game that still has that retro flair.
5084500	5085500	Excited about that.
5085500	5086580	Now let's travel around the world.
5086580	5090180	I guess for some reason, it's probably because of liquor, I said travel around the world
5090180	5092660	with rapid fire news, and that's what confused people.
5092660	5097580	So now that we've traveled around the world once, let's do it again and talk about release
5097580	5098580	dates.
5098580	5100580	Are you able to do the US ones, StarSagra?
5100580	5102540	I don't see jack shit coming out.
5102540	5104380	Yeah, probably this week.
5104380	5105780	There probably isn't a lot coming out.
5105780	5109980	I kind of feel like this is going to be the theme this week, is, you know, there's, you
5109980	5113540	know, we just had a major holiday, so I don't think there's a lot coming out.
5113540	5115420	Let's look at Japan, though.
5115820	5122220	Japan, no, there's some cables and peripherals that are out, but I don't see any games that
5122220	5124660	are actually releasing this week.
5124660	5126460	Checking the DS just to be sure.
5126460	5132700	No, there's some new, like, peripherals and bags and cords and things like that, but as
5132700	5137200	far as games go, it's also dry in Japan this week.
5137200	5141060	And honestly, for the next couple weeks into January, probably going to be the same thing.
5141060	5142500	We have one in Europe.
5142500	5143500	One game in Europe.
5143500	5148580	December 31st, Dovetail Gamers Eurofishing for Xbox One.
5148580	5149580	So nothing exciting.
5149580	5151980	Well, hooray for you fishing game fans out there.
5151980	5152980	Oh, good.
5152980	5153980	Feesh!
5153980	5156420	My least favorite thing to do in Final Fantasy XV.
5156420	5161580	The reason why I won't Platinum XV, because it's going to make me fucking fish.
5161580	5163900	All right, how about the mailbag then?
5163900	5165580	Fuck me, there's a bunch in here.
5165580	5166900	Yeah, we got a lot of emails this week.
5166900	5169860	Well, I begged people to email us last week, and I think it happened this week.
5169860	5172220	Well, why did you do a dumb thing like that?
5172220	5176900	Because I love you.
5176900	5180620	Every week you email us, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5180620	5185700	DarkSakura very happily and appreciatively dives in the mailbag and reads her favorite
5185700	5188620	emails here on the show.
5188620	5189620	One from Fifth Dream.
5189620	5191100	I exist or something.
5191100	5192100	Oh, yes.
5192100	5196020	Do you remember last week I said people should email us and just tell us they exist?
5196020	5199300	So you probably have a lot of those emails tonight.
5199300	5200820	Thank you for existing, Fifth Dream.
5200820	5201820	We appreciate you.
5201820	5203900	Next question comes from Jose.
5203900	5206740	Merry Christmas, OLR, or whatever holiday you celebrate.
5206740	5208540	I am glad DarkSakura is feeling well.
5208540	5213820	My question this week is, do you think free-to-play freemium games need to end quick?
5213820	5219380	And do you think those types of games are bittering the perspective on mobile gaming
5219380	5220380	in general?
5220380	5221740	Thanks again for being awesome, guys.
5221740	5223340	Keep on working on your game, Loki.
5223340	5225860	I'll try to write soon if I'm not busy with the holidays.
5225860	5226860	Take care.
5226860	5227860	Signed, Jose.
5227860	5229620	Um, complicated question.
5229940	5231980	I don't think these games are going anywhere.
5231980	5235500	They're, you know, free is too good of a deal to pass up.
5235500	5240020	And I think it's really weaved itself into the mobile marketplace for better or for worse.
5240020	5244620	And there's going to be free games that are engrossing for a very long time for some people.
5244620	5249060	Some people like to play like what I caught Alan playing Bejeweled Stars or whatever that
5249060	5250060	is that's out.
5250060	5251060	I caught him playing that.
5251060	5252940	I know DarkSakura plays some of these games.
5252940	5254820	I play Ingress and Pokemon Go.
5254820	5258140	Those are free-to-play games, essentially.
5258140	5259900	So I think there is a marketplace for them.
5259900	5264460	I mean, I've played a lot of those games that I just named, Ingress and Pokemon Go, and
5264460	5268580	those are just two of several mobile games I've tried over the years that were free-to-play
5268580	5271940	that weren't necessarily bad.
5271940	5274660	Did it skew things too much on the mobile platform?
5274660	5275660	Maybe.
5275660	5278420	Especially when we talk about something like Super Mario Run.
5278420	5281500	But it's part of the reason why I said, you know what, Super Mario Run, they should have
5281500	5283780	just charged $10 in the store.
5283780	5285620	I understand why they didn't do that.
5285620	5288780	They wouldn't be able to brag about 40 million downloads or whatever they're saying this
5288780	5292620	week if they hadn't set that price as free in the store.
5292620	5298540	But I think it sets some people's expectations in a weird place.
5298540	5301320	And I kind of think they should have just charged $10 out the gate.
5301320	5303820	But I don't think free-to-play games is going to go anywhere, and I don't think free-to-play
5303820	5306180	means necessarily bad.
5306180	5311060	It just depends on how much are you going to nickel and dime your audience.
5311060	5312060	You know, a game...
5312060	5313060	Go ahead.
5313060	5316700	The crap thing about it, though, is that it prevents people who have a family sharing
5316700	5320620	plan to use said family sharing.
5320620	5322820	Yeah.
5322820	5325880	And I know that's kind of a thing about Super Mario Run as well.
5325880	5332260	But a game like Ingress, for example, you can play very well and very thoroughly without
5332260	5333980	ever spending a dime.
5333980	5334980	You know what I mean?
5334980	5335980	I don't think I did.
5335980	5338500	You don't think you ever did spend a dime, or you don't think you played well?
5338500	5339500	It was funny.
5339500	5340500	Come on.
5340500	5341500	It was funny.
5341500	5342500	Drop the phone.
5342940	5344940	I'm trying to catch this Nidoran.
5344940	5347100	Oh, there's always a million Nidorans here.
5347100	5349660	But I need a couple more to get a Nidoqueen.
5349660	5354140	I think our Pikachu spawns here got replaced with stupid Nidorans, so that's all I ever
5354140	5355140	see here at the house anymore.
5355140	5356140	I don't mind right now.
5356140	5358820	Alright, well, but we gotta get to the next email, so...
5358820	5359820	We'll find...
5359820	5360820	Put your balls down, DarkSaka.
5360820	5361820	I'll read the next email.
5361820	5362820	I just fed you my balls.
5362820	5363820	Oh, sorry.
5363820	5365820	Wrong balls.
5365820	5368420	Anyway, the next email comes from Robert M.
5368420	5378300	Felizan Cristinacón, sorry, and it is Esperanto, so thank you, because I had asked for some
5378300	5379300	Esperanto.
5379300	5382340	Oh, look at you with your Esperanto.
5382340	5385220	Just wondering about a prominent iOS app.
5385220	5390220	Super Mario Run has its unlock through an in-app purchase, but I can't find a restore
5390220	5391740	purchases button.
5391740	5396580	If heavens forbid my iPod were to be reformatted again, or I want to download my game on iPad
5396580	5403380	or iPhone on my Apple ID, would I need to have set up a My Nintendo account specifically
5403380	5404380	for the unlock?
5404380	5408540	I haven't really contacted any developer or forum about this yet.
5408540	5413100	I'm generally enjoying the game, but more Wi-Fi time is going to other apps, admittedly,
5413100	5420200	Robert M. I will tell you that Hubby tried to...
5420200	5427600	He did link his My Nintendo account to it, and as it turned out, it did have a restore
5427600	5435680	purchase on there, but I don't think it restored his progress.
5435680	5436680	It's just the purchase.
5436680	5438400	Yeah, just the purchase.
5438400	5443320	You have to have the Nintendo account linked, and by the way, it tells you that in the very
5443320	5444320	beginning.
5444320	5447540	You might have clicked through it, as a lot of people do in the very opening screens,
5447540	5452020	but I did think that was curious, that it actually said, if you want to be able to restore
5452020	5454840	your purchase later, you need to have this on a My Nintendo account.
5454840	5456540	They did the same thing with Miitomo, actually.
5456540	5462560	So now my question is, and I don't know the answer to this, I'm sorry, can Robert M. was
5462560	5463560	the emailer, right?
5463560	5464560	Yeah.
5464560	5465560	Can Robert M. do this after the fact?
5465560	5468740	Now that he's bought the game, can he now assign a My Nintendo to it?
5468740	5472720	Will it work, or now is he screwed because he bought the game without that association?
5472720	5475700	That I don't know, sir, I'm sorry to say.
5475700	5482600	So I would try associating it with a My Nintendo account at this point, just to save yourself
5482600	5484780	if something does happen to your phone.
5484780	5485880	Let's hope not.
5485880	5491260	But hopefully, cross fingers, knock on wood, by the time your phone breaks, you won't care
5491260	5495980	if you lose the game, hopefully.
5495980	5496980	That's it.
5496980	5497980	Okay.
5497980	5500180	Hey gang, first a song, and there's a link.
5500180	5502140	It's Loss of Me from Final Fantasy IX.
5502140	5504860	We're not going to play it, sorry.
5504860	5509120	In the hype surrounding Final Fantasy XV, you guys compared it to other mainline Final
5509120	5510120	Fantasy titles.
5510120	5513660	I mentioned all of them, except for one of the titles I hold most dear, Final Fantasy
5513660	5518820	IX, which for me is my second place game in the series, the first being X.
5518820	5524060	It is an amazing game, not only for the music and battles, but for the story the game tells,
5524060	5526500	and the antagonists that conspire against you.
5526500	5533100	No, really, I've never been more upset at a villain in any other game, in any game than
5533100	5537140	the horrific acts committed by Kuja and those that follow him.
5537140	5541740	The story does a crazy good job building up hope and affection toward the characters of
5541740	5544980	the world before you watch their tales quickly become tragic.
5544980	5549340	It's not all doom and gloom as you watch the main cast come into their roles quite nicely.
5549340	5553060	Even Steiner, who I couldn't stand at the start of the game, really grew on me.
5553060	5554060	Thoughts?
5554060	5555180	Sincerely, Osfer.
5555180	5557460	I appreciate Final Fantasy IX.
5557460	5562960	I wouldn't say I love it the way I love IV and VI and some of the other games.
5562960	5568080	But again, and I even said this last week, the only Final Fantasy game I can't play and
5568080	5572040	I don't like playing is VIII, and I know that's a controversial statement and some of you
5572040	5576800	hate me for it, but sit on that and deal with it for a minute, because I just cannot stand
5576800	5579320	that junction system and the draw and all that stuff.
5579320	5581500	Otherwise, the story in VIII is even fine.
5581500	5583240	I'll watch somebody else play VIII maybe.
5583240	5584240	There's a PS.
5584240	5585240	Oh, what's that?
5585240	5586240	Rob, please finish Undertale.
5586240	5588320	I really want to hear your thoughts on the game.
5588320	5589320	Frown.
5589320	5590320	I'll do my...
5590320	5592480	There's so many games to play, so many.
5592480	5593480	I contributed.
5593480	5594480	So many.
5594480	5595480	Yeah, I know you did.
5595480	5597920	But anyway, as far as Final Fantasy IX goes, it's a good game.
5597920	5603440	And you know why IX was important is because people were a little turned off by the sci-fi-ness
5603440	5605720	of VII and even VIII a little bit.
5605720	5609200	So IX, I remember when it came out, was kind of like a return to form for Final Fantasy.
5609200	5613360	Like you had a black mage who looked like the black mage from Final Fantasy I, right?
5613360	5614820	That was a big thing in Final Fantasy IX.
5614820	5618720	So I would actually love to see, and I think I even tweeted something about this, I would
5618720	5625000	love to see that Final Fantasy XVI is something like Final Fantasy IX in XV's engine.
5625000	5627000	I would love that.
5627000	5628000	But we'll see.
5628000	5629240	I'm not going to hold my breath.
5629240	5632400	Here's the other thing, though, I wanted to say to Osfer, the emailer.
5632400	5636640	I would be curious, how old were you when Final Fantasy IX came out?
5636640	5639040	You know why?
5639040	5641580	Because I think it was Bobby who said this, and I don't know if he stole it from somewhere
5641580	5643800	else or if he came up with it on his own.
5643800	5648100	But he once said that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that came out when
5648100	5649940	you were 12.
5649940	5654180	And so I'm wondering if Final Fantasy IX came out, because I know Osfer is a little younger
5654180	5661460	than me, who was 12 when Final Fantasy II and III America, IV and VI for everybody else,
5661460	5662540	came out.
5662540	5668740	Because that's, I was 12 when Final Fantasy II, IV, whatever you want to call it, when
5668740	5671900	that game came out, and that's probably why it's one of my favorites.
5671900	5674340	I remember having such an emotional connection to that game.
5674340	5680820	I think that for me, it was the first U.S. Final Fantasy, but it's not my favorite.
5680820	5682220	Well, it's not your favorite.
5682220	5683220	It's not my favorite.
5683220	5685180	I love the Japanese III a lot.
5685180	5691660	I love V, but VI was the one, actually, I really have a hard time comparing them because
5691660	5694180	each of them are their own contained stories.
5694180	5698500	And it's hard for me to like one more than the other, but I did sink more time into VI.
5698500	5703080	So well, and some of the chatters are saying it's not exactly right.
5703080	5706400	And I'll also say that I like Chrono Trigger better than the whole series.
5706400	5707400	Which would be wrong.
5707400	5708400	I'm just kidding.
5708400	5709400	But here's the thing.
5709400	5713800	Even if it's not exactly 12, it's around 12.
5713800	5714800	You know what I mean?
5714800	5716760	You still picked one of the earlier games, you know what I mean?
5716760	5718280	So I was in high school.
5718280	5724520	Anyway, anyway, this is, I would just be curious, was Osfer 12 years old when Final Fantasy IX
5724520	5725520	came out?
5725520	5726520	Well, you didn't say so.
5726520	5727520	How old is Osfer?
5727520	5730160	I don't even know if I know off the top of my head, but I pretended to have the flu for
5730160	5731480	a whole week so I could play it.
5731480	5733720	I think Osfer is in his mid to low 20s.
5733720	5735960	So I'm trying to do the math in my head.
5735960	5736960	That'd be about the...
5736960	5737960	So next email.
5737960	5738960	Oh yeah.
5738960	5739960	Next email.
5739960	5744200	Comes from Claire and it's just smile, hugs, smile.
5744200	5747440	And a picture of a dragon with an ornament, a star on top.
5747440	5748800	Oh, I saw that picture in the email.
5748800	5751040	Now my question is, did the emailer draw that?
5751040	5752040	I don't know.
5752040	5753240	But if he did, nice talent.
5753240	5754240	Yeah.
5754240	5757920	If you drew that and you were just emailing it to us to show off, then kudos to you.
5757920	5758920	You're a good artist.
5758920	5759920	All right.
5759920	5761880	If you drew that from DeviantArt, then all right.
5761880	5762880	That's cool.
5762880	5763880	Thanks for the wishes.
5763880	5764880	If nothing else.
5764880	5765880	Hello Sky, Dark Sakura and Loki.
5765880	5766880	Hi.
5766880	5767880	Merry Christmas.
5767880	5768880	Happy Hanukkah.
5768880	5770520	All of the season's greetings.
5770520	5771640	Martin the Belgian here.
5771640	5774480	I love that you're Martin the Belgian.
5774480	5777020	Thanks so much for doing a show on Christmas.
5777020	5781280	This will give me something to listen to while recovering from my food coma tomorrow and
5781280	5786360	spending the holidays playing games and trying to resist the sales on Steam and GOG.
5786360	5790320	I am trying not to buy games I will never play, but it is hard.
5790320	5795360	I am home in Belgium for the holidays, the home of wonderful chocolate and stroopwafels.
5795360	5798960	A long time ago, I promised to send you some Belgian chocolate, but you never sent me an
5798960	5800760	address I can send it to.
5800760	5804480	Being home now, I am stocking up, so I would love to thank you for the wonderful show you
5804480	5806320	do each week with some chocolate.
5806320	5807640	If you send me address, I will.
5807640	5810880	Hope you're all enjoying a nice break with some great games.
5810880	5812400	Hugs from Belgium, Martin.
5812400	5814900	I will send you my address right now.
5814900	5815900	I'm happy to do that.
5816420	5822220	I'm happy to do that, however, if I remember right, he relocated to Atlanta.
5822220	5824940	If I remember an early email, I'll correct.
5824940	5830400	As a reminder, I will be in Atlanta again in 2017 over Labor Day weekend for Dragon
5830400	5832220	Con 2017.
5832220	5838540	I would like to enjoy these fine chocolates in person while I'm drinking stroopwafel,
5838540	5841180	which by the way, this is fucking happening at Dragon Con.
5841180	5842180	But I want some too.
5842180	5843820	Brad from Pod Culture, are you listening?
5843940	5845860	Then you need to fucking come to Dragon Con.
5845860	5848900	Bitch, I don't have money.
5848900	5849900	You got money for stroopwafel.
5849900	5851460	They were a dollar.
5851460	5855460	Put the stroopwafel money away every week until Labor Day and then you can do.
5855460	5857420	I also can't get off work.
5857420	5858660	Stroopwafel.
5858660	5859660	Brad from Pod Culture.
5859660	5860660	Send me my address.
5860660	5862860	Stroopwafel, the new official drink at Dragon Con.
5862860	5865940	Although, I don't know, Brad from Pod Culture is a big fan of Fireball.
5865940	5866940	Maybe we can mix them.
5866940	5871540	Do you think stroopball, stroop, stroop, stroopball, fire, fire, firewaffle?
5871540	5872980	I don't like Fireball.
5872980	5873980	I like Fireball.
5873980	5874980	Firewaffle.
5874980	5876980	I'm sitting in my address right now.
5876980	5877980	Okay.
5877980	5878980	All right.
5879980	5880980	Is that it for emails?
5880980	5881980	I think.
5881980	5883980	I'm just sitting in my address right now.
5883980	5884980	You can't.
5884980	5885980	Make up some time.
5885980	5886980	Talk about stroopwafel some more.
5886980	5887980	I don't know.
5887980	5888980	I don't have time.
5888980	5889980	All right.
5889980	5891980	Going to our chat over at live.fucknetwork.com.
5891980	5893980	Brad from Pod Culture says cinnamon and waffles.
5893980	5897980	See, it sounds pretty good, doesn't it, when I mention it like that?
5897980	5900980	Some folks talking about age and Final Fantasy.
5900980	5905340	RageNator in chat says, I got Final Fantasy one on the NES when it first came out and
5905340	5906900	I was 13 at the time.
5906900	5907900	Not my favorite.
5907900	5910460	Seven, I got day one and loved it.
5910460	5912300	I was 20 when seven came out.
5912300	5913300	Okay.
5913300	5914500	Everybody wants to break the fucking theory.
5914500	5915500	All right.
5915500	5916500	Fine.
5916500	5920360	The theory does not, like most theories, it doesn't hold true 100% of the time.
5920360	5922380	So I don't know what to tell you.
5922380	5923380	All right.
5923380	5924380	Anyway.
5924380	5925380	Let's see.
5925380	5927380	Other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5927780	5928780	Um.
5928780	5931780	That was the last email, by the way.
5931780	5934380	Robis's Final Fantasy nine was a complete throwback to Final Fantasy one.
5934380	5935380	Yeah.
5935380	5936380	That's probably why it was popular.
5936380	5940340	And then everybody's complaining that the stream died, which it does look like we had
5940340	5945420	a little server hiccup, uh, which another Christmas thing out of my control.
5945420	5948000	What can I do?
5948000	5949000	You know what, Rob?
5949000	5950000	What?
5950000	5951820	An important thing happened ages ago.
5951820	5952820	What's that?
5952820	5957660	The person who was born that would change the world for the better.
5957660	5958660	Freddie Mercury?
5958660	5959660	Isaac Newton.
5959660	5960660	Oh, okay.
5960660	5967580	I had to quote Neil deGrasse Tyson on this day.
5967580	5970860	Long ago, a child was born who by age 30 would transform the world.
5970860	5974580	Happy birthday, Isaac Newton, born December 25th, 1642.
5974580	5975580	No.
5975580	5976580	You know what?
5976580	5977580	You know what?
5977580	5981620	That whole gravity thing, that kind of the gravity sucks sometimes just want you to know.
5981620	5986840	Gravity is what gives plastic surgeons a job.
5986840	5991180	To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com.
5991180	5994340	Use the passphrase arrow.
5994340	5995440	That's it for the mailbag.
5995440	5998200	We are going to take calls here in just a moment.
5998200	6002740	We're going to open up the holiday Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
6002740	6008540	So get ready, but hold your calls for just a moment because we've got two more stories
6008540	6009540	for you.
6009540	6013100	Our girls in the eighties.
6013100	6014100	Darsyra?
6014100	6015100	Fake plastic trees are stuck in my head.
6015100	6016100	Oh yeah.
6016100	6017100	Yeah.
6017100	6018100	That's a good song.
6018100	6019100	Pokemon go.
6019100	6020100	It's doing some shit.
6020100	6023740	Um, it's a fun little holiday adventure.
6023740	6026780	Did you hack your pokey stop and get your incubator for the day?
6026780	6027780	No.
6027780	6029260	That, that's a thing.
6029260	6031940	If you hack a pokey stop now you get an incubator.
6031940	6034180	I did hack it, but I didn't get an incubator.
6034180	6035380	Did you do it this today?
6035380	6036380	Yeah.
6036380	6037380	25th.
6037380	6038500	Well then you need to write, you probably got one.
6038540	6041660	I used to realize it after I already bought one.
6041660	6042660	Oops.
6042660	6047340	Um, anyway, um, it'll be a lot easier to get the gen two Pokemon and the Kanto starters.
6047340	6053220	Um, so for the morning of December 25th to January 3rd, pokey stops will award one single
6053220	6054220	use incubator.
6054220	6061540	Like you said, um, each day after your first photo disc spin, photo disc spin.
6061540	6066300	Does that mean maybe it doesn't work through the Pogo plus maybe you have to actually have
6066300	6067300	the app open.
6067300	6068300	Oh yeah.
6068300	6070420	Well, I, I'm only using the app anyway.
6070420	6075540	Um, and there's also a higher chance of earning eggs that will hatch into the new gold and
6075540	6078500	silver babies like Pichu and Togepi.
6078500	6082700	And uh, of course you get the Santa, uh, Pikachu and I caught a Santa Raichu.
6082700	6083700	Congrats.
6083700	6086180	Yeah, I heard the Santa Raichu's are out there in the wild too.
6086180	6090660	Um, and then from the afternoon of December 30th through the afternoon of January 8th,
6090660	6096300	lure modules will last a full hour, which is twice as long as normal and the Kanto region
6096300	6099620	uh, starters and their evolved forms will be made more common.
6099620	6106140	Adding Charizard, Blastoise and Venusaur, um, should be a lot easier.
6106140	6107340	When does the second half of that start?
6107340	6108340	The 28th you said?
6108340	6109340	Or now?
6109340	6111100	December 30th through January 8th.
6111100	6112500	So we still got some time.
6112500	6114900	I'm going to get a Venusaur.
6114900	6116460	Yeah, I know.
6116460	6117460	I need those starters.
6117460	6118460	That's a great event.
6118460	6120780	I'm going to get a Charizard.
6120780	6124540	Even though those incubators are single use only, it's, it really needed it.
6124540	6128140	The game really needed them with the way they're rolling out these new Pokemon.
6128140	6130580	So I think that was a great little incentive for people.
6130580	6131580	So good job.
6131580	6132580	Yes.
6132580	6133580	Yes.
6133580	6136900	Um, can I, we go get more.
6136900	6137900	There's still some of the bottle.
6137900	6141780	Uh, the other thing I want to ask you about the dark soccer, did you know the app for
6141780	6143660	Apple watch came out a couple of days ago?
6143660	6144660	Yes, I did.
6144660	6148080	And I kept hearing that it wasn't going to work on the first gen watches and I couldn't
6148080	6150100	get it to run really.
6150100	6154340	And then, um, I don't know what happened, but I got a notification and suddenly it was
6154340	6155340	working.
6155340	6156580	Oh, well that's good.
6156580	6157580	Right?
6157580	6158580	Yeah.
6158580	6161740	But there's some people with the first gen Apple watches that's just not working for.
6161740	6167000	And so, um, I just been, you know, trying to leave feedback and whatnot to see, but
6167000	6170340	it finally came through on mine, but it wasn't working fully properly.
6170340	6175020	I like that it's more of an exercise tracker and you'll get the egg credit at least if
6175020	6176020	nothing else.
6176020	6177020	That's the best part about the plus.
6177020	6178020	Yeah.
6178020	6182140	But the big, the big bad thing though is that it will drain both batteries.
6182140	6187460	So I only have it on when I know I'm going to be doing some walking.
6187460	6190580	And usually if I've got the walking, I've got the app open on my phone anyway.
6190580	6191580	So yeah.
6191580	6193940	Well, it's the same thing with the plus, you still have to have the app running on your
6193940	6197540	phone and it will drain your phone a little bit, but not nearly as bad as like running
6197540	6198540	the entire app.
6198540	6199540	Yeah.
6199540	6200540	So there is that anyway.
6200540	6201540	Uh, all right.
6201540	6205980	Well, speaking of Pokemon, I have one more story for you guys that has to do with Pokemon.
6205980	6213140	Uh, it has to do with, uh, a ROM hack that got shut down by Nintendo, the Grinches that
6213140	6214140	stole Christmas.
6214140	6215140	Uh, that's right.
6215140	6217820	There was a fan made Pokemon ROM hack in the work.
6217820	6219620	It has been in the works for eight years.
6219620	6225380	It was called Pokemon prism and it was being made off of Pokemon gold.
6225380	6229020	So it was a ROM hack to do an entirely new adventure.
6229020	6235520	And apparently though, uh, a, uh, Nintendo, uh, law firm in Australia, uh, because I guess
6235560	6240560	that's where this was being hosted or whatever, sent the cease and desist and the guy put
6240560	6247560	the letter up on Google drive and said that basically Nintendo is shutting this down as
6247560	6253280	they did with Metroid to return of Samus as they did with other Nintendo fan, Pokemon
6253280	6255400	uranium and all this stuff this year.
6255400	6257080	So a yep.
6257080	6259440	No news if this will ever come out.
6259440	6265840	I don't know if he's going to turn to the dark side or what have you of, um, uh, Torrance
6265840	6267520	and all that to get that out there.
6267520	6271400	But, uh, for right now it doesn't sound like this is ever going to come out.
6271400	6274580	So that's sad.
6274580	6276600	At least the guy made the game for himself.
6276600	6277600	Nothing else.
6277600	6278600	Hmm.
6278600	6279600	Yeah.
6279600	6284640	Tiger call and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm sure downloads of this are out in
6284640	6285640	the wild.
6285640	6286640	Yes.
6286640	6288720	Uh, I'm sure that is a very true.
6288720	6291600	And once it's on the internet, always on the internet.
6291600	6292960	You know how that goes.
6292960	6296200	Speaking of on the internet, it's time for you guys to give us a call.
6296200	6298960	If you'd like orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
6298960	6303000	I know it's a little early tonight, but we are doing a little bit of a shorter show.
6303000	6307760	So that way, uh, dark soccer and myself can enjoy what we thought would be Chinese food
6307760	6311620	on Christmas, but it turns out it's going to be sushi on Christmas because the sushi
6311620	6313840	joint nearby last night too.
6313840	6314840	That was funny.
6314840	6317440	Oh, do you want to try to find something else we can do?
6317440	6318440	We could do that.
6319160	6320160	Oh, the Korean barbecue open.
6320160	6321160	Oh, the big one.
6321160	6322160	Not Oz.
6322160	6327200	There's the YD Tofu house and another Tofu house down the, down the way, but we can do,
6327200	6328200	we can do either.
6328200	6329200	I'm fine with it.
6329200	6330200	We'll see.
6330200	6331200	We'll see.
6331200	6332200	All right.
6332200	6333200	Our phone lines are lighting up at orange lounge radio on Skype.
6333200	6334200	So let's get to it.
6334200	6335200	Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.
6335200	6336200	Who's this?
6336200	6337200	Hey everyone.
6337200	6338200	It's Rama.
6338200	6339200	Hey Rama.
6339200	6340200	How you doing?
6340200	6341200	Pretty good.
6341200	6342200	If it makes you feel any better, I'm eating Chinese food here.
6342200	6343200	I'll eat on your behalf.
6343200	6344200	Thank you.
6344200	6345200	I appreciate that.
6345200	6346200	We'll drink on your behalf.
6346200	6347200	Well, that's okay.
6347200	6349640	I have a nice can of beer right here too.
6349640	6351640	You know what you don't have?
6351640	6352640	What?
6352640	6353640	Stroopwafel.
6353640	6359400	Well, you know, but you know what I will have in two weeks?
6359400	6360400	Me.
6360400	6361400	Stroopwafel.
6361400	6364800	I think Skye's a little bit better than Stroopwafel.
6364800	6365800	Oh, that's right.
6365800	6368520	I keep forgetting that you're actually going to Stroopwafel with you.
6368520	6369520	I know, right?
6369520	6371320	I keep forgetting that you're actually going to Magfest this year.
6371320	6372320	I'm so excited.
6372320	6373320	So we get to hang.
6373320	6374320	Hang, drink.
6374320	6376640	What's the difference?
6376640	6377640	I know.
6377640	6378640	I'm excited.
6378640	6380520	We're going to have a good time.
6380520	6381520	That makes two of us.
6381520	6385840	I'm still putting together my list of cosplays I'm going to do.
6385840	6388240	Any hints for us?
6388240	6391120	Well, I will say this much.
6391120	6397040	One of the characters I am cosplaying from is a character from a fighting game that was
6397040	6400480	covered by Dark Sakura.
6400480	6401480	What?
6401480	6402480	All right.
6402480	6403480	All right.
6403480	6405280	A little show trivia with that.
6405280	6406280	I like that.
6406280	6407280	Mm-hmm.
6407280	6408360	All right.
6408360	6409360	So what's on your mind tonight?
6409360	6410360	What did you call us for?
6410360	6413480	Did you just call to talk about Magfest or something else on your mind?
6413480	6414480	That too.
6414480	6418080	And also I just spent the last six hours putting together my Christmas gift.
6418080	6421000	I rebuilt and redid my entire computer.
6421000	6422000	Wow.
6422000	6423000	Okay.
6423000	6424000	Yeah.
6424000	6425000	I saw you doing some of this stuff on Facebook.
6425000	6426000	Yeah.
6426000	6429440	I was doing a live stream because I couldn't get it to work on Twitch and I was like, you
6429440	6430440	know what?
6430440	6431840	I'm just going to do the stream and do this.
6431840	6434200	You know, I got it up and running finally.
6434200	6435920	So everything is working great.
6435920	6436920	Congratulations.
6436920	6437920	Thank you.
6437920	6438920	Thank you.
6438920	6439920	What are you going to do with this new computer?
6439920	6441720	Is it something for like more streaming stuff?
6441720	6445680	Like, I know you guys took over the feed yesterday and we're doing the holiday music, which thanks
6445680	6446680	for that.
6446680	6447680	Got a lot of love on Facebook.
6447680	6454080	Are you going to do more things like that or no, this is just a game.
6454080	6458720	The funny thing is everyone asks me games and stuff like that, but no.
6458720	6459720	Multimedia.
6459720	6465600	I just rebuilt my machine so that I can do better audio podcasting and video editing
6465600	6472920	and get stuff up onto our sites and then play some games because steam took 21 bucks from
6472920	6475400	me the other day.
6475400	6476800	I know how that goes.
6476800	6477800	Yes.
6477800	6483160	But also I think when you talk about the whole like more oomph in video editing and audio
6483160	6487600	editing, like that was actually a big incentive in updating my own computer is that when the
6487600	6492120	show's done here on the studio computer, I usually I'll drop the files in Dropbox,
6492120	6496720	which is harder now that Dropbox doesn't support XP, but I just do it through the website.
6496720	6501640	And then I take them to my other computer and you know, cause editing three hours of
6501640	6505640	MP3s, those can, I mean, and you know this from anime jam session, those files can get
6505640	6509560	pretty big, so they can be really slow to convert and save sometimes.
6509560	6515400	But on the newer computer I have blazing fast, exactly.
6515400	6520400	Maybe like seven minutes to convert the whole show, which is fast for like a three hour
6520400	6521400	show.
6521400	6522400	That's fast.
6522400	6527920	Well, let's see our drunken podcast show, which was a little bit over two hours.
6527920	6530800	I re edited and rendered it in under two minutes.
6530800	6531800	Nice.
6531800	6532800	Wow.
6532800	6533800	That's really good.
6533800	6536480	Keep in mind, I save in multiple formats and I think that's part of the reason why it takes
6536480	6538080	me a little longer.
6538080	6539400	Probably so better safe than sorry.
6539400	6540400	Yeah.
6540400	6544920	I save one for VOG and I save one for the podcast feed cause I figure, uh, it's, it's
6544920	6551520	a lot of space on some of these iPhone cause one episode of OLR is like what, 80 megabytes
6551520	6553640	I think podcast sized.
6553640	6556440	So maybe less, maybe less, maybe it's like 60.
6556440	6557760	I don't remember now.
6557760	6562440	Um, but it's like a hundred megs on VOG so, but now everybody streams them like I shouldn't
6562440	6564480	have to worry about that anymore cause everybody streams it now.
6564480	6565520	That's the big thing people do.
6565520	6569120	So I only do one.
6569120	6576280	I do the save for VOG upload and did I just go back and just drop in edit for RSS feed
6576280	6577480	and call it a day?
6577480	6578480	You know?
6578480	6584200	I think a lot of our shows do that, but it's one of those things where the particular quality
6584200	6588920	of OLR I kind of set a long time ago before they were even VOG, before there was even
6588920	6589920	all games.
6589920	6592680	So it's kind of one of those I've just never really deviated from that.
6592680	6596720	Not to say I never will, but I haven't been convinced otherwise by anybody.
6596720	6600600	None of the listeners have complained about the quality or the file size of the format
6600600	6601600	of the show.
6601600	6605560	So par for the course for now.
6605560	6606560	Sounds like a plan.
6606560	6607560	Yep.
6607560	6608560	All right.
6608560	6609560	Anything else on your mind, my friend?
6609560	6610560	Oh yeah.
6610560	6615240	I was trying to call it about last week about MAGFest, you were complaining about food places
6615240	6616240	and stuff.
6616240	6617240	Yeah.
6617240	6619920	Um, did you hear the news?
6619920	6620920	No.
6620920	6622600	There's a casino right up the street.
6622600	6623600	Really?
6623600	6625400	They built a casino out there now?
6625400	6626400	Yes.
6626400	6628280	It opened up about a week and a half ago.
6628280	6629280	Oh shoot.
6629280	6631920	So there's probably a ton of food options in there, huh?
6631920	6635160	An MGM Grand Casino.
6635160	6636160	Holy crap.
6636160	6637160	That's going to be a pretty big deal.
6637160	6638160	Well, that's great.
6638160	6642480	So they'll have food options and that'll, I hope they're ready for all those people.
6642480	6643800	I hope so too.
6643800	6644800	Yeah.
6644800	6647640	It would still be great if they could just get oodles and oodles of food trucks come
6647640	6648640	out there.
6648640	6651600	And especially if it's not going to be like horrific snow and all this stuff, it's going
6651600	6652780	to be 50 degrees out there.
6652780	6653780	That sounds awesome.
6653780	6655840	I'm very, very happy to hear that.
6655840	6658240	Hopefully the weather stays the same, knock on wood.
6658240	6663640	So I was saying yesterday, this time last year, yesterday, it was 66 degrees and I'm
6663640	6664640	walking around.
6664640	6665640	It's like 52.
6665640	6666640	Hmm.
6666640	6669840	Well, that's, I mean, again, that's warmer than it is in California right now.
6669840	6674000	So uh, I'll take it by all means.
6674000	6675000	You can have it.
6675000	6676000	All right.
6676000	6679640	It snowed in SoCal today, if you can believe it.
6679640	6683480	Granted on the grapevine where it's a higher elevation, but still you don't hear about
6683480	6684480	that every day.
6684480	6685480	Anyway.
6685520	6686520	There you go.
6686520	6687520	To get more calls.
6687520	6688520	All right.
6688520	6689520	Take care.
6689520	6690520	Take care of my friends.
6690520	6691520	See you in a couple of weeks.
6691520	6692520	You got it.
6692520	6693520	Bye.
6693520	6694520	Bye Ron.
6694520	6695520	Jon and Stroopwafel.
6695520	6696520	Stroopwafel.
6696520	6697520	You know what?
6697520	6699640	The Stroopwafel people need to pay us in Stroopwafel.
6699640	6702000	Well, at least the Stroopwafel booze.
6702000	6703480	I mean, I like the actual waffles though.
6703480	6705720	It's like free advertising for them left and right today.
6705720	6706720	Just like Pinkberry.
6706720	6708720	How come we never got free Pinkberry out of this show?
6708720	6709720	Pinkberry.
6709720	6710720	Do it.
6710720	6711720	Hi.
6711720	6712720	You're on Orange Dots Radio.
6712720	6713720	Who's this?
6713720	6714720	Hi.
6714960	6716960	Not a whole lot.
6716960	6729160	Well, since this is the last show of the year, I kind of figure, I ask the two of you, what
6729160	6732160	is your favorite game that you got this year?
6732160	6737480	It doesn't necessarily have to come out this year so long as you buy it this year and play
6737480	6738480	it this year.
6738480	6744520	Oh, Ray Jeter, you might be dipping into a topic if we do do a show in the next week.
6744520	6748320	This is something that would be a prime topic for that show would be what is the game of
6748320	6755440	the year, but taking Ray Jeter's little twist on it, what is the best game that you got
6755440	6757080	this year?
6757080	6758760	Do you think you have an answer for that?
6758760	6759760	Dark Soccer.
6759760	6761840	What's the best game that you got this year?
6761840	6767120	Well, I haven't played them yet because then it doesn't count.
6767120	6768120	No.
6768120	6772320	I actually really liked the new wow expansion and I'm still playing it.
6772320	6773320	Okay.
6773320	6775640	I got it for myself, so I got it for me.
6775640	6781200	And I've been playing Danganronpa and Danganronpa 2, which I just started this year, so both
6781200	6782200	of them are great.
6782200	6783200	All of them are great.
6783200	6787680	I don't think I've played anything that sucks balls this year.
6787680	6792440	Don't confuse this with my game of the year, but I would actually probably answer Final
6792440	6798480	Fantasy 15 just because you guys know what crazy gamer ADD I have and the fact that I
6798480	6802960	actually played that game start to finish, I think says a lot and that was a game I knew
6802960	6805160	I was going to buy and bought.
6805160	6809600	And so, yeah, I think to answer your question the way you asked it, I think I would say
6809600	6810600	Final Fantasy 15.
6810600	6811600	Oh, cool.
6811600	6812600	What about you?
6812600	6820200	Well, it's kind of hard to answer if only because I just started playing the game, but
6820200	6830920	I just recently got myself Transformers Devastation, which is pretty much just as a refresher to
6830920	6832280	everyone that's listening.
6832280	6839720	It's basically a love letter to all those that grew up watching the Generation 1 cartoon
6839720	6846120	from the 80s and, oh my God, is it amazing.
6846120	6852720	I practically had a nerdgasm as soon as I loaded the game up.
6852720	6857400	I swear to God, I probably like this game more than I like Magic 2014.
6857400	6858400	What?
6858400	6860520	Well, that's quite an endorsement.
6860520	6861520	Don't go overboard.
6861760	6865320	I know, shock and awe, what the hell happened to Reginald?
6865320	6868680	What did you do with him?
6868680	6870960	But yeah, it's pretty good.
6870960	6880400	Now, normally it's a $40 game, but in fact, I picked it up when it was on CL.
6880400	6882720	I paid $10 for it.
6882720	6885400	I can't figure what the hell, I can't pass that up.
6885400	6890920	It might still be on CL now that the Christmas sale is going on.
6891760	6901800	If you're a fan of the Transformers franchise, do yourself a favor and pick it up, especially
6901800	6903280	if it's on CL for cheap.
6903280	6907280	Well, guys, you're just pointing out it was free on PlayStation Network, so if you didn't
6907280	6911240	get it there, I mean, free's a pretty good deal.
6911240	6912960	Oh, definitely, definitely.
6912960	6917320	Well, I'll probably let you go.
6917320	6923280	We're imagining a lot of other people calling for this show, so have a nice night.
6923280	6924280	Thank you, you too.
6924280	6925280	Have a good holiday.
6925280	6926280	Take care.
6926280	6927280	Yep, you too.
6927280	6928280	All right, bye.
6928280	6929280	I'm getting you to think about it.
6929280	6931560	All these people that are calling us tonight and participating with the show, they're here
6931560	6936360	on what is traditionally a pretty busy day for a lot of people, so thank you for being
6936360	6937360	here tonight, everybody.
6937360	6938360	Hearts.
6938360	6939360	Hearts and love and love and hearts.
6939360	6942280	And those of you on the podcast feed as well, don't get me wrong, I still have a lot of
6942280	6945000	love for you guys as well, but anyway, we got another call coming in.
6945000	6946000	Let's get to it.
6946000	6948840	Hey, everybody, you're on Orange
6948840	6949840	Haunted Radio.
6949840	6950840	Who's this?
6950840	6951840	This is Brad from Pod Culture.
6951840	6952840	Hey, my friend.
6952840	6953840	How are you?
6953840	6954840	Not Stroopwaffling, that's for sure.
6954840	6955840	Well, that's unfortunate.
6955840	6956840	We'll have to fix that.
6956840	6961840	Did you know, by the way, Brad from Pod Culture, that your Skype icon is a lesbian?
6961840	6962840	Yeah.
6962840	6963840	Okay, just checking.
6963840	6967640	Still doesn't change the fact that she's my favorite player in the game.
6967640	6968640	Amen to that.
6968640	6969640	Amen to that.
6969640	6970640	Doesn't change a goddamn thing.
6970640	6971640	That is absolutely right.
6971640	6972640	There's the one that does the snow.
6972640	6975600	She's my favorite character in the game.
6976400	6978680	Tracer is the icon for Brad.
6978680	6979960	May is the one you're thinking of.
6979960	6981720	That's who I was using and really liked.
6981720	6982720	Yeah, May's cool.
6982720	6984680	I actually play Pharah a lot.
6984680	6986080	Yeah, I love Pharah.
6986080	6988800	Pharah's the one I play pretty much because it's just rocket launchers everywhere.
6988800	6989800	I like D.Va.
6989800	6991720	But I really like Symmetra as well.
6991720	6995800	And I like Junkrat since I know we're naming a lot of ladies, but there's some love for
6995800	6996800	some of the boys too.
6996800	6997800	I like Junkrat as well.
6997800	6998800	I just found something wonderful.
6998800	7002480	You gotta know Junkrat and Roadhog are a couple.
7002480	7004040	That seems to be the next thing.
7004040	7006640	Yeah, that Junkrat and Roadhog are gonna end up being a couple.
7006640	7007640	We'll see.
7007640	7008640	We'll see.
7008640	7010080	Anyway, Brad, what'd you call in for tonight?
7010080	7015800	Oh, just gonna end that, you know, tying into what Rageinator was saying, I gotta be surprised.
7015800	7020280	My favorite game of the year that I got was Overwatch.
7020280	7022080	Yeah, yeah.
7022080	7023680	There's a lot of love out there for Overwatch.
7023680	7028960	And again, I want to stress, the way I answered Rageinator's question is not the same way
7028960	7032440	I would answer what is the best game of 2016, but we'll get into that possibly later.
7032440	7036040	But anyway, what made you say Overwatch?
7036040	7039240	It's just a lot of fun.
7039240	7045120	It appealed to my gamer ADD to jump in, play for a while, jump back out.
7045120	7048600	The only frustrating thing is those damn loot boxes.
7048600	7051880	Did you get the five free ones for the holiday, which by the way, Overwatch players, if you
7051880	7056560	didn't already check that out, they gave out five free loot boxes for the holiday.
7056560	7061360	I opened up five on PlayStation 4 and five on PC, and you know what I got?
7061360	7063880	Jack shit.
7063880	7065240	I didn't get anything useful.
7065240	7069040	I got sprays, voice lines I don't like, like nothing.
7069040	7070040	I didn't get any skins.
7070040	7073040	Yeah, I get all kinds of shit from characters I don't care about.
7073040	7074040	Exactly.
7074040	7077560	All I want, I wanted just like a Christmas skin for somebody.
7077560	7083240	At least during the Summer Games event, at least I got Lucio's Summer Games outfit, which
7083240	7086760	was awesome because I actually play Lucio quite a bit, so that was really cool to have.
7086760	7091600	I actually had a lot of luck with Lucio skins because I have his gold frog DJ thing too,
7091600	7092600	which is awesome.
7092600	7095600	I got Yeti Winston.
7095600	7098080	Oh, that's cool.
7098080	7099840	I just don't play Winston a lot.
7099840	7104520	I guess if I play any tank, I usually play Winston, but I'm starting to get used to Reinhardt
7104520	7110680	a little more too, and Reinhardt's a really effective tank, so it's hard to not play Reinhardt.
7111600	7118920	Yeah, I've been playing that, and then I've been trying the new update to No Man's Sky
7118920	7119920	on PS4.
7119920	7123640	Oh yeah, what do you think of No Man's Sky, especially post-update and the whole base
7123640	7125400	building and all that now?
7125400	7127400	It's still a very zen game.
7127400	7128400	Yeah, it is.
7128400	7130640	It's a good one to chill out too.
7130640	7133760	But it's nice that you can build the base on your planet so now you can go back and
7133760	7139400	stuff and do all that, so I'd like to hear more about what they have planned for the
7139440	7141520	future, but I guess this is the way it is now.
7141520	7144920	We're just going to get the updates when they come out, and they're not going to talk on
7144920	7148560	Twitter because people on Twitter are mean.
7148560	7152560	I think you can get it for like 20 bucks now, so it's definitely a 20-buck game.
7152560	7154920	Yeah, I was just telling somebody else this earlier today.
7154920	7158140	We were talking about it because he mentioned that he's getting a PlayStation 4 soon and
7158140	7162280	finally catching up and getting on that band, or at least like he says, finally catching
7162280	7166200	up, but I'm kind of like, there's a lot of people that are still on PS3, and not everybody
7166200	7168460	can afford to get the newest gaming tech.
7168460	7171780	But anyway, he said he's getting it, and I said, he was kind of asking about No Man's
7171780	7172780	Sky.
7172780	7175760	We were talking about the controversy a little bit, and I talked about how the controversy
7175760	7179900	didn't really bug me with No Man's Sky because my expectations were low.
7179900	7183120	I didn't buy into all the hype about the game in the first place, so when I played the game
7183120	7184120	I was fine.
7184120	7188460	And I said, you know what, now that it's a 20-dollar game especially, it's a great deal
7188460	7189460	at 20 bucks.
7189460	7190460	Oh yeah.
7190460	7191460	Yeah.
7191460	7192460	Very definitely.
7192460	7197780	So just don't expect to actually do multiplayer or anything like that, and you'll be fine.
7198100	7199100	Yeah.
7199100	7200100	Yep.
7200100	7201100	All right.
7201100	7203100	Well, Brad, anything else you want to share with us before we let you go?
7203100	7204100	No.
7204100	7208660	If I had some Fireball in the studio, I'd do a shot with you, but unfortunately I'm tapped
7208660	7209660	at the moment.
7209660	7210660	Well, I appreciate that.
7210660	7214500	Have you been tappered?
7214500	7215500	Only if you ask nicely.
7215500	7219180	A happy holidays to you and everybody over there helping you out with pod culture.
7219180	7220180	All right.
7220180	7221180	Same to you guys.
7221180	7222180	All right.
7222180	7223180	Take care, my friend.
7223180	7224180	Thank you.
7224180	7225180	Bye-bye.
7225180	7226180	All right.
7226180	7227180	Let's see if anybody else tries to call in.
7227580	7230180	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7230180	7234920	If you want to do it the old-fashioned way, you can as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR, but I don't
7234920	7237740	think we've had a call on that line in a very long time.
7237740	7240900	But Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7240900	7245740	We'll give it a few minutes, but if nobody else calls in, then that will be a show.
7245740	7249140	Dark Sakura, any last-minute stories or things you want to bring up with our audience before
7249140	7252980	we pull the plug on tonight's show if we don't get any calls here?
7252980	7254900	Christmas is really a pagan holiday.
7255620	7258700	You're going to edumacate the listeners tonight?
7258700	7259700	It's true.
7259700	7260700	Yeah.
7260700	7265340	Basically, if you don't already know, and I've explained it a bajillion times, all of
7265340	7272920	these traditions, with the exception of the Jesus stuff, all came from pagan winter holidays.
7272920	7279060	They did not have decorated fir trees in Bethlehem.
7279060	7282540	So just saying, know your history.
7282540	7285100	I feel like you're a living Tumblr post right now.
7285100	7288700	Well, yeah, Tumblr was made for people like me.
7288700	7292580	And dick.
7292580	7298980	One last call, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR, some folks in chat, Bob
7298980	7302300	Coffey just stumbled into chat saying, oh, I forgot OLR was on tonight.
7302300	7303300	Yep.
7303300	7305020	Well, the good news is, this will be on the podcast feed.
7305020	7309380	You came in time to hear me talk about dick.
7309380	7310380	So there you go.
7310380	7312020	And you're not even as drunk as you were at the beginning of the show.
7312020	7314900	And I never did finish this glass of wine.
7314900	7315900	Frickin' Stroopwafel.
7315900	7316900	Oh my God.
7316900	7317900	Rob.
7317900	7318900	Rob.
7318900	7319900	What?
7319900	7320900	Rob.
7320900	7321900	Rob.
7321900	7325740	You sound like a broken car or something.
7325740	7326740	But what?
7326740	7327740	You need more.
7327740	7331740	I'm finishing off this one.
7331740	7332740	Hold on.
7332740	7335980	Please understand that there will be silence for a moment here.
7335980	7338100	Not really, because I'm going to sing.
7338100	7339100	We need to do-
7339100	7340100	No, no singing.
7340100	7341100	I will mute the mics for their singing.
7341180	7351260	We need to do the Careless Whisper saxophone line on repeat in honor of our departed.
7351260	7354540	Can we do the sax line from Carly Rae Jepsen's Runaway with Me?
7354540	7355540	No.
7355540	7356540	Why not?
7356540	7357540	Because?
7357540	7358540	Carly Slay?
7358540	7359540	Because George Michael.
7359540	7362480	This is the day of our Lord Carly Slay Jesus Epson.
7362480	7363480	Come on.
7363480	7364480	Anyway.
7364480	7366580	I quit for the year.
7366580	7367580	All right.
7367580	7370660	Nobody's calling in, so I guess we are definitely done.
7370660	7372020	And I chugged the rest of the wine.
7372020	7373020	Thank you very much.
7373020	7375580	And I'm sorry for my poor taste earlier.
7375580	7380340	Actually, I'm only vaguely sorry for it, because it was pretty funny.
7380340	7381340	All right.
7381340	7383280	So anyway, there it is.
7383280	7387340	And she did have a little bit to drink, so she was a little unhinged, y'all.
7387340	7390300	But thank you for tolerating us for two hours tonight.
7390300	7394140	I told you all at the very beginning, I said, if this is your first OLR, maybe you should
7394140	7397340	go listen to a different episode to start, because tonight's going to be a little crazy.
7397340	7401980	But I hope you guys in our chat and the fans that have been listening for over 670 episodes,
7401980	7407260	I hope you enjoyed our show full of holiday cheer, shall we say.
7407260	7408940	Liquid holiday cheer.
7408940	7413280	I hope you all enjoyed that in our chat and out there in podcast world.
7413280	7419620	We're going to wrap up, but we will be back in three weeks live with an all new Orange
7419620	7420620	Laundry Radio.
7420620	7423260	January 15th will be the next live Orange Laundry Radio.
7423260	7428540	But you guys, 670 back episodes that you can catch up on.
7428540	7431620	We'll see if we can put out something that is taped and advanced as well.
7431620	7433660	That's still going to try to do that.
7433660	7437020	But again, I try very hard not to over promise and under deliver.
7437020	7439100	So expect no show.
7439100	7443180	And if there's a show that pops in on the podcast feed, then hooray, right?
7443180	7444180	That's how we work.
7444180	7445180	Right, DartSakura?
7445180	7446180	Yes.
7446180	7447180	Expect nothing.
7447180	7448500	You know what, though?
7448500	7449500	Maybe it will surprise you.
7449540	7453740	I wish everyone warmth and love and kitty kisses.
7453740	7456140	Yes, lots of kitty kisses.
7456140	7457140	Your final thought.
7457140	7459740	Well, let me just quickly do my line about plugging the show.
7459740	7460740	Do it.
7460740	7462140	So thank you for listening to Orange Laundry Radio.
7462140	7465660	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show tonight, please tell a friend or five
7465660	7468500	or 25 about the show or 12 apostles.
7468500	7473260	Tell them about the show and help spread the word because we are the show where every gamer
7473260	7474420	has a voice.
7474420	7476860	But if the voices aren't here, we can't share them.
7476860	7477860	So we don't ask for your money.
7477860	7478860	We don't have them in our head.
7479220	7483860	We just ask for word of mouth and a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, Google
7483860	7486140	Play Podcast or wherever you found this goes a long way.
7486140	7488060	Unless you have 10 available, then do 10.
7488060	7489060	Then do 10 out of 10.
7489060	7490060	A pluses.
7490060	7491060	Maximums.
7491060	7492060	Yes.
7492060	7493060	Maximum.
7493060	7494060	Maximum ratings.
7494060	7495420	Now let's do everybody's final thought.
7495420	7498100	I'll do my sappy final thought first, then you can do yours.
7498100	7502980	My final thought is that, you know, Christmas is a time that you spend with family a lot
7502980	7504020	of times, right?
7504020	7507080	So I just really appreciate you guys showing up.
7507080	7508080	You guys are like a family.
7508300	7509300	Aww.
7509300	7514520	But no, I mean, part of what motivates us to do this show every Sunday when we know
7514520	7518200	we know there's not 5000 people listening to this show.
7518200	7523220	We know we're not some huge podcast that matters out there, even though we are the oldest.
7523220	7524980	We know that all that stuff.
7524980	7530360	But we still do this show because even though we have a small audience, y'all are a faithful
7530360	7531360	audience.
7531360	7532360	You're a loyal audience.
7532360	7533660	You have family here.
7533660	7538440	And that's why we love you guys and why we're crazy enough to do a show on Christmas.
7538440	7539860	So thank you very much.
7539860	7541400	And I hope you do have a great holiday.
7541400	7545580	When I say holiday, that not just encompasses everything that whatever it is you celebrate
7545580	7548360	this time of year, but also New Year's.
7548360	7549820	Be safe.
7549820	7552100	Have a safe New Year's celebration.
7552100	7554100	Don't do anything stupid like drink and drive.
7554100	7556300	Don't be fucking stupid.
7556300	7557300	Be safe.
7557300	7558300	Have fun.
7558300	7562340	And let us all hope that 2017 fucking stops killing people.
7563940	7564940	Except like Kirk Douglas.
7564940	7566620	That's, you know, again, he's 100, you guys.
7566620	7567620	He's 100.
7567620	7573300	But 2017 needs to not kill celebrities at the rate that 2016 has been doing.
7573300	7575260	And a lot of great games.
7575260	7578420	And let's hope the Nintendo Switch, you guys, you guys, you know what would be the awesome
7578420	7580900	way to start 2017?
7580900	7585940	For Loki to walk in here on January 15th and go, I preordered a Switch.
7585940	7586940	Y'all know you want to hear it.
7586940	7587940	Y'all know you want to hear it.
7587940	7593080	So let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that that happens in a couple weeks.
7593080	7594480	DarkSakura, any final thoughts?
7594480	7595480	Thank you.
7595480	7597880	I am reading chat, by the way, and thank you very much for the very kind words.
7597880	7599880	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
7599880	7604680	I love you guys, but not in that way.
7604680	7608640	I think that you are all mostly wonderful people.
7608640	7611160	And thank you for listening to us.
7611160	7614560	And thank you for putting up with me.
7614560	7619880	And thank you for all of the wonderful things that you have sent us.
7619880	7621280	Folks who have sent us stuff.
7621280	7623680	The rest of you, we're waiting.
7623680	7624680	Stop it.
7624680	7625680	I'm kidding.
7625680	7627280	You can send us a five star review.
7627280	7628280	That will be plenty fun.
7628280	7631960	You can send me a gift certificate to Sephora.
7631960	7633720	Actually Dan got me a gift certificate for Sephora.
7633720	7635640	Then the listeners don't need to.
7635640	7636640	You can send us Stroopwafel.
7636640	7637640	Stroopwafel.
7637640	7639440	Send us Stroopwafel.
7639440	7641440	The liquor and the real things.
7641440	7642440	Crunch, crunch.
7642440	7646640	But no seriously, without you guys, we would not have been, well I don't know, we might
7646640	7650040	be stubborn, but we don't know that because of you guys.
7650040	7654880	So thank you for being encouragement and sometimes Devafit.
7654880	7656680	Hey now.
7656680	7657680	Reactionary.
7657680	7658680	It's Christmas.
7658680	7659680	Be nice.
7659680	7660680	I am being nice.
7660680	7661680	I'm always nice.
7661680	7663240	I am nice.
7663240	7665640	I was born ready.
7665640	7666640	Action.
7666640	7669680	Pee Wee's Big Adventure.
7669680	7670680	Don't think I don't know.
7670680	7671680	Don't think I don't know.
7671680	7674440	My cousin-in-law got a new bike.
7674440	7678480	And Dan's response, say that's a nice bike.
7678920	7679920	Anyway.
7679920	7683080	It's not a Christmas movie, but it ought to be.
7683080	7684080	Anyway.
7684080	7689840	All of you are rad in your own individual unique way.
7689840	7695460	Sometimes I come across, I think, a little bit harsh, but it's all out of love and getting
7695460	7697600	people to fucking think for themselves.
7697600	7700160	You guys are all free thinkers.
7700160	7701780	Continue to be free thinkers.
7701780	7704840	Continue to resist through the next year.
7704840	7706520	And talk to you then.
7706520	7708320	Or enlighten if you play Ingress.
7708360	7709640	Please don't resist.
7709640	7710640	Enlighten.
7710640	7713640	Just saying.
7713640	7717960	There are certain boundaries I have to draw with that line.
7717960	7718960	Little boundaries.
7718960	7719960	That's all.
7719960	7722720	All right.
7722720	7726320	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
7726320	7727320	Thank you guys so much.
7727320	7728320	Oh my God.
7728320	7729320	What?
7729320	7730320	Oh my God.
7730320	7731320	What?
7731320	7732320	You.
7732320	7733320	Me?
7733320	7734320	What?
7734320	7735320	What do you do?
7735320	7736320	Why?
7736320	7737320	Because.
7737320	7738800	This is awesome.
7738800	7741960	And this is why you've put up with me for going on 15 years.
7741960	7747320	Rob, I will put up with you for another 15 and then it will expire and I'm done.
7747320	7748480	You're kidding.
7748480	7749480	Kid, kid.
7749480	7752120	I will put up with you when you're old and gray.
7752120	7753120	We will.
7753120	7754120	I'm already old and gray.
7754120	7755120	Next year.
7755120	7756120	All right.
7756120	7757120	We will see you at the Quiceniera.
7757120	7761040	I will put up with you when you're older and grayer.
7761040	7762040	Thank you.
7762040	7763040	And gayer, hopefully.
7763040	7764040	All right.
7764040	7765040	Gayer and grayer.
7765040	7772840	That's the Orange Lounge Radio 2017, gayer and grayer, but not to be confused.
7772840	7774800	I can just, I can just see Loki in the background.
7774800	7779280	Hey, but not to be confused with clear, which is a cheat.
7779280	7780280	That's it.
7780280	7781280	We're definitely done.
7781280	7782280	Have a great holiday, everybody.
7782280	7783280	Good night.
7783280	7784280	Thanks for listening.
