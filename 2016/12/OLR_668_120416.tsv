7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight's least surprising headline, Pokemon Sun and Moon are the fastest selling Nintendo games in the Americas. Not bad for a still portable only franchise.
20000	27000	We'll also catch you up on the news and reveals from two gaming events, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 668 of our program for this December the 4th of 2016.
45000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, coming at you live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-host, Techmaster Loki over there, as he is every week.
55000	56000	Hello.
56000	57000	How's it going?
57000	58000	My mic's hot.
58000	59000	Yeah, your mic is hot?
59000	64000	It's sitting next to the vent fan on my laptop. I didn't realize it was so warm.
64000	69000	I hope the listeners weren't picking that up. That would be a little awkward if all things were started at the beginning of the show.
69000	72000	It's all good. How was your week?
72000	75000	Well...
75000	82000	Okay, we'll leave it at that. I think just that one word response says all we need to know there. That's plenty for me.
82000	88000	Anyway, how's your gate? You said you were thinking about focusing on your game a little more this week. Did that actually happen?
88000	95000	Sort of, but not. Let me put it this way. I did work in Unity quite a bit this week, not on my game.
95000	102000	Because I was trying to get back into my game and I realized I was so rusty because I had taken such a long break from it that the basics were kind of lost on me.
102000	111000	So I started working on another project just for the hell of it. I went through a tutorial for a multiplayer first person shooter game.
111000	119000	And so I've got the basics of I can move around, I can aim, and I can play multiplayer across the network.
119000	129000	So that was basically it. It was just to kind of get my feet wet again back in Unity. I'm enjoying it quite a bit being able to do that.
129000	139000	And then I was going to work on something else. I've had several concepts I've been working on.
139000	147000	Then my wife said that I should work on making a new excite truck. So I was looking at the feasibility of that and then actually it's not.
147000	151000	Your wife loves to tease you about video games and all that stuff, but even she likes excite truck.
151000	158000	Yeah, because she's playing excite truck right now again. So she wanted to play it again. So I set it up on the Wii U and been doing that.
158000	165000	But yeah, I was looking at the feasibility of making a new excite truck and it's not that difficult actually. So let me look into that.
166000	173000	Alright, cool. Not joining us here, DarkSakra or Jamie Summers. She's on her continued hiatus from the show due to a work conflict.
173000	181000	However, I can let you all know she'll be back next Sunday. That work conflict is going to be ending so she'll be back with us for the rest of the shows in December.
181000	187000	We'll let you know also our holiday schedule with Christmas and New Year's falling on a Sunday. We have to kind of work all that out.
187000	192000	So we're going to let you guys know next week once the three of us can kind of talk about it. When we will have shows and so forth.
192000	196000	Because not only are there the holidays, but then I will be at MAGFest the very next Sunday.
196000	201000	So it's kind of like you have a lot of, which is a holiday of sorts for nerds, I think. Especially those of you on the East Coast.
201000	204000	I don't think a lot of people are that crazy like me that travel all the way through the West Coast.
204000	210000	But I think a lot of you in the Northeast that are into gaming and stuff, probably a holiday for you guys as well.
210000	214000	And I look forward to joining you again for my second year at MAGFest. That'll be exciting.
215000	224000	Dark Soccer is out. However, we do have some awesome guests in the studio helping us to help fill her presence with her not being here.
224000	229000	And some voices you've heard on the show before. Say hello. Welcome back to the show from a few weeks ago.
229000	231000	Say hello to JD is back with us tonight.
231000	232000	Hi.
232000	233000	Or is it JD?
233000	235000	Well, if you want to say it that way, that's fine.
235000	236000	That's fine.
236000	237000	I usually don't bother.
237000	241000	How are you doing? And JD's kind of like the guy that's still a music game enthusiast.
241000	242000	Yeah.
242000	248000	I certainly don't dislike music games. I know y'all are thinking about the Parappa thing. We'll talk about that later for sure.
248000	252000	But I don't follow it as closely.
252000	261000	Or somebody will do one of those Bamani jokes that uses one of the newer songs from a 2DX style since they dropped the numbers and went with red and stuff.
261000	263000	And I just go, blink, blink, blink, blink. I don't get it.
263000	266000	But you make those jokes still.
266000	272000	Yeah. Well, so to be fair, my knowledge has kind of trailed off a bit too.
272000	279000	Since they stopped making home versions, I haven't been keeping current because it's a lot more effort to go out to the arcade and find where the newest one is.
279000	281000	So I stop at about 16.
281000	286000	But speaking of going to the arcade, so we went to Roseville Golf Land just out of...
286000	291000	We were in Roseville and you remember there was a golf land there and I was like, oh, it's kind of sad now, but we'll still go.
291000	292000	It really was.
292000	293000	We'll still go.
293000	296000	You played Max 2. We did a round of that and that was fun.
296000	299000	And then that was it because that's all the Bamani they have there really.
299000	302000	Yeah, and we searched the place pretty good, but they didn't have anything.
302000	304000	I think they had Guitar Freaks that was off.
304000	306000	They had a Guitar Hero, I think.
306000	307000	Yeah, but that doesn't...
307000	310000	Well, it doesn't count really because it's not Bamani, but I think it was still there.
310000	312000	They got rid of a lot of stuff. They used to have a Disney rave there.
312000	314000	Disney did not have that anymore.
314000	316000	They got rid of that a while ago.
316000	318000	That surprised me. I thought that thing would be there until the end of time.
319000	322000	But, okay, here's the thing, though, that I have to ask you about.
322000	325000	So, I tweeted a picture saying, like, Throwback Saturday.
325000	329000	And it was a picture of you and Alan playing DDR on the Max 2 machine.
329000	331000	And you played DDR barefoot.
331000	335000	And I was getting tweets back about you playing barefoot.
335000	338000	And, like, nobody was saying the ew cooties thing.
338000	340000	That would have been the thing I would have tweeted.
340000	343000	But people were concerned about the safety of your feet.
343000	345000	So you played DDR machines barefoot.
345000	347000	Well, so for some context, I grew up in Florida.
347000	350000	And, you know, like, people dress differently there.
350000	353000	And so I'm used to wearing sandals all the time.
353000	356000	And so I just started playing DDR barefoot.
356000	359000	And just that's kind of a thing for me.
359000	364000	Part of it is just I have a better sense of where I am on the pad because I can feel it more.
364000	366000	Like, in shoes you kind of lose some of that.
366000	369000	And it's easy to get off and not realize that you're not where you're needing to be.
369000	372000	So it's a lot more responsive for me.
373000	375000	And I don't really find it uncomfortable.
375000	377000	Like, I know some people trip and fall or whatever.
377000	379000	But I think it helps me keep my balance better.
379000	382000	I think it also goes with the whole classic debate.
382000	385000	Like, literally years-old debate about bar versus no bar.
385000	387000	Is things like balance and stuff.
387000	390000	And that's a years-old debate I'm not going to get into tonight.
390000	393000	I mean, I used to be, like, really care about that a lot.
393000	396000	And now I don't. I'm like, oh, you know what? I'm getting older.
396000	399000	You literally grew up. You grew up, right?
400000	402000	We all grew up and it's like, this is not worth arguing about.
402000	404000	I'm like, I'm not in the shape I used to be.
404000	406000	And I kind of fall over sometimes.
406000	408000	Like, oh, hey, this is what this is for.
408000	410000	Oh, I can, like, you know. Anyway.
410000	413000	Awesome. I know you got to play a lot of newer music games, too.
413000	415000	Because you were at round one this week.
415000	418000	I'll save that for your gaming week because you probably want to talk a little bit about that there.
418000	420000	But I want to make sure we introduce as well.
420000	424000	We just name-checked him and here he is in studio gracing us with his presence again.
424000	425000	Alan's back.
425000	426000	Hello.
426000	427000	Hi, Alan. How are you doing?
427000	428000	I'm good. How are you?
428000	432000	I'm great. So, I don't want to spoil your gaming week too much.
432000	436000	But I do find it interesting that you were playing the crap out of Skyrim HD.
436000	437000	Yes.
437000	441000	And then all of a sudden, what happened? You regressed into an older, older skulls game.
441000	445000	I fell back to Morrowind, which I've played.
445000	451000	Morrowind was one of those games where I've played, like, the first two hours of it.
451000	454000	Like, five times over the ten years that it's been out or whatever.
454000	456000	I think it's been out, oh god, 2003? Longer.
456000	459000	But I never got past that hurdle.
459000	465000	And I finally got some mods and just like, I'm going to dive in and play this for real real.
465000	467000	And I'll talk more about it during my gaming week.
467000	468000	Sure.
468000	473000	Yeah, so I was actually going to revisit my new Skyrim hero tonight.
473000	475000	But I've been playing Morrowind.
475000	476000	Nothing wrong with that.
476000	478000	I just got Elder Scrolls on the brain, I guess.
478000	482000	We talk about classic games on this show for a reason. Morrowind is a classic at this point.
483000	487000	Well, I think it always was a classic, probably after the day it came out.
487000	491000	But yeah, certainly a lot of love still for that game.
494000	504000	I can definitely see really awesome things that you could do in Morrowind that honestly were pretty overpowered if you knew how to exploit the mechanic.
504000	511000	It's not like a hack or anything. It's just like, oh, if you do this and this, this is a legit rule that will work.
511000	517000	I can see stuff like that in Morrowind that they just got rid of entirely for Skyrim and possibly Oblivion.
518000	522000	Let me ask you real quick about one other game you've been really into, and then I'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.
522000	527000	Another game that's a couple years old, well at least a year old, but you seem to be really into this.
527000	531000	I'm trying to understand what your fandom is for this game, and that's Mortal Kombat X.
531000	537000	I see you watching YouTubes and stuff, so you're into this right now?
537000	546000	Yeah, the thing is that, I don't know if it was January of this year or last year, because I have no concept of time, because it's the end of the year.
546000	560000	Mortal Kombat XL was announced for consoles, and Mortal Kombat X for PC was kind of like abandonware, because the netcode was terrible, versus mode simply did not work.
560000	570000	Of course, people were rightly furious about it in the forums, and it just seemed like dealing with the PC client was more trouble than it's worth, or at least that's the impression that Netherrealm Studios gave.
570000	582000	Well, all of a sudden I noticed, oh, Mortal Kombat XL, which, XL was like the game of the year edition, with all of the extra costumes and fatalities and stuff,
582000	596000	but there were also four or five characters, like Leatherface, Borycho, Triborg, which is like four characters in one, Jason, Alien, all that stuff came to consoles in the XL package, and PC never got that, and I was kind of salty about it.
596000	609000	But all of a sudden, they're like, oh, if you own the main game, which I got during the Steam sale, and pay like eight bucks, you can upgrade to XL, and oh, by the way, here's the performance patch that should have been in the first month,
609000	620000	here's the upgraded netcode so that versus actually works, so it's like, oh, this game is suddenly viable again, because of the fact that they addressed a bunch of issues that they had sort of ignored.
620000	632000	So, I mean, that kind of made you give the game a second look, what maintains your enthusiasm for it, because I imagine there's a lot of people that watch the fatalities one time, giggle, and then that's it, but you've kind of maintained this.
632000	649000	Mortal Kombat X was really sort of infuriating, because the quality of the fighting system, even though I'm not good enough to really take advantage of it, the juggling, the air combos, the detail put into the graphics and the stages and the characters is really incredible,
649000	658000	and I really feel that X and also the reboot Mortal Kombat 9, where they just told basically the story of the first three and a half, four games over the course of the narrative of the first one,
658000	674000	really are the best Mortal Kombat games that they've made, it doesn't mean that the previous ones, like I know Shaolin Monks on PS2, which is sort of an adventure fighting game, was really good, so it doesn't mean that the other previous games were bad, but my point being is that
674000	682000	There's a right way to reboot a game and there's a wrong way to reboot a game, and Mortal Kombat did a very good job of that, whereas there's been plenty of other franchises that have failed.
682000	692000	If someone really loved Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, they may even say, I might play that for nostalgia, but I actually would rather just play the new Mortal Kombats because they're the same thing but better.
692000	706000	The DLC model that Warner Brothers and other realm studios introduced for X back before XL and the Alien and Jason Pak was really extortionary and awful.
706000	729000	Like it's one of the worst DLC models I've ever seen, where there was a collector's edition that cost like 70 bucks, but then Goro didn't come with it, and Goro was like $10 on his own, and then there was other characters that were like $20 on top of that, and it's like this, if you bought everything the first two months it came out, I almost felt like you could spend $100 or more on it.
729000	732000	Which is why you always wait for the Game of the Year edition.
732000	748000	I also want Warner Brothers to know, not that they listen to the show, but just in case, I want them to know they lost a sale of the game because of that to me, because I knew in the back of my mind they're gonna repackage this in a year as the Game of the Year edition, and sure enough they did, but by that time I moved on.
748000	759000	I never picked up Mortal Kombat, which is tragic because I still recognize, you know what, it's a pretty darn good game, but I think they really screwed up with the whole value thing. They really, really screwed up with it.
759000	779000	They weren't the first and definitely won't be the last that does stuff like that, where there's a collector's edition, oh but you can also get the season pass, like shadiness, but it was just so flagrant that you're gonna pay out the notes for these characters, and if you're into tournaments and stuff you have to have them.
779000	788000	And I know, I'm sure if I listened to go to the OLR archives from a year, a year and a half ago, there were several stories about how disgusting the DLC model was.
788000	790000	Which you can do at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
790000	791000	Yes.
791000	797000	Hey, by the way, Loki, what do you want to bet? Infinite means infinite DLC. Getting ahead of myself?
797000	800000	They will have a lot of DLC, I guarantee that.
800000	802000	Infinite means infinite DLC.
803000	811000	Because right now there's no X-Men going to be coming to the movie, because apparently for the Marvel Cinematic rights, which has, I don't understand.
811000	813000	But the minute they sign that contract, DLC.
813000	815000	Of course, of course.
815000	816000	It sounds plausible.
816000	826000	But it doesn't make any sense, because we don't have the rights to the Marvel Cinematic universe. It's not a fucking movie, it's a goddamn video game, what the hell does that have to do with anything?
826000	832000	$5,000 space on the wheel of plausibility. The minute the X-Men thing gets signed, DLC.
832000	837000	They stopped doing X-Men because they can't further license off of it. If they want to make a movie, they can't.
837000	842000	So that's why they've started replacing X-Men with Inhumans. Which, don't even get me started, it's a whole thing.
842000	848000	Alright, alright, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Sorry, it's totally my fault, but I felt it still was a little topical.
848000	851000	So some companies still have some things to learn about DLC, clearly.
851000	863000	Yes, so the fact that, oh, this isn't abandoned where they faked it, because it ran really crappy on my decent computer before the performance patch that came out with this.
863000	873000	Depending on which stage I got, it really had lag to it. Now it's a smooth 60 frames per second, regardless of the stage, because they optimized the port.
873000	876000	Because obviously it was made for consoles first, PC second.
877000	886000	And I was like, okay, so I paid whatever, eight, ten bucks. I got all these characters. It works now. I could play online mode versus if I wanted to, which I absolutely don't because I'm terrible.
886000	895000	And I was like, okay, now I can experience this game and have it perform well and see really what an incredible product it is.
895000	903000	It's a really solid fighting game, and of course the fatalities are as realistic and grosser than they've ever been in X.
903000	910000	They're not really campy at all. So there's that whole aspect, which is a totally separate thing about violence or whatever in video games.
910000	918000	But it was so well made, and I never got to appreciate it because of how their DLC character model was so extortionary.
918000	923000	It left a really bad taste in everyone's mouth, and enough time had passed where I had forgiven that.
923000	929000	Right, right. All right, well, we'll talk to you more about the games you've been playing lately a little bit later on in the show.
929000	933000	But I want to get to our kickoff topic tonight, which ironically is a little bit about our gaming weeks.
933000	938000	And I think for a lot of you out there, your gaming weeks, because we talked about this a little bit last week,
938000	944000	but a game that many people have been waiting ten years for was finally released this past week.
944000	948000	So one of the big things that happened in gaming news was the release of Final Fantasy XV.
948000	955000	And I have to give Square Enix some kudos for thinking of this idea, whether you like it or not.
955000	959000	They've been really good at pushing Final Fantasy XV all over social media,
959000	966000	because this game is really designed to use the crap out of that share button on the PlayStation 4,
966000	971000	and even equivalent stuff on the Xbox One, because of this whole selfie thing that Prompto does.
971000	977000	One of the characters takes pictures throughout the game, and the game is practically like just setting it up.
977000	980000	It's not begging you to share. You don't get any incentive for sharing, but it's like,
980000	986000	it is so easy to share these photographs that look really, really good and serve as a little bit of a memory of your journey.
986000	992000	So for that reason, I think even the people that aren't playing Final Fantasy XV kind of can't get away from it,
992000	994000	because it's everywhere, right?
994000	997000	That's me. I don't have a PS4, so I'm not playing Final Fantasy XV,
997000	1002000	but I have several different friends who've been sharing photos, and the fanfic writes itself.
1002000	1004000	The photos are really good.
1004000	1006000	Well, what do you think? Let's start with you.
1006000	1010000	You've even mentioned to me, I'm more of a Final Fantasy outsider.
1010000	1014000	I played VII and VIII, and you've said on the show before, you don't play a lot of modern console systems.
1014000	1017000	You focus on music games and stuff from PS2.
1017000	1018000	And Nintendo.
1018000	1023000	But I know you've watched me play some Final Fantasy XV throughout the weekend,
1023000	1026000	and plus what you see on the social media.
1026000	1030000	What are your impressions of XV compared to these other games?
1030000	1033000	It looks pretty fun. It seems pretty straightforward.
1033000	1037000	I've played a bunch of side quests, and that's, to me, the kind of gamer I am.
1037000	1040000	I like doing side quests more than the regular game half the time.
1040000	1042000	So it seems like it'd be pretty fun.
1042000	1043000	Okay, cool.
1043000	1047000	Loki, you bought the game, but you've barely touched it, right?
1047000	1049000	What's your impressions on XV?
1049000	1051000	Yeah, so I purchased the game.
1051000	1055000	I had pre-ordered it the week before, and the fucking PlayStation decided,
1055000	1059000	oh, preload that shit? Fuck that. I'm not doing that.
1059000	1062000	And so I had the manly go in there to figure out how to get it to start downloading,
1062000	1064000	and it finally got the download.
1064000	1068000	And it was just about the time to unlock, and it did, and it's all okay, ready to go.
1068000	1069000	I'm like, cool.
1069000	1071000	That was a pretty fast download.
1071000	1075000	Went in the plate, and oh, sorry, it's not fully fucking downloaded yet.
1075000	1079000	But hey, you can play this endless battle mode or something like that.
1079000	1080000	So that's what I did.
1080000	1084000	It was basically that demo area, and you just run around and kill goblins.
1084000	1086000	And I did that for about five minutes.
1086000	1089000	I got bored, and I'm like, I'm just going to play Skyrim while this downloads.
1089000	1092000	And then, unfortunately, that was the last I checked of it.
1092000	1098000	So I do like the new battle system a little bit better than what it was in the demo previously.
1098000	1104000	I still don't understand if there's a better way to switch weapons between,
1104000	1107000	because before it used to be really easy to switch weapons and combo that stuff.
1107000	1111000	But it was cumbersome to fight, and then now it's easier to fight,
1111000	1113000	but it's cumbersome to switch weapons.
1113000	1115000	You mean just hitting the D-pad to switch weapons?
1115000	1118000	Yeah, but it doesn't have the same flow to it.
1118000	1121000	Okay, you feel that break in the rhythm when you do it.
1121000	1124000	Yeah, so it doesn't feel the same.
1124000	1127000	But I like it, so we'll see.
1127000	1128000	I'm kind of with you.
1128000	1131000	I don't hate the combat as much as I thought I would based on the demo.
1131000	1133000	They really did clean it up from that demo.
1133000	1135000	And I'm actually surprised myself.
1135000	1137000	I thought I would only be able to play the wait mode,
1137000	1139000	but I've been playing the normal battle.
1139000	1142000	Yeah, I tried wait mode, but I wasn't really waiting a whole ton.
1142000	1147000	Even the wait mode, you can't wait forever because there is a bar that ticks down.
1148000	1151000	So, I don't know. But it was alright.
1151000	1152000	I just haven't gotten to play it.
1152000	1156000	And it's unfortunately because of an oversharing time.
1156000	1159000	It's because of family drama.
1159000	1162000	Because this goes all the way back to Thanksgiving.
1162000	1165000	But apparently my sister and her husband are going through a thing.
1165000	1167000	And I'm getting dragged.
1167000	1168000	I didn't realize you were going to air this on air.
1168000	1170000	I'm going to get dragged into it.
1170000	1174000	And so last night, I was all ready because my wife had gone out with her friend.
1174000	1176000	I put the kids to bed, or I was about to put the kids to bed.
1176000	1178000	I'm like, cool. I mean, you finally get some time.
1178000	1180000	You get a few hours to play Final Fantasy XV.
1180000	1182000	Are you sure you want to bring all the listeners into it too?
1182000	1184000	Yeah, sure. Why not? Because I don't care.
1184000	1188000	And so as soon as I'm about ready to have my wife come,
1188000	1191000	I'm like, man, you're home early. What are you doing home early?
1191000	1196000	And she's like, oh, you need to go over to your mom's house or something.
1196000	1198000	I'm like, why do I have to do that?
1198000	1204000	And it's like, oh, and apparently she up and took the kid and left and stuff like that.
1204000	1207000	And it's just drama. And I'm like, why am I being dragged into this?
1207000	1209000	I just wanted to play a fucking game.
1209000	1212000	Just like on Thanksgiving, all I wanted was fucking turkey and mash potatoes and gravy.
1212000	1214000	Is that too much to ask?
1214000	1217000	I mean, I dragged into a mediation shit. Whatever.
1217000	1221000	So long story short, and this is only going to continue on and it's hell.
1221000	1230000	But long story short, I haven't been able to play it because my wife has been hogging the TV to play fucking Excite Truck.
1230000	1232000	At least she has good taste.
1232000	1239000	So I haven't had a chance to play more of it. I will get to it, though, because I do want to play it, but I just.
1239000	1245000	I have and I could have streamed it to my my console last night to play, but I've actually been trying to do more programing unity.
1245000	1247000	So, yeah. All right.
1247000	1250000	Well, I my thoughts are with you to get through this situation.
1250000	1256000	Someone who grew up with also a tumultuous family, if they're if they're going to be like, I'll put my business in the street.
1256000	1260000	There's nothing wrong with being like, I'll put your business in the street, too, if you're going to drag me into it.
1260000	1263000	So I'm totally not judging.
1263000	1268000	All right. Fair enough. Hey, guys, I have yet to visit chat this episode. I apologize.
1268000	1270000	We're so chatty here in studio, but I do want to remind you guys.
1270000	1274000	We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of Geeks Network of Vogue Network dot com.
1274000	1277000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
1277000	1282000	And we do have a live chat room. And I definitely want to get your thoughts on Final Fantasy 15 as well.
1282000	1286000	Or Loki's drama, if you want live dot vogue network dot com.
1287000	1292000	Rachel here says, I definitely want to get Final Fantasy 15 on Steam, plus the other Final Fantasy I've been missing there.
1292000	1296000	Well, buddy, you're going to be waiting a little while because they didn't release Final Fantasy 15 on Steam.
1296000	1299000	They have not confirmed a PC release of this game at all.
1299000	1302000	So did it come out on Xbox one? It did come out on Xbox.
1302000	1306000	OK, so it wasn't there was that parody, but there is no PC release.
1306000	1312000	That means you've been like by 2020. Yeah, I'm not saying it's never going to happen, but it's just not happening right now.
1312000	1319000	Back on the social media and all that stuff I was talking about, Dungeon Buster in chat says, yeah, I'm surprised how good a lot of the pictures are.
1319000	1324000	Yeah, because what's interesting to me is that a lot of the pictures, like there are things that didn't happen.
1324000	1327000	There are things that, here's your favorite word again.
1327000	1331000	There are things that plausibly could have happened on the day's journey.
1331000	1334000	But the thing that gets me is that Prompto like takes these selfies, right?
1334000	1336000	You take pictures of him and his buddies and all that stuff.
1336000	1341000	And it's like, I never saw Prompto stop, gather everybody up, extend his arm and take a picture.
1341000	1350000	So the game takes some kind of liberal decisions with the way it presents the photos because there are things that it's this very interesting hybrid.
1350000	1355000	They're not necessarily things you actually watched happen or things like that, but some of it is.
1355000	1363000	But then it kind of mixes it with things that, well, these are things that happened that day to remind you about the same day because you can save these pictures or tweet them or whatever you want.
1363000	1368000	Yeah, it reminds me like I've seen some online where he's like taking crotch shots and stuff like that.
1368000	1374000	So if that's not intentional, then what the fuck, Square Enix?
1374000	1377000	Yeah, no, I think what happened, okay, I tweeted the crotch shot.
1377000	1385000	And what happened with that, I think, is that it probably was intending to take a face picture of the prince, Prince Noctis, while they're driving.
1385000	1390000	But sometimes while you're driving, he just up and sits on the hood of the car for a little bit because he's a prince.
1390000	1392000	He can do whatever the fuck he wants, right?
1392000	1397000	And so I think for some reason, Prompto, the code was like, take a face picture of Noctis.
1397000	1401000	But the game didn't line that up with when Noctis is seated.
1401000	1409000	So for some reason, it just took a picture of his crotch because that's where his head would have been had he stayed in his fucking seat like you're supposed to do in a moving vehicle.
1409000	1413000	But this is Final Fantasy and I suppose magic protects them. I don't know.
1413000	1415000	They're just giving us fan service.
1415000	1416000	I guess.
1416000	1427000	I can't wait until we have the news article where some teenager is mimicking how they're driving and riding in the car and getting in a car accident and die.
1427000	1431000	Akuma in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,
1431000	1434000	Sky, it's a game. I don't want to see my character goofing too much.
1434000	1439000	You know what's interesting though is that's what a lot of people seem to really like about this game.
1440000	1446000	I don't want to get too far back into this debate about the whole, the cast is all men, really.
1446000	1451000	Yes, there are women, but they're not part of the main four.
1451000	1456000	You have a group of four that doesn't really change, at least in the opening chapters.
1456000	1462000	I'm really trying to not be spoilery here, but you guys know that debate that's been going on and all that stuff, right?
1463000	1474000	But, to the game's credit, and a lot of people really like this about the game is that they're showing elements of friendship that a lot of games don't really show.
1474000	1475000	You know what I mean?
1475000	1485000	Even though a lot of people say, oh, it's the bro down, ho down, there's things that are on a much deeper level than just the bra, bra, and all that stuff.
1485000	1486000	You know what I mean?
1486000	1493000	It's like men that can have empathy and really sensitive, sweet relationships with each other and have it not be gay at all.
1493000	1503000	Yeah, I don't want to say feminine men because I don't want to do, but maybe the proper thing would be men expressing femininity.
1503000	1507000	But maybe I'm also the wrong person to state this.
1507000	1509000	So like Metro.
1509000	1514000	I don't even know if that's the right word because that's a different thing.
1514000	1515000	But it's just interesting.
1515000	1524000	Ignis will say at one part, he'll say, oh, your button has been undone on your shirt and you need to sew that up when we get back to camp or I'm going to do it for you.
1524000	1526000	Is he mom?
1526000	1527000	What is this?
1527000	1531000	It's vulnerable masculinity.
1531000	1532000	Yes.
1532000	1533000	Yes.
1533000	1534000	Vulnerable masculinity.
1534000	1535000	Yes.
1535000	1536000	And we need more of that in gaming.
1536000	1540000	It's really, especially in American culture, hard to find good portrayals of that.
1540000	1541000	So I'm really glad that they're going there.
1541000	1557000	So it's interesting because, yeah, even though there is definitely a lack of women in the main group, there's not a lack of emotion and things like that and that deeper level of friendship.
1557000	1559000	So it's very, very interesting to me.
1559000	1562000	And a lot of people, again, give the game a lot of credit for that.
1562000	1564000	Some people can do without it.
1564000	1568000	Some people just want to get in there and kill things, which is fine.
1568000	1575000	Okay. Alan, quickly, you've also watched the game, observed the game a little bit. What are your quick thoughts? What's your quick take on this before I get into it?
1575000	1578000	Because I've spent 12 hours with it this week. I want to get into it a little.
1578000	1587000	I just love how you're in such an open world, like you're just running through these sprawling deserts.
1587000	1596000	And of course, Final Fantasy 13 got all this hate for, oh, it gets better 35 hours in and it's Final Fantasy Corridor 13 and just run down the hallway, blah, blah, blah.
1596000	1604000	Here is like, you know what? Here you go. We'll give you a waypoint, but just explore this vast BS because this is what you people want.
1604000	1607000	Interesting when you consider this game started as a 13 spinoff.
1607000	1608000	Yeah.
1608000	1613000	The whole design in that regard is like the antithesis of 13 in a way. Just interesting.
1613000	1618000	With the combat, it does look akin to Kingdom Hearts in that it's more action-based.
1618000	1624000	The problem, I know that Noctis can zoom around and warp to different enemies.
1624000	1634000	But there's a certain point between him and the other three people in the party where it sort of looks like it's so frenetic that it kind of looks like just bodies falling around and being thrown around.
1634000	1642000	There's kind of a chaos that's not appealing to the combat, just from what I've seen. I don't know how it plays.
1643000	1653000	It's like more of a style decision than a mechanic. I don't know. But sometimes it looks really fast-paced and precise.
1653000	1658000	And other times, I just see bodies being flung around. I can barely understand what's happening.
1658000	1666000	Because you've been doing side quests most of the time that I've been watching it, so I don't really know how the story is or what's even going on.
1667000	1672000	Well, what's interesting is that there's a movie that they put out on Blu-ray, and there's an anime.
1672000	1675000	Which, by the way, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at live.vognetwork.com is saying,
1675000	1679000	Actually, if you watched a Brotherhood anime, yes, Ignis is kind of like the mom.
1679000	1682000	Well, I wouldn't know that because I didn't watch the anime and I didn't watch the movie.
1682000	1690000	And I was going to watch it before the game, but then it's like I waited so long to get the game, install the game and all that stuff, because I didn't get it on Monday.
1690000	1694000	I had to wait until Tuesday. By the time I was all set up and ready to go, I just wanted to get in and play the damn game.
1694000	1700000	And I almost was kind of like, no, if I can't enjoy the game for what it is without all that other stuff, then that's a problem.
1700000	1705000	Now, for me, I know a lot of people are saying, oh, you need to see it because it fills in all this stuff.
1705000	1710000	I'm not lot. Like, I understand what's going on without it.
1710000	1717000	I understand there might be like, here's from another perspective and this other stuff that I might be missing out on.
1717000	1721000	But I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by not having seen that.
1721000	1728000	I really don't. But maybe after I go back and watch it, I'll be like, yeah, you guys need to watch that before you play the game.
1728000	1730000	But I'm still kind of like, I don't know how I feel about that.
1730000	1737000	BioWare has taken on a really nasty habit. It was really bad with Dragon Age Inquisition, which I had a lot of problems with.
1737000	1741000	And that technically, no, you didn't need to read the supplemental lore.
1741000	1747000	But there was so much of it, especially with Empress Selene and that whole storyline where you go to her ball.
1748000	1753000	A lot of the characters that you interact with that only have one or two lines of dialogue are major players in the novel.
1753000	1756000	And you would know who the fuck they were if you had read the book.
1756000	1759000	Otherwise, you're like, why do I care who the snip shit is and why he's talking to me?
1759000	1763000	And then you read the book and it's like, oh, they were a major player.
1763000	1770000	It's just all this stuff where there are parts of the game that really go over your head unless you've read the supplemental information.
1770000	1773000	My point being, I hope this is not a trend.
1774000	1777000	Well, I will say this. The game does hit the ground running.
1777000	1779000	You know what I mean? The plot hits the ground running.
1779000	1786000	But I kind of was able to fill in the gaps, I think, maybe just based on what previews I've seen online and all this stuff.
1786000	1793000	But maybe that's part of it, is that you're not going to be ready to hit the ground running with the game without maybe some of the setup.
1793000	1796000	I don't know. Just depending on how you play games, I suppose.
1796000	1805000	But anyway, it's funny you brought up Dragon Age Inquisition because honestly, my gut thought on the game after spending 12 hours with it this week.
1805000	1807000	Which I know is nothing compared to some people.
1807000	1811000	But for me, the guy that can't stick with one game for very long.
1811000	1815000	Alan, this is an anomaly, right? How much I've played this game this week, right?
1815000	1816000	Yeah.
1816000	1819000	I feel like this...
1819000	1823000	I was going to say, it's not so much how much you play in a week, but whether or not you finish it.
1823000	1826000	Because you played the hell out of No Man's Sky that first week.
1826000	1828000	Yeah, that's true. That's true.
1828000	1832000	Which is funny because I played it again this week, but I'll talk a little more about that in-game movies.
1832000	1841000	But as far as the Dragon Age Inquisition, I feel like this game is Square Enix's version of Dragon Age Inquisition.
1841000	1845000	And that's the best way I can describe this game and what's weird about it.
1845000	1851000	And that's not a bad thing. I love Dragon Age Inquisition, but this game feels like Square's version of Dragon Age Inquisition.
1851000	1855000	It's insert Final Fantasy into Dragon Age Inquisition.
1855000	1860000	You know, the combat actually kind of reminded me a bit of Tales of Symphonia, except in 3D.
1860000	1866000	Yeah, and not the combat, literally, but the open world-ness definitely reminded me of that Hinterlands thing and all that.
1866000	1868000	And the side quests everywhere.
1868000	1869000	Yes.
1869000	1870000	Everywhere side quests.
1870000	1875000	And even some of the... I don't know, there's just a lot about it that really reminds me of my time with Dragon Age Inquisition.
1875000	1879000	So I know people are not going to agree with me on that, but that's my thought.
1879000	1883000	So it's like this game feels like Kingdom Hearts mixed with Dragon Age Inquisition.
1883000	1885000	But do you know what game I left out of my comparison there?
1885000	1886000	What?
1886000	1887000	Any other Final Fantasy game.
1887000	1889000	Yeah. Yeah.
1889000	1895000	And that's the weird thing about this Final Fantasy game, is that I can sit here and say, it's a good game.
1895000	1901000	Actually, it's a great game. It's a wonderful game. Does it have flaws? Of course it has flaws. A lot of great games do.
1901000	1904000	It's a great game. It's really not Final Fantasy.
1904000	1906000	It's so outrageously a side story game.
1906000	1907000	This is not a Final Fantasy game.
1908000	1912000	It's a Gaiden or whatever. That was made a blue chip property.
1912000	1918000	I am telling you, this is so funny to me that people will not play 11 or 14 because they're MMOs.
1918000	1922000	And I get that. I understand that. A monthly fee on top of the regular fee, that's a lot to ask for.
1922000	1929000	But I'm telling you, having played the plots in the game, 14 is way more a Final Fantasy game.
1929000	1932000	11 is way more a Final Fantasy game than 15.
1932000	1934000	I can see that.
1934000	1938000	14 does feel like Final Fantasy. Absolutely.
1938000	1940000	Where's the White Mage?
1943000	1945000	There's a lot of weird stuff about this game.
1945000	1955000	Again, I think the game's great, but it's very, very apparent this was a spinoff game that got injected into the mainline game to recoup the costs.
1955000	1959000	And so, I don't think that's going to hurt anything in the long run.
1959000	1962000	In the meantime, I haven't looked at chat yet, but I'm sure people will say,
1962000	1966000	Rob, things are going to evolve, things are going to change, and so forth.
1966000	1971000	But there's also a lot of people that have really pushed back on some of these changes.
1971000	1978000	I think a lot of people haven't been big fans of 13 or 12 because combat has slowly shifted away from the active time.
1978000	1980000	Well, they haven't had ATB since 10.
1980000	1984000	Yeah. And so, we ride off 11 and 14 because they're MMOs. ATB's not going to work.
1984000	1988000	But 12 and 13 had very different types of battle systems.
1988000	1995000	And then 12 had that disadvantage of it came out at a really bad time right before the new consoles came out.
1995000	1996000	Or PS3 was already out.
1996000	1997000	Yeah, a lot of people really skipped it.
1997000	2006000	And then 13 had all that, the story is BS, which I feel isn't true if you stick with it long enough, but I understand why people hate it.
2006000	2010000	And the whole hallway stuff, so I think a lot of people were apprehensive looking at 13.
2010000	2017000	So, it's weird to me that you play this game and the very first thing you see is a Final Fantasy for long-time fans and first-timers.
2017000	2022000	And I'm like, really? Because this is nothing like the other games. Nothing.
2022000	2025000	Yeah, it had very little to do with the classic style.
2025000	2029000	I understand. Yes, they put the classic soundtracks in it. It's cute as hell.
2029000	2031000	They have the little sprites. They have throwbacks.
2031000	2034000	Their car has a chocobog decal on it.
2034000	2036000	Right? There's a guy named Sid.
2036000	2041000	Okay, I understand all that, but again, it's more a spin-off game.
2041000	2049000	It's more Final Fantasy X-2. It's more Final Fantasy Type-0. It's more that than it is a mainline game to me.
2049000	2056000	I feel more Final Fantasy in XIV, which many of you have written off because of the monthly fee, I understand, than I feel in XV.
2056000	2059000	Now, all that aside, again, I think the game is great.
2059000	2065000	Because if I can just take that hat off and go, okay, this isn't really the Final Fantasy I thought it was going to be,
2065000	2071000	but just as a game, there's a lot to explore. It's gorgeous.
2071000	2077000	The battle system, although at first, again, because I'm putting my Final Fantasy hat on,
2077000	2082000	I'm like, this battle system is such a huge departure. It sucks. It's Kingdom Hearts.
2082000	2087000	But once I kind of let that go and I take that hat off, I'm like, actually, this is kind of a lot of fun.
2087000	2091000	It's kind of fun to go from the warp points to there, and I am playing it live.
2091000	2094000	I'm playing on the non-weight mode. I'm playing on normal mode.
2094000	2102000	It's kind of fun to bounce around and kind of using your heels a different way by using Ignis' ability to regroup everybody.
2102000	2108000	And the death system is interesting, where you don't actually die, but you lose HP until somebody revives you.
2108000	2111000	And then only if all that goes to zero do you actually die.
2111000	2115000	There's actually nuances about the combat system, and they're like, actually, this is kind of fun to play.
2115000	2118000	So I'm enjoying it in that regard.
2118000	2125000	Side quests, they lack a little bit of character to me, but so do side quests and MMOs and stuff.
2125000	2129000	And so do side quests in Dragon Age Inquisition or any other game.
2129000	2135000	There's always going to be fetch quests that's like, I need this. Why? I just need it. Go get it.
2135000	2143000	Yeah, there's only really certain ways you can do a side quest.
2143000	2148000	Whenever an MMO comes out and people say, oh, this is just WoW with a different coat of paint on it.
2148000	2155000	It's like, well, yes, because WoW found the methods that you can do this in an online game and have it work.
2155000	2158000	So you can't really escape that formula.
2158000	2163000	So side quests are always going to be, kill 10 deer, bring me five frogs.
2163000	2165000	And bring me five frogs of a different color.
2165000	2168000	Which is literally, you go to that because it's literally a quest I was doing the other day.
2168000	2172000	Yeah, go to the lake and find me frogs and they could be anywhere.
2173000	2178000	Let's see, ActDeft is asking, is Final Fantasy XV on the PlayStation 4 Pro worth it?
2178000	2183000	Not yet, because the patch that does the frame rate updates I think is out this next week.
2183000	2188000	It's not out right now. But the game looks gorgeous as it is.
2188000	2191000	And I understand there's two different graphics modes.
2191000	2195000	And I'm on the light mode because they say light will give you better performance.
2195000	2199000	And I'm more for better frame rate than I am for the picture.
2199000	2202000	But I think even on light it looks gorgeous.
2202000	2206000	This is a gorgeous, gorgeous game with varying sceneries.
2206000	2209000	Yes, you start in the desert and you're in the desert for a little while.
2209000	2213000	But you leave that and you go to other areas that look really, really pretty.
2213000	2216000	And Final Fantasy games, that has always been a strength of theirs.
2216000	2220000	Square Enix knows how to push the graphic limitations of the systems they're developing for.
2220000	2224000	They've done this ever since the original Final Fantasy, really.
2224000	2227000	So it's no different in Final Fantasy XV. I'm loving that.
2227000	2230000	Soundtrack is gorgeous.
2230000	2233000	Yes, you can listen to soundtracks from other games.
2233000	2235000	But I kind of do that in the car.
2235000	2239000	But the battle theme I just had happen, which was a new battle theme.
2239000	2242000	Because I think I was in a newer area. It was awesome.
2242000	2244000	I'm liking discovering things like that.
2244000	2247000	So anyway, I could go on and on.
2247000	2250000	But at the end of the day, I do think the game is interesting.
2250000	2253000	I want to wait to talk about the story.
2253000	2258000	Because I'm only on Chapter 3, yet my characters are level 28.
2258000	2261000	Because I can't stop doing side quests.
2261000	2263000	But is that a bad thing?
2263000	2267000	I don't think so. I think that just shows I'm kind of into what's going on.
2267000	2274000	And I think, again, part of the relationship unfolding and seeing all of that and how the characters interact with each other.
2274000	2278000	While there are some stock lines where I kind of go, stop saying that.
2278000	2281000	You say that every time we do something, stop saying that.
2281000	2286000	There's other things that you kind of discover as you move on that are really cool.
2286000	2288000	Like those car rides.
2288000	2292000	If you want to go from one area to another, you can get in the car and you can have Ignis drive the car.
2292000	2295000	I don't like to do the driving because I'll flip the car over a cliff.
2295000	2297000	So I usually let Ignis do the driving.
2297000	2300000	So he drives and so literally you are just sitting there waiting.
2300000	2302000	It's like flight points in an MMO.
2302000	2305000	You're sitting there waiting for your car to go from one point to the other.
2305000	2309000	Now, they sweeten the pot a little bit because you can listen to classic soundtracks.
2309000	2311000	You can use the shop while you're in the car going.
2311000	2315000	There's like a base shop, like the internet or something you can do.
2315000	2319000	But sometimes you want to pay attention because Prompto might speak up and say,
2319000	2322000	Hey, I want to go down there and get a picture. Let's go do that.
2322000	2329000	And there's something about that that makes the game, like it kind of elevates the immersion for me that I really enjoy.
2329000	2330000	About that.
2330000	2333000	Where you go, yeah, go ahead. Go on down there. We'll meet you.
2333000	2334000	And then keep driving.
2334000	2336000	Hit the gas. Ha ha ha. Dumbass.
2337000	2339000	No, you can't do that.
2339000	2341000	But that's what bros do.
2342000	2346000	That's true. But these guys are more sensitive bros. They're not going to do that to each other.
2346000	2348000	So, anyway.
2349000	2351000	I almost said that to my son the other day.
2351000	2352000	What did you say?
2352000	2358000	I'm like, because I was parked too far in my driveway, too far to the right and I wanted to straighten the car out.
2358000	2363000	And so I'm all, just go by the front door so that you're not on the way to the car and I'm just going to straighten the car.
2363000	2366000	And I backed out and I told my other son, I'm like, okay, let's leave him here.
2366000	2371000	He comes looking out and he's like, are you leaving me?
2371000	2372000	Alright.
2372000	2373000	Yes, I am.
2373000	2375000	Chatters, if you've played 15, what are your thoughts?
2375000	2378000	Live.vognetwork.com. Try to keep them tweet sized.
2378000	2381000	I want to read your thoughts real quick here on those of you that have spent some time with the game.
2381000	2385000	Dungeon Buster says, too many side quests is never a bad thing, Sky.
2385000	2392000	Whenever an open world game allows me to cut free from the main story, it's off I go to become a walking god before coming back to it and steamroll the next few boxes.
2393000	2394000	Yes, me too.
2394000	2404000	And to be fair, it is a very Final Fantasy way for me to play games is to power level the crap out of my characters and then you go back and you can kill the boss easy peasy.
2404000	2407000	Like, and I've always done that in Final Fantasy games.
2407000	2409000	So this game kind of lets you still do that but in a different way.
2409000	2417000	I mean, how come in Final Fantasy games you will do all the side quests for the XP and gil but in a Pokemon game you have to keep the story moving.
2417000	2420000	You can't linger or else it will drive you insane and you'll put the game down.
2421000	2423000	How is that different?
2423000	2424000	I'm sorry, say that one more time.
2424000	2432000	In Final Fantasy you'll do all the side quests and not necessarily go to a new location or major plot point in the main story because you're doing side quests.
2432000	2443000	But when you're playing a game like Pokemon, you catch what you can and keep it moving because if you like, oh I want to catch this, this, and this and grind my Pokemon to this, this, and this, like you can't play the game that way.
2443000	2445000	Well easy, there must not be that enjoyable.
2446000	2450000	Like, I just see it's a different style. I know it's a different style of game but...
2450000	2454000	It is. I can't, I don't know if I can put my finger on what it is.
2454000	2462000	Like, I think maybe with Pokemon they don't track as easily. That's one big thing.
2462000	2463000	That's what the Pokedex is for.
2463000	2467000	No, I'm not talking about necessarily that. I'm talking about the actual side quests and things like that.
2468000	2471000	You kind of have to remember what you're doing and that can sometimes be a bear.
2471000	2477000	Whereas when you're tracking in a game like Dragon Age or Final Fantasy, you see everything, you see your agenda and your list.
2477000	2479000	You have a journal. You have a quest journal.
2479000	2481000	Exactly. And you know my memory is crap.
2481000	2483000	So I think that makes it a little...
2483000	2488000	Actually, that system you mentioned, if that came to Pokemon, I would love that. I would really, really love that.
2488000	2491000	But it's not, so it is what it is.
2491000	2495000	I know some of the older Final Fantasy games have a bunch of side quests and some of them are missable.
2495000	2498000	Like, if you don't do this at this point in the story, you don't get to do it at all.
2498000	2499000	So that's, you know...
2499000	2504000	Hey, you know that character you wanted to be in your party? Well, you missed him.
2504000	2505000	Yeah.
2505000	2511000	Alright, let's see. Go into the chat again over at live.vognetwork.com and looking for some comments here.
2511000	2518000	DungeonBuster says, I love it when a game lets you explore, though. I'm a sucker for poking around and seeing if there might be something cool hidden in a forgotten corner.
2518000	2524000	In the first dungeon, I didn't want to leave when the quest was done because I wanted to keep exploring what might be behind those locked doors or the next cave.
2524000	2527000	Anyway, I want to go to the Skype line real quick, a little bit out of character.
2527000	2532000	But I'm getting a phone call because somebody's listening in his car.
2532000	2538000	And this happens all the time. Of course he feels very opposite how I do on this game.
2538000	2541000	So he said, you need to let me call in, so I'm doing it.
2541000	2545000	Welcome to the show, everybody. Live from his car, Shane.
2545000	2549000	Live from the Del Taco drive-thru, basically.
2549000	2553000	Alright, you're a little quiet, so just make sure you're speaking into the speaker.
2553000	2554000	Okay, is that better?
2554000	2557000	I guess. What are your thoughts on Final Fantasy XV?
2557000	2560000	I'm ready to trade it in because it's not fun.
2560000	2564000	Why? I need more whys. Why aren't you enjoying the game?
2564000	2571000	Let me preface this with I'm about, I think last count said like 16 or 17 hours.
2571000	2578000	And I am at the end of chapter 7, I think.
2578000	2583000	And one, there's no story still. I'm bored out of my mind.
2583000	2586000	I don't like the combat. The characters aren't interesting.
2586000	2591000	I don't think it particularly looks good as a PS4 game.
2591000	2596000	And it's just like a piece of crap.
2596000	2598000	I think that pretty much sums it up.
2598000	2601000	A piece of crap, really? Like, I can understand.
2602000	2614000	For a game that has been 10 years in the making, I think I hold garbage games like No Man's Sky in higher regard.
2614000	2619000	Like, I tried to like this game. I'm still trying to power through it just to say I beat it.
2619000	2621000	But I'm not having a good time.
2621000	2630000	And it feels like you're supposed to already understand everything that's going on in the game, but they never tell you anything.
2630000	2631000	Ever.
2631000	2633000	Did you watch the movie or the anime or any of that?
2633000	2641000	I watched, okay, first of all, if you're supposed to watch all this extra media to understand the story for a game, there's something wrong with your game.
2641000	2643000	I'll agree with that.
2643000	2649000	But I did watch Kingsglaive, which actually was pretty good. I liked that movie. I didn't watch the anime, though.
2650000	2651000	Huh.
2651000	2659000	But the combat never gets fun. All I do is like, so I ride in my chocobo around, which is kind of okay.
2659000	2665000	But if I'm doing anything else, I turn on my, at one point you get an MP3 player, like the music in your car.
2665000	2669000	I just put on Final Fantasy XI music because the music in this game is so forgettable.
2669000	2678000	I completely disagree. There are, there's like the battle songs when you're doing the quest for going out to get the cargo in the car and you get to this newer area.
2678000	2680000	Like that battle song is amazing.
2680000	2682000	I don't agree at all.
2682000	2692000	I was going to say Ziba in chat and Act Deft as well are both saying in unison to you saying you don't like the game. Why? And they both said it's not Pokemon.
2692000	2698000	That's not true because I play other games that aren't Pokemon. Granted, I have over 100 hours in Pokemon Moon already.
2698000	2709000	But no, the game, it's just, it feels very lifeless and hollow. Like, kind of like a cash grab game, sort of.
2709000	2714000	The interactions between the characters do nothing for you. You don't, the, like I would think.
2714000	2719000	I don't find the characters endearing. Like Prompto is sometimes kind of funny, but usually annoying.
2719000	2726000	I'm sick of Ignis figuring out recipes to cook because he can only say the one line whenever he figures it out.
2726000	2735000	And Gladio is, I didn't even care for. Noctis is okay. Noctis I'm actually okay with as a character. He needs a better supporting cast though.
2735000	2741000	But what about that whole like brotherly friendship they show in the game that like, I don't know if I've ever seen in a video game before?
2741000	2755000	They just seem like party members to me. Like they kind of goof around, I guess. But it's like the dialogue and the like relationships they have, I expect in games now.
2755000	2763000	It's like, maybe it's novel for Final Fantasy, but I don't feel it's novel for other games I've played and have done much better.
2763000	2771000	All right. Like there's just things like I just, I'm sitting here going, I just don't get it when Shane says, like with the graphics and all that stuff.
2771000	2775000	Like I just don't get how you can think this is an ugly game. I'm just, I don't.
2775000	2785000	I don't, let me rephrase. I don't think it's ugly. I just, I'm not wowed by the graphics. I think there are other PS4 games that look much, much, much better.
2785000	2797000	They clearly only spent time on the character models for like the main characters, all the NPCs. Like there's four different NPCs, basically the entire game.
2797000	2803000	And I think Final Fantasy 10, like all of these came from there and they slightly up-res their models.
2803000	2807000	I don't know. I think they spent quite a bit of time on Sydney.
2808000	2813000	Okay. Well, no, see, she's like a main character. I hate her. She is terrible by the way.
2813000	2827000	Like honestly, she is not a good, like, like they kind of pushed her in the tree views and stuff. It's like, look, we have a female character in the game and it's like, that's not the one.
2827000	2828000	That's not helping.
2828000	2833000	That's not, that's not helping. And like her character is awful. Yeah. I agree. Her character is not.
2833000	2836000	She has to breathe through her skin. That's why she's naked.
2836000	2838000	I was about to, I was about to make a quiet joke too.
2838000	2852000	Here's the thing. And again, I don't want to be spoilery. There are other women, they're not showing. That's all I'm going to say, but they, but they not nobody, but to be fair, nobody plays at that level that the four main, the four main dudes do.
2852000	2854000	So anyway, I just leave it at that.
2854000	2863000	But let, let me just say, if you're playing this game and you expect the story to pick up, it has not, and I'm in chapter seven, which I hear there's only like 10 chapters in the game.
2863000	2866000	Okay. So I still feel like nothing has happened.
2866000	2875000	Okay. I do want to move on from 15 because there's been a lot of news this week, but I got, I got a couple other quick questions for you. First off. I love this comment from chat. This is perfect. Alan, get ready to laugh. You ready? Okay.
2875000	2885000	Okay. And chat says, if Shane was a dentist, he would be that one dentist out of the nine of 10 that wouldn't recommend the toothbrush or toothpaste.
2885000	2888000	If it was blue, I would.
2888000	2896000	That's like the perfect, like, like just, Hey, Shane, you want to try it and don't get me started.
2896000	2907000	I don't, but see, that's the thing. I don't get it. Like people like, cause I've posted on Twitter, my thoughts and I've had these arguments. I'm like, why is it wrong for me to not like this game? No, you're, you're welcome to your opinion.
2907000	2923000	I'm just, I'm trying to understand it because I, I so don't get it like, but this is not the first time you and I, your, your rash conversation about a video game, you're going to have issues with people thinking that your rationality or your rationale is not relatable.
2923000	2939000	That's really, I think the issue, which is fine because I don't think everybody likes everything I like, but when I've put so much time when there's only supposed to be 10 chapters and I'm about to finish seven, I think I have a pretty good grasp on the systems and everything that I feel like I can say, Hey, you know what?
2939000	2948000	Holding down the circle button. Isn't a really fun way to play a game. At least there's one thing we can all agree on is that that new design of alpha five is fucking terrible.
2948000	2952000	If they got rid of his eyes, I'd be okay with it. Those little eye things are weird though.
2952000	2965000	All right. Um, I want to ask you this too, because early on, you know, one of the things I said about the game is that it doesn't feel like final fantasy at all to me. Do you, do you agree with me on that or what are your thoughts on that conversation?
2965000	2975000	It doesn't feel like one at all. And like, I wouldn't send the biggest final fantasy fan, but I tend to like a lot of them. I think there's only a few I I've played that I didn't really care for.
2975000	2987000	And this one included, but, um, it doesn't, I think it falls under final fantasy because there's chocobos and there's a Sid and there's a crystal.
2987000	2996000	There you go. I think that's really it. Otherwise this could be generic open world Japanese game. Number one.
2996000	3003000	But are there mogs? Because there has to, has to be mogs in order to be, I hear there are, there are single one there.
3003000	3010000	There are because somebody spoiled it in a GIF on tumblers. That's all I'm going to say. Um, what did you think when I called it the Japanese dragon age inquisition?
3010000	3020000	I think that's really mean to inquisition. I think, but if I remember right, that was also a game you were really excited for and then you also didn't care for at the end of the day.
3020000	3026000	Or was that, am I confused? I liked it. I never beat it. Maybe I'm confusing that with Alan. Alan felt more negative about that than you did.
3026000	3035000	And maybe I think the problem with inquisition was that like the first place they sent you to was so massive and you just wanted to stay there forever here.
3035000	3040000	I want to get out of every area as fast as I can because they're pretty bland.
3040000	3055000	All right. I do want to move on with the show where every gamer has a voice. Shane, thank you for expressing your opinion, even though like honestly I don't get it, but I still, you know, I wouldn't be friends with you if I didn't respect your opinion.
3055000	3059000	So see if you feel the same way once you get to where I'm at, if it's picked up for you.
3059000	3064000	If somebody could tell me where it's fun at, maybe I would have more fun. I just haven't found it yet.
3064000	3070000	You know what? And I do kind of preface everything I've been saying tonight. And I said that at the beginning is, well, that's why I told you guys, I've played 12 hours.
3070000	3078000	I'm only on chapter three, but I'm doing all the side quest stuff because I do want to reserve that right that, you know, when I play more of the story, the story might end up being really bad.
3078000	3087000	I'm into it so far, but maybe it will take a dive. And if it does, I'll come back on next week and tell you guys I changed my mind on some things.
3087000	3092000	That happens with games sometimes, right? Hating Mass Effect at first, but then playing it...
3092000	3094000	Oh yeah, Mass Effect 1 was garbage until I...
3094000	3097000	Playing it the second time, you're like, oh my God, I was so wrong about this.
3097000	3098000	Exactly.
3098000	3102000	Yeah. All right. Shane, what's your Pokedex in Sun and Moon up to?
3102000	3103000	A hundred percent.
3103000	3105000	A hundred percent. Congrats. How many shinies?
3105000	3115000	Zero. I have killed like 700 rock roughs at this point. Like, I don't think they exist anymore because I've murdered them all trying to get a shiny.
3115000	3124000	All right. Well, I can at least agree with you that Sun and Moon is probably the best Pokemon game, but SOS battles ruin it.
3124000	3127000	Oh, nope. They're awesome. You can prevent them.
3127000	3132000	SOS battles are the worst. The worst thing that's ever happened to the Pokemon franchise.
3132000	3133000	No.
3133000	3134000	They're a pretty annoying mechanic.
3134000	3137000	All right. Shane, I'm gonna let you go so we can move on with the show.
3137000	3138000	All right, bye.
3138000	3139000	Bye.
3139000	3145000	All right. Shane from Ranger Pride and Pokestop Podcast, both on the VoG network, VoGnetwork.com.
3145000	3156000	All right. Let's... I want to get into other stuff we played in our gaming weeks, but I do want to say, if you guys have further thoughts on Final Fantasy XV, I'd really love to hear them over in our mailbag.
3156000	3161000	Participate at orangelountrader.com. We'll read some of those next week, but I do want to move on.
3161000	3165000	Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks outside of XV, the other games we've been playing this week.
3165000	3167000	Loki, why don't you start? What have you been playing?
3167000	3172000	I played Skyrim, the remastered whatever.
3172000	3178000	So I played that because, you know, my Final Fantasy XV wasn't downloaded in time.
3178000	3183000	So I'm still enjoying that quite a bit, especially with mods now. It's really nice on console.
3183000	3187000	It kind of sucks I can't earn trophies still, but whatever, I don't care.
3187000	3191000	I mean, it's all about going through the game endlessly.
3191000	3195000	So yeah, I'm enjoying that.
3195000	3196000	What else did I play?
3196000	3202000	I played Excite Truck a bit, because we set that up so that my wife can play it.
3202000	3206000	And I apparently am still good at it, so that's pretty good.
3206000	3212000	More Ingress. I played a little bit of Pokemon.
3212000	3216000	Literally like a minute of Pokemon just here, because...
3216000	3217000	Pokemon Go.
3217000	3218000	Pokemon Go, yeah.
3218000	3220000	Because we have the Pikachus here all the time.
3220000	3225000	Yeah, I didn't catch a Pikachu. I caught a Mankey and a Eakins.
3225000	3228000	Check again in 30 minutes. There's always a Pikachu up here somewhere.
3228000	3232000	I have no motivation to play that game anymore, even Ditto.
3232000	3234000	It's not even motivating enough for me to play that.
3234000	3240000	So, I mean, I don't know. I keep it on there just for the hell of it, but I really don't play it anymore.
3240000	3242000	And then, what else?
3244000	3246000	That's pretty much it.
3248000	3251000	I've been working Unity, trying to make stuff.
3251000	3257000	I've been learning UNET, so doing networking and stuff like that.
3257000	3261000	So, I've kind of got a little bit of an understanding of that, which is nice.
3261000	3267000	And I'm just going to work on some concepts I have, just to get a little bit more non-Rusty again.
3267000	3270000	And then go back into what I was going to work on originally.
3270000	3273000	So, we'll see. We'll see what I work on.
3273000	3276000	I'm just kind of playing around with it right now.
3276000	3280000	All right. If that's it for your gaming week, let me move over to JD.
3280000	3282000	Talk a little bit about his gaming week.
3282000	3284000	I noticed you've been playing a lot of Pokemon.
3284000	3286000	I have been, yeah.
3286000	3289000	Because we actually did a little trading in Sun and Moon. You gave me a couple more Pokemon.
3289000	3290000	I did.
3290000	3294000	And then you said something about the whole fact that you want to trade with more people because the numbers go into the lottery.
3294000	3296000	Oh, yeah. Well, this is a thing since Gen 2.
3296000	3299000	There's an in-game lottery that you...
3299000	3305000	It's like once a day in this game, and it's based on the ID number of the original trainer of the Pokemon.
3305000	3308000	The more people you trade with, the better your odds of getting the top prize are.
3308000	3311000	So, you know, the more people you trade with, it's good.
3311000	3313000	But you've been enjoying Sun and Moon a lot, right?
3313000	3316000	I've been playing, yeah, like 85 hours worth of it.
3316000	3320000	Wow, that's impressive. But, yeah, what's interesting to me, you are only on Island 3.
3320000	3322000	I just got to Island 4 today.
3322000	3323000	85 hours in the game?
3323000	3324000	Yeah.
3324000	3325000	Okay.
3325000	3328000	I've spent a lot of time looking for Pokedex completion, basically.
3328000	3331000	Because you're doing the side quest thing.
3331000	3332000	Yeah.
3332000	3334000	Alan, I say he, I'm pointing at Alan.
3334000	3338000	Alan just said, how come you don't do this with Pokemon? You're doing that.
3338000	3340000	I mean, for me, it's pretty finite.
3340000	3348000	Like, I know which ones I'm missing because it shows me in a grid where you've caught this one, you have seen this one, you haven't seen that one.
3348000	3351000	So, it's a lot easier to explore.
3351000	3356000	I mean, I've also been looking at Serebii to see what the percentage rates are because sometimes I'm just like, oh, there's a 1% chance?
3356000	3358000	Yeah, I'm going to come back to that.
3358000	3360000	I might get it in Wonder Trade.
3360000	3367000	We mentioned at the top of the show you had been to Round 1 recently, and I know you're a big music game fan, so you probably got to play a lot for the first time, right?
3367000	3368000	There's a good number, yeah.
3368000	3374000	I played Sound Vortex, which I couldn't hear at all because it was really noisy in Round 1 because it was a Friday night in a mall.
3374000	3380000	And I've learned that you need to bring headphones to an arcade if you want to play music games because that's a thing now.
3380000	3389000	There was Sound Vortex, we played Groove Coaster, Music Gun Gun, which is like a shooter music game, which I was kind of reserved about because I don't like shooters.
3389000	3390000	But it was pretty fun.
3390000	3393000	Yeah, but it's shooter like point-blank shooter. It's not shooter like Call of Duty.
3393000	3396000	I have terrible aim. Terrible.
3396000	3404000	See, I don't play shooter in the context of first-person shooters, but I love Misa point-blank. It's like carnival games.
3404000	3409000	The only shooter game I like is Portal, and that's about as far as I'll go.
3409000	3412000	Which some people would say is not a shooter. I'm with you.
3412000	3415000	You're pointing a gun and firing portals.
3415000	3417000	I get it. It's a thinking shooter.
3417000	3418000	First-person puzzle game.
3418000	3420000	Yeah, it's a thinking shooter game, but anyway.
3420000	3424000	There was also Hit the Beat, which is a ticket redemption game, but it's made by Pump It Up.
3424000	3431000	So they had Beethoven Virus and Seacoast Post, and I was like, I'm playing Whack-A-Mole with Pump It Up songs. It was hilarious.
3431000	3436000	And then I played DDR Ace, which was the first time I had played that.
3436000	3438000	Because I've never been to round one. This is the first time.
3438000	3442000	How'd you like Ace compared to other DDR games?
3442000	3445000	So I played for one round because there was a line of people, and it was getting late.
3446000	3451000	Honestly, I didn't really look at it all that much because I was playing with somebody else, so I only chose half the songs.
3451000	3456000	But the cabinet was really good. I could tell a difference. The pads were responsive.
3456000	3460000	And it's kind of sad that that's the standard because a lot of machines are not kept up very well.
3460000	3468000	For me, just in a nutshell, Ace really feels like a step up for the series that I haven't really felt in DDR since maybe Supernova.
3468000	3474000	And a lot of Supernova was just the fact that, oh, we finally have a DDR game after a multi-year break.
3475000	3478000	Supernova was like, oh, look, we're going international for the first time.
3478000	3482000	Supernova wasn't really that different from Extreme, all things considered. It really, really wasn't.
3482000	3488000	The interface was still the same, but Ace really feels like a step up in a way that the franchise hasn't seen in a while.
3488000	3492000	And yet I'm even counting that 2014 release or whatever it was.
3492000	3497000	I was going to say, what came before Ace? I know X3 vs. 2nd Remix was around, but was there one in between?
3497000	3502000	There was the X series, and then there was the 2014 game. I think they just called it DDR 2014.
3502000	3505000	I don't even know if that came over here very much. I couldn't find it.
3505000	3508000	I only ever saw it at one convention.
3510000	3513000	Does D&B have Ace now?
3513000	3515000	I haven't been.
3515000	3518000	Because I thought they were getting those machines. I have to go over there.
3518000	3525000	So I got a 3DS for Pokemon, basically, and I've been basically spending all my free time doing that.
3527000	3530000	Anything else you've been playing you want to mention real quick before we move on?
3530000	3537000	I've been playing Pokemon Go. Part of my work commute involves walking, so it's basically something I can do, and it works out pretty well.
3537000	3539000	There's a good synergy there.
3539000	3546000	And I've actually been playing Miitomo, because now that I have a 3DS, I have something to spend the coins on, which made a world of difference.
3546000	3549000	Our 2DS says that D&B does have Ace.
3549000	3551000	Well, there you go. I had no idea.
3551000	3554000	So, good to know. We'll have to go over there and check it out at some point.
3554000	3558000	If that's it for your gaming week, JD, let's talk to Alan. How was your gaming week?
3558000	3566000	Good. Oh, I just wanted to add, though, when we went to round one, their BeatMania machine was 2DX, was off, and had been off for like a week.
3566000	3572000	That's why I was so happy I made the decision not to go over there after I'd already had a long day, because I would have been so mad if that had been off.
3572000	3574000	Like, the one game I'd want to play more than anything.
3574000	3578000	And they didn't have a sign-up saying out of order, so we're like, can you turn on the 2DX machine? What's going on?
3578000	3585000	And I guess the reply was, it's on order. There's only certain techs that can work on it. Like, it's been a week. We know.
3586000	3587000	Go away.
3587000	3589000	Well, how was your gaming week? What else did you play?
3589000	3594000	I've been playing lots of Skyrim and now Morrowind.
3598000	3607000	The reason why I never really got into Morrowind before is that I never played a lot of the really down and dirty, like, AD&D, like Ravenloft.
3607000	3615000	Like, some of the really not beginner-friendly Dungeons & Dragons games that came out on PC.
3615000	3621000	And I think Elder Scrolls originally came from that school where, like, there's a barter system.
3621000	3627000	If you level up in a really weird way, you have to spend your skill points very carefully.
3627000	3631000	Because if you put it in stuff that isn't combat-based, you'll die.
3631000	3635000	And, like, it was just really overwhelming. I didn't know what to do. And now I just finally...
3635000	3642000	I have the strategy guide that's almost like new for Morrowind that I got out of the cat's room.
3642000	3646000	I realized, like, oh, I can play this. So I'm a couple hours in now.
3648000	3652000	I was playing Overwatch for a bit. Season 2 ended.
3652000	3654000	Since season 3 started.
3654000	3658000	Season 3 started, like, a week ago, I think, and I haven't done any of my eval matches.
3658000	3662000	And it's funny that you're, like, still level 18 or 19 on PC.
3662000	3665000	On PC. And now I'm catching up on PS4.
3665000	3669000	Yeah, so you're never gonna really do the ranked seasons.
3669000	3670000	Never say never.
3670000	3673000	Because I know, like, in Diablo, you always wanted to...
3673000	3678000	Except we've each had two or three seasons go by, though, on Diablo 3 where we haven't played.
3678000	3683000	That's really it, though. And then, of course, I did do a Mortal Kombat 9 story run.
3683000	3688000	And then I was playing X, but now I just watch, like, a Let's Player or a YouTuber that plays X.
3688000	3691000	Mortal Kombat X, and I just watch what he does.
3691000	3695000	Because I know I can't perform juggle combos like that.
3695000	3698000	Okay. All right. Well, that's it for your gaming week?
3698000	3700000	Yeah, that's it. We're running long, so I'll keep it brief.
3700000	3705000	That's fine. My gaming week, and I really don't have a lot to say, because Final Fantasy XV really took up a lot of my week.
3705000	3711000	The one other thing I will mention is that Monday night, after last week's OLR, but before I had my copy of XIV,
3711000	3714000	I did check out No Man's Sky because of the patch.
3714000	3715000	15?
3715000	3718000	I'm sorry, yeah. Well, I still do play Final Fantasy XIV.
3718000	3719000	I understand. I know.
3719000	3722000	I don't talk about it every week, but it is the MMO of choice.
3722000	3724000	But I certainly haven't been playing that as much.
3724000	3728000	And I think even my free company, like, just hasn't been as active.
3728000	3732000	Which, you know, of course, a lot of people playing XIV are Final Fantasy fans.
3732000	3735000	Of course, everybody's checking out the new game, so, you know, it's logical.
3735000	3739000	But anyway. But I did play No Man's Sky on Monday night.
3739000	3745000	Because they did that patch. And I was really curious about, okay, does this, you know, fix some of the problems I had with it?
3745000	3748000	And so the first thing I did was fire up Creative Mode.
3748000	3754000	So when you go into the game now, there's a new menu you didn't have before that says pick the game you want to play.
3754000	3757000	Do you want to do normal? And it actually shows, here's your last normal save.
3757000	3760000	Do you want to do creative? Here's your last creative save.
3760000	3762000	So it's now you kind of juggling three separate games.
3762000	3766000	So the first thing I did was went into Creative Mode just to kind of see what I could do.
3766000	3771000	And I have to admit, like, they did change a lot just on an interface level.
3771000	3773000	Like, especially with the fact that Creative Mode.
3773000	3778000	Creative Mode, you just, like, you can build whatever you want and it doesn't subtract resources.
3778000	3779000	That's what Creative Mode is.
3779000	3783000	But it really now gives you the sense, like, oh, you can really see, like, what all the options are.
3783000	3786000	And, wow, they really did add a lot of different stuff.
3786000	3791000	Like, now you can put little beacons on the planet to leave messages behind for other players.
3791000	3792000	Like, this is Dark Souls or something.
3792000	3793000	Yeah.
3793000	3799000	Which, you know, so if I want to, so, but the thing is, what's, I haven't run into somebody else's beacon enough because I didn't play that much.
3799000	3802000	But, like, is it going to show, like, oh, there's a beacon on this planet.
3802000	3803000	You should go get it.
3803000	3808000	And then you go and you find the beacon, you land, you find it, and then you activate the beacon and it says, poop fart.
3808000	3813000	Like, oh, wow, I wasted all that fuel to come find this beacon that says, poop fart.
3813000	3819000	Honestly, it would probably be just about as important as all the other story stuff that they have in there.
3819000	3820000	So, I mean.
3820000	3821000	Yes. Little did you know.
3821000	3823000	They should have new words that you can learn.
3823000	3826000	They should have it where you can put those, like, word rune things.
3826000	3828000	It's like, you learned the word for dick butt, you know?
3828000	3833000	But anyway, but I also played around with the base building stuff.
3833000	3837000	And so they put in this whole new, like, quest thing.
3837000	3841000	So, like, you can build the base and it's, it's kind of on a grid system.
3841000	3850000	You know, you pick, like, you don't see it on a grid, but you can kind of tell, like, that's how it's, like, you choose, like, everything is a perfect little square and what goes here, what goes here, you know, that type of thing.
3850000	3856000	But I like that it was, like, okay, now that you've built a terminal, you need to go find somebody to staff this terminal.
3856000	3859000	So, you've got to blast off into space, find the dude, you know, come back to your base.
3859000	3861000	So, it seems like there's this whole quest around it.
3861000	3866000	So, the patch that the game got is substantial and I didn't even really have enough time to explore it in one night.
3866000	3871000	But, you know, I know people have aired their grievances with this game and so on.
3871000	3874000	I thought this patch was very interesting.
3874000	3879000	The one thing I didn't get to figure out with creative mode is, did it remove the sentinels?
3879000	3885000	Because it's telling me that the planet is still, like, the sentries were normal, I think, on this planet that I started on.
3885000	3887000	But I never saw a sentry.
3887000	3892000	But then again, I also wasn't farming the planet because you don't have to. It's creative mode.
3892000	3902000	Yeah. Also, in the original game, the sentries weren't really an issue unless you were on a planet that had really rare commodities on the ground.
3902000	3912000	Like, the pearls and the weird things where if you find the right galaxy that has the economy for it, you could sell it for, like, two and a half or three times the price.
3912000	3914000	That's how I made all of my units.
3914000	3921000	TigerClawInChat asks, if this patch was released on day one of this game, would the game still have received the same reception as gotten prior to it?
3921000	3922000	Yes.
3922000	3932000	Yes. It would have. Because some of the biggest problems about the game were the PC issues that jammed it up the first day, which had kind of already been fixed.
3932000	3934000	It didn't even run until, like, a week after release.
3934000	3938000	Yeah, this patch didn't really do anything with that because that's already been fixed in progressive patches.
3938000	3943000	Some of the inventory stuff would have been less frustrating, though, because of the stacking.
3943000	3950000	I think maybe some of the grievances would have changed, but, you know, gamershateeverything.com, there was still going to be complaints somewhere.
3950000	3960000	So, but, and, you know, I'm not poo-pooing the complaints. Like, I understand that people felt certain things were promised and that, you know, they underdelivered.
3960000	3965000	Does this address all of the issues? No. Does it address some of the issues? Yes.
3965000	3967000	I would say maybe.
3967000	3969000	Okay, I'll let you have one.
3969000	3980000	I haven't really read too much about it because, LOL, I don't care that much, but I guess there are some people in the community, by which I mean Reddit, that are, like, deeply offended by this patch.
3980000	3991000	Like, you guys don't say a damn thing for five months, then you put out this content that you never even, like, gave us a sneak preview of. Why should I care about this? Or how dare you?
3991000	4002000	I see that partway because I know, and I've been critical of Hello Games, you know, through this whole ordeal, is that you need to say something. You need to do something, you need to reassure your customer base, you're working on it, you need to say something.
4002000	4012000	But I do understand, I also, at the same time, understand the perspective of, they probably feel like they can't say anything without the entire internet screaming at them.
4012000	4014000	So why say anything at all?
4014000	4015000	Yeah.
4015000	4025000	In a way, I get it. But I just, I still sort of feel like, okay, you know what, say something and then don't look at your notifications. Like, seriously!
4025000	4039000	So the issue I have with the base, and I know, I guess you can build a teleporter to warp back to it, but the original game, when it came out, because of their randomly generated universe that is so massive, like, it'll never be 100% explored, which, yeah, right.
4039000	4048000	The way that the original game played was that they always wanted you to keep it moving, explore new planets and galaxies at the expense of everything else.
4048000	4055000	You can't make your way back to a planet that you visited, you name it and you move on. Keep going, explore, explore, explore.
4055000	4068000	So now that they're setting up things where you have, like, a base, like, before in the previous game, you couldn't even record and set a waypoint for a station that you had found on the planet that you're still currently on from four hours back.
4068000	4075000	Now you're on the other side of the planet and you're like, I need to sell the stuff I have. I can't find a shop. Where's that shop I went to a couple hours ago?
4075000	4080000	You can't find it because it's like, no, keep, just leave the planet and find a new one then.
4080000	4094000	So I just don't understand how they can put in these new centralized features when the original game had problems where you couldn't even tell where you had been, if that makes sense.
4094000	4104000	Yeah, no, totally, totally. It was always a little weird in that regard, but I do think the patch is worth looking at if you still have somewhat of a retained interest in No Man's Sky.
4104000	4110000	But I also understand, you know, and I think another follow-up question in our chat, Tigerclaw says, does this patch change people's perception?
4110000	4123000	I don't know because I think a lot of people just moved on to the next hot game of the minute, which right now is Final Fantasy XV, Pokemon Sun or Moon, back to Overwatch, just depending on what your community is and the gamers you play with.
4123000	4126000	I think a lot of people have just moved on to the next hot game of the minute.
4126000	4144000	When we were at Fry's this weekend in the PS4 section, they had No Man's Sky and it was like, think of like a bookshelf and the amount of layers, like how thick the amount of copies were is where if you put one more, it would have fallen off the shelf because that's how dense it was.
4144000	4151000	And it was like $39.99. I was like, that's still too much. I know, I imagine if you go to GameStop and look in the You section, they're probably like two bucks because of how...
4152000	4155000	I thought there were Black Friday deals for $19.99 at this point.
4155000	4174000	So it was funny that all of the other games just had one or two copies each, but No Man's Sky specifically, they had like one chunky stack of 15 and another chunky stack of 15 that looked totally disproportionate to all the other games and it's like a game that's like three or four months old. It's like 40 bucks, was 69.
4174000	4190000	I'm going to be extremely interested. I really hope somebody is filming Hello Games right now. If somebody was making a documentary on Hello Games throughout this whole ordeal, I would love to see that in two years.
4190000	4207000	You know what I mean? Like if somebody was like documenting this from the inside, which I don't think is happening, but I'm just saying if it was for whatever reason, like, oh my god, this would be so fascinating to me. Like, I really want to see the postmortem on No Man's Sky from Sean Murray's mouth in two years, if he'll do it. I don't know.
4208000	4230000	For all I know, dude is going through severe mental trauma because of this. But I don't know. I don't want to make up or try to diagnose other people when I'm not serving. But I'm just saying he could be having really extreme reactions to a lot of this stuff on the internet. Maybe he'll never want to talk about it in two years. I don't know.
4230000	4248000	I'm going to be so curious to see what the postmortem for this looks like in a couple years time. Anyway, let's see. Bobby Black Wolf. Interesting. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I think Sean Murray will walk away like Phil Fish did. I don't want him to walk away. I don't like to see people walk away.
4248000	4253000	He'll get the game to a point where he's whatever over it and then he'll take his marbles and go home.
4253000	4280000	I don't know. Or maybe he'll say, you know what, I'm going to do it right the next time or I'm going to learn from this. It just kind of depends on where he's at right now. God, you know what, I gotta say there's a lot of people I've always wanted to interview on the show. I would love to interview that guy on the show. I would love to interview that guy on the show, respectfully. I'll have a respectful dialogue with that man about everything. But I also realized we're a small fry podcast, you know.
4280000	4291000	Peter Molyneux is probably like, Oh, thank God he came along. Jesus Christ. I'm so like, I know it sucks, dude. You're a pariah. But like, you've helped me so much with my reputation.
4291000	4295000	He's got that with a walking game now was a hiking game or something.
4295000	4324000	Look, I thought that was Ingress. All right. We got to move on. We got to move on. We like an hour and 15 into the show and we've barely touched what's going on in gaming news. And you know, there's been a lot that's been going on this week because, you know, interestingly enough, we're at the halfway point between E3s, right? E3 is the beginning of June every year. And here we are at the beginning of December. And it does feel like we got a lot of news this week, which early December didn't used to be a part of the video gaming news cycle. But then, you know, internet happened and so on.
4324000	4337000	Sony decided they were going to hold an event in December to get people talking about Sony products right around Christmas time. Genius move. So let's talk about some of the big events that have happened this week. That's kind of the news we want to start with the top of the show.
4337000	4342000	So first off Thursday night, the Game Awards. Loki, you actually watch the Game Awards, right?
4343000	4344000	I watched most of it.
4344000	4357000	I didn't. I didn't watch it at all. I saw all the news. So I'm prepared to talk about this stuff. I watched the highlight reels and all that, but I did not watch the show because I just had something else going on. It was just not a bad time for me. I wasn't trying to hate just conflict.
4357000	4366000	I watched most of it. I missed the beginning or part of the beginning. So one of the things they showed was a new trailer for Breath of the Wild, which I watched that later on.
4366000	4382000	I also missed the middle because I had to put the kids to bed. But on the Breath of the Wild trailer, I mean, everyone was kind of gung ho with it. Honestly, I could have cared less. I mean, or couldn't have cared less because it was just kind of, it looked all right, but didn't really show me anything like that.
4382000	4387000	I haven't seen it before. Not necessarily the trailer, I guess, the actual gameplay footage that they did.
4387000	4388000	With the treehouse guys and all that?
4388000	4399000	With the treehouse guys. That was just kind of like, it was like ho-hum. Like, eh, whatever. Like, the E3 stuff was exciting because it was like, whoa, man, wow, this is really cool. And that didn't really show me anything different.
4399000	4408000	You know, that's kind of the impression I got from the footage, too, is that the footage kind of made me go, okay, it looks like a Zelda game, which isn't bad. God, no, Zelda games are fantastic.
4408000	4420000	But there was definitely that part of me that was kind of bracing myself for, ooh, that he keeps saying that, you know, he really likes playing Skyrim. You know, this is going to be Zelda meets Skyrim, and this is going to be a radical departure for the series and all that stuff.
4420000	4424000	And that footage kind of made me go, okay, it's not going to be that much of a departure.
4424000	4437000	No, it's not. I mean, I think the big open world is sort of like Skyrim, but the one thing I really don't like is the weapon durability. That is just a terrible idea. Has there ever been a game with weapon durability? It's like, wow, this is really awesome.
4437000	4449000	No one has ever said that. It's a stupid mechanic. I really don't like it. I'm not looking forward to having that in there where, oh, I'm fighting something, you know, my stupid thing broke.
4449000	4466000	The game looked great to me. I'm still on board, but I think there, I saw a great tweet and I kind of stopped and went, huh, that's a very interesting observation that said it was not the best idea to put out this Zelda Breath of the Wild footage the day after Final Fantasy 15 hit.
4466000	4473000	Because now a lot of people are looking at him side by side going, the limitations of the Wii U are showing a little bit.
4473000	4474000	Yeah.
4474000	4479000	A little bit. But again, I don't want to sound overly shady with that comment.
4479000	4482000	I think it's going to be a fantastic game, but yeah.
4482000	4497000	Yeah, I still think, you know, graphics, you can take a hit on graphics and still have a fantastic game. And I think Zelda still will be good at the end of the day. It's just that maybe that wasn't the right time to get the hype machine going. But that's maybe out of Nintendo's control a little bit. I don't know.
4498000	4512000	Yeah. So, I mean, it was okay, I guess, but it wasn't all that exciting. Of course, you know, they talked, they had given awards or the, what was it? Not a lifetime achievement award, but like a, some sort of, I don't know.
4512000	4518000	It may as well be the lifetime achievement award. Same type of thing. Video game pioneer or something like that. They called it. Yeah.
4518000	4525000	So anyways, and they gave that to Hideo Kojima. And I think a lot of it is because he couldn't give him an award last year. And so it was kind of like.
4525000	4527000	Did you see the whole Jeff Keighley lead up to that?
4527000	4528000	Yes, I did.
4528000	4532000	Where like I was waiting for Jeff Keighley to open mouth kiss Hideo Kojima after that.
4532000	4534000	It seemed kind of awkward.
4534000	4544000	Yeah. Well, and I also, I expected that and I expected him like as he's open mouth kissing Hideo Kojima to have like a little tattoo on his hand that says, fuck Konami. Like I was just, I was waiting for that.
4544000	4546000	Industry icon award. That's what it was. Yeah.
4547000	4549000	Same lifetime achievement. Same thing.
4549000	4550000	And then they showed that.
4550000	4551000	What's that Alan?
4551000	4559000	Kojima is only open mouth, open mouth kissing one dude on the planet. And that's Norman Reedus from Walking Dead.
4559000	4561000	It could be two people already since then.
4561000	4572000	So they did show, they did show the new trailer for Death Stranding, which we still don't know really what it's about, but honestly just, you know, gauging by what we're seeing.
4573000	4578000	It looks like kind of a melding of Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid, which I think for a lot of people is like, fuck yes.
4578000	4589000	I think there's definitely like, he's taking some of the ideas from Silent Hill and putting them in this game, but I'm sure he recognizes he has to walk a very fine line because Konami will sue if there's too many similarities.
4589000	4594000	But this also huge that Guillermo del Toro is involved.
4594000	4595000	Yeah, he is involved.
4595000	4597000	Why didn't they drop that bombshell at E3?
4597000	4598000	I don't know.
4598000	4599000	Oh my God.
4599000	4605000	He is involved and now also they revealed that Mads Mikkelsen is involved with it as well.
4605000	4608000	Which, you know, people fucking obsess about Hannibal.
4608000	4609000	I gotta say that.
4609000	4613000	Alan, you're on Tumblr, right? Tumblr, Hannibal.
4613000	4614000	Yeah.
4614000	4625000	So I am not a fan of Metal Gear Solid. I'm the, I like the idea of Silent Hill, but I don't like it, but I've watched this trailer about 30 times because the music is fucking awesome.
4625000	4628000	Like the music and the atmosphere of it, I am on board with that.
4628000	4633000	And I think, I don't know what the hell this game is about, but I love the way it looks.
4633000	4635000	Like I can seriously, I'm down for it.
4635000	4640000	But again, I feel like we're going to go down, people are going to hate me for this comment.
4640000	4644000	We need to be very careful not to go to a no man's sky place with this game.
4644000	4645000	I understand.
4645000	4647000	Because I'm starting to feel like we're going to a no man's sky place with this game.
4647000	4651000	Okay, but this is, this is Hideo Kojima.
4651000	4652000	That's fair, that's fair.
4652000	4653000	And Sean Murray.
4653000	4663000	Sean Murray made a motorcycle racing game, and then, you know, Hideo Kojima, the pedigree, I have higher expectations for him. I feel that he will be fine.
4663000	4667000	I'm just warning everybody else, don't fucking do that to this game.
4667000	4673000	I'm not saying that, but like, I think that he can, he can live up to that.
4673000	4678000	That's fine. There's a lot of people that would open mouth kiss Hideo Kojima at the end of the day, right?
4678000	4684000	But like, I don't know what the hell this game is about yet, and what is up with all these fetuses and everything around.
4684000	4690000	Did you see the whole conspiracy theory about what happens when you play the two trailers side by side?
4690000	4691000	No.
4691000	4693000	Oh, mind blown.
4693000	4696000	Go look at one of those series about playing the two trailers side by side.
4696000	4700000	What sort of Wizard of Oz, Dark Side of the Moon nonsense?
4700000	4706000	It is dark sided. It's that lady from trading spouses from like 10 years ago, the way, it's ungodly, I don't want it.
4706000	4710000	It's that. Have you seen the whole, have you seen the whole thing about the two trailers?
4710000	4711000	No.
4711000	4716000	If you play the two trailers at the same time, the baby moves in between the two trailers.
4716000	4720000	The baby is never in both trailers at the same time.
4720000	4721000	Okay.
4721000	4723000	No, like there, it's, you have to
4723000	4725000	Like it's on the left monitor, then it's on the right monitor.
4725000	4729000	Yes, like it's, it's almost like it's intentional the way it is laid out.
4729000	4733000	And I can see them doing that, especially the way they kind of did PT and everything.
4733000	4738000	Yeah. I know. I know. I get it. It's one of those things where you go like, is this, this is all, this is all intentional, right?
4738000	4745000	Like this is, this is a total mind fuck. Like, is there going to be a third trailer that then, you know, even does that even worse? So
4745000	4747000	Avril Lavigne was replaced with a clone.
4747000	4750000	Fuck off.
4750000	4752000	Wait, what?
4752000	4757000	Oh God, I never knew this was a meme until he said this. I never knew this was a meme.
4757000	4759000	Okay. So, so sorry. We were talking about kids.
4759000	4762000	Thank you for bringing this up on the show. This has nothing to do with video games yet.
4762000	4764000	But you have piqued my interest in that.
4764000	4766000	Now you have to explain what the fuck this is.
4766000	4778000	So, um, there's like, it's kind of like the jokes where George W. Bush makes a joke about how like Jet Fuel doesn't melt steel bars and all this stuff.
4778000	4788000	And Beyonce is the Illuminati. One of them is Avril Lavigne was, died horribly, discreetly, and was replaced with a lookalike that had plastic surgery to look like her.
4788000	4794000	And that's not the real Avril Lavigne. And I guess it's, I don't know if it's a 4chan or a Reddit thing, but I guess people really believe this. It's like a meme.
4794000	4804000	Like you can go to YouTube and look up Avril Lavigne imposter conspiracy and find like videos on it.
4804000	4811000	And I was just saying with the two trailers side by side and like Wizard of Oz and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, if you run together, is it real? Is this intentional?
4811000	4817000	Or are we just like getting like confirmation bias? Like we want to see some weird shit. So we're seeing some weird shit.
4817000	4823000	And I just thought it would be funny to say Avril Lavigne was replaced with a clone and then Rob peed his pants.
4823000	4830000	The baby moves between the two trailers. Avril Lavigne is a clone. Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's. All that.
4830000	4832000	Okay. Yeah.
4832000	4845000	Anyway, so, uh, yeah, Death Stranding trailer. Uh, you know, again, I, I'm, I'm hyped for the game, but I would like the next thing we see to be gameplay footage.
4845000	4854000	But then again, if Kojima is going to keep them, I have a feeling that this game, maybe I think this is like 2018, at least, at least, at least.
4854000	4861000	So, I mean, okay. Which, which comes first? You ready? Which comes first? Everybody. Final Fantasy seven remake.
4861000	4868000	Kingdom Hearts three or Death Stranding, which hearts three, which one will we see first?
4868000	4873000	I think Kingdom Hearts three. Cause we've seen gameplay of that. We have seen gameplay of Kingdom Hearts three.
4873000	4881000	We've also seen gameplay of the seven remake. Yeah, but that's just tech, I mean, I think that's just assets basically thrown on top of the, uh, engine.
4881000	4886000	You heard though that he's using the engine that they're using for that now is the same one that's being used for Horizon Zero Dawn.
4886000	4891000	Oh no, I didn't hear that. Yeah. That's the engine that they're using for that game.
4892000	4898000	TigerClaw in chat says, uh, Sky, the third Death Standing trailer will introduce Betty White. Yeah, thank you.
4898000	4901000	That would be awesome. Film her parts now.
4901000	4906000	I would open mouth Kissadeo Kojima if that happened. And I'm sure that man smokes a pack a day.
4906000	4914000	Uh, Stoppy says, same theory as Paul McCartney being replaced. Was that a thing? So this, this, so this rumor just repeats itself every generation.
4914000	4918000	I'm sure there's one for lots of people. I mean, some people think Elvis is still alive.
4918000	4921000	Oh, that's, or Tupac is the other one I hear all the time. Tupac is Elvis.
4921000	4924000	Well, I mean the hologram didn't help that.
4924000	4930000	Do you, did you see the, did you see the reaction people had when that hologram fucking thing happened at Coachella in the desert?
4930000	4934000	Like, did you, did you see the look, something like those, those reaction YouTubes?
4934000	4940000	Can you imagine people that were like fucking stoned out of their head and they're like, what the fuck is going on? I thought he was dead.
4941000	4951000	Seriously. It's just, wow. Anyway. Okay. So what else, please don't turn this into conspiracy theory. Episode 666 passed. You should have done it two weeks ago.
4951000	4955000	Bobby Blackfolf in chat says the first episode of the remake or all episodes for FF7.
4955000	4964000	Um, that's a great question. I would say the first episode of the remake and me personally, I think the first episode of the remake is going to be the 2018 release.
4964000	4971000	Square's got to, Square is going to have to put one of those things out next year. One of those two is coming out next year.
4971000	4973000	And I think it's going to be the first part of the Seven Remake.
4973000	4974000	In 2017.
4974000	4975000	Huh?
4975000	4976000	2017.
4976000	4981000	2017. Square has to deliver one of those two games because they've been hyping it for way too long.
4981000	4988000	I mean, granted, look at the fucking game they released this week and hype, but I really think Square's on the line to release one of those two games in 2017.
4988000	4993000	I think it'll be the first part of the Seven Remake, but that's me personally. And the Death Stranding 2018.
4993000	4995000	But anyway, what else? Game of Words.
4995000	5003000	Um, so, one of the things that happened was Nolan North won for Best Voice Actor.
5003000	5011000	And so, of course, he had some words to say regarding the whole voice actor strike.
5011000	5015000	So, basically, I guess I'll just kind of quote what he said here.
5016000	5030000	Performance matters. And the performance of every designer, every programmer, and of every hardworking and talented person who works at the office, that performance is so important.
5030000	5042000	And their performance matters more than mine. And it's important in this day and age with all the talk going back and forth because without their performance, my performance wouldn't matter. It wouldn't even exist.
5042000	5048000	That almost seemed like it went against the strike, didn't it? Did anyone else take it that way?
5048000	5060000	I mean, it kind of seemed like it played an interesting middle ground, but that almost seemed, especially because he said their performance matters more than mine, that was interesting.
5060000	5075000	I mean, the way I kind of take it is like, yes, the voice actor should get paid more, but the programmers and designers should get paid more because we hear all the horror stories of all the shit they have to go through.
5075000	5086000	And I think it's like he's just trying to say, listen, recognize that what we do is important, but these guys that actually make the game are just as important, if not more important.
5087000	5089000	Why are we treating them so poorly?
5089000	5104000	I see that side of it too. And I've said this, I think this is a good reminder, I think because of the way the video game news cycle is, right? I bet a lot of you forgot that this, well maybe not, not you personally, but I bet a lot of people out there forgot that this voice actor strike is going on.
5104000	5124000	And we're talking about what do 2017, what do 2018's games look like and all this stuff. These strikes could severely impact 2017 and 2018's gaming releases. Like we're not seeing the impacts yet, but there's all these games further down the line that could severely be impacted because of the voice actor strike. This is still going, it is not resolved.
5125000	5127000	That's why you just get actual actors to do the roles.
5130000	5140000	Because SAG-AFTRA is one guild, I don't think people like Norman Reedus would be allowed to cross the lines. I'm not sure how that works. I don't know the science of it, but I don't, because it is all one union, I don't think they can do that.
5140000	5144000	Well technically he hasn't said anything yet, so that could be very well.
5144000	5155000	Yeah, we don't know. So anything could happen. But I'm just saying, this is still a situation that needs to be resolved. And the one thing that Nolan North didn't bring up that I think is still an important issue about the strike altogether is the safety issues.
5155000	5165000	And there's a lot of people, you know, about the whole fact that you can't do all these screams and yells in one recording session without sufficient breaks and rest and all this stuff. And there's still a lot of issues to be resolved.
5165000	5180000	So, you know, I hope if nothing else, you know, this speech reignites a conversation between the two sides. Because if this doesn't get resolved, do you guys remember how the Rider's Strike ruined TV? Wait for it.
5180000	5181000	Yeah, it was pretty bad.
5181000	5188000	Remember the show Heroes when it was good? And then the Rider's Strike happened? Yep. Anyway, what else?
5189000	5204000	Alright. And then, see, so, moving on from there, there was a trailer for a remaster of Bulletstorm, and they had Duke Nukem featured in that, which was kind of like, why the hell is Duke Nukem here?
5204000	5212000	Because they really want people to give Bulletstorm a look, because that game really got, I think, didn't that come out almost the same time that Overwatch did?
5212000	5217000	No, Bulletstorm was way older than that. Bulletstorm came out, like, several years ago.
5217000	5218000	Oh, did it? I'm confused.
5218000	5221000	Yeah, it was an Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 game.
5221000	5223000	I'm totes confusing it with Battleborn.
5223000	5226000	You're, yeah, you're thinking that.
5226000	5227000	Whoops!
5227000	5229000	No, no, this came out back in 2011.
5229000	5230000	Okay.
5230000	5245000	And there's supposed to be, it's an enhanced version that's going to be offering at 60 FPS, Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4, and then they're going to also have 4K visuals on it. But Duke Nukem's going to be in it as well, so...
5245000	5249000	Okay, but still a second chance for people to check out a game they may have missed, and now, you know...
5249000	5260000	It was alright. I played a little bit of it, and I think I actually have it, it's in my library, well, it wasn't my library when I was paying for live gold, but it's one of those free games with gold that they had a while back, so, I don't know.
5260000	5265000	But yeah, it's, it was supposed to be pretty good, but I haven't played it.
5266000	5268000	Let's see, what else?
5268000	5284000	So then, after that, we had a teaser for Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy, so that's kind of been confirmed that's coming now. I'm assuming it's going to be timed around the time of the movie, the new movie, which we actually had a trailer for this weekend, which is kind of nice.
5284000	5286000	Oh yeah, I missed that, but I heard that came out.
5286000	5287000	It was cool.
5287000	5289000	You know, I still haven't seen the first movie.
5289000	5291000	You should really watch it, it's a good movie.
5291000	5292000	I just never see movies.
5292000	5294000	You should see it, it's a great movie.
5295000	5299000	And then they showed some footage from Prey. This is one of the things I missed.
5299000	5308000	I watched a portion of that, you know, and I saw that he turned into a coffee cup and rolled himself through a hole, and then that was that.
5308000	5317000	And I'm just like, wow, this really doesn't look like Prey, the original game, or it doesn't look like Prey, the reimagining of it that was supposed to be coming out a long time ago.
5318000	5324000	I don't even know what this is, so it's a thing though, but I wasn't all that interested in it.
5325000	5336000	I have neglected to watch the new footage, but I did enjoy the old Prey game, but yeah, I could get the sense from what we saw at E3 that it was not even going to be the same thing.
5336000	5337000	No.
5337000	5343000	It must be some of the original ideas from the original series, and going somewhere else with it.
5343000	5357000	Yeah. Then there was a trailer for Specter of Torment, which is the prequel for Shovel Knight, which kind of reminded me a lot of a Castlevania-type game, at least visually, it kind of reminded me of that.
5357000	5367000	It looks like a whole new game to me. It doesn't even look like it's Shovel Knight. Well, okay, yes, it has that same retro kitsch, but it doesn't look so much like an expansion like it does just a whole new game.
5367000	5368000	Yeah.
5368000	5369000	In that same style.
5370000	5371000	But it looks good.
5371000	5373000	Yeah, I'm with you. It looks really cool.
5374000	5378000	And then, of course, I'm sure you saw the footage of Mass Effect Andromeda.
5379000	5380000	Fuck yes, I did.
5381000	5382000	So, you want to talk about that?
5383000	5394000	It looked great. I mean, it was interesting, because I got a very Mass Effect 1 vibe from it. Maybe that's the fact that you have the not Mako in it, the new car, but now you have the jetpacks, which is going to really change things up a little bit.
5394000	5404000	But I was actually somewhat comforted by the fact there was a lot of familiarity to it, you know? The combat didn't look all that radically different.
5404000	5413000	I mean, yes, there are clearly some differences with the jetpack, and they were showing more action-y stuff and less cover stuff, but I wonder if that's because cover doesn't make for a very good trailer.
5413000	5419000	They had cover stuff, too. They had one that almost looked like they put out one of those... I don't remember what their energy weapon was.
5420000	5421000	Omni Tool, yeah.
5422000	5431000	Almost like it had an Omni Tool. He built a... I don't know, like a cover, a piece of cover that he was hiding behind. A half-wall thing.
5431000	5439000	So, I mean, I was really interested in what I saw. The one thing that kind of made me grimace a little bit was that they were showing that, oh, you can pick flowers and you can craft in this game.
5439000	5446000	And I was like, Mass Effect has enough in it that you'll spend thousands of hours playing. You don't need the fucking...
5446000	5450000	Because the min-maxer in me is like, I'm fucked, if that's a thing.
5450000	5458000	And then they also basically said, oh yeah, here's your galaxy, go explore and stuff. I was like, I'm getting too much of a No Man's Sky vibe with this.
5458000	5459000	No, no, no.
5459000	5462000	At least the plan is much nicer than No Man's Sky.
5462000	5468000	Well, and then if you actually... I don't know if this is spoilery or what, but Alan and I both noticed, which is funny because Shane...
5468000	5472000	When I talked to Shane, he'd watched that trailer a billion times. He didn't notice what we noticed, Alan.
5472000	5476000	Like the quest names in the right-hand corner of the screen, the missions that you're on.
5476000	5483000	Remember how we caught one that said loyalty mission? You were on somebody's loyalty mission. It was like, oh, they're bringing that back. That's going to be a key point.
5483000	5490000	Because Mass Effect 3 was rushed so badly, Mass Effect 2 was such an incredible game.
5490000	5494000	And you got to fight mechs and robots, and there was all this stuff in the loyalty missions.
5494000	5501000	And in the Andromeda trailer, there are mechs that you fight. So it looks like they're bringing back a lot of the stuff from 2.
5501000	5503000	Which is why they've taken their sweet ass time doing it.
5503000	5505000	Was really good, yeah.
5505000	5512000	So I'm really on board. I'm really, really looking forward to the game. I mean, of course I'm going to fucking buy it because it's Mass Effect.
5512000	5515000	But you know, there's been other talk about how multiplayer might be a little different.
5515000	5522000	And they're saying that multiplayer will not influence the single player game the way it did in Mass Effect 3, where it felt very required.
5522000	5524000	And a lot of people really resented it for that.
5524000	5532000	But I still love the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3, so I can't wait to try it in Andromeda.
5532000	5538000	Yep, and then they showed off some stuff for the new Walking Dead series that's going to be coming out.
5538000	5544000	It looked okay, and I know they have some reoccurring characters. I still haven't played any of those, so I don't know.
5546000	5552000	And then as far as the Game Awards winners, one of the things I didn't really care for on the Game Awards is like,
5552000	5557000	a lot of these, they're like, oh yeah, and this person's accepting the award for this, but they also won this!
5557000	5561000	And it's like, okay, wow, there's no fanfare whatsoever for that.
5561000	5566000	Must be a time thing, because they kind of did that last year too, or it was like, I'm going to interview you, and you won this award!
5567000	5576000	Yeah, so, for example, Game of the Year went to Overwatch. Game Direction also Overwatch.
5576000	5582000	Narrative was Uncharted 4. Art Direction went to Inside, which I thought was pretty cool, and then Indie won that.
5583000	5589000	Doom won best music and sound design. Of course, best performance was Nolan North.
5589000	5597000	Games for Impact went to That Dragon Cancer, which, you know, very touching speech,
5597000	5603000	but my god, those people that were presenting were a little too enthusiastic about saying that.
5603000	5610000	It went to That Dragon Cancer! It's like, okay, dude, chill the fuck down.
5610000	5618000	This is about a game about some kid who died. Don't need that much fucking oomph from you, okay?
5618000	5620000	Just calm the fuck down.
5620000	5621000	Come down to about a seven.
5621000	5623000	Yeah, calm that shit down.
5624000	5627000	Best independent game also went to Inside, which is awesome.
5627000	5633000	Best mobile or handheld game went to Pokemon Go, which I don't agree with that whatsoever.
5633000	5643000	Maybe a few months ago, yes, but honestly, compared to the other games that were in the category, it is least game of all of them, I think.
5643000	5645000	I don't know if I agree, but that's alright.
5645000	5656000	Best VR game, Rez Infinite. Best action game went to Doom. Action adventure, Dishonored 2, which is weird because that just came out.
5656000	5664000	Best RPG went to Witcher 3. Best fighting game, Street Fighter 5. Civ 6 won best strategy game.
5664000	5670000	Family game went to Pokemon Go. Sports racing went to Forza Horizon 3.
5670000	5673000	Multiplayer went to Overwatch.
5673000	5682000	And most anticipated game, which is most throwaway category ever, went to Legends of the Breath of the Wild.
5682000	5688000	And trending gamer went to Boogie2988.
5688000	5695000	And of course, best fan creation, apparently there was no award listed for that.
5696000	5702000	What do you think about the whole... I guess there's some controversy out there, and I didn't really realize this until, you know, it was brought up on Bobby's show,
5702000	5708000	and I did see a little bit about this on Twitter as well, is that apparently some people are really not okay with the fact that Overwatch won Game of the Year.
5708000	5715000	I'm not sure I understand that because I kind of think Overwatch is a fantastic game.
5715000	5721000	I do understand some people are bothered by the fact that it's multiplayer only, although I could nab you on a technicality.
5721000	5724000	You can play against AI. It's just not nearly as fun.
5724000	5731000	I think to disqualify something for, you know, not having a single player version, if you want to fault them for anything, you fault them for their fucking loot system,
5731000	5735000	but aside from that, I mean, everyone likes it, so what's the big deal?
5735000	5740000	I would rather they do that loot system than what Mortal Kombat X did, for what it's worth.
5740000	5750000	I mean, but I kind of think Overwatch in many ways has changed the game, and there's a lot of people out there that don't play first person shooters that got sucked into Overwatch,
5750000	5758000	and I think Overwatch kind of opened up that new genre, and I think especially, like, this is a shooter game.
5758000	5768000	A first person shooter game, team game, where the characters are so rich and developed that it's like a Disney cartoon.
5768000	5778000	Like, this game has accomplished a lot that a game like Doom that I really enjoyed, mind you, I don't think did in the same way.
5778000	5786000	Well, I think, you know, Team Fortress 2 did it first, but, you know, they really cut back on what their, you know, advertising for that.
5786000	5791000	They did do it first, Overwatch took it to another level, in my opinion, but these are opinions.
5791000	5797000	And of course, we're always gonna bitch about award shows, that's what these fucking things are for, is to get us to bitch and complain about them,
5797000	5801000	just like the Oscars, when, you know, remember when Crash won the Oscar? Jesus Christ.
5801000	5806000	You know, all that type of stuff. Like, anyway, but Alan, you play a lot of Overwatch, what do you want to say?
5806000	5816000	I was gonna say, Overwatch, unlike any other game I've ever seen before, has a huge fan art, fan fiction, and, you know, player created universe,
5816000	5827000	comprised of people that have no intention of playing the game and haven't played the game, because the characters are so vibrant, and the little ship wars and all this stuff.
5827000	5835000	So, like, they'll watch the, because the story that Blizzard provides for Overwatch is kind of paper thin to begin with.
5835000	5843000	You really just have those YouTube shorts, but I've never seen a game that has such a huge fandom comprised of people that have never played the game,
5843000	5850000	that understand the characters, know about the characters, draw them, fantastic fan art, all this stuff.
5851000	5858000	That, in itself, I think is worthy of giving a game of the year, that it has some type of appeal like that.
5858000	5865000	But anyway, everybody's gonna bitch about award shows, so obviously, I can even see in chat, there's people that disagree, and we're having the same things in there,
5865000	5873000	and I'm just kinda, I'm rolling my eyes in a way, I'm not rolling my eyes at the opinion, I'm rolling my eyes at the whole, and this is what award shows do.
5873000	5877000	Like, this is the hype they build, so you tune in next year and all that stuff, so.
5877000	5886000	But, at the same time, I also just kinda feel like, okay, wait, there are reasons why Overwatch is worthy of game of the year consideration.
5886000	5893000	But again, just like Shane hated Final Fantasy XV, and I don't fucking understand it, there's just always gonna be differences of opinion.
5894000	5902000	But, and one thing we can agree on that was really cringey about the whole show was the product placement, and granted, yes, I do understand they have to pay for the show,
5902000	5907000	but my fucking god, do we really need a person dressed up like a shit hydro robot?
5909000	5914000	It was just such a weird, like, oh hey, let's just watch this awesome trailer for Death Stranding, wow, that was so cool.
5914000	5918000	Now let's talk about the shit hydro bot, and fucking, what the fuck was that?
5918000	5920000	At least it wasn't Doritos and Mountain Dew.
5920000	5925000	It is now, it's a new meme, so, I mean, it's just, it's bad.
5925000	5928000	Alright, so let's talk about the PlayStation Experience.
5928000	5934000	So, I mean, literally two days later, then we have the PlayStation Experience happens, but you didn't watch the keynote.
5934000	5938000	I did not watch this, I watched the trailers a little bit afterwards, for the ones I was interested in.
5938000	5944000	So I did watch the PlayStation Experience, so I'll take the lead on this a little bit, you fill in any gaps that I'm missing on this stuff, okay?
5944000	5945000	Because I'm gonna do it from memory.
5945000	5951000	So, the PlayStation Experience had the thing, and JD, you actually watched this with me, even though you don't really play a lot of the modern games.
5951000	5953000	Did you like what you saw out of the keynote?
5953000	5955000	Well, I mean, I recognized Parappa, that's for sure.
5955000	5960000	We'll get to that. I will say that, you know, I think Sony did a bang up job.
5960000	5963000	I mean, really, this was like an E3 level conference.
5963000	5968000	The news was there, you know, and they promised it at the beginning, it's gonna be games, games, games.
5968000	5971000	And no backwards compatibility news, so fuck them.
5971000	5976000	There isn't, and there's, yes, there are places that Sony still needs to improve.
5976000	5982000	But hey, you know what? At least a guy came out on stage and said the word Vita multiple times.
5982000	5986000	So, we gotta give him a little credit, we're gonna give him a little credit, partial credit for that.
5986000	5993000	But no, I think all things considered, despite the lack of backwards compatibility, when they so set it up for that, at one point,
5993000	5996000	the words he was saying was talking about the classic games, he's like,
5996000	5999000	and we know you're excited to play classic games and stuff.
5999000	6004000	And like the whole audience is like, we are about to jizz all at once because of what you're about to say.
6004000	6007000	And they said, let's talk about the Crash Bandicoot remaster.
6007000	6011000	And everybody was like, motherfucker, you know, all that, not, not really.
6011000	6013000	Because Crash Bandicoot remaster, I guess we'll start there.
6013000	6016000	The Crash Bandicoot remaster looks really neat.
6016000	6021000	I mean, it's not just a simple up res, like they've gone back and they've redid a lot of stuff.
6021000	6024000	The question is, will that game formula hold up all this time later?
6024000	6026000	But I kind of think it will. I'll check it out.
6026000	6027000	Yeah.
6027000	6032000	Yeah. I mean, you know, I've, and the fact that it's like all three original games kind of helps quite a bit.
6032000	6034000	So, you know, that's, that's good.
6034000	6041000	I know it started, they started the PlayStation thing with some footage of a game that you didn't know what it was.
6041000	6048000	And it looked really pretty and it looked like it was set in India, you know, and the lead character was wearing a burka.
6048000	6050000	So you were kind of like, oh, is this like, this is new IP?
6050000	6052000	What is this?
6052000	6055000	And actually we were all sitting in the room and we were going, it's Tomb Raider.
6055000	6057000	This is a Tomb Raider game.
6057000	6063000	But then we're kind of looking at, but I'm kind of looking at going, but I just, Tomb Raider in the city just, but I'm like, okay, well maybe they're going to go a radical new direction.
6063000	6069000	I think it was supposed to be Syria, but they showed a horizon shot where it was obvious that this place that she was at was very war torn.
6069000	6073000	And Tomb Raider doesn't really go to those types of topics.
6073000	6076000	So, but, but I mean, in the beginning it was like, oh, this could be Tomb Raider.
6076000	6078000	This might be like, oh, just like Microsoft got the second Tomb Raider.
6078000	6080000	Maybe Sony's got a deal for the third.
6080000	6086000	But then it turns out, no, it's not Tomb Raider, but it's like literally the adjacent thing. It's Uncharted.
6086000	6088000	It's, it's a, it was an Uncharted game.
6088000	6094000	It was Uncharted Lost Legacy, except this time, and I have to admit, I'm not super, I don't super follow Uncharted.
6094000	6098000	And I realize a lot of you are into it, but again, you can only play so many games as a hobbyist.
6098000	6103000	But I understand this is a very popular female character in the game.
6103000	6109000	When she took off her scarf and the entire audience like gay gassed, I'm like, I have no idea who this woman is.
6109000	6113000	And I guess, yeah, it's Nathan Drake's ex from 2.
6113000	6118000	And she's, I guess, a fan favorite character, very recognizable face.
6118000	6125000	Oh, Claudia Black, who is Morgan in Dragon Age and the woman in Farscape.
6125000	6128000	That's, that's one of the characters that she voice acts for.
6128000	6129000	Oh, okay.
6129000	6133000	So it's, it's going to, so she by herself is amazing.
6133000	6141000	But yeah, she's getting her own game and it was, it was really interesting for me to hear the entire audience go like, it's hard.
6141000	6143000	I'm like, I don't know who this, who this chick is.
6143000	6146000	Darts at Sea and chat says gay gasp. That's a thing.
6148000	6153000	No, no, no, that's not, that's, that's, no, this, yeah.
6153000	6156000	Like, yes, has to be very over the top.
6156000	6158000	You have to clutch your pearls as you inhale.
6158000	6160000	Yes, you have to clutch your pearls as you inhale.
6160000	6162000	That's the, that's the difference. Yeah, exactly.
6162000	6165000	Like, and it has to be like big, has to be really big news.
6165000	6168000	You know, crash beat Brokeback Mountain for best picture.
6170000	6175000	And I made, I made an Uncharted joke before we were like, I think this is Tomb Raider.
6175000	6177000	And then it turned out actually it is tangent.
6177000	6179000	It is, it is a part of the Uncharted umbrella.
6179000	6180000	I was like, of course.
6180000	6182000	So didn't you like shout out to Nathan Drake?
6183000	6184000	Oh, yeah. Like it looked, yeah.
6184000	6189000	It's, it's obviously a woman with long hair that's wrapped up in a scarf covering her face.
6189000	6193000	But like once the scarf comes off, it's just like Nathan Drake's like face, like with the stubble and everything.
6193000	6196000	Like, I just thought that would be hilarious.
6196000	6197000	It would be hilarious. It'd be good.
6197000	6202000	Dungeon buster chat over at live.vognetwork.com says she's like Nathan Drake only with less scruples.
6202000	6205000	So what I see of Nathan Drake on Tumblr, he doesn't have many scruples at all.
6205000	6210000	But, but the game looked great for what, I mean, cause that looked like it was being rendered like in game.
6210000	6212000	Like that was like an actual, like, so it looked really neat.
6212000	6215000	And you know, again, I don't really play a lot of the Uncharted games and I totally recognize it.
6215000	6220000	I guess one of those series I need to play, but you know, tear me away from the MMOs and maybe I will.
6222000	6225000	Then they announced Marvel versus Capcom.
6225000	6230000	It is, and even last week, didn't we sit here last week and say it was debunked, but I guess not.
6230000	6235000	Somebody did a good job saving that thing from leaking completely, I guess.
6235000	6241000	But it is more Marvel versus Capcom infinite, not Marvel versus Capcom 4, but you know, same thing.
6241000	6246000	Except as the joke I said with Loki earlier, infinite DLC perhaps, but we'll see.
6247000	6254000	They did show gameplay. Now in the, in the press thing they did in the morning, well it wasn't really a press thing, but it might as well have been.
6254000	6257000	That thing they did in the morning, they didn't really show the gameplay.
6257000	6261000	But if you watch the Capcom Cup later on, which we just happened to be watching Twitch at the time.
6261000	6268000	We turned it on right as the Street Fighter V finals were happening, and then right after that, they showed the gameplay footage.
6268000	6272000	And it looked pretty good. I'm assuming it's being done in Street Fighter V's engine?
6272000	6273000	No, Unreal 4.
6273000	6274000	Oh really?
6274000	6275000	Yep.
6275000	6276000	Interesting.
6276000	6281000	But it looks good. There's only four characters we know so far. Ryu, Mega Man X.
6281000	6285000	They were supposed to, Captain America was another confirmed character apparently, but yeah.
6285000	6287000	Ms. Marvel, or Captain Marvel.
6287000	6289000	Mega Man X and Iron Man.
6289000	6290000	And Iron Man.
6290000	6291000	Yeah.
6291000	6294000	So that's all we know so far, but then again, the rumors are out there, there are no X-Men.
6294000	6299000	Which would be a very strange departure for the series, because Storm has always been there, Cyclops has always been there.
6299000	6301000	It would be very strange to not have that, but.
6301000	6305000	It would be a departure for the video game, but it's very current with what's going on in the comics right now.
6305000	6307000	True, fair enough, fair enough.
6307000	6312000	It would be cool though if we could get some more of the Cinematic Universe, maybe Doctor Strange, maybe Ant-Man or something.
6312000	6317000	Several people in chat are saying Morrigan was also confirmed, as well as Captain America.
6317000	6319000	So, well that's cool.
6319000	6326000	Alright, so Marvel vs. Capcom, and then they drop the bombshell, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is out on Playstation 4 today.
6326000	6332000	Which, all those copyright issues we talked about a few weeks ago, I guess they worked that shit out, because there it is.
6332000	6336000	Which is weird, because that does have X-Men characters, and that also has Deadpool in it.
6336000	6341000	And it's like, well shit, if you can work that shit out, why can't you work it out for this game?
6341000	6344000	It must be something about the fact that the game was already done a long time ago.
6344000	6350000	And if they did backwards compatibility with PS3, you could just run it that way, but now you have to buy it again.
6350000	6352000	Yeah, nice.
6352000	6354000	They didn't do any remaster or anything to it, right?
6354000	6360000	No, they did. I thought it was upres, and it's also 60 FPS or something.
6360000	6363000	I just figured they took the 3 and made it playable on the 4.
6363000	6365000	They could maybe.
6365000	6367000	It has all the DLC though.
6367000	6368000	That's cool.
6369000	6376000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, fear.
6376000	6378000	I was really into this.
6378000	6384000	Some folks in the room, like Alan and JD when this came on, were like, is this F-Zero?
6384000	6387000	But no, it's the next best thing on a Sony console, it was Wipeout.
6387000	6393000	And so they are remastering the Wipeout series, which is interesting because that developer had closed years ago.
6394000	6404000	So Sony must be taking those assets and they must have given it to somebody else to develop the Wipeout Omega collection that is confirmed is going to come out on PlayStation 4 this summer.
6404000	6409000	I'm a fan of the Wipeout series. It took me a little bit to warm up to. I didn't like it right away.
6409000	6414000	But it was a game I played a lot of all things. I think it was on the Vita or on the PSP, one of those.
6414000	6418000	I played a lot of the Wipeout. I remember playing that on the portable.
6418000	6420000	And it's a fun series.
6420000	6427000	I mean, again, since Nintendo keeps denying me a fucking HD F-Zero, I will take what I can get.
6427000	6435000	So an HD Wipeout, even though we did have one on, but you know, a more HD-er Wipeout on PlayStation 4 will be welcomed.
6435000	6437000	I'm excited to check that out for sure.
6439000	6447000	Then there was that Crash Remastered footage, Ace Combat 7, which I gotta admit I don't really follow the franchise.
6448000	6450000	That has PlayStation VR support. I didn't know that.
6450000	6457000	That looked pretty cool. But I also know this series does have its diehard fans, as Flight Sim games also do.
6457000	6459000	Although Ace Combat's not a total Flight Sim game.
6459000	6460000	It's more arcade-y, I think.
6460000	6469000	Yeah, it's more arcade-y. I feel like it kind of fills that void for like, if Top Gun on the NES had become a series, on and on, this is what it would be now.
6469000	6476000	You know what I mean? But obviously, because of licensing and stuff, there really wasn't any more Top Gun games after the NES.
6476000	6479000	But I kind of feel like that's what this would be years later.
6479000	6482000	But I know people are super into it, so I wanted to give it a shoutout.
6482000	6488000	I no longer care about Half-Life 3 because I saw that NAC 2 was coming out. Just kidding, no one cares.
6489000	6494000	Yes, NAC 2 was announced. And that kind of came out of left field.
6496000	6498000	Was the first one even good? Was the first one even a hit?
6498000	6500000	He had a cult following, I think.
6501000	6507000	This is the sequel nobody asked for. Was it well-received in Japan compared to here, maybe? I don't know, Kuma?
6507000	6509000	There's a lot of people that are fans of NAC.
6509000	6519000	Really? Alright, well, hey, if that Windjammer game, which I'd never fucking heard of, can get a release that gets everybody riled up, then why not NAC?
6519000	6521000	What the fuck's Windjammer?
6521000	6531000	So, apparently, it's one of those, like, okay, you know how we never shut up about the Guardian Legend and how the Guardian Legend deserves a sequel or it deserves another chance, you know, all this stuff?
6531000	6538000	So, is it GameSpot or is it Giant Bomb? One of those does that with Windjammer.
6538000	6543000	So, because they're bigger and more people pay attention to them, they actually got their wish.
6544000	6554000	It's a Neo Geo game where, if you wanted the home version, you had to get the console where the games were, like, $300 because it was the arcade board that you were basically buying. I think it's a Neo Geo game.
6554000	6560000	As the homeowner, Matt, insists, we're playing Windjammer at MAGFest. That's fine. I mean, there's obviously a reason they won't shut up about it.
6560000	6572000	It looked like it must have had the competitive edge. It looked like the game, maybe this is something somebody stayed up all night playing at, like, a sleepover party, like, years ago or something, and that's why, you know, people have, like, a sentimental attachment to it or whatever.
6572000	6580000	But, like, literally, as I was watching it, I was like, okay, like, the audience seemed to be losing their shit, and I'm like, there is clearly a joke I am not in on.
6580000	6588000	So, I, like, went to Twitter and I'm like, what's the joke? Because I don't get some, I got some tweets. It's like, oh, Giant Bomb, they love it over there, all this stuff. I was like, oh, okay, so.
6588000	6589000	Well, what about what we want?
6589000	6598000	I know, what about what I want? I guess we have to get about 2 million more followers before we'll get our Guardian Legend remake.
6599000	6610000	All right. Let's see. So, what else? Oh, speaking of remakes, Parappa the Rappa unveiled as a remaster. That was a little bit of a bombshell that they dropped.
6610000	6621000	Now, we had heard Inklings a couple days before that Sony had filed a trademark or something for Parappa the Rappa, so there was a lot of news going into Saturday that it was coming back.
6621000	6632000	And maybe that was a little bad that that came out because my mind went, finally, they're going to give us a new Parappa game. This is the game, they're going to right all the wrongs with Parappa 2.
6632000	6642000	Maybe Umjama Lamy will make an appearance in it, and it'll be like the must-have Parappa game. I am so excited. We're finally going to revisit this series, and it's a remaster of the first game.
6642000	6645000	Buy one of your favorite games again.
6645000	6646000	Yeah.
6646000	6652000	It's what they're doing, because why bother adding backwards compatibility when you can resell these games for 20 bucks a pop again?
6652000	6660000	Well, but if they're going to remaster them like they're doing Parappa, then I'm a lot more okay with it than I am when they don't.
6660000	6668000	Which, by the way, they released Parappa the Rappa 2 on PlayStation 4 last year when they kicked off their whole PS2 thing.
6668000	6676000	So, is it really an accomplishment to remaster a game that's art style, was cel-shaded, and very...
6676000	6678000	4K graphics, Alan.
6678000	6688000	But the whole point of that game is the music, which is fantastic, but it's like, we rebuilt Parappa the Rappa from the ground up or whatever, and it's like, but it was always cartoons. Who cares?
6688000	6692000	And it wasn't that crazy of a system. I mean, what? It's a rhythm game.
6692000	6695000	They look like, they're like paper dolls.
6695000	6699000	And where the fuck is Vib-Ribbon? Wasn't I supposed to get that on PlayStation 4 like a year ago?
6699000	6700000	I was promised Vib-Ribbon.
6700000	6702000	Yeah, where the hell's Vib-Ribbon?
6702000	6706000	You know, did Parappa ever get the Space Channel 5 treatment where they like...
6706000	6712000	Sorry, just quickly. I understand it was released on PlayStation 3, but we were supposed to get it on PlayStation 4 at some point too. That didn't happen. Anyway.
6712000	6718000	Do they ever like release a collected edition with the sequels all together in one place, or are they just like scattershot, like here's this one, here's that one?
6718000	6721000	I think they're scattershot because Parappa 2 was on PlayStation 2.
6721000	6722000	Right.
6722000	6727000	And so, yeah, and Umjama Lammy, for some reason everybody's forgotten about even though it was the superior game.
6727000	6728000	Because it had a different name.
6728000	6734000	Well, it was the sequel that Parappa, like, needed.
6734000	6735000	Should have been or whatever.
6735000	6738000	Yeah, should have been or whatever, even though Parappa 2 came later. But anyway, anyway.
6738000	6744000	Look, here's the thing. I don't want to sound like I'm hating on it too much because of course I downloaded the demo and it was a lot of fun to play.
6744000	6749000	I still love Parappa. If this is how a new generation can get introduced to Parappa, then cool.
6749000	6757000	I just wish they'd go somewhere new with it. Maybe this is them testing the water, this has to do well for them to justify another stage.
6757000	6763000	But it's like we just got Rez again, which, but I love Rez and it's great in VR and all this stuff.
6763000	6765000	But Area X.
6765000	6767000	But they added Area X. They added some excuse to it.
6767000	6769000	Now did you play Area X finally?
6769000	6770000	I still haven't gone to Area X.
6770000	6772000	You really need to do Area X.
6773000	6783000	But it's like I would be ten times more excited about Parappa if like, oh, but you can, you know, get a new stage that we added to the game or there's something else and it's kind of missing for me.
6783000	6796000	However, as part of that same announcement, in the same breath, they also said, by the way, LocoRoco and Patapon are also going to be redone just like this.
6796000	6810000	And actually, this is really weird for me to say, I'm almost more excited about those two than I am Parappa because those two, the fact that they came out on the handhelds originally, I think a lot of people overlooked those series, especially Patapon.
6810000	6819000	You know, Patapon's a pretty cool little, like it's like part music game, part, you know, but that's, I think a lot of people missed that game because it was never on a console.
6819000	6823000	So I'm actually more excited that that is getting a second chance than even maybe something like Parappa.
6823000	6824000	Yeah.
6824000	6825000	So what were you gonna say, Loki?
6825000	6826000	Oh, I was just gonna say that.
6826000	6827000	That same thing.
6827000	6830000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6830000	6834000	Orange Right says, it's cool to have both Parappas, hopefully Umjama Lamy follows suit.
6834000	6835000	Exactly.
6835000	6848000	But at the same time, if you're going to do Umjama Lamy, you can either A, add a new stage or B, give me the original version with the hell stage, not the censored stuff.
6849000	6854000	That would be a draw, but I just, I'm not going to hold my breath that that would ever happen, but I'm just going to say.
6854000	6856000	All right.
6856000	6857000	Let's see.
6857000	6860000	Gran Turismo Sport looked pretty gorgeous.
6860000	6862000	It did, and it's also VR support.
6862000	6864000	They were like, it supports the pro.
6864000	6865000	It supports PlayStation VR.
6865000	6867000	It supports the camera.
6867000	6870000	I don't know if they said the camera, but it feels like it supports everything.
6870000	6871000	4K.
6871000	6873000	Yeah, 4K HDR.
6873000	6877000	And it looked gorgeous, like absolutely gorgeous, which Gran Turismo games usually do.
6877000	6882000	So, um, you know, I'm, even though I don't get into that series because I can't do this.
6882000	6884000	Yeah, it's per sim.
6884000	6890000	I wish, I really wish that you go the Forza Horizon route where you can dial that sim or arcade in.
6890000	6896000	Do you know how bad I would love a Gran Turismo like arcadey game, like a Gran Turismo Horizon?
6896000	6899000	Like, why is it, is that what Drive Club was supposed to be?
6899000	6901000	Drive Club is still more sim racing, I think.
6901000	6902000	Okay.
6902000	6906000	Motorstorm is more of like your arcade racing type thing.
6906000	6911000	Well, that was even so somewhat sim, but I mean, you know, Motorstorm Paco is not sim.
6911000	6918000	If any Sony peeps are out there, Gran Turismo, but Forza Horizon it, like there's people that would love to see that.
6918000	6923000	Just like even the settings, like even if you can have the settings, just like you do in Forza Horizon,
6923000	6931000	where you can, if you really suck at racing games like I do, and you just want to dial that old arcadey and stuff, then fine, you should do that.
6931000	6933000	I will point out though, they did change the name to Sport.
6933000	6937000	Could that indicate that it's a little bit different from the mainline games?
6937000	6938000	Could be.
6938000	6941000	So maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves. Maybe there is going to be a shift here.
6941000	6942000	Maybe, yeah.
6942000	6945000	All right, so we'll see, to be continued.
6945000	6951000	Let's see, Ni No Kuni 2, they showed some more footage of, which that game's a little bit legendary here at VOG Network.
6951000	6956000	But I like to, I mean, they're very heavy on the anime and the cut scenes, but you saw a little bit of the playable stuff.
6957000	6963000	It looked like it didn't maybe necessarily connect so much to the first game, which might be a good thing, because I'm sure there's a lot of people,
6963000	6969000	I mean, the first game came out a while ago now, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of people who never played the first game are going to be curious about this one.
6969000	6974000	So are they Final Fantasy-ing it a little bit, where the two games don't tie together?
6974000	6977000	But, you know, I really liked what I saw, so I'd be curious about it.
6977000	6981000	Just, you know, maybe reconsider the demo this time.
6981000	6984000	Maybe you guys can get Bobby Black Wolf on board with Ni No Kuni 2.
6984000	6989000	If you approach the demo differently, just re-approach that a little differently.
6989000	6995000	Yakuza 6 and Kiwami, both were shown back to back.
6995000	7002000	I know Yakuza, like, super has diehard fans and very cinematic presentation and lots of things to do in those games.
7002000	7004000	So I know people are very excited about those games.
7004000	7007000	Again, another franchise like Uncharted that I know I need to play.
7007000	7009000	So what's Kiwami?
7009000	7011000	That's the reimagining of the first game, if I'm not mistaken.
7011000	7012000	Oh.
7012000	7017000	So that is both on the horizon for the next year.
7017000	7022000	Then, believe it or not, I'm going to bring up a sports game because MLB 17, the show, right?
7022000	7026000	They showed a little bit of that, but they showed this retro mode that looked awesome.
7026000	7032000	Like, it was like, you still, but it was like you had the modern-day graphics that you get with one of these games,
7032000	7035000	but the play style was like the NES or something.
7035000	7038000	And the scoreboard looked all NES style and there were sprites,
7038000	7043000	but all over like the photo-realistic graphics that come with one of these newer sports games.
7043000	7049000	And I was like, you have my attention because I could play baseball games back during like, you know,
7049000	7053000	RBI baseball and bases loaded and all this stuff on the NES.
7053000	7055000	It's a little rough for me now.
7055000	7059000	So if they kind of dumbed it down a little bit in a retro mode, I really want to try that.
7059000	7062000	So I think that was a very interesting approach for that.
7062000	7067000	Do it in a hockey game so I can feel like I'm playing Blades of Steel all over again, please.
7068000	7072000	Lara Croft GO, coming out on PlayStation 4.
7072000	7075000	Actually, that was a It's Out Today release.
7075000	7081000	That game has already existed, if I'm not mistaken, on PC and I think the mobile tablet space.
7081000	7086000	So it's not a new game per se, but a lot of people will be giving that the first go.
7086000	7090000	They announced a free game on PlayStation 4, Let It Die.
7090000	7096000	Although I used my quotey fingers with free because I noticed when I went to get Let It Die in the store,
7096000	7099000	they were selling gems in different sized packs.
7099000	7101000	Well, yeah, it's free to play.
7101000	7103000	It's one of those free to play games.
7103000	7108000	It's the guy that did, you know, all the, I forget the name, Grasshopper.
7108000	7111000	The manufacturer, I think, is the one that's behind it.
7111000	7113000	I think that's who it was.
7113000	7121000	They're the ones that did like, you know, Killer7 and No More Heroes, all that stuff.
7121000	7125000	Ys Origin, I was just surprised to see that at the press conference,
7125000	7127000	because usually we don't talk about the Ys series on the American shores.
7127000	7131000	I just wanted to say I was pleasantly blown away that they showed that here,
7131000	7136000	because, you know, that's more of a cult type game for the really JRPG affectionados.
7136000	7138000	And they showed that on the main stage.
7138000	7139000	I thought that was cool.
7139000	7146000	And then the big finish, you know, just explosion everywhere was The Last of Us 2.
7146000	7150000	And a lot of people lost their flippin' minds over that, even though we don't have any gameplay,
7150000	7152000	but just the fact that they're doing it.
7152000	7156000	And the characters that are coming back have a lot of people very, very excited.
7156000	7159000	And I know a lot of people really, really love that game,
7159000	7163000	so I understand why people are excited about the sequel.
7163000	7166000	Also on my list of games, I must have something against Naughty Dog.
7166000	7168000	Like, I keep skipping all their games. I'm not doing it intentionally.
7168000	7172000	I haven't played Last of Us either, and apparently a lot of people see it's fantastic.
7172000	7175000	Yeah, I keep meaning to visit the PS4 remaster, because it's only like 20 bucks,
7175000	7179000	but it's just, you know, again, pull me away from the RPGs if you can.
7179000	7182000	But I know a lot of people very excited about the sequel.
7182000	7183000	And the trailer did look really good.
7183000	7188000	You know, for a reveal trailer, what I liked about it is that, yes, it was not gameplay footage,
7188000	7191000	but it definitely looked like it was something that was rendered completely in the game.
7191000	7192000	You know what I mean?
7192000	7195000	So that's what I thought was really nice about that.
7195000	7197000	So, very exciting.
7197000	7203000	Also, now, there's a game missing from this list, and, chat, you might have to help me out with this.
7203000	7206000	What was the game? It was a twin-stick shooter game.
7207000	7208000	Oh, yeah.
7208000	7211000	And they actually have the guy from Smash TV is on board with that game.
7211000	7214000	Is that the Supergiant Games game that they were showing?
7214000	7218000	What was the twin-stick shooter game? Because that soundtrack was amazing.
7218000	7220000	Whatever that was. I was so here for that.
7220000	7225000	It was Hex Machina, Death Machine.
7225000	7228000	Thank you. Dark to see us as Hex Machina. That was the name of the game, yes.
7228000	7233000	And Eugene Jarvis, of course, of Smash TV Legend, is involved with that game.
7233000	7238000	And the soundtrack was amazing. So, yes, please, to that.
7238000	7241000	So, we'll be seeing more on that in the future.
7241000	7244000	Was that also the game that Supergiant Games was doing?
7244000	7248000	Or, no, I'm mixing up my games right now.
7248000	7254000	I don't see who's attached to that. Let's see what the other one was here.
7254000	7256000	Actually, I feel like the Supergiant Games had a different name.
7256000	7260000	I think I am mixing up games. I think Supergiant Games had a one-word game.
7260000	7263000	That might be this one here. Let me just take a look.
7263000	7268000	Was it Vain?
7268000	7271000	I don't remember.
7271000	7274000	No, that's Friend or Foe Games. That's different.
7274000	7278000	I do remember they also showed a concept trailer or whatever.
7278000	7280000	They showed a little more about that Edith Finch game.
7280000	7282000	Like, whatever happened to Edith Finch.
7282000	7287000	And that trailer was pretty conceptually pretty cool.
7287000	7290000	Did you see that? Oh, no, you didn't see that because you didn't see the show.
7290000	7292000	So, never mind.
7292000	7294000	Pyre. I am mixing up my games.
7294000	7297000	Pyre is the Supergiant Games that's being worked on.
7297000	7300000	But, anyway, that Hex Machina looked amazing.
7300000	7303000	So, I'm here for that.
7303000	7307000	Okay, let's move on. That's a lot of gaming news.
7307000	7310000	My god, we've had a two-hour opener tonight show.
7310000	7312000	That's how much news has been going on this week. It's a busy week.
7312000	7314000	But we've got to get to the classic game of the week.
7314000	7318000	We've got to go back to a time. Let's go back to a time when retro mode was simply mode.
7320000	7322000	The classic game of the week.
7322000	7325000	Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a week that she thinks,
7325000	7330000	hey, brats, play this game instead of your fancy pants, Last of Uses,
7330000	7334000	and your Nax that you all want a sequel for.
7334000	7336000	Go back to this classic game.
7336000	7338000	Obviously Dark Sakura not here in studio tonight.
7338000	7341000	She'll be back to take over the segment next week.
7341000	7345000	So, here it is, the last chance to stealth this segment away with Halo.
7345000	7349000	But I'm going to allow JD to pick tonight's game.
7349000	7351000	JD, what is the classic game of the week this week?
7351000	7355000	So, this is Generation 2's side game. It's Pokemon Puzzle Challenge.
7355000	7358000	Oh, a timely Pokemon selection to go with all the...
7358000	7362000	We can't forget that Sun and Moon, there's still a lot of hysteria around that game.
7362000	7363000	Right.
7363000	7365000	Even though Final Fantasy XV came out this week.
7365000	7369000	Yeah. So, this is a game. It's a puzzle game, as you might guess from the name.
7369000	7373000	This is for Game Boy Color, and it came out in 2000.
7373000	7378000	There's a grid that's like 6 by, I want to say 18 or so.
7378000	7384000	You match the color blocks by switching two adjacent spaces horizontally.
7384000	7388000	This is basically a remade version of Tetris Attack,
7388000	7391000	which itself is a remade version of Panel de Pon.
7391000	7398000	And you end up making a lot of combos, which are simultaneously matching three or more,
7398000	7400000	and you end up to about 10 or so.
7400000	7404000	And there's also chains when the blocks cascade, because this game has gravity.
7404000	7407000	And if you continue to make combos, you make bigger and bigger chains,
7407000	7411000	which are worth more points and do more damage.
7411000	7413000	There's a couple of different modes.
7413000	7419000	The most prominent mode in the game involves what are called garbage blocks,
7419000	7423000	where the game just drops entire rows of unbreakable blocks on you.
7423000	7426000	Well, of solid blocks.
7426000	7430000	You try to break them by making a combo that's adjacent to them,
7430000	7434000	and they turn into usable blocks, and they drop down on the field.
7434000	7440000	And you are fighting various Gen 2 Pokémon.
7440000	7447000	There's also time limit modes, and get all the blocks below a certain point.
7447000	7449000	So it's a lot of fun.
7449000	7452000	The really big advantage of this game is that it was on the Game Boy Color,
7452000	7454000	so you could take it with you anywhere.
7454000	7457000	I've taken hours into this because I could just take it wherever I wanted
7457000	7460000	on road trips and stuff like that.
7460000	7463000	There's a couple of goals that you can do besides the main storyline.
7463000	7469000	If you do certain achievements, like make a chain of seven chain,
7469000	7472000	which is like blocks falling and cascading and continuing,
7472000	7478000	you get to catch rare Pokémon and things like that.
7478000	7482000	This also had an N64 version that was Pokémon Puzzle League,
7482000	7486000	and that was much more reliant on the anime.
7486000	7491000	But this version just had remixed versions of the Game Boy Color music
7491000	7497000	from the various towns that you have in Gold and Silver.
7497000	7500000	Yeah, I think that's about all I have to say about it.
7500000	7503000	So I like to hear memories about playing the game.
7503000	7504000	You kind of addressed this.
7504000	7506000	You like to play this on long road trips and stuff?
7506000	7510000	Yeah, well, I was in school when this came out,
7510000	7513000	and we would go on family trips, which were like six to eight hours in the car.
7513000	7517000	And if you take a Game Boy Color with you, the battery will last that long.
7517000	7519000	And it's something you do when you're just driving down the highway
7519000	7521000	and there's not much to look at.
7521000	7523000	Some of the Pokémon spin-off games were really good.
7523000	7528000	Yeah, this is one of the top-rated Game Boy Color games from the life of the system,
7528000	7531000	despite being a spin-off game from our franchise.
7531000	7534000	But puzzle games are one of my favorite genres,
7534000	7536000	and this one is absolutely worth picking up.
7536000	7539000	It's also on the 3DS Virtual Console,
7539000	7542000	so if you don't have a Game Boy Color anymore, you can still pick it up.
7542000	7543000	Ooh, good call.
7543000	7546000	Now, something I want to ask about, though, is that, you know,
7546000	7549000	if it had been me picking the Classic Game of the Week
7549000	7551000	and my brain went to Pokémon spin-off games,
7551000	7555000	I probably would have picked Pokémon Puzzle League on Nintendo 64.
7555000	7558000	But then again, you know, personal does a lot with that.
7558000	7561000	But did you ever play the N64 version?
7561000	7562000	Oh, yeah.
7562000	7564000	So I love the N64 version.
7564000	7568000	I have it on Virtual Console on my Wii because I don't have it at 64 anymore either.
7568000	7569000	It's a different game.
7569000	7571000	Part of it was just I had a Game Boy Color.
7571000	7576000	That was my first video game system, so I got it earlier,
7576000	7578000	even though the game came out later.
7578000	7581000	So part of it is personal memories, and part of it is just, like I said,
7581000	7585000	I think the portable nature of it made it a much more accessible game.
7585000	7587000	You know, you can't just take an N64 around with you.
7587000	7591000	You have to have a TV and a power source and all of that.
7591000	7596000	You know, the N64 version did have a 3D mode, which is cool, but...
7596000	7598000	And, like, those anime-style intros are pretty impressive.
7598000	7602000	Yeah, so the Pokémon Puzzle League is actually, you know,
7602000	7606000	it only came out in the U.S. because it relied so much on the anime dub.
7606000	7609000	I mean, it's a worthwhile game in its own right,
7609000	7614000	but this one really focused a lot more on the basics of we're doing puzzles,
7614000	7618000	and that's the heart of this game.
7618000	7620000	Yeah.
7620000	7621000	No, awesome.
7621000	7625000	I mean, again, this is a great, great spin-off game and just a fun puzzle game.
7625000	7627000	And I'm seeing in chat, there is a little shade being thrown in chat,
7627000	7628000	so I should bring this up.
7628000	7634000	Bobby Blackwolf says, Tetris Attack SNES greater than Pokémon Puzzle League N64.
7634000	7637000	Did the SNES one have a 3D mode?
7637000	7640000	Because that was a really, really neat feature.
7640000	7643000	Yeah, and Tetris Attack didn't really have the Pokémon stuff in it,
7643000	7644000	which was a really cute license.
7644000	7645000	I think it had Yoshis and stuff, though.
7645000	7647000	Yeah, yeah, Tetris Attack was a Mario license.
7647000	7649000	And Tetris Attack wasn't bad by any means.
7649000	7651000	It just, you know, I don't know.
7651000	7653000	I mean, the original game this is based on in Japan,
7653000	7656000	the Panel de Pon, that's where the lipstick item comes from in Super Smash.
7656000	7661000	So, I mean, all of it is just let's throw our licensed characters on it
7661000	7666000	to make a theme for it because that's how you do puzzle games to make people buy them.
7666000	7669000	And I'm with folks in chat who say both are great.
7669000	7670000	Let's leave it at that.
7670000	7672000	Yeah, they're both top-level games.
7672000	7673000	That's right.
7673000	7674000	Absolutely.
7674000	7675000	Puzzle games are awesome.
7675000	7678000	So there it is, your classic game of the week Pokémon Puzzle Challenge
7678000	7679000	on the Game Boy Color.
7679000	7680000	Thank you for that pick.
7680000	7683000	A very timely pick with a lot of Pokémon fever going around right now.
7683000	7684000	We are going to take a break.
7684000	7686000	It is time to finally take a break here.
7686000	7688000	We still have plenty more show to go.
7688000	7690000	Believe it or not, even though there was all that big news,
7690000	7694000	we still have news and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
7694000	7697000	when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
7704000	7707000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
7707000	7711000	Live tonight with episode number 668 of our show for this,
7711000	7714000	December the 4th of 2016.
7714000	7717000	Again, Dark Sakura is still out for one more week,
7717000	7719000	but JD, you did a very good job of classic game of the week this week.
7719000	7720000	Thank you.
7720000	7721000	Appreciate that.
7721000	7722000	Good job.
7722000	7723000	And speaking of kind of like classic games,
7723000	7725000	Loki, you and I were talking about something before the show tonight
7725000	7727000	that I thought was kind of interesting.
7727000	7730000	Yes, I was discussing how I was playing Excite Truck and stuff,
7730000	7732000	and I said, you know what?
7732000	7736000	Those launch Wii titles are 10 years old now
7736000	7739000	because, you know, and so they're all contenders of the classic game of the week.
7739000	7740000	Yeah, for sure.
7740000	7742000	That's kind of weird to think about is that, like, oh, my gosh,
7742000	7745000	and I remember when we were covering the Wii launch and all that stuff,
7745000	7751000	but, yeah, now things like the Zelda Twilight Princess would be eligible,
7751000	7753000	and we were talking about Trauma Center just the other day, right?
7753000	7755000	There was a Trauma Center game that was a Wii launch game.
7755000	7757000	Trauma Center was slightly about a month late,
7757000	7759000	so you have to wait a couple of months.
7759000	7760000	I thought it was a launch title.
7760000	7761000	It was a launch title.
7761000	7762000	It was close.
7762000	7763000	It was, like, a couple weeks later.
7763000	7765000	It was a remake of the DS game anyway.
7765000	7766000	Oh, okay.
7766000	7768000	I thought we got that when we got the Wii game, but whatever.
7768000	7770000	But anyway, yeah, that's great.
7770000	7771000	Red Steel.
7771000	7773000	So, oh, yeah, Red Steel.
7773000	7774000	Oh, my God, the Ubisoft game, right?
7774000	7775000	Yeah.
7775000	7779000	So it's crazy to think that, yeah, Wii games are now eligible for classic game of the week.
7779000	7781000	Are Raving Rabbids also a launch title?
7781000	7783000	What is Raving Rabbids?
7783000	7785000	I think that might have been later.
7785000	7788000	I'm trying to think what I got at launch because I bought a ton of the launch games
7788000	7789000	when they came out.
7789000	7792000	So I know Wii Sports, that would be one.
7792000	7796000	Obviously, Excite Truck.
7796000	7799000	I think I got, I'm trying to think what other games I bought.
7799000	7801000	Twilight Princess.
7801000	7803000	I don't know.
7803000	7805000	Well, Excite Truck's all that matters.
7805000	7807000	Next time you get to pick a game, that would be one.
7807000	7808000	Exactly.
7808000	7809000	Yeah.
7809000	7810000	All right.
7810000	7811000	Anyway, let's get back.
7811000	7813000	You know what's not eligible ever, though, is Halo.
7813000	7815000	Just kidding.
7815000	7819000	Let's get back into the news cycle with some rapid fire news.
7819000	7820000	Loki.
7820000	7823000	So YouTube has upgraded their streaming.
7823000	7828000	So now you'll be able to stream in 4K, which is fantastic,
7828000	7831000	except I don't think that my internet can handle that.
7831000	7836000	I mean, I can't even download in 4K, I don't believe.
7836000	7838000	Well, then again, I don't have a 4K TV, so I wouldn't know.
7838000	7840000	But yeah, you can do that.
7840000	7847000	And also, they're going to extend, I guess, you're going to be able to do 360 videos.
7847000	7848000	Well, I guess in 4K.
7848000	7851000	It says the 4K streaming option also extends to 360 video.
7851000	7853000	Wow.
7853000	7857000	And then, of course, this was kind of cool.
7857000	7859000	Not necessarily during the PlayStation conference,
7859000	7863000	but there was another conference going on in Vancouver, Canada.
7863000	7865000	And that was MechCon 2016.
7865000	7870000	And apparently, they announced that Piranha Games is going to be releasing
7870000	7873000	MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries.
7873000	7876000	And it looks pretty awesome and MechWarrior-ish.
7876000	7880000	It's going to be taking place in the year 3015,
7880000	7884000	and you're going to take the role of a rookie mech pilot
7884000	7887000	who finds themselves in the midst of the war between factions.
7887000	7891000	And they said there's some gameplay footage that they showed off,
7891000	7895000	and also there's going to be a single-player campaign.
7895000	7898000	And that's supposed to come out on PC in 2018.
7898000	7901000	Are you going to get it because you like mech games?
7901000	7904000	You know, I haven't played a MechWarrior game in a long time,
7904000	7908000	but I would be down for a new MechWarrior game with VR support.
7908000	7911000	That would be pretty fucking awesome, to be honest.
7911000	7913000	Yeah, a VR mech game would be a lot of fun.
7913000	7919000	It would be bringing back to the virtual world stuff.
7919000	7920000	Heck yeah.
7920000	7924000	All right, let's talk about some backwards compatibility on Xbox One.
7924000	7929000	There was a brand new game that came out that's a pretty big deal on Xbox One
7929000	7931000	for the Xbox 360 backwards compatibility,
7931000	7933000	and that is Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
7933000	7937000	Speaking of launch titles, or at least I think Oblivion was more launch window.
7937000	7940000	I think it originally was supposed to come out that day,
7940000	7942000	but it came out a few months later.
7942000	7946000	Oblivion did, but obviously that is an Xbox 360 game a lot of people checked out
7946000	7949000	because the PlayStation 3 version had problems when it first came out especially,
7949000	7951000	and that had even come out later.
7951000	7955000	PlayStation 3, Sony botched a lot in the early days of that
7955000	7957000	that they had to fix later on.
7957000	7960000	So a lot of people really associate the Elder Scrolls Oblivion,
7960000	7962000	if not PC, on Xbox 360.
7962000	7964000	That's really cool that that is now backwards compatible.
7964000	7968000	I'm sure it also helps in free promo for Skyrim Remastered, if nothing else.
7968000	7972000	Not the only game to hit backwards compatibility this week, however.
7972000	7977000	Medal of Honor Airborne, Trine 2, and Astro Pop, the PopCap game,
7977000	7980000	also now available on Xbox One.
7980000	7982000	Guess which one of those I actually own?
7982000	7983000	Astro Pop.
7983000	7986000	So I guess I do have Elder Scrolls as well, though.
7986000	7990000	I thought that game was phenomenal on the 360.
7990000	7994000	The next games for PlayStation Plus have been announced.
7994000	7998000	So December's PlayStation Plus titles, which will go live on December 6th.
7998000	8001000	It's a little bit later. It didn't go live this week,
8001000	8003000	but they're going to be going live a little later.
8003000	8008000	For the PlayStation 4, Invisible Inc. Not I-N-K, but Incorporated.
8008000	8011000	Invisible Incorporated is going to be free for PlayStation Plus users,
8011000	8013000	as well as Stories, Path of Destinies.
8013000	8017000	On the PlayStation 3 there is Hyper Void, which by the way is also a PlayStation 4 title.
8017000	8019000	And also PlayStation VR.
8019000	8023000	Tiny Troopers Joint Ops, also a PlayStation 4 title.
8023000	8028000	And then on the PlayStation Vita, Color Guardians, also a PlayStation 4 title.
8028000	8033000	So there's a lot of smaller, but still games that you're going to be able to pick up on PlayStation 4,
8033000	8036000	because when you cross by them on the PlayStation 3 and the 2...
8036000	8042000	Yeah, I have to remember, apparently I had not downloaded or marked all the games for November,
8042000	8044000	so I went and grabbed the rest of them.
8044000	8046000	Like, oh, hey, there's some other games I missed.
8046000	8049000	Yeah, everybody's gone to the Rapture. If you still haven't played that, make sure you mark that.
8049000	8051000	That was, I think, October.
8051000	8053000	No, it's still up. I think it's still up for this week.
8053000	8055000	Well, I must have already gotten that then.
8055000	8058000	Like, there was BMX something, and then, oh, there's another game.
8058000	8062000	And then if you haven't played this yet on the Vita, VVVVVV, which, you know, that's been out a million times.
8062000	8064000	Why isn't it on PlayStation 4?
8064000	8065000	It is.
8065000	8067000	Why isn't that free?
8067000	8073000	That's a good question. That one was not marked as cross by, but I'm almost positive VVVV is on PlayStation 4,
8073000	8075000	because I think I bought it.
8075000	8080000	Yeah, so, because I have that, you know, you guys all tease me about the Mass Effect 3 thing,
8080000	8085000	but I'm pretty sure I have VVVV on PC, 3DS, and PlayStation 4.
8085000	8090000	So, yeah, that is interesting that maybe, maybe they all are. I don't know.
8090000	8093000	But for some reason, they don't have it marked as such.
8093000	8097000	All right, so let's now get into the mailbag.
8097000	8100000	Every week, you guys email us. Oh, I'm sorry, we're not going to do that.
8100000	8103000	I almost forgot to talk about what's in stores this week.
8103000	8104000	What is in stores this week?
8104000	8106000	Lots of important things, actually.
8106000	8110000	So, this week, we've got a lot of Oculus Rift games coming out.
8110000	8115000	So, actually, it started off Arizona Sunshine on HTC Vive and the Rift.
8115000	8118000	Carnival Games VR coming to the Rift.
8118000	8123000	Dead and Buried, Dead Hungry, those are also both for the Rift.
8123000	8128000	Dead Rising 4 coming out on PC and Xbox One.
8129000	8131000	Dexed on Oculus Rift.
8131000	8135000	Enigma Sphere, Fantastic Contraption, Final Approach.
8135000	8138000	Hollow Ball, those are all on the Rift.
8138000	8142000	I Expect You to Die on the Rift and PlayStation VR.
8142000	8144000	Oculus First Contact, also on the Rift.
8144000	8147000	Pure Head Arcade.
8147000	8150000	Quar Battle for Gate 18.
8150000	8152000	Rip Coil, also all on the Rift.
8153000	8158000	Shadow Tactics, Blades of the Shogun on PC, Mac, and Linux.
8158000	8161000	Sports Bar VR on the Rift.
8161000	8164000	The Climb, also Rift.
8164000	8167000	A little PlayStation 4 game by the name of The Last Guardian,
8167000	8169000	I'm sure that no one is looking forward to.
8169000	8170000	That comes out this week.
8170000	8174000	Well, yeah, just that little dump it at the end of the year title.
8174000	8175000	Exactly.
8175000	8179000	The Unspoken on the Rift, VR Sports Challenge, also Rift.
8180000	8183000	And then Werewolves Within on pretty much all VR platforms,
8183000	8186000	HTC Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR.
8186000	8189000	And then we've got a little later in the week,
8189000	8192000	Apollo Justice, Ace Attorney on Android.
8192000	8197000	Nitro Plus Blasters, Heroines Infinite Duel on PC.
8197000	8201000	Yakuza 6 on PlayStation 4.
8201000	8205000	And let's see, what else?
8205000	8208000	Space Hulk Deathwing, that's on PC.
8210000	8217000	Star League Girls Episodes, Starcia on iOS and Android.
8217000	8219000	And that's it.
8219000	8220000	Bobby and Chad is talking about,
8220000	8222000	he's going to have a big show next week with all this VR stuff.
8222000	8223000	Yeah, there's lots of cool stuff,
8223000	8226000	and a lot of stuff that was on PlayStation VR,
8226000	8231000	so I know that apparently the Sports Bar VR
8231000	8232000	is supposed to be pretty good.
8232000	8234000	I'm actually waiting to get that, maybe.
8234000	8236000	Well, let's look at the Japanese releases.
8236000	8237000	The last couple of weeks were kind of slow,
8237000	8238000	but it's picking up again in Japan.
8238000	8240000	There's a very big game out this week in Japan
8240000	8241000	on the PlayStation 4.
8241000	8243000	In fact, this is a game so big
8243000	8246000	that it actually has a special 500 gig system bundle,
8246000	8249000	also a terabyte system bundle.
8249000	8253000	Yeah, all the kind of big stuff for this game.
8253000	8256000	It's Ryu Ga Gotoku 6.
8256000	8258000	Do you know what that is? Ryu Ga Gotoku?
8258000	8260000	Yep, that's Yakuza.
8260000	8261000	It's Yakuza.
8261000	8264000	So Yakuza 6 is making its way to Japan this week,
8264000	8266000	and that is the big release on the PlayStation 4.
8266000	8268000	But there are some other games as well.
8268000	8272000	We also have Touhou Shin Pieroku Urban Legend in Limbo
8272000	8273000	is out this week,
8273000	8277000	and Dishonored 2 gets its Japanese release this week as well,
8277000	8280000	so a pretty busy week there in Japan with that being it.
8280000	8281000	So it's like we're getting The Last Guardian.
8281000	8282000	They're getting Yakuza 6.
8282000	8283000	Pretty big deal.
8283000	8284000	I imagine they've got to be getting
8284000	8287000	The Last Guardian there as well, though, in Japan.
8287000	8289000	Yes, they are also getting it the same day we are,
8289000	8293000	so it's kind of like a worldwide release, if you will.
8293000	8295000	Looking at the 3DS,
8295000	8297000	the 3DS has some Monster Hunter amiibos
8297000	8300000	that are coming out this week, so keep an eye out for that.
8300000	8303000	Miitopia is a game that's coming out on the 3DS in Japan.
8303000	8306000	I'm not familiar with this title,
8306000	8308000	but I feel like this is something you would think
8308000	8309000	would have been released over here,
8309000	8311000	but Miitopia does look like, yes,
8311000	8314000	it's a game that involves the Miis,
8314000	8316000	and I'm trying to see if it bears a resemblance to, like,
8316000	8318000	is it Tomodachi Life or something like that,
8318000	8322000	but no, it looks like you have the little Mii characters
8322000	8323000	living in an apartment complex,
8323000	8324000	but it's not like Tomodachi Life
8324000	8329000	because then you have this little battle mode and stuff too,
8329000	8332000	so it looks like it might be a collection of minigames involving Miis.
8332000	8335000	Jamie would be very happy to hear that Puyo Puyo Chronicle
8335000	8338000	is coming out in Japan this week as well,
8338000	8340000	and that is on the 3DS.
8340000	8342000	There's also a special Nintendo 2DS
8342000	8344000	to celebrate Pokémon Sun and Moon
8344000	8347000	is coming out in Japan this week.
8347000	8349000	Lastly, checking the Vita
8349000	8352000	because the Vita is still seeing a stream of releases in Japan.
8352000	8354000	No Yakuza 6 on the Vita,
8354000	8361000	but Momo Touji Taisen Ryoku 3 is out on the Vita this week in Japan.
8361000	8363000	It's a busy week. How about the UK, Loki?
8363000	8366000	The only thing I've listed right now is The Last Guardian.
8366000	8368000	Well, it's a pretty big release, so...
8368000	8369000	Yeah.
8369000	8372000	All right, now we're going to get to the mailbag.
8372000	8383000	Every week you guys e-mail us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com,
8383000	8388000	and we try to find some of our favorite messages to read here on the show,
8388000	8389000	so let's get to it.
8389000	8392000	Our first e-mail this week, I believe, comes from a new e-mailer.
8392000	8395000	That's always exciting to hear from new people, so hello.
8395000	8398000	This is from Lorcan, sends us this e-mail,
8398000	8400000	so a big hello to this first-time e-mailer,
8400000	8401000	who says,
8401000	8402000	Hello, O-L-R.
8402000	8407000	In the last episode, you briefly mentioned enderall the shards of order,
8407000	8410000	which in German is die...
8410000	8412000	I'm going to totally mispronounce this.
8412000	8413000	The e-mailer apologizes.
8413000	8415000	Sorry if my English is not perfect.
8415000	8416000	Well, guess what?
8416000	8419000	My German is atrocious, so what?
8419000	8421000	Die trumer der ordnung.
8421000	8423000	I don't know if that's even right,
8423000	8425000	but anyway, that's what they call it over there.
8425000	8428000	I got the impression that you may not be completely aware of this gem.
8428000	8430000	That's why I wanted to highly recommend it to you.
8430000	8432000	If my impression was wrong, this mail is probably obsolete.
8432000	8433000	No, you're right.
8433000	8436000	This came up last week in the fan game stuff.
8436000	8437000	Yes, I have no idea what it is.
8437000	8440000	They didn't even end up giving that away at the award show.
8440000	8441000	That award, by the way.
8441000	8442000	Did you know that?
8442000	8443000	No, I noticed.
8443000	8446000	So anyway, Lorcan continues and says,
8446000	8449000	Enderall is a so-called total conversion of Skyrim.
8449000	8453000	It's an independent and free game that only requires the Steam version of Skyrim without DLCs.
8453000	8457000	It comes with its own soundtrack and professional voice acting.
8457000	8459000	According to the website, in German and English.
8459000	8461000	I've only played the German version so far.
8461000	8465000	It's basically like Skyrim, just better in my opinion.
8465000	8468000	The atmosphere of the whole world is much denser with more details.
8468000	8472000	If you like exploring, there's an enormous amount of things to find on and off the road.
8472000	8474000	The skill system differs from Skyrim,
8474000	8477000	and the story and quests seem more interesting as well.
8477000	8479000	I haven't finished the game yet.
8479000	8483000	So if you like Skyrim, you may want to give it a try instead of playing the special edition.
8483000	8485000	Greetings from Deutschland, Lorcan.
8485000	8487000	Sorry if my English is not perfect.
8487000	8489000	No, you did a fantastic job, and thank you.
8489000	8493000	I love it when emailers will email us and tell us their side of the story on a gig.
8493000	8496000	Because again, we all have day jobs and lives and things like that.
8496000	8499000	We cannot play every single stinking video game that's released.
8499000	8502000	If I was getting paid a salary to do this show, maybe we could do that.
8502000	8504000	But we don't, so it is what it is.
8504000	8507000	So we love when fans give us their opinion on things.
8507000	8509000	I would have loved to get Alan's opinion.
8509000	8513000	Alan had to step out and run an errand, so he can't really tell his side.
8513000	8516000	But I will tell him to check it out, because he does like mods.
8516000	8521000	So the fact that you have this as a complete redo of Skyrim from the ground up with different stories,
8521000	8523000	that sounds pretty awesome.
8523000	8526000	Weird that we will never find out who won that award, though.
8526000	8528000	This is very, very weird.
8528000	8530000	Reginator emails us, saying,
8530000	8534000	Hello, OLR. It's your favorite friendly neighborhood gaming deals expert, Reginator.
8534000	8537000	I thought that I'd write in to mention that GOG is currently having their winter sale.
8537000	8540000	It's been going on for four days as of now today, Sunday the 4th.
8540000	8544000	While not everything is on sale, a good many games are, including some true classics.
8544000	8549000	Now the nice thing is, during the sale, you can earn XP by performing certain tasks or buying certain stuff.
8549000	8554000	As soon as you meet certain XP thresholds, you can claim up to three specific games for free.
8554000	8558000	Lastly, although it's too late to do anything about it if you hadn't done so already,
8558000	8564000	for the first 48 hours of the sale, you could have claimed an old D&D game, Temple of Elemental Evil.
8564000	8569000	Yeah, I went to go get Neverwinter Nights, and then realized it was only free for 48 hours.
8569000	8571000	Whoops on me.
8571000	8575000	So, yes, I was aware of this, and I was disappointed that I missed out on the free game,
8575000	8578000	but that's on me. I should have got it when I had the chance.
8578000	8580000	I think it's only like four bucks otherwise.
8580000	8583000	And then finally, I do have a game recommendation for you.
8583000	8588000	If you like games Portal 1 and 2, then you'll love Maize, M-A-I-Z-E.
8588000	8593000	The game will have you laughing so hard that you'll end up either pissing or shitting yourself.
8593000	8596000	Did that happen to you, Reginator?
8596000	8599000	If you really want to tell us all here at OLR that that's what happened to you, it's a little embarrassing.
8599000	8601000	Keep that to yourself.
8601000	8605000	I'll just say that the game is, wait for it, amazing.
8605000	8607000	Yeah, yeah, I know, the pun was corny. It was pretty bad.
8607000	8613000	But I do like recommendations, especially for games that are like Portal.
8613000	8617000	And Portal's a funny game, and so I'm all for this Maize a funny game too.
8617000	8623000	This email was brought to you by the next Classic Game of the Week, Halo. No.
8623000	8630000	And if you also like Portal, you should try Portal Stories, Mel, which is also a free expansion thing that they have.
8630000	8632000	Yeah, that's like a fan thing that they did on Steam or something, right?
8632000	8637000	Yeah, it is. And then they also have one that's without the portal guns, it's with just the...
8637000	8642000	They're the paint guns, I guess, that do the...
8642000	8652000	It's with the bouncy one and the acceleration gels, the gel guns, so that's pretty cool too.
8653000	8658000	Our next email here is from, I think, another new emailer, Jose, who emails us and says,
8658000	8661000	Dear OLR crew, I would like to say that I'm a huge fan of your show.
8661000	8666000	I want to know if you ever had a game that made you so angry you couldn't stand to finish it.
8666000	8670000	For me, it would be Spider-Man 3 on the Xbox 360.
8670000	8673000	Loki, a game that made you so angry you couldn't finish it.
8673000	8677000	I know there has been, I just can't think of what it is off the top of my head.
8677000	8684000	I certainly get frustrated with games.
8684000	8688000	Like, you kind of hit a wall in a game and you feel like you're never going to get past that point,
8688000	8690000	and so you're kind of like not able to beat it.
8690000	8693000	God, I feel like this happens with a lot of different games.
8693000	8698000	I know what, for me, my copy of God of War, when I had the original God of War,
8698000	8705000	like at the very end boss, got all jacked up and it wouldn't work right and it couldn't kill the end boss.
8705000	8709000	And I remember that was frustrating, so I didn't ever finish that game.
8709000	8712000	But that's the only thing I can think of.
8712000	8717000	I know there's been others that have been like that, but I can't remember what they are off the top of my head.
8717000	8718000	Here's some comments in our chat on that.
8718000	8720000	Act F says, Space Giraffe.
8720000	8725000	Akuma JP says, Mega Man or Final Fantasy XIII.
8725000	8729000	And then some folks chiming in about that rock cyclops in Mega Man.
8729000	8731000	That's what Dungeon Buster is saying.
8731000	8733000	Dark Tetsuya says, Dragon Quest Swords.
8733000	8738000	I was probably near the end, but I was fighting this super tough knight enemy.
8738000	8740000	I'd already expended all my healing items.
8740000	8744000	I finally kill it and a second one drops down in its place.
8744000	8749000	Oh, for me, that would be Pokemon Sun and Moon because one too many SOS battles killed it for me.
8749000	8751000	I just want to be a little shy. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
8751000	8756000	Actually, Shane gave me a copy of all the starter Pokemon.
8756000	8759000	I say a copy because he bred them and all that stuff.
8759000	8762000	So I have a team now that's every starter Pokemon in a Mimikyu.
8762000	8767000	The door is wide open for me to just play through the damn game.
8767000	8769000	I don't even have to catch any freaking Pokemon.
8769000	8770000	I can just take these all the way to the end.
8770000	8772000	So hopefully that will happen in the next few weeks.
8772000	8773000	We'll see.
8773000	8775000	Anyway, continuing on with the email.
8775000	8777000	Also, I want to know if you guys like anime.
8777000	8778000	What's your favorite and least favorite?
8778000	8785000	I was going to say also, Final Fantasy XIII on some of those, what were they called?
8785000	8787000	I always want to call them summons.
8787000	8789000	You know, summons, whatever they call them.
8789000	8795000	Whatever their word for summons in that game was, you know, where you had to fight those to get them.
8795000	8796000	Eidolons.
8796000	8797000	Eidolons.
8797000	8798000	Yeah, some of those fights were really hard.
8798000	8799000	Okay.
8799000	8800000	Yeah.
8800000	8802000	Why the fuck do we got to change what they call that shit?
8802000	8803000	I know.
8803000	8804000	Game, the game, the game.
8804000	8806000	It's like fucking Final Fantasy XIV.
8806000	8807000	That's why some people-
8807000	8810000	It's like, dude, they're the same fucking classes that were in XI.
8810000	8813000	Why the fuck did they change the names on all of them?
8813000	8814000	That's why some people took issue.
8814000	8815000	They're just the fucking same.
8815000	8816000	That's why some people took issue.
8816000	8817000	All right.
8817000	8818000	Anime.
8818000	8819000	Anime.
8819000	8820000	What's your favorite and least favorite, Loki?
8820000	8822000	I don't watch a lot of it, but I like Miyazaki movies.
8822000	8824000	That's my serious answer.
8824000	8825000	Yeah, they're good.
8825000	8826000	They're good.
8826000	8827000	I don't watch a lot of it.
8827000	8829000	I mean, recently I haven't watched a whole ton.
8829000	8833000	I do like the CG remake of Captain Harlock.
8833000	8837000	I thought that was pretty badass.
8837000	8839000	I've seen pieces here and there.
8839000	8841000	I've gone to enough conventions where they show it.
8841000	8849000	My last anime that I watched, the anime series that I watched was Attack on Titan.
8849000	8850000	I really liked that.
8850000	8853000	But I don't really watch a whole lot of series.
8853000	8854000	I mean, there's not a whole lot.
8854000	8857000	I used to just kind of get into the really short series.
8857000	8859000	Trigun was before that.
8859000	8862000	I think it was probably the last one I liked a lot.
8862000	8867000	And before that, even just a lot of- Neon Genesis was all right.
8867000	8870000	But it's been remade several times now.
8870000	8871000	I don't even know.
8871000	8877000	I'm talking about the original series, so I have no idea what it even looks like now.
8877000	8881000	That's too damn hard to follow anyways.
8881000	8882000	What else did I like?
8882000	8886000	I used to like Golden Boy, which was a pretty pornographic one.
8886000	8889000	But it wasn't too pornographic.
8889000	8891000	It'd be like a rated R.
8891000	8893000	It's not straight up porn.
8894000	8899000	It's this perverted guy, and it was a hilarious six episode series.
8899000	8901000	But I liked that a lot, and I still like that.
8901000	8903000	I think that's a hilarious series.
8903000	8907000	Project Aco, going way old school, I used to love-
8907000	8911000	That was such a weird series with the women that looked like men.
8911000	8916000	Just the whole, I don't know, world for that was pretty funny.
8916000	8920000	Yeah, and I used to watch the Pokemon anime back in the day.
8920000	8922000	I need to watch the new ones.
8922000	8924000	I don't think the Pokemon anime is that great.
8924000	8926000	The early ones were so cheesy.
8926000	8929000	I mean, it has a lot of character, but it also has a lot of,
8929000	8933000	oh, we're going to this random filler town of the week, and we're not advancing the plot any.
8933000	8935000	Anyway, there's going to be judgy people out there.
8935000	8938000	Yeah, and of course, if we're talking standalone movies,
8938000	8941000	Ghost in the Shell, Akira, I mean-
8941000	8942000	Urosu Toji?
8944000	8945000	No.
8945000	8948000	Oh, can I say the Tron anime?
8948000	8949000	No, seriously.
8949000	8952000	That was pretty awesome, and I never finished watching.
8952000	8955000	I saw two episodes of that, and it was just-
8955000	8957000	I have another answer. Daft Punk music videos.
8957000	8961000	Okay, you mean like the Interstellar 555 movie?
8961000	8962000	Yeah.
8962000	8963000	The whole album?
8963000	8964000	Is that a legit answer?
8964000	8967000	Yeah, well, Interstellar 555 is basically all those together in one movie.
8967000	8969000	Yeah, I mean, it's short on plot, but-
8969000	8971000	Isn't a lot of anime.
8971000	8973000	Well, depends.
8973000	8975000	I think as far as recent anime goes,
8975000	8978000	Moatopenguindrum was amazing, and I liked that one a lot.
8978000	8982000	Stuff I watched when I was a kid, Digimon Adventure,
8982000	8986000	and, I don't know, Azumanga Daya was kind of old, but I loved that a lot.
8986000	8989000	All right, let's get to-
8989000	8992000	I think I have one more email I want to make sure I get to here,
8992000	8995000	except I accidentally closed the screen, so I got to bring it back up.
8995000	8997000	But again, if you want to email us and participate with the show,
8997000	9000000	it's participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
9000000	9003000	Here it is. The email's from Rob-ba-ba-ba-ba.
9003000	9006000	That's the Rob with two Bs. Not to be confused with this Rob.
9006000	9008000	Rob-ba-ba-ba says,
9008000	9012000	I was happy to hear you report Lego City Undercover was coming to other consoles.
9012000	9015000	I called the Wii version best game of the year.
9015000	9017000	I think he meant Wii U.
9017000	9019000	Or did it come out on the Wii at the same time? Maybe it did.
9019000	9021000	No, it was only Wii U.
9021000	9024000	Okay, thank you. I think the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One may be superior,
9024000	9026000	because the load times were horrible on the Wii U.
9026000	9030000	About 90 seconds each time you do a story, go inside police headquarters, etc.
9030000	9033000	The Wii U had the advantage of the touch screen being a map, though.
9033000	9038000	I found the game extremely funny, and it proved that GTA-type games can be family-friendly.
9038000	9040000	I just hope it isn't $60.
9040000	9044000	I completed it 100% on a system with no achievements.
9044000	9048000	I'm telling you, there's a lot of money that I would pay for a Lego Grand Theft Auto game.
9048000	9050000	You know, let's hit it all.
9050000	9052000	Here it is.
9052000	9054000	I understand that, but Lego City Undercover was different,
9054000	9056000	and they honestly need more in that series.
9056000	9058000	I think it would be pretty awesome.
9059000	9063000	Just dumb it down. Don't make it so violent.
9063000	9066000	I would totally play the crap out of that.
9066000	9068000	Participate at orangelaundry.com
9068000	9071000	if you would like to email us in the future week for Dark Soccer to read on air.
9071000	9073000	We'll pick our favorites.
9073000	9075000	Sometimes we do have to edit them for content and time a little bit,
9075000	9078000	but we will always read your emails.
9078000	9081000	Unless we get inundated one week.
9081000	9083000	Then we're going to spread around the love.
9083000	9085000	Raginator, we love you, but when you email us every week,
9085000	9087000	we'll let someone else have a chance.
9087000	9090000	Participate at orangelaundry.com.
9090000	9092000	Let's get to some other news. Loki.
9092000	9095000	Speaking of a game that's also in the Lego franchise,
9095000	9100000	I haven't played this in a while because I bought it on early access on Steam a long time ago.
9100000	9103000	It wasn't really fun then because of the early state that it was,
9103000	9105000	but it's come a long way since then.
9105000	9107000	Now it's leaving early access,
9107000	9109000	and that game would be Lego Worlds.
9109000	9112000	It was kind of that cross between Lego and Minecraft
9112000	9115000	where basically you're just building whatever the fuck you want,
9115000	9119000	and you can dig and gather resources and stuff like that and get designs.
9119000	9123000	And apparently I guess it was in early access for 18 months.
9123000	9125000	Man, that's been a while.
9125000	9127000	But now it's going to be coming to consoles.
9127000	9131000	So that's going to be coming to consoles on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in February.
9131000	9134000	So you can go check that out.
9134000	9137000	It looks interesting.
9137000	9140000	I may have to go try it again on PC again because I do have it on PC,
9140000	9142000	but like I said, back when I played it originally,
9142000	9144000	there was no point to the game.
9144000	9147000	The building didn't seem that easy,
9147000	9151000	and just kind of the exploration was kind of lame.
9151000	9152000	I don't know.
9152000	9154000	But it could be good.
9154000	9158000	So I'll have to check it out again.
9158000	9161000	Alright, so this is different though from the Lego...
9161000	9163000	I mean, this is that Minecraft-y Lego game, right?
9163000	9167000	Yeah, it's like the open world Minecraft-y game that you can kind of build whatever.
9167000	9169000	So I'll have to check it out.
9169000	9171000	Did you actually play it on PC?
9171000	9172000	I did a little bit,
9172000	9175000	but it was only, you know, it was early access,
9175000	9178000	so it was really glitchy and just kind of, I don't know,
9178000	9180000	there was no point to it.
9180000	9181000	Okay.
9181000	9184000	Well, maybe they'll put a point in the console releases.
9184000	9185000	That would be something, wouldn't it?
9185000	9188000	Minecraft kind of got a point when it came out to consoles,
9188000	9189000	so that was nice.
9189000	9192000	Alright, this is interesting.
9192000	9198000	You guys know I'm not a fan of Facebook these days.
9198000	9200000	Tangent time.
9200000	9204000	I've been needled a little bit on why did the show lose the Facebook question of the week.
9204000	9210000	And admittedly, part of that is my own frustration with social media in general.
9210000	9213000	Part of that, you could say, is maybe the election stuff
9213000	9216000	and the whole fake news and all that stuff that kind of goes on around there.
9216000	9218000	But this was something that I think even existed before that,
9218000	9221000	is that like, you know, the whole, I just...
9221000	9224000	The social media has taken over too much, and especially Facebook in a way.
9224000	9228000	Like, I'm just, I'm really getting sick and fucking tired
9228000	9231000	of how Facebook will just do what they want to do
9231000	9233000	because they think they know what you want.
9233000	9234000	Right?
9234000	9236000	Facebook reorders your timeline.
9236000	9240000	Facebook shows you that friends are live when you don't really give a shit.
9240000	9241000	Yeah, it's so hard.
9241000	9243000	Like, I loved back in the day when everything was in order.
9243000	9245000	You know, granted, I know there's plug-ins that do that,
9245000	9247000	but like now it's so hard.
9247000	9254000	Like, even like you couldn't say you can view someone's, you know, story or post or whatever,
9254000	9257000	and you go and look at something else and you come back and you can't find it again
9257000	9262000	unless you go to their page because it's just been reordered the shit.
9262000	9266000	So, you know, I just, I feel like on that type of personal level,
9266000	9270000	like, I don't necessarily want to keep supporting Facebook more and more
9270000	9275000	because I feel like Facebook is something a lot of us should be cutting back on,
9275000	9276000	myself included.
9276000	9281000	You know, Facebook is just too much right now.
9281000	9283000	And I think that's kind of like where my head is at,
9283000	9287000	is that like I don't necessarily need Facebook to be like a central part of the show,
9287000	9290000	but at the same time, I don't want you guys to hear that as, you know,
9290000	9293000	I don't have a lot of love for the community and you guys that are out there
9293000	9295000	and wanting to get more voices on the show.
9295000	9298000	I do realize that Facebook is so integrated into our lives and all that stuff
9298000	9302000	and that I'm almost committing suicide for the ratings of this program
9302000	9304000	by not being more active on Facebook.
9304000	9308000	And I'm really, you know, robbing the show of more potential listeners and all that stuff.
9308000	9312000	But that's just where I'm at personally is that I'm kind of willing to give that up
9312000	9317000	because I believe that strongly that we need to cut back on the amount of Facebook in our lives
9317000	9320000	and not necessarily increase it, like it's just too much.
9320000	9324000	I realize it's a little tangeny, maybe a little political,
9324000	9326000	which you guys don't always like it when we go there,
9326000	9328000	but that's just my honest to God answer.
9328000	9330000	So, I hope you guys don't take it personally.
9330000	9335000	If there's other ideas you guys have, I'm all ears.
9335000	9338000	Google Plus, though, even that's, I mean, you guys might think that,
9338000	9340000	even Google Plus is starting to be like,
9340000	9343000	well, since we didn't work as a social network, we want to be more,
9343000	9346000	I feel like they're going for more like a Pinterest angle or something,
9346000	9348000	where it's about communities and groups.
9348000	9351000	Google Plus is failing to tell me what the hell they are right now,
9351000	9354000	and that's why I'm struggling with Google Plus even.
9354000	9355000	So, JD?
9355000	9357000	You could always just post the question on Twitter.
9357000	9358000	That's true.
9358000	9361000	Because Twitter, at least, I mean, it has its issues, but it's not the worst.
9361000	9364000	Twitter does have its issues, but Twitter is extremely filterable,
9364000	9367000	and the fact that Twitter limits you to 140 characters is a lot.
9367000	9370000	But Twitter has its own drawbacks as well.
9370000	9371000	Sure.
9371000	9374000	Some folks in chat say more VoG, less Facebook.
9374000	9377000	As Joan Hunter-Matt says, use the VoG forums instead of Facebook.
9377000	9380000	I feel like Facebook killed internet forums, so many of them.
9380000	9383000	I mean, yes, I know NeoGaf is still a thing, and there's others as well,
9383000	9385000	but, like, it's rough. It's rough.
9385000	9387000	And Facebook is a poor replacement.
9387000	9390000	It does not work well as a message board because of all the algorithmic,
9390000	9392000	you know, stuff like that.
9392000	9394000	Like, I mean, Reddit is better for message boarding.
9394000	9395000	And maybe that's the thing.
9395000	9398000	I've actually had somebody suggest you should do an OLR Reddit.
9398000	9403000	Maybe. Again, Reddit has its own issues too,
9403000	9405000	but I'm a little more open to that right now.
9405000	9408000	I feel like Reddit has a lot of good cross-promotion opportunities.
9408000	9409000	Yeah, that's true.
9409000	9411000	So anyway, that's where I'm at, so I apologize.
9411000	9414000	I just wanted to respond to that because people have been calling us out on it.
9414000	9415000	Like, why did we kind of?
9415000	9419000	And, you know, after the hiatus, I thought we could incorporate it back into the show,
9419000	9422000	but I felt like it was like we were doing more Facebook instead of less.
9422000	9425000	And it was like that promotional side of me was starting to take over,
9425000	9426000	and I was like, you know what?
9426000	9429000	I want to do this for the right reasons.
9431000	9435000	But speaking of which, this is about Facebook.
9435000	9438000	And as exciting as something like this sounds,
9438000	9441000	there's a part of me that winces because Facebook owns it.
9441000	9443000	And this is Facebook gaming.
9443000	9447000	So this is separate from the games that cluttered your feed at one time
9447000	9449000	before Facebook banished them to their own feed.
9450000	9454000	And even the separate, like they have a store type of thing, like Steam,
9454000	9456000	like a Facebook client, Facebook universe or something they call it.
9456000	9457000	And their own platform.
9457000	9458000	But this is separate from all that.
9458000	9462000	Now they're going to shove games into Messenger, or they have.
9462000	9465000	They say it's in closed beta, but it showed up on mine.
9465000	9468000	And so in a message with Alan, you hit the little controller,
9468000	9471000	and now you can challenge Alan to play a game of Pac-Man.
9471000	9473000	And it's a little HTML5 Pac-Man.
9473000	9478000	It's just one stage, one life, and it's who can get the highest score.
9478000	9479000	They're like little micro games.
9479000	9481000	Yeah, my wife did this with like, they had like,
9481000	9484000	if you do some of the emojis for like basketball sports games,
9484000	9486000	like there's little mini games associated with that.
9488000	9490000	Is this going to be Farmville all over again?
9490000	9491000	Perhaps.
9491000	9492000	Because I got tired of invites real quick.
9492000	9493000	I don't know.
9493000	9498000	Space Invaders, Words with Friends, also involved in like micro versions
9498000	9500000	available on.
9500000	9503000	Yeah, you send this through Messenger, Jimmy.
9503000	9504000	I'll have some Words with Friends.
9505000	9508000	I spammed one of my groups today just because I wanted to test it,
9508000	9510000	and I don't think anybody else tried it.
9510000	9514000	It was just me and some of my friends from like Chicago and other places.
9514000	9515000	I don't think anybody else touched it.
9515000	9518000	But I did play the Pac-Man, and it was a competent conversion,
9518000	9521000	and there's a lot I like about the idea.
9521000	9525000	I just, it's on Facebook, and therefore I'm already kind of like,
9525000	9528000	does Facebook need to have more?
9528000	9529000	I don't know about that.
9529000	9531000	So anyway, there you go.
9531000	9534000	So Facebook is launching the gaming thing,
9534000	9538000	but it is a little bit more micro, in tune to play a messaging.
9538000	9542000	I guess to play while you wait for somebody to respond,
9542000	9544000	and you will know when they've read the email,
9544000	9546000	because Facebook will tell you that,
9546000	9548000	and it does not allow you to turn that setting on or off.
9548000	9551000	Just like Facebook won't allow me to get rid of,
9551000	9553000	apparently I have an Instagram account.
9553000	9556000	I have never set up an Instagram account.
9556000	9557000	I have an Instagram account,
9557000	9560000	and I get fucking notifications on it constantly,
9560000	9562000	and it fucking pisses me off.
9562000	9565000	So anyway, let's move on.
9565000	9568000	I could talk about my grievances with that for a long time,
9568000	9569000	but we're going to move on for now.
9569000	9571000	All right, so this is kind of cool.
9571000	9575000	Ubisoft, you know, they're putting out some VR games,
9575000	9577000	and one of the things that's kind of neat about this is
9577000	9579000	that they're going to be going cross-platform
9579000	9581000	for their multiplayer on those.
9581000	9583000	So for Eagle Flight, Werewolves Within,
9583000	9585000	and Star Trek Bridge Commander,
9585000	9587000	players will be able to play against each other
9587000	9591000	across PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive,
9591000	9595000	and apparently the first game to have that available is,
9595000	9597000	well, I guess the only one that's out right now,
9597000	9599000	Eagle Flight, so that's coming,
9599000	9604000	and then Werewolves Within looks like December 6th,
9604000	9607000	and Star Trek Bridge Crew is on March 14th.
9607000	9610000	But see, I always thought that would be kind of difficult
9610000	9612000	with all these different platforms that are out there.
9612000	9614000	You know, how are we going to have some sort of synergy
9614000	9616000	with being able to play with each other,
9616000	9618000	and now this is kind of neat that they're doing this.
9618000	9619000	I don't know how that's going to work
9619000	9621000	with all the different control schemes and everything,
9621000	9623000	if that's going to play into it quite a bit,
9623000	9626000	but it's nice to see that at least this is playing nice
9626000	9628000	with the other platforms.
9628000	9631000	Nintendo Switch, a lot of you want more information
9631000	9633000	on the Nintendo Switch, and you're going to get
9633000	9636000	the information on the Nintendo Switch in early January,
9636000	9637000	January 12th.
9637000	9639000	That date is coming sooner than we think.
9639000	9641000	I mean, that's only about a month away now.
9641000	9643000	So finally, finally we know what Nintendo's future
9643000	9645000	will be looking like a little better.
9645000	9648000	Not only will we be getting the announcements on January 12th,
9648000	9650000	there is going to be an event in New York.
9650000	9653000	It is private, so I imagine this is a press-only event,
9653000	9655000	but it will be happening on January 13th,
9655000	9656000	the very next day.
9656000	9659000	It is a five-hour event that will further emphasize
9659000	9662000	on some of the details that Nintendo plans to announce.
9662000	9666000	This is my perception, is that this is the press
9666000	9668000	to get their opportunity to play the Switch,
9668000	9671000	to write all about it, because this is around the time
9671000	9673000	pre-orders will be going live.
9673000	9675000	I can't stress this enough.
9675000	9678000	If you think you want a Nintendo Switch,
9678000	9680000	you need to be prepared to pull the trigger
9680000	9683000	on a pre-order on January 12th,
9683000	9688000	because that is likely when it will be going live everywhere.
9688000	9691000	And you guys know how Nintendo is with hardwares.
9691000	9693000	Incompetent.
9693000	9696000	So I would highly suggest, if you want a Switch,
9696000	9698000	get in on that on January 12th.
9698000	9701000	So if you don't have money and you need to put down 50 bucks
9701000	9704000	at GameStop or whatever, either A, find a place
9704000	9706000	that doesn't ask for money upfront,
9706000	9709000	because Amazon doesn't, pretty much any other place doesn't.
9709000	9712000	Maybe Target wants like a dollar, right?
9712000	9714000	Did they do systems at Target, though?
9714000	9716000	They do games on systems.
9716000	9717000	I feel like they do.
9717000	9721000	So my advice, strong advice, do that research now.
9721000	9723000	Where are you going to pre-order?
9723000	9725000	What are you going to look up on the 12th?
9725000	9727000	And get ready to go when that announcement is done.
9727000	9731000	But anyway, we will get all the details on January 13th.
9731000	9734000	And I'm not guaranteeing pre-orders are going live that day
9734000	9737000	or even the January 13th, but they will go live around that time.
9737000	9740000	If they're still launching in March, they gotta be coming soon.
9740000	9742000	Like, two month pre-order window?
9742000	9745000	I'm shocked that they haven't already started taking pre-orders for that.
9745000	9748000	I am also shocked as well, but I believe Nintendo
9748000	9751000	is truly waiting for the holidays to be over,
9751000	9753000	so that that is off everybody's minds,
9754000	9758000	because in early January, Nintendo will dominate gaming news.
9758000	9761000	There's really nothing else going on in January,
9761000	9764000	except we will have a lead-up to Mass Effect Andromeda.
9764000	9767000	I think we have a couple games in early January that were put,
9767000	9768000	like the South Park game.
9768000	9770000	No, we don't have a date for that, do we?
9770000	9773000	That's sometime around that.
9773000	9777000	But anyway, my point is, there's not going to be a lot to compete with.
9777000	9779000	So Nintendo will have an open news cycle.
9779000	9781000	They will dominate that conversation.
9781000	9784000	It's a risk, but we'll see.
9784000	9786000	Anyway, William Murderface in chat says,
9786000	9789000	Incompetent? I doubt it. More like manipulative.
9789000	9792000	Well, since they won't admit to being manipulative,
9792000	9794000	I am left to assume the other.
9796000	9799000	Also, in Wii U news and Switch news,
9799000	9803000	Stardew Valley for the Wii U has been canceled.
9803000	9804000	It will not be happening on the Wii U,
9804000	9807000	but Nintendo fans, do not be disappointed.
9807000	9809000	They're just going to move it over to the Switch.
9809000	9812000	And I think this makes a lot of sense coming from the dev team.
9812000	9815000	They're looking at Wii U and the current gaming landscape,
9815000	9818000	and they made the difficult choice to shift things over to the Switch.
9818000	9819000	Hey, look, I get it.
9819000	9821000	The Wii U's got one foot out the door.
9821000	9824000	I know it's going to have a last hurrah with Breath of the Wild,
9824000	9826000	but it has to share that with the Switch.
9826000	9830000	So I think this is the right call.
9830000	9832000	And I still consider myself a Nintendo fan.
9832000	9834000	This is the right thing to do.
9834000	9836000	Sucks for Wii U owners,
9836000	9839000	but I'm sure a large percentage of the folks
9839000	9841000	that would be interested in Stardew Valley who own a Wii U
9841000	9843000	are probably looking into the Switch.
9843000	9846000	The only question is the supply.
9846000	9848000	Just a couple more stories,
9848000	9850000	and then phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
9850000	9851000	Loki.
9851000	9854000	Alright, so we had talked a little bit about Pokémon GO
9854000	9859000	kind of expanding their whole update with the new tracker.
9859000	9862000	Well, that previously was on just the west of the Mississippi.
9862000	9866000	Now it's updated, I guess, for the whole United States
9866000	9868000	and most of Europe.
9868000	9870000	So that's pretty cool.
9870000	9875000	And not sure if they're going to be adding anything else near future,
9875000	9878000	but yeah, it's nice that that new tracker's out there.
9878000	9881000	So hopefully a lot more of you can experience it.
9881000	9882000	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
9882000	9885000	So luckily it didn't take a long time for that to get everywhere.
9885000	9886000	Right.
9886000	9888000	Once it started expanding, because it took a long time
9888000	9891000	once they were beta-ing it to go everywhere.
9891000	9894000	Even if I feel like some days I'm the only one still playing Pokémon GO.
9894000	9896000	Well, Alan's still playing here and there.
9896000	9897000	He just hit 27, right, last night?
9897000	9898000	24.
9898000	9899000	No, not that high.
9899000	9900000	24.
9900000	9901000	Yeah.
9901000	9902000	You're farther along.
9902000	9903000	I hit 26.
9903000	9906000	I took advantage of the bonus XP to use a lucky egg over Thanksgiving.
9906000	9907000	Got it.
9907000	9909000	And so you're still playing Pokémon GO.
9909000	9910000	I am.
9910000	9911000	So there are people playing Pokémon GO.
9911000	9912000	It's just not nearly what it was.
9912000	9914000	I'm not nearly playing as much as I used to.
9914000	9916000	If I get more burnt out on Ingress, maybe.
9916000	9919000	I mean, because I like having something to do, but I'm just...
9920000	9922000	I'm hitting that point in Ingress where I'm getting burned out.
9922000	9927000	Like, I pushed too hard to get to level 15 by the end of the double XP event and all that.
9927000	9930000	And I'm just kind of hitting this point where I'm like, I have...
9930000	9933000	And that happening at the exact same time Final Fantasy XV coming out,
9933000	9936000	it's like I'm having that whole sit-down discussion with myself,
9936000	9938000	because I do that with the voices in my head, of the whole,
9938000	9940000	do I spend too much time playing MMOs?
9940000	9944000	But there's a very social and real element to Ingress I don't want to miss out on.
9944000	9946000	So I'm kind of like one of those, I don't really want to play Ingress,
9946000	9949000	but if there's a pizza party involved, then I'll get it out.
9950000	9952000	Right? That's what it is for me.
9952000	9959000	It's more of when a game becomes, you know, it's from when it's fun to when it's a chore.
9959000	9962000	And it's been more on that chore side.
9962000	9966000	I am, in full admission, I am still having a hard time letting it go.
9966000	9969000	There's a very, very competitive side of me that doesn't want to let it go.
9969000	9970000	Right.
9970000	9971000	And I still have to work that out.
9971000	9973000	No one likes losing, but you know.
9973000	9977000	No, it's not, I mean, but our team isn't losing for the entire year,
9977000	9979000	because we've won more cycles, of course.
9979000	9983000	But what happened, we may be losing the current battle,
9983000	9985000	but we're definitely not losing the war.
9985000	9989000	But anyway, all that joke and smack talking aside and all that stuff,
9989000	9993000	I just really have to evaluate the priority level,
9993000	9995000	but that's going to take some time, I think.
9995000	9997000	As it would with any MMO.
9997000	10000000	Anybody who's been spending two nights a week playing World of Warcraft
10000000	10002000	kind of has to hit that point, I think.
10002000	10006000	And either you quit cold turkey, or you kind of start to ease out,
10006000	10010000	and you say, maybe I'll play one night a week, or that type of thing.
10010000	10011000	Yeah.
10011000	10012000	Anyway.
10012000	10014000	All right.
10014000	10016000	See, I need more time to play Pokemon.
10016000	10017000	That's my problem.
10017000	10018000	I can't play Pokemon Sun.
10018000	10020000	I'm not even talking about Pokemon Go.
10020000	10022000	I'm talking about Pokemon Sun and Moon.
10022000	10024000	I don't have enough time to play it.
10024000	10027000	But Pokemon Sun and Moon, I mean, a lot of you are into it.
10027000	10030000	And this is not a surprise to me whatsoever.
10030000	10035000	Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon sold a whopping 3.7 million units
10035000	10037000	in just two weeks.
10037000	10042000	That is an 85% increase on what they sold with Pokemon X and Y.
10042000	10046000	And I firmly believe this is Pokemon Go's doing.
10046000	10051000	I think it's also the smart intertwining between Pokemon Go
10051000	10055000	bringing back Generation 1 Pokemon to people's minds
10055000	10057000	and the throwback to Gen 1.
10057000	10061000	Especially if we had that cross interaction with it.
10061000	10066000	Well, at the end of the day, Pokemon Go was probably rushed
10066000	10069000	not only for the peripheral, but for this reason.
10069000	10072000	Pokemon Go had to come out when it came out to get the hype,
10072000	10075000	to get the pre-orders, to get people in for Sun and Moon
10075000	10077000	so I could be reporting this today.
10077000	10081000	So even if I'm sitting here saying, overall, well, Pokemon Go is declining
10081000	10086000	and all this stuff, this, I firmly believe, is in large part,
10086000	10090000	not solely, but in large part to the fact that Pokemon Go happened
10090000	10092000	and it was such a big deal that it was.
10092000	10096000	However, it shouldn't be dismissed that, SOS battles aside,
10096000	10099000	Pokemon Sun and Moon probably are the strongest Pokemon games
10099000	10102000	they've, dare I say, ever made.
10102000	10104000	JD, ever?
10104000	10107000	Well, I mean, yeah, probably.
10107000	10109000	I'm nostalgic for Gen 2.
10109000	10111000	I know you are. I know you are.
10111000	10113000	But, I mean, Shane on the last PokeStyle podcast was saying
10113000	10115000	these are his favorite, hands down, and I can see why.
10115000	10118000	I really can. And all the quality of life stuff really, really helps.
10118000	10120000	Yeah. And it's really pretty.
10120000	10122000	It is!
10122000	10125000	You know, there's a legendary they're giving away for free tomorrow
10125000	10128000	if you've beaten the game, and it'll be up until March.
10128000	10130000	I haven't beaten the game. I guess I better get on that.
10130000	10132000	Well, I mean, your deadline is, like, March 5th.
10132000	10134000	Oh, well, I have a little time.
10134000	10137000	Yeah, but the distribution starts tomorrow, December 5th,
10137000	10140000	and it's a QR code that you use the scanner in-game for.
10140000	10143000	Okay. Which will I finish first? Are we ready?
10143000	10146000	Here it is. Another multiple choice for everybody.
10146000	10148000	Which will I finish first?
10148000	10150000	Final Fantasy XV.
10150000	10152000	Pokemon Sun and Moon.
10152000	10154000	Level 16 in Ingress.
10154000	10156000	Which will happen first?
10156000	10158000	I think that depends on social pressure.
10160000	10162000	Loki, care to guess?
10164000	10166000	Final Fantasy XV?
10166000	10168000	That's where my money is.
10168000	10171000	Act-Def says Mass Effect Andromeda will happen first.
10172000	10174000	That's a fair bet. That's a fair guess.
10174000	10175000	Alright, we'll see. We'll see.
10175000	10178000	Alright, anyhow, also, if you want to experience Sun and Moon
10178000	10182000	and other times, the soundtrack is now available on iTunes,
10182000	10184000	so you can check that out.
10184000	10187000	The pricing appears to be 8.99 euros,
10187000	10189000	at 16.99 Australian dollars.
10189000	10193000	I guess when this report came out, it was only in those stores,
10193000	10195000	but usually when those come out in Australia and Europe,
10195000	10199000	they will be available everywhere else in a matter of time.
10199000	10203000	That brings us to the end of the news that we had slotted for tonight.
10203000	10205000	We kind of ran through Part B here,
10205000	10207000	but we had a really long Part A tonight,
10207000	10209000	so I guess everything balanced itself out.
10209000	10211000	But we're not done yet, because you guys have a chance to call us.
10211000	10213000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
10213000	10216000	If you want to talk about Pokemon, or the Game Awards,
10216000	10220000	or possibly want to talk about the PlayStation Experience,
10220000	10221000	or something else that happened this week,
10221000	10222000	please feel free to give us a call.
10222000	10224000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
10224000	10227000	Ooh, it's lighting up already, so let's get to it.
10227000	10229000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10229000	10231000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
10231000	10233000	Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind, buddy?
10233000	10235000	Well, a lot of things happened this week,
10235000	10240000	but I want to ask about the PlayStation Experience.
10240000	10241000	Sure.
10241000	10248000	Basically, my question is, how does this affect E3?
10248000	10253000	Like, we got a lot of announcements yesterday with the keynote,
10254000	10256000	and the PlayStation Experience,
10256000	10260000	and really big bombshells like Marvel vs. Capcom,
10260000	10264000	and The Last of Us Part II, like really big games.
10264000	10269000	And I wouldn't see these announcements outside E3,
10269000	10274000	but now with events like this, we have them.
10274000	10279000	So what's going to happen now with E3 in the future,
10280000	10284000	with events like this, like PlayStation Experience?
10284000	10286000	My honest answer, Akdeft, nothing.
10286000	10289000	I think we will continue to see E3.
10289000	10291000	Because, and the reason why I'm saying this is that
10291000	10293000	if this was year one of the PlayStation Experience,
10293000	10295000	I would be with you a little bit.
10295000	10297000	But this is year three, and every year,
10297000	10299000	they have dropped some pretty big bombshells on us.
10299000	10302000	Street Fighter V was announced at the PlayStation Experience.
10302000	10305000	What were some other big stuff that came out of PlayStation Experience?
10305000	10306000	You remember Loki?
10306000	10308000	I just remember Street Fighter V was the big one.
10308000	10311000	Final Fantasy VII, not remake, but remaster.
10311000	10314000	Remember that whole, like everybody started to lose the...
10314000	10315000	That was that whole thing.
10315000	10319000	But honestly, I think Sony is pumping out enough games,
10319000	10321000	and they've figured out the news cycle well enough
10321000	10324000	that they can kind of do both.
10324000	10326000	And this year, if I'm not mistaken,
10326000	10330000	didn't they have an additional conference about virtual reality
10330000	10332000	that they were still able to do?
10332000	10334000	So Sony's got enough news.
10334000	10337000	I was really surprised, Akdeft, that God of War didn't show up,
10337000	10338000	at all.
10338000	10340000	That ended up being a little more exclusive to E3.
10340000	10343000	I'm sure that game is still in the oven, still cooking.
10343000	10345000	We need to see what's going to come with that.
10345000	10348000	So I'm not disappointed it didn't show up or anything like that.
10348000	10350000	But I imagine we'll get an update on God of War at E3,
10350000	10352000	and everybody will lose their shit.
10352000	10354000	We didn't see Final Fantasy VII remake.
10354000	10356000	We didn't see Kingdom Hearts III.
10356000	10359000	One of those has to be next year, as I said earlier in the show,
10359000	10363000	just like there was a lot of pressure for Last Guardian to be this year.
10363000	10366000	So yes, I think we'll get an update on one of those games
10366000	10367000	next E3.
10367000	10370000	So I think there's still plenty left to talk about, Akdeft.
10370000	10374000	So I don't think this is going to ruin E3 or the news cycle or anything.
10374000	10376000	I really don't.
10376000	10378000	Yeah, me either.
10378000	10384000	I don't think E3 is going to disappear from one day or one year to another.
10384000	10387000	Because we also have third parties.
10387000	10394000	But I think E3 is going to become more and more irrelevant
10394000	10401000	for at least the big three, like Microsoft, maybe Sony and Nintendo eventually.
10401000	10407000	I'm pretty sure I'm seeing right now with Nintendo not taking E3
10407000	10415000	like a serious platform to show their games on.
10415000	10416000	You know what, you raise a really good point.
10416000	10418000	I kind of see where you're going with this now.
10418000	10420000	I see why you brought this up in the first place now.
10420000	10421000	You're right.
10421000	10425000	This is kind of all about the diminishing of E3's relevancy.
10425000	10429000	The fact that the Nintendo Switch...
10429000	10434000	When was the last time we had a console not unveiled at E3?
10434000	10435000	Not unveiled at E3.
10435000	10438000	A console, not a peripheral.
10438000	10442000	So not like VR or any of that stuff, the Move or any of that stuff.
10442000	10445000	A console, not at E3.
10445000	10447000	I can't think of one.
10447000	10448000	I really can't.
10448000	10451000	Nobody in chat can think of one that has a memory that goes a little further back.
10451000	10452000	I can't.
10452000	10456000	So that alone, you're right, Act F, that's huge news.
10456000	10458000	But I still think at least for the next couple of years,
10458000	10462000	I don't see E3 going belly up next year,
10462000	10465000	but I definitely think the ESA probably has to be having that conversation
10465000	10468000	about how do we keep this show exciting?
10468000	10470000	Are we going to open it up to the public like Tokyo Game Show,
10470000	10474000	which would be fascinating, or what's going to happen?
10474000	10475000	I don't know.
10475000	10478000	I could see E3 as a whole changing,
10478000	10481000	but for now I think Sony still has enough news
10481000	10487000	that their E3 press conference will still be a big deal.
10487000	10492000	And yeah, you bring up a good point.
10492000	10502000	The public, E3 only accepts media and people from the industry,
10502000	10504000	but it's not open to the public.
10504000	10507000	Something like PlayStation Experience, it is.
10507000	10511000	The whole perception of what is media is changing,
10511000	10515000	and ESA has not always done the best job of catching up to that.
10515000	10518000	I'm not just saying that as some bitter-beddy podcaster
10518000	10520000	who used to be able to get an E3 no problem
10520000	10522000	and now has a really hard time doing so
10522000	10527000	because E3 doesn't know how to measure the impact of podcasts and so forth,
10527000	10529000	which, you know, whatever, whatever.
10529000	10531000	But it's not even podcasters.
10531000	10534000	We were the question marks of ten years ago.
10534000	10536000	It's just a lot of us are still going.
10536000	10540000	Now the question is YouTubers and Twitch streamers.
10540000	10542000	Are they media?
10542000	10543000	Or not?
10543000	10545000	Because many of them have like 50,000 followers.
10545000	10547000	Some of them are still getting into E3.
10547000	10551000	What is that all about?
10551000	10554000	And I think ESA has a lot of these types of questions to answer.
10554000	10559000	Yeah, and we've seen in the last few years
10559000	10562000	that many YouTube personalities go to E3 like,
10562000	10567000	Oh, I'm going to E3 like it's something uneventful.
10567000	10570000	Yeah, I'm going to E3, whatever.
10570000	10575000	And yeah, what it means for the rest of the media
10575000	10578000	or journalists in the industry.
10578000	10582000	And I was talking about this in my podcast
10582000	10586000	that something like PlayStation Experience,
10586000	10589000	I don't even need a media badge.
10589000	10592000	Probably if I want to do interviews,
10592000	10598000	I want to cover more for my site and all that, maybe.
10598000	10602000	But even if I don't get it, I can just buy a ticket and go
10602000	10606000	and at least play the games, live the experience
10606000	10610000	in my personal level and report from that.
10610000	10615000	So I think that E3 at least needs to change that.
10615000	10617000	So yeah.
10617000	10619000	Very, very good perspective and some really good points,
10619000	10622000	Zach Deft, gold star for you for this call tonight.
10622000	10624000	I do want to say, though, on chat,
10624000	10627000	SSJ100Matt says the investors will still want E3 around
10627000	10630000	regardless just to be that figure piece to tout the stocks.
10630000	10633000	You know, Loki, let me go back to you
10633000	10635000	because you worked on that side of the industry
10635000	10637000	that we often don't talk about on this show
10637000	10639000	because let's be real, it's not the glamorous side of games.
10639000	10644000	And that is the wheeling and dealing of the distribution
10644000	10646000	and the marketing and all that side of things
10646000	10648000	because we only get that whole, you know, the media fire up
10648000	10652000	and so forth. Does that side of the industry still need E3?
10652000	10654000	Does that side of the industry still need that big show
10654000	10656000	every year to have those wheelings and dealings
10656000	10658000	about how many copies are on shelves and all that?
10658000	10662000	They do. I mean, to a certain extent, yeah,
10662000	10664000	they do meet a lot of, I mean, I don't know
10664000	10666000	if it necessarily needs to be E3, but there aren't
10666000	10668000	a lot of conferences that they go and meet
10668000	10671000	with all these first-party publishers and stuff.
10671000	10673000	So that is really the only time that they're sitting
10673000	10677000	face-to-face to renegotiate deals and to try to get them
10677000	10681000	to get you enough supply. I mean, because you think
10681000	10683000	Nintendo's bad in stores. I mean, it's just as bad
10683000	10685000	on the distribution side. It's like, oh, hey, by the way,
10685000	10688000	yeah, we know that, you know, you have customers looking
10688000	10690000	for thousands of units of, you know, the Wii,
10690000	10694000	you're getting five. It's like, it's ridiculous.
10694000	10697000	All right. Akdeft, again, great call.
10697000	10700000	I still think E3 is going to be a thing,
10700000	10703000	but the ESA definitely needs to evaluate a lot of things
10703000	10706000	with E3, and I wouldn't be surprised if we, you know,
10706000	10708000	get some press release in 2017. You know, they haven't
10708000	10710000	opened registration for 2017 yet. That's not going to happen
10710000	10713000	until after Nintendo does their thing.
10713000	10715000	But I'll be very curious to see if maybe there's going to be
10715000	10718000	some changes with this year's show. We'll see.
10718000	10721000	Hopefully. We'll see. All right. Take care, my friend.
10721000	10722000	Hey, thanks for having me.
10722000	10725000	Hey, no problem. Anytime. Bye-bye.
10725000	10727000	Great call from Akdeft. OrangeLoungeRadio,
10727000	10729000	all one word on Skype. See, I thought he was kind of
10729000	10731000	going one place at the beginning of the call.
10731000	10733000	It was just like, I took it one way about the announcements,
10733000	10736000	but he really made a great point about E3
10736000	10739000	and that shows like PlayStation experience.
10739000	10741000	I don't want to say they take away from E3,
10741000	10744000	but they kind of show that Sony can throw their own damn party.
10744000	10747000	Nintendo can throw their own damn party.
10747000	10749000	Microsoft is certainly capable of throwing their own damn party
10749000	10752000	if they want. We just live in a different time now.
10752000	10755000	All right. Let's take another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10755000	10758000	And to be honest, on the retail side,
10758000	10760000	Microsoft does throw their own damn party.
10760000	10762000	Sony also throws their own damn party.
10762000	10763000	Nintendo's pretty much the only one that doesn't.
10763000	10766000	Microsoft threw a party when they announced the Xbox One.
10766000	10769000	Now, granted, that backfired on them spectacularly,
10769000	10771000	but I don't think they're ruined.
10771000	10773000	I mean, there's a new person in charge at Microsoft.
10773000	10777000	Microsoft is not barred from ever being able to do their own.
10777000	10780000	Like, if Microsoft wanted to do a Microsoft thing, people would go.
10780000	10782000	I'd probably have an Xbox One already.
10782000	10784000	If Crackdown would have fucking come out already.
10784000	10786000	All you people that never shut up about Halo, you'd go.
10786000	10788000	Anyway, we have another call on the line. Let's get to it.
10788000	10790000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10790000	10795000	Well, the only reason why people complain about Halo is because of the budget.
10795000	10798000	Because you're cutting in and out a little bit,
10798000	10800000	but I think you said because they want to bug Jamie?
10800000	10802000	No, the budget.
10802000	10804000	Oh, the budget.
10804000	10806000	Yeah, that's the Fifth Avenue store.
10806000	10808000	Ah.
10808000	10810000	Did we have our... Okay, so our feed went down live.
10810000	10812000	They're saying... Yeah, it just...
10812000	10815000	That's okay. We're going to keep going for the sake of the recording.
10815000	10817000	So, Rama, what's on your mind tonight?
10817000	10820000	First off, can we give an F.U. to Comcast for the feed going down?
10820000	10823000	Yes, I agree. Big F.U. to that.
10823000	10825000	That was a weird hiccup, though.
10825000	10828000	But here's the thing, Rama, it actually might not have been on my end,
10828000	10830000	because you're still here on the call.
10830000	10834000	So that indicates to me an F.U. to the VoG hosting service,
10834000	10837000	because our call didn't drop, so the internet connection didn't cut out.
10837000	10839000	Yeah, and I was starting to freak out.
10839000	10843000	I'm just like, my settings were set perfectly when I called Bobby earlier tonight.
10843000	10846000	I mean, nothing changed except I turned up the volume.
10846000	10848000	We're under attack, we're getting hacked.
10848000	10851000	First they came for the voting machines, then they came for O.L.R.
10851000	10852000	Alright.
10852000	10854000	My DM hurts.
10854000	10857000	Maybe I said too much about the E.S.A. tonight, they're coming for me.
10857000	10859000	Alright, no, in all seriousness, what's on your mind?
10859000	10865000	Well, there were some things I wanted to say, but I forgot.
10865000	10870000	But I will listen to the show, it'll come back to me, and I'll just send an email.
10871000	10874000	Can I just give a fuck you to Capcom real quick?
10874000	10876000	Oh, why is this?
10876000	10879000	Nobody wants Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.
10879000	10880000	I think we're at the...
10880000	10881000	I do.
10881000	10884000	Well, you are one out of like a thousand people, okay?
10884000	10888000	When that was announced, the majority of my Facebook was like, no, no, no, no.
10888000	10891000	I don't know the people in yoga have something pretty excited about it.
10891000	10893000	Alright, let the man finish.
10893000	10896000	Even though there's a little confirmation bias at work here,
10896000	10899000	what is it that people really want?
10901000	10904000	New stuff. I get it.
10904000	10907000	Capcom is rehashing these IPs because they're like,
10907000	10910000	oh, let's throw some more money and just make more money out of it,
10910000	10915000	instead of like, let's bring an older IP or older franchise out,
10915000	10919000	blow the dust off of it, tweak it some, and put it back out there and see what happens.
10919000	10923000	What's fascinating to me is something like Resident Evil 7 is like,
10923000	10925000	it's a Resident Evil game, but it's kind of not.
10925000	10929000	Like, you look at all the previews, you're like, this is going a really different direction.
10929000	10933000	Obviously inspired a lot by the PT stuff and all that.
10933000	10936000	It's interesting that they kind of won't put a new name on some of their games
10936000	10938000	that have clearly changed.
10939000	10945000	Yeah, but I'm like, well, I remember when we used to complain about Nintendo doing this,
10945000	10949000	and I was like, well, you know, Nintendo's bringing back, recycling some of these IPs
10949000	10951000	to get the newer generation. I get that.
10951000	10954000	Then it's like, other companies are jumping in on the bandwagon,
10954000	10957000	and I'm just like, well, I've already played these.
10957000	10959000	I mean, you're bringing it back, you're adding a little bit extra.
10959000	10962000	I'm like, I'm not going to pick this up, you know?
10962000	10966000	See, I thought the FU was going to be because Mega Man was in that trailer,
10966000	10969000	yet they still won't give us another fucking Mega Man game.
10970000	10972000	I could give two shits about that.
10972000	10977000	My thing is, they trolled everybody on the Marvel license
10977000	10980000	because everybody knew that they no longer had it,
10980000	10985000	and right about now, if you ask me, everything Capcom is doing now
10985000	10988000	is to make money back off of Street Fighter V, okay?
10989000	10994000	Yeah, Street Fighter V is kind of Capcom's Final Fantasy XIV right now, a little bit.
10994000	10998000	But, yeah, do you think people are going to get jazzed about Akuma?
10998000	11001000	I will say, watching the match, we did watch the final match,
11001000	11004000	and I don't know a lot about Street Fighter V, but it was pretty exciting to watch.
11004000	11007000	I wasn't even around, so I did not catch that.
11007000	11010000	I would just pick up bits and pieces from people on Facebook
11010000	11012000	so I could figure out what the hell is going on.
11012000	11016000	And to be perfectly honest, like I said, I'm getting a PS4.
11016000	11018000	I'm only getting it for one reason.
11018000	11021000	Final Fantasy VII, and that's it.
11022000	11026000	I was like, alright Capcom, give me another reason to get a PS4.
11026000	11030000	I want multiple reasons. Y'all ain't doing it for me.
11030000	11032000	Fair enough, fair enough.
11032000	11034000	Alright Mama, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,
11034000	11036000	but thanks for the call as always.
11036000	11039000	No problem, and one more thing, I want to give you a couple of quick anime titles
11039000	11041000	to check out since you were talking anime earlier.
11041000	11044000	You are the anime connoisseur here at VOG Network.
11044000	11046000	Yeah, and Mako-chan's the hentai connoisseur.
11046000	11049000	Yes, you and your pals, to be fair.
11049000	11052000	The other two don't call into this show, you do, so I'm picking on you.
11052000	11056000	Aruska Doji? Really, you had to mention Aruska Doji.
11056000	11058000	It was a joke, it was a joke, please.
11058000	11061000	Everybody from college knows that anime.
11061000	11065000	Everybody from college got high or drunk and watched that anime at some point.
11065000	11068000	Not that I would advocate doing that, but I'm just saying a lot of people did it.
11068000	11071000	I actually know of one of the people who did voices on that one, okay?
11071000	11074000	We'll just leave it at that.
11074000	11076000	What would you recommend?
11076000	11081000	Okay, long-term series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
11081000	11084000	It's on its fourth season now, Diamond is Unbreakable.
11084000	11086000	It's really great, it's really cool.
11086000	11089000	If you like fifth of the North Star style animation,
11089000	11092000	that's the first series and the second series.
11092000	11096000	And as each series goes, the animation kind of goes up to date
11096000	11099000	for the time period it's supposed to be.
11099000	11103000	Seasons one and two take place in the 1800s to the 1920s,
11103000	11106000	so it's like older 80s style animation.
11106000	11112000	And then part three, Stardust Crusaders, has a 90s style to it.
11112000	11115000	And now the new series, no wait, older 80s style.
11115000	11119000	The new series, Diamond is Unbreakable, 90s style to it.
11119000	11122000	It's pretty cool.
11122000	11128000	It's a lot of posing and so forth when you get to seasons two, three, and four.
11128000	11131000	Alright, well those are some good recommendations.
11131000	11134000	If I have time, which I don't, I'll watch them at some point.
11134000	11137000	No, I really do need to make an effort to watch more,
11137000	11140000	but I haven't even seen the Guardians of the Galaxy movie, Rama.
11140000	11142000	That's how weird I am.
11142000	11145000	For a short series, Digimon Adventure Tree,
11145000	11147000	it's like three movies, that's really it.
11147000	11150000	It's like the sequel to the first two Digimon seasons.
11150000	11151000	It's fantastic.
11151000	11152000	I like short series.
11152000	11155000	That's how I was able to get convinced to watch Black Mirror.
11155000	11157000	Somebody's like, dude, season one is three episodes.
11157000	11158000	I'm like, sign me up.
11158000	11160000	At least season one's pretty good.
11160000	11162000	I haven't watched the other seasons yet, but I hear they're a trip.
11162000	11164000	So Stranger Things was eight episodes.
11164000	11166000	Easy peasy.
11166000	11168000	Did you ever watch Glee?
11168000	11172000	I watched half of the first season, and then I was like,
11172000	11176000	this show has fallen up its ass so hard, I can't stand to watch it anymore.
11176000	11178000	Go watch Love Live.
11178000	11181000	It'll reprieve Glee. Trust me on this.
11181000	11183000	Go watch Love Live.
11183000	11184000	We'll thank you for it later.
11184000	11185000	All right. Fair enough.
11185000	11187000	All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up.
11187000	11188000	Cool. Take care, man.
11188000	11189000	All right. Bye-bye.
11189000	11190000	All right.
11190000	11192000	Anime Jam Session, of course, live Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network
11192000	11196000	if you want to hear more talk about anime.
11196000	11199000	S.G.O. 100 Matt said, I was going to call in just to say,
11199000	11200000	MAGFest is one month away.
11200000	11203000	If people are listening via the podcast and plan on attending MAGFest,
11204000	11208000	keep an eye on the VOG forums for a rally call and possible meetup plans.
11208000	11212000	I am actually trying to work out to still get on a panel.
11212000	11216000	It won't be a VOG-related thing, but I can't say much more on that now
11216000	11218000	because I don't have anything confirmed yet.
11218000	11221000	But stay tuned is all I can say.
11221000	11223000	But for now, I'm about to wrap up the show,
11223000	11225000	but I do want to check if there's any last-minute stories.
11225000	11226000	Loki?
11226000	11227000	Yeah, there's one thing.
11227000	11230000	Apparently, P.T. has been data mined.
11230000	11232000	Oh, yeah, I heard about this.
11232000	11233000	And they found some...
11233000	11235000	Why did it take so long?
11235000	11237000	The encryption, maybe, or something.
11237000	11243000	But they found some monster models that were not in the game.
11243000	11248000	So this weird, like, I don't even know, it's missing a head, missing a leg, and an arm.
11250000	11251000	Yeah.
11251000	11254000	The things that could have been, but they're not.
11254000	11255000	Sigh.
11255000	11256000	All right.
11256000	11258000	Well, I think that's going to do it for another episode of Orange is Ontario.
11258000	11260000	It's 9.30 here on the West Coast,
11260000	11262000	so this show has run very long.
11262000	11264000	But granted, we had a little bit of a long break there,
11264000	11268000	and then we started at, like, 6.10, so we were a little late tonight.
11268000	11269000	But that's all right.
11269000	11272000	We had a very fun show tonight, and that is large part thanks to JD.
11272000	11277000	Thank you for being here and filling us in on Pokémon and music games and all that.
11277000	11278000	Thank you for having me.
11278000	11279000	Do you have anything to plug?
11279000	11281000	You don't do your own show.
11281000	11283000	No, I mean, I have Twitter.
11283000	11285000	You can follow me if you want.
11285000	11287000	I post really terrible puns.
11287000	11290000	I retweet a bunch of social justice stuff, and I game.
11290000	11292000	So, you know, that's...
11292000	11293000	Awesome.
11293000	11297000	And you'll still be involved with GamerX when they do another one here?
11297000	11299000	As long as it's here.
11299000	11302000	I mean, I can't promise anything if they do it in New York again.
11302000	11303000	Ah, gotcha.
11303000	11304000	Sounded like that was a good time, though.
11304000	11305000	Extra win.
11305000	11306000	He had a great time.
11306000	11307000	I heard it was really good from a lot of people.
11307000	11308000	I just wasn't able to go.
11308000	11309000	That's all right.
11309000	11310000	All right.
11310000	11311000	Well, thank you.
11311000	11312000	We'll see you again soon, I'm sure.
11312000	11315000	Alan, I know you didn't get to sit in on a lot of the second half,
11315000	11316000	but thank you for being here tonight.
11316000	11318000	And filling in on the first part of the show.
11318000	11319000	No problem.
11319000	11322000	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight, or anything you want to plug?
11324000	11326000	Papa Murphy's Pizza.
11326000	11327000	Go buy some.
11327000	11328000	It is pretty good.
11328000	11329000	It is good.
11329000	11330000	It is good.
11330000	11331000	All right.
11331000	11332000	They didn't pay for that sponsorship.
11332000	11335000	As always, thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11335000	11337000	Thank you so much for taking the time out of your week
11337000	11340000	to either listen to us live or listen to us on the podcast feed.
11340000	11342000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
11342000	11347000	a five-star review on a nice site like iTunes or Google Podcast or TuneIn.
11347000	11351000	They all go a long way in helping to spread the word about the show.
11351000	11352000	Tell a friend or two about the show.
11352000	11353000	That's all we ask.
11353000	11355000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice,
11355000	11357000	but we can't air those voices if they're not here.
11357000	11360000	And look, after that phone call with Shane tonight
11360000	11363000	about Final Fantasy XV is crap graphics or whatever it was he said,
11363000	11367000	clearly we are able to have dissenting opinions here at OLR.
11367000	11370000	Even when somebody is as blatantly wrong as he is,
11370000	11374000	we will still hear those voices here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11374000	11376000	So thank you again.
11376000	11377000	And yeah, e-mail us.
11377000	11379000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
11379000	11381000	We're also on Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.
11381000	11384000	And that's all I've got to say.
11384000	11386000	I guess my final thought for tonight would be
11386000	11390000	I'm ready to do more side quests in Final Fantasy XV.
11390000	11393000	I have now realized there is no penalty for staying up eight days straight
11393000	11395000	except for the nighttime creatures.
11395000	11397000	So I may have a new approach in Final Fantasy XV.
11397000	11398000	We'll see.
11398000	11400000	Loki, any final thoughts from you?
11400000	11403000	I guess I'll have to play Final Fantasy XV.
11403000	11405000	I think you should.
11405000	11406000	Report on that next week.
11406000	11407000	Okay.
11407000	11409000	All right. We'll be back next week to do this all again.
11409000	11413000	DarkSakura makes her return to the show again
11413000	11416000	because she kind of did have a little fling there with Episode 666,
11416000	11417000	but she will be back full time.
11417000	11420000	I was texting with her a little bit during the show on another issue,
11420000	11423000	and she did want me to pass along the hellos.
11423000	11425000	So hellos, and she will be back next week.
11425000	11427000	We will be back next week.
11427000	11428000	I hope you will be back next week.
11428000	11431000	In the meantime, happy gaming, whether it's Final Fantasy XV,
11431000	11433000	Pokemon, or whatever it is you're playing.
11433000	11434000	Have fun.
11434000	11436000	Treat each other with a little bit of respect, please,
11436000	11438000	and we'll see you next time.
