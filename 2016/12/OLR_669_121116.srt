Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week, the world saw Jimmy Fallon nerdgasm over the televised reveal of a playable Nintendo Switch running Zelda Breath of the Wild.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll have more about this and the most important part all three co-hosts you know and love, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live tonight, episode number 669 for this December the 11th of 2016.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you from Sacramento, California's Studio N7 with my co-host to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
First off, welcome back. DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. How you doing? Is your mic on though? You're not going to be able to do very much without a mic on.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
As I was saying, I'm back bitches. A little rusty. I had it off because I still have a bit of a cough left.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Feel better for one. It's just leftovers. But nice to have you back. How was your month?

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, kind of boring and weird for having to work weekends and I spent the past three weeks sick, so.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yuck.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, so that's pretty much it.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But at least all's changed now and your schedule clears your way to do OLR again for the rest of time.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And the funny thing is that I didn't realize I had done a day trade with somebody.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Uh huh.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I had to work yesterday.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Uh huh.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But I have a three day weekend coming up so.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Nice.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Nothing wrong with three day weekends. I like three day weekends.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Also a fan of three day weekends. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Like everybody else in the face of the planet.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right. Who hates three day weekends? Bring them to me.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, I can find reasons to hate three day weekends, yes.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Loki, you missed out, man. Last night here in Sacramento we had a double feature and I was fortunate enough to get to host this.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We had a double feature of Kung Fury and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Your favorite movie, Kung Fury.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I just figured you didn't go because of, you know, family stuff. The wife probably wouldn't let you in.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, and I completely forgot about it.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, you know what? For what it's worth, while I was there, since, you know, I got to do interviews and stuff, I brought a little piece of it back for you since I know you're such a fan of Kung Fury.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So there's a little, uh.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So wait on my Blu-rays too. Apparently those haven't shipped ever. So.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's awesome.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So anyway, that's an autographed picture of Andreas Kaling who plays Thor in the movie. We actually had a special guest last night and I actually had to make it out to Loki.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So there it is. He was a great guy.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's awesome. I wanna hang that at my desk.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Alright, awesome. So I knew you'd get a kick out of that. Dark Soccer, I'm sorry. I would have got you one too. You haven't even seen the movie yet, right?

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You need to see it at some point. It's so ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's on YouTube. It's like 45 minutes long.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just haven't been interested.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Not even that. 30 minutes.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Really? It's like 40 minutes?

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, it's like 30 minutes. Yeah, it's short.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's got David Hasselhoff theme song.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's one of those things where you're like, this is so fucking ridiculous. I actually kinda like it.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It stars one of the guys from Lonely Island as Hitler.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's ridiculous. Totally ridiculous. Anyway.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Anyway. Let's see. And of course, always joining us here in our chat room, our live audience in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And hello everybody to our chatters.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Starting with SSJ100Matt who says,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I hate three-day weekends because they're not four-day weekends.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There's no pleasing some of you out there. No pleasing some of you.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then a few people talking about Kung Fury there in chat.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Act F says it's hilarious. And Bob Coffey says,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Best part of that is Triceracops. Yes.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's awesome. I made some joke on stage last night because there's this scene where the gold bird and the dinosaur fight each other with their tiny little hands.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They're fighting each other. So I made a tiny hands joke and I'll just let you fill in the gaps where I went with that joke.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right. Oh, yes. And hacker man. Oh, my God.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Anyway. All right. Look, this isn't a Kung Fury podcast. It's a video game podcast.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So we're going to get some gaming news here at the top of the show.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's talk about we've had a lot of big anticipated game releases this year.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Final Fantasy 15, of course, we were talking about last week.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Last Guardian just came out in the last week and a lot of people picked that up.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Very excited to play that, you know, and that's just kind of the end cap.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The last two delayed games that were supposed to come out earlier in the year.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But here they are. So we're really only left with one big game release left for this year.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And that is this week's Super Mario Run is coming out on mobile.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Lower your expectations. I'm saying some people would say that's not a major release.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. A lot of people have been pressuring Nintendo to do mobile.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And Pokemon Go doesn't super count because that was the Pokemon company, which isn't it's complicated.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is but this is Nintendo actual Nintendo IP and property like they're putting Mario on a non Nintendo device.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is kind of a big deal because this could be, you know, a huge thing for Nintendo.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It could be the CDI. I mean, the CDI.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I was going to say they put it on the film CDI.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, yeah, but because of that, they haven't done it a long time. So I don't know.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I kind of think Super Mario Run is a big, big deal.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And, you know, I I'm sure a lot of you saw the piece on Jimmy Fallon this week or heard about the fact that Super Mario Run demo is out in stores now.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Right. The Apple stores. I think I'll have it. Let me run right out.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, play a demo of a game. Well, OK.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Some people did because some of the YouTubers saw the opportunity to if I can get the recording of it first and get it on my YouTube channel, I'll get lots of hits.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There's lots of YouTubers out out there who went and played the demo.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And, you know, you can see this out there now so you can get a pretty good sense for what the game is going to be like.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I have to admit, I it looks neat. I'll probably pick it up. Why not?

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And you'll probably finish it in an hour. And then that will be that.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And I'm I'm goddamn serious because I was reading the early impressions from people and they said, yeah, it's a neat game.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But it's short. It's like 24 levels. And that's it.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
J.D. is in our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com who asked, does Miitomo not count?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, it probably should, based on the words I chose.

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But the reason why I'm not considering Miitomo is because Miitomo was kind of like a new thing where it's like Mario is a very established kind of thing.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Like, I just don't put I don't put the Mii caricatures and Mario on the same level of Nintendo like stuff to put out there.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I point out Act of the Same Portal can be finished in 30 minutes and Portal is one of the best games ever.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, well, that's speedrunning that shit. And you know what? I'm not talking about speedrunning this game.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm talking about that is the actual playtime of the game is one hour when you visit all the content.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean, shit, you could beat certain games in like a couple minutes.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That doesn't mean that they're great.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The old school Atari 2600 games.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Here's my thing is they're hoping for a repeat of the craziness that was Pokémon GO.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is not going to happen with this game. I'm sorry.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's just not because it's not a completely social phenomenon.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's not something that gets people out and changes the way that they play gaming.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Just like, you know, we did this is just another fucking runner game on a mobile platform that has a million fucking runner games,

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
but it has another licensed property that people like. That's it.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Lower your fucking expectations because it's not the fucking godsend of like mobile gaming.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is not going to change mobile gaming. People are going to forget about this shit in about a month.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And I would ultimately say, to be fair, I would only say almost everything you said ultimately doesn't matter.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The part I agree with, it's not going to do as well as Pokémon GO.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that's where I stop agreeing with you because and it's not like, look, I don't think that this game is going to be a critical darling by any means.

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't even think it's necessarily going to be a good Mario game.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It'll probably be a competent Mario game, but it's I don't think it's going to stand the test of time as a Mario Brothers 3 or a Mario World or something like that.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But at the end of the day, Loki, here's my argument.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It doesn't matter what you are. I think it doesn't matter what most of the listeners of this program think because the majority of the people, I mean, sorry, but that's my honest answer.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The majority of the people who are going to buy this are not your, using my quotey fingers, hardcore gamers.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not even really your casual gamers because now, you know, a lot of the 30 and 40 year olds in this day and age remember Mario and played it at some point in their lives.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I think there's just going to be a lot of people who buy it because, oh, hey, it's a Mario game on my device.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And it's people who probably like otherwise would never buy a Wii U for themselves, maybe for their kid.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I just think there's a whole, and I think that's the whole reason why Nintendo's pushing mobile is this is a game for them.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is not a game for the rest of us.

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And you kind of have to realize that's where it is now.

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Nintendo's going to chase the money.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, I understand Nintendo's going to chase the money.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's nice to see them have, you know, this is the first step for them being, you know, a non console publisher and just, you know, third party and all this shit, which I'd be totally fine with playing Mario games on my PlayStation 4.

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's all the hardcore gamers are frothing over, but I don't, we're not ready for that yet.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We need to get, we need to see what happens with the Switch and then we can start having those discussions.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:53,000
All I'm saying is though, it's like, I don't know, fine. I'm sure it'll do well. I'm sure they'll say, oh, it was a great success, but my expectations aren't very high for it.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Now, Animal Crossing.

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That may be different.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All right.

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, look, and this, Loki, this probably won't make you happy either.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And this is, it's one of the things where it's surprising and it's not, was this little tidbit of information that came out this week because Nintendo has been pushing the publicity tour for this so hard.

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They want the day one to be big.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't think the Apple store has ever done a notify me of when this comes out thing before.

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't think that's ever happened before on the stores.

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is like a new thing.

140
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So Nintendo really wants day one to be big for this thing, right?

141
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But with the publicity tour comes the Q&A and a lot of things have come out about the game and this one is going to, I don't know, some people are going to be concerned about it.

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Super Mario Run is going to require you to be online at all times.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't think that's a huge deal breaker because there's a lot of online games that do require that, or mobile games, I should say.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think. I mean, I don't play a ton of mobile games, but I know there are others out there, some major ones.

145
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, Pokemon Go would be a great example, actually.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, that's a little different. I mean, that's not a game that you can really play without an internet connection anyways.

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And it's, but this is not, it's, this is a platformer game. This is something that you should potentially not need that connection.

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I mean, I can see the update. If you want to submit that score you just got to an online leaderboard, then yeah, you need an internet connection.

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm actually kind of surprised that you are accepting this.

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, I'm fully accepting that Nintendo is several decades behind the trend of networking and so this always online connection thing, that was a few years ago.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So they're catching up. It's just, they're slowly getting around to it.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Here's what's interesting about this, too. Whereas, you know, when Diablo 3 did it, they tried to come up with a whole list of reasons on why it needed to be always online, right?

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And that was about stopping the cheating, which got through anyway, and all this other stuff, right?

154
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right. SimCity can only really be always online.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, right. Oh, boy. Okay. But, interestingly enough, Nintendo has basically just come out and said, no, it's because of piracy. We don't want this game to get pirated.

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So, you've got to give up. I know, I know, right? Have another laugh, Loki. Have another laugh.

157
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But you've got to at least admire that they're being upfront in that regard.

158
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No, I don't. I don't have to admire that at all because this is the platform that you're on and I'm sorry, too bad.

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I want to give you the exact words here. In an interview with Mashable, Miyamoto said,

160
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:37,000
For consumers who are purchasing the game, we want to be sure, or excuse me, to make sure that we're able to offer it to them in a way that the software is secure and they're able to play it in a stable environment.

161
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Went on to comment about the number of countries the game is launching in, as opposed to a normal Nintendo product, so there's all these additional countries.

162
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And they want to make sure that all the services are as secure as possible.

163
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Security is also being cited as part of the reason why the game is an iOS exclusive for those, however long it's going to be, I don't know, a month or two months or whenever the gap is until it's on Android.

164
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, Loki dying not to laugh over there.

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, I'm totally sure it was a security issue. They were so concerned about security and not that they were being paid by Apple to have a timed exclusive.

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sure that has nothing to do with it at all. Please. They think I'm fucking stupid?

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
To be fair, Loki, I'd buy it.

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What does it matter anyway? The decision is made. We don't need a reason. It just is what it is.

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What are your thoughts on Super Mario Run? Not even necessarily this whole piracy thing, but just the game in general.

170
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll play it, you know, but I don't really care why it's exclusive to one versus the other. If that's their decision, that's their decision and the reasons don't matter. What can we do about it?

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it's not even really an exclusive, it's a timed thing.

172
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Even so, it's not our decision and their reasons. Knowing the reason why changes nothing.

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Which, to be fair, Ingress was an Android exclusive and I still play the crap out of that, unfortunately. So, I mean, it can work both ways.

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah. So, let's see. The other thing I wanted to say, because I kind of agree with this comment in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's Raginator in chat says, mark the date and time, everybody. I really agree with Raginator on something.

176
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Raginator says, wouldn't the always online thing kill your mobile data cap? That's the first place my mind went.

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How much is this always online thing going to use?

178
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But the security, you got to be secure in this day and age and you wouldn't want piracy. God forbid, Nintendo, think about other people.

179
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How much of my two gigabyte plan, which I don't actually have, I'm clinging to my unlimited plan through my carrier that they don't offer anymore.

180
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Like a frickin' nobody's business. I won't get rid of it. And if they force me to get rid of it, I will switch carriers.

181
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I've been with the same cell phone company for 10 years. If they make me get off my unlimited plan, I'm switching to Sprint or T-Mobile.

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't even care that their networks, or I guess Sprint's pretty good. I don't even care that T-Mobile's network is not so hot, at least in this area.

183
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So, I will jump ship to that if they make me lose that. And this is part of the reason why it's crap like this.

184
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's like, you know, all these data providers keep saying, like Comcast and all these other providers keep saying,

185
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
oh, well, with this, you can do so much of this and this and this. And it's like, okay, that's what grandma does.

186
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I play a lot of games that use a lot of bit rate, you know? So, anyway, sorry, I don't mean to get on tangent.

187
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But my point is, how much of this data cap am I gonna use playing Mario Run?

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Now, granted, if I'm at home and I remember to put my phone on the Wi-Fi network, then I guess that won't matter.

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, there's my Comcast cap, but that one's pretty big.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I wouldn't worry about it too much. I mean, the game's only about an hour long, so you're not gonna use much of your data caps.

191
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're gonna be bored of it before, you know, before it gets to be a problem.

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay, so ActDeft goes here and says, I don't think Super Mario Run is going to use more than Pokemon Go.

193
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Probably some kilobytes at most.

194
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're right, ActDeft, but I think at the same time we have to recognize those are both clearly different games.

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And I guess I do agree with Loki on something here, is that with Pokemon Go, there's that expectation that,

196
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
okay, yes, if I'm gonna be out in the real world, of course this is using data downloading maps and so forth.

197
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But Mario Run, being a platforming game that has nothing to do with online environments outside of high scoreboards,

198
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and that sort of exchange, if I'm not mistaken, doesn't necessarily need that data consumption. You know what I mean?

199
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like, you expect it with Pokemon Go. You know that going in.

200
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
At least I give them props. I mean, albeit they weren't entirely direct, but I mean, I give them props saying,

201
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
oh, it's because of copy protection. It's a shitty reason to do it.

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But unless it's, at least they didn't try to spin it with some sort of, oh, multiplayer leaderboards,

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and oh, it's a social aspect. It needs to be connected.

204
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I mean, I don't know. It's stupid. But you know what? I don't care because I'm not gonna download it.

205
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So, whatever. It doesn't matter.

206
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But it's seriously, you gotta understand, Nintendo, yes, people love Mario, but it's a mobile platform you're on.

207
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There's a million fucking runner games out there, and I'll be honest, yeah, they may not have Mario with them,

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
but there may be other games that are much better than yours.

209
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And even, like, I gotta, I really don't like the new Super Mario Brother art style.

210
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I really wish they would just have done away with that.

211
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But whatever. I mean, that's what they decided to use and reuse those assets and everything for this game.

212
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So, whatever. I mean, I don't care. It doesn't appeal to me. I'm not gonna play it. That's it.

213
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So, you don't think there's anything this game can do to win you over?

214
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No, I've watched how the game plays. I know that the game's short.

215
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't give a shit about the Kingdom Building part of it. I don't care. There is nothing that appeals to me in this game.

216
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They didn't really explain enough about the Kingdom Building part for me to understand, like, what that is.

217
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Does that make sense?

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You just don't care, yeah. I mean, it's just, watching him play it, I'm like, wow, this is not exciting.

219
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So, okay, so I'm looking, I just was curious, because I see in chat, Act F says,

220
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I do have a two gigabyte data cap. I don't ever get to two gigabytes, even with Pokemon Go.

221
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I decided to look up what my usage looks like right now. Okay, since December 3rd, you ready for this?

222
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Since December 3rd, I've used 2.2 gigs.

223
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, I believe that. I have three gigs and I normally use almost all of it.

224
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And I wanna say in the past month, like when I pull my reports, I'm usually like about eight gigs a month.

225
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And I'm not using my phone for anything illegitimate. I don't do piracy or any of that garbage on my phone.

226
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Like, everything I do is either, it's Spotify or it's probably fucking Ingress and Pokemon Go and shit.

227
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like, I'm starting to question, like, how much data am I really using with those games? You know what I mean?

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But it could be Spotify. I listen to Spotify a lot in the car, like that, I don't...

229
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Occasionally, you know what lot will kill my data cap is?

230
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Occasionally, I'll... Because my... For whatever reason, Ingress doesn't work on my Wi-Fi network at home.

231
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know why, but for some reason, it just doesn't work with it, which is odd.

232
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because I didn't do anything to it, so I'm not sure why.

233
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But, so I'll shut off the Wi-Fi to, you know, if I wanna recharge or whatever, play, you know, do organization crap with it.

234
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And so, sometimes I forget to turn it back on, and then I go watch a YouTube video, and it's like, oh shit, there goes like a...

235
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I do the same thing. I do the same thing, is that sometimes my Wi-Fi, like, screws up and it doesn't, like, work the internet the same way,

236
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
so I turn it off, and then I forget to turn it back on, and I'll do the exact same thing.

237
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Or my work Wi-Fi, it's slow, so like, I'll be trying to view a web page or something, the page isn't loading,

238
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
so I'll switch the Wi-Fi off to load it faster over 4G, and I forget when I'm listening to, like, a podcast or something.

239
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You know what would be great? I need to submit that. Does Tim Cook have a suggestion box? Does he have an email address I can email him at?

240
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because I wanna send a suggestion that says, put a button in the next iOS that disables Wi-Fi for five minutes.

241
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That would be brilliant, and then it just automatically comes back on.

242
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Apple.com slash feedback.

243
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Okay, all right, I'm gonna do it.

244
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm serious.

245
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I would do it live during the show if we didn't have stories coming up, I gotta focus on first.

246
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
All right, so anyway, we will see. I'm very curious to see how well this Super Mario run does.

247
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Are there gonna be a lot of folks like Loki who say, pass, this just looks like a throwaway garbage type of game?

248
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Or are there gonna be enough other people where this thing makes tons and tons of money?

249
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm not saying it's garbage, I'm just saying that it's not, it's lazy is what it is.

250
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's just, it's just a lazy game. They're reusing assets, they're putting minimal effort into creating a game,

251
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and then they're just throwing it out there because they figure it's Mario, people are gonna eat the shit up, and we're gonna make a quick buck.

252
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And they know they're gonna make a quick buck, because that's why they were on Jimmy Fallon fucking promoting an iOS game.

253
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is because they know they're gonna make bank off of it, because people are like, oh my god, Mario, I gotta buy that!

254
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Do they promote like, Clash of Kings, or what are those games, what's the Mariah Carey game?

255
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They have commercials for that shit all the time, like Bubble Strike.

256
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Do they promote that stuff on Jimmy Fallon?

257
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Neither do I. I don't watch like any, the only late night TV thing I watch is on Netflix.

258
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I know he does game stuff usually during E3, and that's kind of a mix everywhere, and they do Nintendo stuff a lot, but

259
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Interesting.

260
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know, I don't watch him.

261
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, the only late night show I watch, I don't know if I should talk about this on the show, but I watch Chelsea pretty religiously on Netflix.

262
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I think she's hilarious, even though I understand why a lot of people don't like her.

263
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But she was more the type that she sent somebody to BlizzCon to make fun of it.

264
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, she sent that guy from American Pie, was it Jason Biggs? Is that his name? The guy that was on Orange is the New Black?

265
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
She sent him to BlizzCon, he's on her show all the time, and she sent him to BlizzCon, because she's like, I don't want to fucking go.

266
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So, she sends him, and it was, I actually did not find the piece to be insulting or anything like that, or I'd probably be really mad and say, like I just, I thought it was, it was silly.

267
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
As a late night talk show ought to be is a little silly, so anyway, that's just my take on late night.

268
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Alright, we're moving on to late night TV, we've obviously exhausted the topic of Super Mario Run, but we'll see how the game does this week.

269
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'd be very curious for those of you that pick up Super Mario Run this week, what your thoughts are on the game.

270
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Like, here's, here's what would be fantastic, which is impossible because it doesn't have any controls, so you can't really play games with the precision that you need for, but, like a game like Super Mario Maker on iOS would be fucking amazing.

271
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That would be like, that would probably be like crazy, you know, awesome, that this could be like a big social thing, but no.

272
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No. No, I don't want that. No, I don't want it.

273
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It wouldn't work because there's no buttons.

274
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, exactly. That's the one reason I don't want it. Until there's a standardized D-pad controller type thing that Apple, Android, whatever, like Ecosystem puts out, and I'm not talking third party, like I'm saying, either Apple puts out a joystick themselves, or there's some type of, I know that's harder to do on Android, but some type of officially adopted standard at least or something.

275
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I don't want that to happen because those games that do the D-pad on the touchscreen end up being garbage.

276
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Like, how many times has Luminous fooled me with a mobile release, like, oh, I'm gonna love it because it's Luminous, I'm gonna eat this shit up because I love Mizuguchi and I'll play anything he puts out, and then I play Luminous on mobile devices, and I'm like, god dammit, this game sucks without a D-pad.

277
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So, how many times are they gonna fool me?

278
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I actually have a really good controller that works on my Apple TV.

279
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Does it, well, but...

280
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It also works for iOS.

281
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Does it work with a phone?

282
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

283
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's Bluetooth, probably.

284
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's Bluetooth. It's the SteelSeries.

285
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay, because I have that iCade thing that I've used my iPad with.

286
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Not quite the same, but it's like a standard, maybe about the size of an Xbox controller, and we were playing Sonic CD with it.

287
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If I'm not mistaken, though, I could be wrong, but because those things are not, is it an official Apple device?

288
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
No, it's a third party, but it's...

289
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So there's no standard?

290
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But it's sold on the Apple website.

291
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's a thing that you can use for, like, I have the iOS, or not iOS, the Android version of it, because that doesn't make any fucking sense that a Bluetooth device can't fucking work on one platform and another platform.

292
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Thank you, Apple, for that shit.

293
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But, I don't know, it's just, it works good for, like, Minecraft.

294
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Wait, but doesn't a game have to choose to enable that?

295
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, the games have to be compatible with Bluetooth for it to work.

296
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
See, and that ends up being the real problem.

297
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Like, even though those devices are good, it's not a standard. It's not a universal standard.

298
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But they've had that available. That was one of the standards I thought they introduced with iOS 7, but...

299
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't know.

300
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Whether or not it's on the operating system is one thing. The game has to support it.

301
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Exactly. Exactly. And I don't know. Maybe Luminous does support it. To be fair, I haven't tried. But anyway...

302
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I do want to move on and talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we have been playing this week, be it mobile devices, or consoles, or PCs, or whatever.

303
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Uh, Loki. Actually, no, I'll start with Dark Sakura. You've been gone for so... Sorry, I'm so out of practice with you being gone for three months. I can simply go to Loki first.

304
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Dark Sakura, now that you're back, how was your gaming week?

305
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Uh...

306
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Maybe I should have started with Loki.

307
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I played Animal Crossing.

308
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Like the DS one?

309
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah.

310
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, did you finally get that patch? Okay, okay.

311
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You get a campsite. That's it. Like Amiibo support. I haven't played with the Amiibo stuff yet, but it was kind of neat walking around. Because of the changes, you get a new dream address. So you make a new dream town and everything.

312
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It was nice. All my people were there, and Isabel cleaned the town. And I harassed Resetti. Reset Sun. And that was great.

313
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft, because I missed it so much. And it is far superior to Final Fantasy XIV in every way. Except for graphics.

314
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Even though she's incorrect, she was bragging about her eye level when she walked in here.

315
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I hit eye level 863. I went from 856 to 863 because of one epic item. And now I can handle elites by myself so I don't have to party with other people. Because I hate that. I play an MMO to play by myself. And to play with my guild friends.

316
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:40,000
She's a strong, independent MMO player. Who don't need no man. No need no party. Exactly. She's a strong, independent mage. Yeah, well actually I'm playing a demon hunter.

317
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh, excuse me. I've been playing my mage some. She doesn't party with you, she hunts you.

318
00:27:45,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, we've been calling them demon hunties. I've also been playing a little bit of Danganronpa 2. Sonic CD on the Apple TV. Because it's got the Japanese track. Hello.

319
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Of course. It's great. Both of the theme songs. Well, the Sonic Boom one was there. But the Japanese one had no lyrics. It was just instrumental like they did for the Steam release. It handles really, really well with that controller that I have.

320
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The Seal series. It's a really nice controller. Very comfortable. Pretty hefty though. I know I've played some other stuff. I've played some Pinball actually. Blastroids. Because we have that Blastroids cabinet.

321
00:28:41,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And Dan's been playing a lot of UNO. Random. Online. Like the new one? Or the 360 one? Whatever some online website thing is. I'm like what are you doing this for? Because I want to say Ubisoft or somebody put out a new UNO like a month or two ago.

322
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:24,000
About UNO a month ago? Well Ubisoft better be watching their ass in other ways. News to come later. Was that it for your gaming week? Yeah I guess. Then we'll go to Loki. Oh wait, wait. I'm still trying to catch a ditto. I caught one here at the house. Well I'm going to pull it off my phone. It was a Rattata. Everybody else I know got it from a Pidgey but I got one from a Rattata. Rattata, tat, tat. Rattata, tat, tat.

323
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And if nothing else, like seriously this is a Pikachu farm. I catch a Pikachu outside like every hour. And the other thing, Miitomo is actually a lot more fun now. I heard they did a lot of changes to it. I decorated my room so I have like six posters in my room. I have Garrus, Cullen, Illidan. I have Sonic and Amy. Because I took a picture for Sonic CD. And like the other one is the Japanese Guardian Legend art.

324
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I keep meaning to go back and check out Miitomo because everybody is telling me how it's different now but I've been too lazy. It really is a lot different. Loki, how was your gaming week?

325
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I played this week more Skyrim on Playstation 4. So I'm like level 160 now. But I haven't really done anything. I'm just leveling because I can.

326
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Then I did try out a little bit of Final Fantasy XV. I did not play very far into it because I'm not very interested in it. And you know what? That is their fault to be honest because you're supposed to hook me from the get go.

327
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I was hooked with the other games like Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy VII. You know what those had in common? Fucking kickass beginnings. Where it actually felt like there was some sort of, you know, something on the line. Some sort of motivation for your character other than, yeah let's go drive. Let's go drive to get married.

328
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I want to play it to cook stuff.

329
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But you don't really cook anything though. You just say, hey you make this based off of like...

330
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But the pictures are so real. Like the food looks so real.

331
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's what my son said. He's like, oh man that looks good. The egg like jiggles and stuff.

332
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I've actually decided that I want to make that braised beef stew because I've never considered caramelizing the onions.

333
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I bet there could be a market at like conventions for like cooking dishes from Final Fantasy XV. But you better bring lots of cup of noodle. Just saying. Bring lots and lots of cup of noodle.

334
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That's pretty much just like, they have channels for that. I know there is like a channel with, not Freddy Wong, but his brother. They do like game based stuff and cartoon stuff.

335
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Anyways, so I played that and then other than that I played Excite Truck. I actually worked on my Unity project thing.

336
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And it's weird, like I was working, like my wife wants me to make like an Excite Truck type game.

337
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So the first thing I did was make the terrain deformation script and stuff.

338
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And so it works part of the way. Like normally in the game when you hit an icon or something it makes like a hill appear and then after a while it goes away.

339
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And so I have it and the hill appears and then it doesn't go away. Which is weird because I literally copied the script and then just reversed the order that goes in and it should work just fine.

340
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But Unity is being special and just saying, no. We're not going to tell you what's wrong, but there's something wrong. Fantastic. I get to dive into that and figure out what the hell is wrong with that.

341
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So I worked on that and then Ingress a little bit. I haven't been playing too much though, but a little bit of that.

342
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I think that's it. Just buying games from the sale with new VR games. I'm probably not going to end up playing them.

343
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Alright, that's it for your gaming week. My gaming week, honestly, 100% Final Fantasy 15.

344
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I haven't even been playing Final Fantasy 14. Which is so funny to talk about those games back to back because they're so, so different to me.

345
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But anyway, regardless, I've been playing Final Fantasy 15. I've just been progressing in the story. I really wanted to beat it.

346
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I was going to try to beat it before tonight's show, but with the performance last night and everything I just didn't have enough hours in the week to do it for me for doing that.

347
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I know some people have already powered their way through the game. They powered their way through the game in like four days.

348
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I can't do the same thing just because I have other priorities I have to juggle. But I would say I've spent, I think I'm 26 hours in at this point.

349
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I mean, for me, for one game, you guys, that's pretty good. Like, again, I know I had Alan vouch for this last week, but it does look like I'm going to beat this game.

350
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Or I'll be that person that gets all the way to the final boss and then says, fuck this game and then quits.

351
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So one of the two is bound to happen with Final Fantasy 15. But I gotta say, I know we got into it a little bit last week when we had Shane Collin and all that stuff.

352
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But, and I don't want to repeat myself too much, but it is kind of funny because, you know, Shane and I have been kind of continuing our discussions.

353
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He's actually been watching me play. I haven't been streaming on Twitch, but I've been doing SharePlay, like private streaming.

354
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So he's been watching me play some of the game, which is, for somebody that hates the game so much, he sure has watched me replay a lot of it.

355
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But I guess he really wants to, like, he wants to know what I like about it or wants to see if his opinion changes on it or whatever.

356
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I know there is a particular chapter he did really like and he wanted to watch me play that chapter.

357
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But I'm, again, obviously keeping the spoiler free because I know a lot of people have not progressed 26 hours like I have, or even 10 hours like Loki.

358
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But, I gotta say, like, I think Shane and I's opinions on this game are gonna stay polar opposites.

359
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Like, I am really enjoying the game. I am up to chapter 13, I got to today.

360
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So for everybody who has beaten the game, I'll speak in vague terms, I got to chapter 13.

361
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And my understanding is, this is the chapter where the game shits the bed for a lot of people.

362
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And just reading what I'm reading on Twitter.

363
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But, I, again, trying to keep this very vague, I can see why it's very annoying, this particular chapter.

364
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But it's not a deal breaker for me yet. I think for me it's one of those things where it's like, okay, if you watch an entire series of, let's say, I don't know, Doctor Who, and there's one bad episode, you don't necessarily hate the whole show.

365
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You go, okay, it was still a pretty good show, just, you know, there was a bad episode or two.

366
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Because, honestly, I've really enjoyed all the chapters leading up to this.

367
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I still am feeling the problem of this doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game to me at all.

368
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But, I'm at the point where I would say this game does feel more Final Fantasy than the movie.

369
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Remember Final Fantasy The Spirits Within? Remember that?

370
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I would say Final Fantasy XV is more of a Final Fantasy product than that. I'm willing to move it up to that.

371
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
That's not much.

372
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Exactly. I'm willing to move it up to that rank, at least.

373
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But it's still, it does start, the story does start to go places that at least involve creatures that you would know from Final Fantasy games and stuff, so there's at least some of that.

374
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But again, I'm just really put off by the whole fact that nobody can fucking cast cure. Nobody casts cure.

375
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Like, you can use potions and shit like you do in other Final Fantasy games, and there is a cure type ability, something else that kind of does what cure does, but it's, it's just, it's so off-putting to me and I can't explain it.

376
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Like, the fact that there's, you would expect that there's a white mage and a thief and a butt, and like, that whole system is gone.

377
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And it's, it's, that part is still a little weird to me.

378
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But again, and like I said last week, I'm still okay with it because at the end of the day, I actually am enjoying the game.

379
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I just kind of say, okay, Rob, just approach this like it is Final Fantasy 13 versus and stop thinking that it's Final Fantasy 15 and just enjoy the game for what it is and not what it needs to be.

380
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And once I kind of like let that go, I'm like, yeah, I actually kind of enjoy this game quite a bit, and I actually, I kind of like the battle system.

381
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The battle system is like, and I don't play wait mode either. I do the whole live thing. I love the whole like warping in, warping out, creating chains with people, getting other party members to use their abilities so I can piggyback off of them, trying to get behind the enemy.

382
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Like, I'm actually really enjoying that side of it. It's just not Final Fantasy battles, but it's fun. So, but that's it. Otherwise, I, otherwise I'm, yeah, I'm still enjoying the game.

383
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I feel like my opinion of this once I'm done is going to be favorable. Again, if the ending completely shits itself, like a lot of people are leading me to believe, maybe it'll knock down a peg or two, but I can say I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience of getting to where I am in the game right now.

384
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And I thought some of the, some of the cut scenes were amazing and some of the graphics and things you see, all I'm going to say is that, you know, everybody knows that Final Fantasy 15, one of its large part, one of its large things that there's a big open world thing, right?

385
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But as the story progresses, you start to, you know, go somewhere else. And the events that kind of lead to that are pretty, pretty awesome. But it does start to get a little tunnel-y. And that was the thing that everybody complained about with Final Fantasy 13.

386
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:49,000
See, I kind of don't mind that because everything is still varied and different and I don't know. But I like it. So, that's me. Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster in chat says, I'm not a fan of the spell system in Final Fantasy 15. My inner Vivi isn't happy.

387
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes, totally agree. Like, I think that's what, that's what kind of ruins the Final Fantasy vibe for me is that the spell system is, it just, it doesn't, it doesn't connect like the other Final Fantasy games. This is weird.

388
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Dungeonbuster also continues and says, the battle system can be a lot of fun, especially when link attacks kick in with massive crit bonuses. But Final Fantasy 15 feels really rough to me. Not the best Final Fantasy I've played so far.

389
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah, you know what? The game crashed on me today in Chapter 11. There's a pretty graphics-intensive sequence in Chapter 11. And the game crashed on me during that sequence. And I was like, fucking gaming in 2016. Like, what the fuck? Like, this is some bosses missing on level 30 shit.

390
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Luckily the game, the game auto-saves, so I only lost maybe five minutes of gaming time and I went, and I just played through that point again and I got through it fine. But that was a little irritating to say the least.

391
00:39:43,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I do think though that as much as I'm enjoying this game, if I do have to compare it to the other Final Fantasy games, which is still a weird thing for me to do, it's not going to be my favorite either. It's going to be very, very, very difficult to top Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy XIV's expansion.

392
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:28,000
VI is what I'm talking about, like the mix of the technology and the magic and stuff. That was, I think, was a perfect balance. And even that battle system, I don't see anything wrong with that battle system at all. And just modernize everything. Make it more modern-looking, make it 3D. But keep it like that. What's wrong with that? That's perfectly fine.

393
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But I would say it's better than VIII. Bring on the hate mail. Bring it on. It's better than VIII.

394
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
VIII was fine until the third disc. It was nothing but repetitive bullshit.

395
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And if you don't want to argue about, because I know Final Fantasy VIII is a polarizing one for people, it's better than Final Fantasy II, NES Final Fantasy II, which I think is one of the worst Final Fantasy games in the franchise. Like, out of all the games, I think Final Fantasy II is one of the worst.

396
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What, the NES one?

397
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah, the NES II.

398
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay.

399
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yeah, no, god no. No, Super Nintendo II, or IV, which I would call IV, is one of the top.

400
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
III was great.

401
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah, III is where a lot of the future games kind of draw its inspiration, really.

402
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
III gave us the job system.

403
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah. But I made a list some time ago about where I'd rank them all, and I think VIII was in last. No, well, XIV 1.0 was in last place, then VIII, then II, and then I think I, which I don't dislike Final Fantasy I.

404
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But XV is probably somewhere in that mid-lower tier. I would still put stuff like X, XIV's expansion, VI, IV. I would still put those games above XV.

405
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But anyway, let's see, looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says, still waiting for that 6-2, Square Enix.

406
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And JD follows up, oh man, if any game deserves a huge expanded universe, it is 6. Totally agreed.

407
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah, but C4 got that, and it was extremely mediocre. The after years, remember that? It was on the WiiWare.

408
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It was cool to play something new that was totally in Final Fantasy IV's engine, but at the same time, the game itself is extremely mediocre.

409
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So, I don't know if I would want them to do that to VI. Dungeon Buster points out the XII Zodiac remake is coming up too. I can't wait. I'm really excited for XII Zodiac remake.

410
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
We'll get a VI remake someday.

411
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Technically we did, because the phone games are a remake, because they went back and redid all the art, but it's...

412
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Did they do VI in the phone games?

413
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah, they did VI and they redid all the art and all that, and it's not good. It's just not good. So VI needs a proper remake.

414
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:52,000
See, I like the phone games when they just up, you know, like they did the II, or was it II, no, Final Fantasy I. They redid that, remember that? It was just kinda like 16-bit looking graphics or something like that. That was cool.

415
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:04,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, no love for Final Fantasy V, which is still my favorite Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy V is an interesting one, because V, I think the story in V is just really...

416
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I think it's one of the weakest stories in the entire franchise. I'm sorry, and I know people love the characters, and I know Ferris is cool and all that.

417
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I just think V is one of the weakest stories in the entire franchise, but the battle system and the job system is an insane amount of fun, and it's one of the better battle systems in the entire franchise.

418
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So it walks this weird line between, it's a lot of fun to play, but the story's just really not interesting.

419
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Compared to the game that followed it and the game that was before it, it just falls in this really weird place for me.

420
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But that's my personal opinion, and you know what? Obviously, opinions, we all got them.

421
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And XV is apparently going to be no different. XV is the new VIII. It's just what it is, apparently.

422
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Alright, we gotta move on with some other gaming news, though. First off, I want to do some quick housekeeping and announcements.

423
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So, here's the deal. We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can also follow us on Google Plus, google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

424
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We're on Facebook as well, facebook.com slash orange launch radio.

425
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Holidays, you guys have been wondering what's going to happen during the holiday.

426
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So, on Christmas Day, December 25th, we will be here. Dark Soccer and I will be holding down the fort with a special Christmas edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

427
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And, I don't know, what will we do?

428
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It'll be a first day of Hanukkah Orange Lounge Radio. No, a second day of Hanukkah Orange Lounge Radio.

429
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Whose nuts will you roast on an open fire?

430
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'll bring my menorah.

431
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Okay.

432
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We can light the menorah.

433
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
We can do the nut roasting.

434
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
She will roast nuts with a menorah, yes.

435
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Will you make latkes?

436
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I suppose I can make latkes.

437
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
There we go.

438
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But, I thought that we normally do like...

439
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
We do. We do. We just have to do like...

440
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We should just get takeout.

441
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Yeah, we'll get takeout. If we can find what's open.

442
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
We like to get Chinese food.

443
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Panda!

444
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Was Panda going to be open on Christmas?

445
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I don't know. We got full one year.

446
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I know. Figure that out. It'll be like a Christmas story.

447
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And then we went to Denny's one year.

448
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Bleh. That was a mistake.

449
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You had those red velvet pancake pops.

450
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It was like red food coloring in generic pancake pops.

451
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Anyway, we will be here on December 25th.

452
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
We will have a show on January 1st, but it may be recorded in advance.

453
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But there will be something that week.

454
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It may just not be live.

455
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We're still working the details out on that.

456
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We will not be here at all January 8th, which I know is weird.

457
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And that's going to be the first week back for a lot of your favorite podcasts who are taking the holidays off.

458
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
However, MAGFest is that weekend.

459
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And so I will be coming back from Washington, D.C. at the time that OLR would normally be on.

460
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So we won't be here January 8th.

461
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So we do the holidays late around here, all right?

462
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So you'll just have to deal with a delayed schedule there.

463
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But we will be here on Christmas night.

464
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And the good news is that even if you have other things to do, well, that's why this is a podcast.

465
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And you can download it whenever you want.

466
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And you can subscribe wherever you find podcasts.

467
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Whether that be iTunes Store, whether that be Google Play Store, whether that be TuneIn or another third-party app, you can catch up on OLR.

468
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Whenever you want through the podcast feed.

469
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And I know a lot of you do listen on the podcast feed.

470
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So hello and thanks for being here.

471
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Send us an email sometime.

472
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Let's see.

473
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell reminding us that he will be here, too.

474
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So we're going to have a very full night.

475
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It's a VOG holiday present on December 25th.

476
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And SHO 100 Matt says, hopefully the weather is good for MAGFest.

477
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, that is the thing I fear the most, honestly, is the fucking weather when I go out to D.C.

478
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And I just, look, my California ass can't handle a blizzard.

479
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So just please do whatever.

480
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Cross your fingers and whatever deities you believe in.

481
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Just make it a smooth trip for me, please.

482
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
All right.

483
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Let's get into some gaming news, however.

484
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I was expecting this to be a completely dead week for news.

485
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
However, there's still a lot going on this week, right, Logie?

486
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yeah.

487
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So there's apparently a new law that has just passed in China that will be going to affect May 1st.

488
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And what that's going to do is actually govern loot boxes or those random crate drops that you get in some games,

489
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
which they're classifying them as almost a form of gambling.

490
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So publishers will be required to give players information about them,

491
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
including the draw, quantity, content, names and properties.

492
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Also the percentage chance that you have of actually getting the blind box item.

493
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So basically the, you know, percentage to win or something like that.

494
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think that's a good thing.

495
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And yeah, they are basically gambling.

496
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I mean, the whole CSGO stuff is for this shit.

497
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So, I mean, that was actually a little bit different.

498
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
But still though, I mean, I don't like this trend of paying for a full game, you know, like Overwatch and then having this shit on top of it.

499
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah, I have to admit, I also kind of like the idea about companies having to be transparent about what the odds really are for some of the items.

500
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And, you know, I have done loot boxes.

501
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I've done them in games like Mass Effect, which was the first one, Mass Effect 3 specifically,

502
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
which is the first game that I remember doing this that had loot boxes.

503
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But obviously Overwatch has this as well.

504
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You know, and I get that it's all cosmetic.

505
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Everything that comes out of these things is cosmetic and nothing really impacts the game itself.

506
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But I do, in Mass Effect 3, you can't really say the same thing because you had the guns and you had the other characters that were locked in there.

507
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And it always starts off as cosmetic and there's a lot of things like Call of Duty used to do that as well.

508
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But then eventually that's not enough and then it goes beyond that.

509
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But in Mass Effect 3, you could earn the in-game currency pretty fast to get the loot boxes yourself.

510
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So I just kind of looked at it as an experience.

511
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I never bought a loot box in Mass Effect 3, never did.

512
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And I still got all the characters I wanted and everything I needed.

513
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So, you know, if the system is going to only be in-game currency, then fine.

514
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I don't think they need to be in-game.

515
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Who cares about that?

516
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah, who cares? They can keep the loot to themselves if they want.

517
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But I have to admit, maybe you guys can help me out and chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

518
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:29,000
But I don't see the bad thing about companies having to be transparent with what is the percentage that I will get Sombra's taunt that I really want.

519
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Or D.Va's thing where she plays the video games and eats Cheetos emote.

520
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
What is really the percentage chance of that?

521
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And where's the accountability on the company because they are taking money?

522
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Where's the accountability on them to ensure that things are actually dropping at that rate and that they're not making it up?

523
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Now the one drawback I could see is that maybe the government doesn't need to oversee that.

524
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And I can totally see that perspective as well as that maybe we don't need that oversight.

525
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But I can kind of see the perspective that this is getting into gambling a little bit.

526
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And maybe not necessarily the same way we oversee slot machines in Reno and Vegas.

527
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
But maybe a similar arm of that does need to take some of this into consideration.

528
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's sort of like a lottery ticket. I mean, you're basically picking for a random outcome.

529
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And I honestly don't think they should be doing the whole loot craze.

530
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm fine with in-game currency, but if they have skins and stuff for sale, which I guess they can do that.

531
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Just offer, okay, here's the skins for this character. Here's the price point for it.

532
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And then allow them to choose that way instead of, oh man, I really want that taunt. Let me buy some loot crates.

533
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Ah crap, I got a whole bunch of repeats of shit I already have, which are completely fucking useless.

534
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Or I can sell it back for some low amount of currency.

535
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well yeah, you do get the gold or whatever, and then the gold ultimately you can buy whatever you want.

536
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So it's like if you are trying to save up for that particular taunt and you just keep not getting it,

537
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
eventually you're going to get enough gold where you can buy it.

538
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But yeah, I'm also kind of with Brad from Pod Culture in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

539
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
who says that's the one flipping drawback of Overwatch that annoys me.

540
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Overwatch takes a long time to get the loot boxes for free. It really does.

541
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Not in the beginning, not in the first few levels, but later on, yeah.

542
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Maybe it's just because I also kind of more casually play Overwatch. I don't play a ton of it.

543
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I think the people that play a ton of it probably don't have a problem getting what they want in-game.

544
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But god, I just, yeah, I'm not, I don't feel like you get enough loot boxes really in the game.

545
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
But what's interesting is that now that this is going to be a law in China, what next year is the implementation or whatever?

546
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
May next year.

547
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So if Blizzard wants to have Overwatch in China, they're going to have to publish these numbers.

548
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And do you think the US won't find them?

549
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So those numbers are going to be out there. Now, granted, they could change it up.

550
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
China could have different drop rates from the US.

551
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But I think Blizzard would have to be a little more transparent with that.

552
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And I keep picking on Blizzard. That's just because that's the game I play right now that does this as Overwatch.

553
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But there's a lot of games that do this.

554
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
There's some that are even worse, especially when you get into the mobile space.

555
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah, the mobile space, yeah.

556
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You can buy $25 worth of in-game currency and you unlock absolutely jack shit with that.

557
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It's ridiculous. I watched there was an Angry Joe video that they had where he was playing a DC type of game.

558
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It was some DC beat-em-up game.

559
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And to unlock the characters, you had to get these cards and stuff.

560
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And it took 25 cards per character to actually unlock them.

561
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So he bought $25 worth of in-game currency and bought the chests with that.

562
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And he got literally no characters unlocked with all that shit.

563
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It would have taken more, like $50 at least, to unlock something.

564
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Which is fucking stupid.

565
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But that's mobile for you.

566
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I mean, it's just a mess.

567
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But that's kind of where it can go.

568
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And unfortunately, console games, whereas they have an upfront price point to them, it's starting to head in that direction.

569
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah.

570
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Kaijuto in chat says,

571
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
How is this Overwatch or Rocket League not free-to-play games when they have this loot system?

572
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You know, it's not that I always agree with it.

573
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But just to present the other perspective, with Overwatch, you don't need any of it.

574
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You can be a world-class Overwatch champion.

575
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You can be the best Overwatch player in the world with none of the loot stuff.

576
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:37,000
All of it is just taunts, art, cosmetic stuff that ultimately the actual game itself doesn't really have an impact on.

577
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And to be honest, most of it is ridiculous.

578
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And I think that's why I don't even bother to buy the loot boxes, really.

579
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's because I don't really need any of it that bad.

580
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Like, none of the items I get in there are going to make me any better at Overwatch.

581
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I'm already pretty bad, you know?

582
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So that's, I don't know.

583
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I guess that's the other side of it, is that it ultimately doesn't impact the game.

584
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Also, Overwatch is starting to come down in price.

585
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Like, you know, Black Friday was like 35 bucks for Overwatch.

586
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And I think Overwatch is not really going to be a $60 game much longer.

587
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And I'm kind of curious what the long-term game looks like for Overwatch.

588
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Because it hasn't even been out a year.

589
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So what's going to happen next for Overwatch?

590
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
How are they going to keep that money coming in?

591
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Is it just, are they going to rely completely on the loot boxes thing?

592
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Or is there going to be something else in the future?

593
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't know.

594
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Let's see.

595
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Let's move on.

596
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I want to talk about some other news because we have plenty of stuff to talk about as well.

597
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I've already pretty much talked about this in the intro.

598
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But just to bring it up officially here.

599
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
The Nintendo Switch was officially unveiled this week beyond just the trailer.

600
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It was actually brought to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

601
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I almost said Jimmy Kimmel.

602
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I always get their names mixed up even though I know they're different people.

603
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But it went to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

604
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And they were doing a Super Mario Run preview.

605
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But Reggie Fils-Aime did the whole,

606
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Oh but I have one more thing because you're such a big fan.

607
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And right there under a question mark block there it was an actual Nintendo Switch.

608
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And Jimmy Fallon did the dorky little Jimmy Fallon thing.

609
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Where he pretended to fanboy over it and all this other stuff.

610
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Which I don't doubt that he is legit a Nintendo fan.

611
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But the whole thing did feel very calculated and scripted.

612
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Like you know he knew what was under that question mark block.

613
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Which is fine.

614
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Honestly that's kind of his excited look.

615
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
He kind of reacts that way a lot of the times.

616
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Like kind of overreacts I guess.

617
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yeah he does. He does.

618
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But that's part of being a business person.

619
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Which even yes late night talk shows are a business.

620
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But anyway that's fine.

621
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm not really shading him too bad.

622
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Because at least we got to see the Switch on TV.

623
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And a lot of people doing heavy analysis of freeze frames of this device.

624
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Did you catch that whole thing about there's a European trademark symbol on the back.

625
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So either the device was a European device or this is confirmation that the thing is region free.

626
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Like people are like going all out on their analysis of this thing.

627
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So but the good news is we're only a few weeks away from the official Nintendo unveil.

628
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Where supposedly we get all the details.

629
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I'm just going to reiterate what I said last week about Breath of the Wild.

630
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The more I see of it the less interested in it I am.

631
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And here's why.

632
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And it's because that first time that they were showing it off at E3.

633
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's like wow this is so amazing.

634
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And they keep showing the same shit over and over.

635
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It's like okay I get it.

636
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
There's nothing new that they're showing me that's really wowing me.

637
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I hate to say it guys but I kind of agree with Loki on this one.

638
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Because in the beginning I really was feeling like oh this Breath of the Wild is going to be completely new and different.

639
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And influenced by these other games.

640
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And then to see it in motion you're like oh okay.

641
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's like I've almost seen like all of the entire game already.

642
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yeah it's kind of like oh okay yeah I know this formula.

643
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Not to say it's going to be a terrible game.

644
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Zelda games it's a good formula.

645
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Maybe they don't need to rock the boat too much.

646
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So I don't know I'll still buy it I'll play it.

647
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Of course I will.

648
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But anyway so yeah you got to see the Switch.

649
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And they did the whole thing where they actually popped the device out.

650
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So they actually kind of showed that in motion.

651
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And you could see the time to transition between the two devices.

652
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It wasn't instant because Reggie Fils-Aime did buy a little time when he pulled it out.

653
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And he kind of talked for a minute and then handed it to Jimmy.

654
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So there is definitely a 20 second transition.

655
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I still don't think that they actually have that working yet on that demo.

656
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I think there was two separate feeds and they had one.

657
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Really?

658
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I don't think it's the same thing because I don't know.

659
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It just didn't seem like that was the case.

660
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I think they had two separate things of the game running or something.

661
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But we get the idea though at least.

662
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Well and then in the rumors and potentials department.

663
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:04,000
There is a rumor that was going around this week that From Software has Dark Souls 3 running on the Switch.

664
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Not to say that they are going to sell Dark Souls 3 on the Switch.

665
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
But that From Software has that going on there.

666
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And apparently From Software is currently mulling over do we release the entire Dark Souls trilogy on the Nintendo Switch.

667
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Including the DLC as some type of trilogy collection which I imagine...

668
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Dark Souls trilogy praises edition.

669
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
There you go.

670
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Something like that.

671
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But you know I could see that something like that they could release on the Switch at the same time.

672
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
As they do on the Xbox One, the Playstation 4, the PC and all that stuff.

673
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So I guess that's cool.

674
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But I have to admit my gut reaction to those of you that follow me on Twitter.

675
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,000
No my gut reaction to this was don't go down this path.

676
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Because I'm getting nervous.

677
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Because the games that we're seeing are Skyrim, Dark Souls 3.

678
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh granted we haven't seen Dark Souls 3.

679
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But still this is where my mind is going.

680
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I can't help it when I see these rumors.

681
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It's last generation shit on the Switch.

682
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Stop it.

683
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
That's how third parties fucked up the Wii U launch.

684
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Don't do it.

685
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It's got to be new stuff.

686
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Or at least if nothing else, stuff you release on the Switch at the same time you release on the other consoles.

687
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
So at least everybody has a fighting chance.

688
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
But if you released last year's shit on the Switch, it's going to be shot in the foot from the beginning.

689
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Please don't do this third parties.

690
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Don't do this.

691
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'd still buy Skyrim on the Switch.

692
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Alright well...

693
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It's an older game but I'm getting a lot of use out of it.

694
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And I own several versions of the game.

695
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
So it's just...

696
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I don't know.

697
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
For example, I played more Skyrim.

698
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
This is so weird to me that the few things you're going to throw a bone at Nintendo for and give them credit for are the one things where I'm like...

699
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
No!

700
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
No, hold on.

701
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I'm in agreement with you.

702
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That's kind of what botched the whole launch lineup with the Wii U.

703
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Because they're like Batman Arkham Asylum or Arkham City or whatever it was.

704
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Well that game came out last year.

705
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That is like a launch title.

706
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't have a problem with them throwing Dark Souls on there.

707
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
But as long as that's not the only thing that they're launching with is old stuff.

708
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Let's see some new stuff as well.

709
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And yeah, you can always go ahead and throw out those trilogies and stuff later on to port those older games over.

710
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But just don't heavily rely on that.

711
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Okay, and ActEftInChat continues on to say...

712
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But at the same time, Dark Souls on the go?

713
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I don't think that's bad.

714
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I understand that and I understand this whole enthusiasm about Skyrim being on the go and everything as well.

715
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But I don't know. Maybe this is because I don't commute on a subway.

716
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Or I don't sit down with nothing else to do for long periods of time during the day.

717
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So maybe my perspective is just a little different.

718
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But I just think Dark Souls would be fucking horrible to play on a portable device.

719
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Because a game like that is so hard and so challenging.

720
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It kind of commands a lot of precision and a lot of attention that I'm not sure I can get on a portable device.

721
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Is that weird?

722
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yes?

723
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Okay!

724
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I don't know.

725
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I kind of feel like, especially if you're in a subway that's bouncing all around and moving all around you.

726
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Well yeah, it's like a subway train would be a little bit difficult.

727
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Or in a plane. I do a lot of portable gaming when I'm on the plane.

728
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But I'll play Dragon Quest VII. That's okay if that bounces around a little bit or I have a hard time hearing something.

729
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Because of the plane engine or something.

730
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I just don't think Dark Souls would...

731
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I mean, I know the concept sounds awesome.

732
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Like, yes, PlayStation 3 and 4 games. I can take Wibby on the go.

733
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That concept sounds awesome.

734
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
But then in execution, I just think those games would really not be fun on portable.

735
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

736
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We need to know.

737
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I don't know.

738
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
That is just my opinion.

739
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
If enough of you disagree with me, then go by and support the game and prove me wrong.

740
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I mean, you can go and pre-order that shit, but good luck getting it.

741
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And JD points out, yeah, if you have two hours a day to kill on a train, it definitely changes your perspective.

742
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And I can respect that.

743
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But again, I just feel like Dark Souls would not be the game to play.

744
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Pokemon is great.

745
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
That's why those games do so well.

746
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But not every game works the same portable as it does on the TV.

747
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I don't know.

748
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Alright.

749
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Well, we'll see.

750
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Again, those are just rumors of Dark Souls 3, so we'll see what happens January 12th.

751
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It's going to be a big day.

752
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Moving on.

753
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Dark Sakura.

754
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Well, we have some news, as I alluded to earlier, about Ubisoft.

755
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Oh, when will people learn about insider trading?

756
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So they have been fined, or will be fined, by the AMF, which is, I'm going to mispronounce this,

757
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Autorte de Moche Financier, basically the finance commission in France, for being accused of insider trading,

758
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
where they offloaded some of their shares of Ubisoft.

759
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Before the publisher announced the delays that made their stock drop by 25%.

760
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:36,000
However, they have sent direct messages to certain publishers saying that while they acknowledged the AMF's decision,

761
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:43,000
they still assert that they acted in good faith and have appealed the decision.

762
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So they're hoping that it gets overturned, but it's pretty, at the very least, quite a coincidence,

763
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
that they would sell their shares just prior to this happening.

764
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And I believe that it's five different executives that are being held accountable for this.

765
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So there you go.

766
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Don't cheat.

767
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Don't cheat.

768
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah, it's a tough one for them to prove, because, you know, executives, wouldn't you think they're going to know

769
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
when a game's going to be delayed?

770
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
That's not something you wake up in the morning, roll out of bed, and go,

771
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I think a game's going to get delayed today.

772
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Well, depending on how quickly they sold their stock before that happened,

773
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,000
it would have had to have been that they sold their stock very quickly before that delay happened

774
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and would have anticipated that the delay would also cause the stock to drop that drastically.

775
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Because a 25% drop in value is pretty big.

776
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So, just saying.

777
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Let's see, DungeonBuster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

778
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,000
instead of insider trading, maybe they should figure out how to allocate funds to properly test their PC releases.

779
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Going to need some salve for that burn.

780
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Maybe they knew how it was running. I don't know.

781
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I think they had to have done something.

782
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But then again, I will point out that.

783
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Because this all dates back to stuff in 2013, right?

784
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
This isn't like insider trading alleged that happened like yesterday.

785
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
This is something that happened years ago that's been investigated and now they've been fined.

786
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I guess, alleging guilt from this organization is giving, what would you say?

787
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Basically saying that they're guilty.

788
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The Ubisoft Montreal CEO was fined 700,000 euros.

789
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And everyone else between, well the smallest was 15,000 euros and then we had 100 and then 200.

790
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So a total, approximately in American money, about 1.28 million dollars.

791
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So, it's quite a bit of money spread across 5 people.

792
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I mean, even for the one who had to pay the least, that's roughly.

793
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I'd give approximately an average year's salary on the low end, middle class wage.

794
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So, of course, if there are executives, they probably can afford it easy.

795
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Though I do tend to see a trend that the higher up that you get on the corporate ladder, the less touch you have with the way people are working.

796
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And so, if the delay was impending, they might not have found out about it until the memo made it to them.

797
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So, take that as you will.

798
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Loki, you have somewhat of a follow up to this, right?

799
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Yeah, in regards to Ubisoft as well.

800
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,000
As you may remember, Vivendi is purchasing shares of the company.

801
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So, right now, with their last acquisition, they own 25.15% of the company and almost 23% of its voting rights.

802
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Apparently, though, they are saying that Vivendi's been discussing their objectives for the next six months.

803
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:37,000
They're not considering to acquire shares, depending on the market conditions, but not considering the launch of public tender on Ubisoft, nor acquiring the control of the company.

804
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:49,000
However, though, it says a recommission of Ubisoft board directors in order to, and among other things, obtain the board representation consistent with its shareholder position.

805
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
They're going to be seeking that.

806
01:07:51,000 --> 01:08:03,000
However, though, according to French law, though, they will need to submit a bid for an actual takeover bid if they reach 30% of ownership in the company.

807
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yes, it looks like Vivendi wants to own a video game company very badly again.

808
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It says that they don't, though, so I don't know. Maybe they just want...

809
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Actions speak louder than words.

810
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
We'll see, I mean, I don't know.

811
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Well, and then this whole thing, that Jamie just talked about, seems quite the setback. Like, it just primes them in ready for something like this, you know?

812
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Maybe.

813
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I don't know. We'll see, we'll see.

814
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Capcom, which, you know, has been in the news recently at the PlayStation Experience.

815
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You know, they have the whole unveil of a new Marvel vs. Capcom game, which, by the way, Dark Soccer, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, because I know you are a big fan of fighting games and Capcom games and all that.

816
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
What did you think of the Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite reveal?

817
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm still reserving judgement.

818
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
That's fair. Obviously, you don't want to just base the whole thing off four characters, but did it get you hyped?

819
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Because I'd written off that we'd ever get another one, to be honest.

820
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I had some Doki Doki moments.

821
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Alright, fair enough.

822
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Well, we have six characters, remember.

823
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh, right, right, right. I forgot about the two that came later. I'm thinking about the four in the trailer. Anyway.

824
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And remember, it's Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, and there's going to be infinite DLC Loki, so we're going to have an infinite number of characters.

825
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
If they run out, they'll just come up with new ones.

826
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Alright, anyway. But Capcom has also talked about in a press release that they're looking to revive some franchises that have been forgotten.

827
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Let's see, as part of the press release, it said, quote,

828
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:42,000
In addition to regular major title releases each fiscal year, Capcom is currently focused on reviving series that have not had new entries recently or otherwise dormant IP,

829
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
beginning with Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, a return for the series following a five-year hiatus.

830
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Capcom looks to enhance its corporate value even further by utilizing its library of rich contents.

831
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Which, I don't know, I think most of us would look at this and go, how about fucking Mega Man?

832
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Right? It's like, would you like to enrich your company more? Freaking give back, give the people what they want.

833
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
How about fucking Mega Man? I don't care if it's Mega Man Legends. I'll take a fucking Mega Man X game at this point.

834
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Yeah, I don't want to take these proposed redesign of Mega Man that was supposed to be that Bomberman X-Zero type Mega Man game.

835
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Yeah, I don't want that one. But I'll take the other ones.

836
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And don't make it suck. Because, my God, if the creator of Mega Man... Like, I watched a documentary on that.

837
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Like, they had a fan documentary thing about the whole Mighty No. 9 bullshit.

838
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Oh, did they? Oh, I got to check it out.

839
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Is that on Steam?

840
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:46,000
It's on YouTube. It's like a 45-minute long thing that they talk about what happened with all the, like, just the whole drama from beginning to end.

841
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Interesting.

842
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's interesting. It's like, how could they have fucked that up so bad? But seriously, how could they have fucked that up so bad?

843
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Just make a good game if you're going to do that.

844
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Brad from Pod Culture in chat suggests, Mega Man Run?

845
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
No.

846
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I'll take it. I will take it at this point.

847
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
What about... I'm sure Dark Soccer has got to be sitting there going, Rival Schools?

848
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Right? Oh, my God. I would love... Or at least I would like some of the Rival Schools characters to show up in at least some of the other ones, you know.

849
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I'm trying to...

850
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:36,000
What dormant Capcom... I mean, it was suggested to us behind the scenes that this would make a great List List segment.

851
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But I don't... I don't know. You need, like, 18 different options for a List List. I'm not sure I could come up with that many.

852
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I'll take another Bionic Commando.

853
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Like, we'll just forget the last one happened?

854
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Rearmed was fine.

855
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah, that's true. Rearmed was fine.

856
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,000
The 3D one was kind of stupid, but, you know, it had potential, like, on paper and, like, in the trailers.

857
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It was like, wow, this is going to be fucking amazing, but, like, then it just didn't quite come together.

858
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But I'd be willing to have them try again.

859
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I'll take UN Squadron. How about that?

860
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

861
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Take a new UN Squadron game.

862
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Captain Commando.

863
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Hell yes.

864
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Or if we want to get more obscure, we can do, like, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.

865
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
You know, just all the beat-em-up.

866
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
How about Final Fight?

867
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Bring back Three Wonders.

868
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Power Stone.

869
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Fucking Power Stone.

870
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Hell yes.

871
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Powerful.

872
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I wouldn't mind, though, a follow-up to Three Wonders.

873
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Dark Tetsuya says, UN Squadron was a licensed game based off the anime or manga area 88.

874
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Oh.

875
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
See, 12-year-old me didn't understand all that.

876
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I just rented a game called UN Squadron once and thought it was badass.

877
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
So, I guess I don't get that.

878
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And, that's what you wanted to know. Matt says, Power Stone discussion over.

879
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
No, because Mega Man is first. I'm sorry.

880
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Yes, Mega Man needs to come before Power Stone.

881
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
This is long overdue.

882
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Act F says, Gotcha Force. Shut up.

883
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Dungeon Buster says, New Magic Sword.

884
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Ooh, fuck. Maybe we could come up with 18 games, because we need to talk about Magic Sword.

885
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And how fucking underrated that game is.

886
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Oh, god, that was such a good series.

887
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Well, series of one game.

888
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Let's see. Act Def wants to point out, Dark Soccer, there's rumors of a rival school's character appearing in Street Fighter V Season 2.

889
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
That's a character.

890
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
That's one lousy character.

891
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
What about bringing Dark Soccer's back? Didn't they do a Dark Soccer's 3?

892
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
They were teasing at one point that Dark Soccer's was supposed to come back.

893
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Well, there was a Dark Soccer's 3. It was Vampire Savior.

894
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah. No, beyond that.

895
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:41,000
They were teasing a 4, but I don't know if they actually said it got cancelled, but something caused Dark Stalkers 4 to get pushed back.

896
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I think it was the sales of Dark Stalkers 1 and 2 on 360.

897
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I think there was something, I remember we talked about it a long time ago, but it was something about the 360 reinventions of Dark Stalkers the first game did not do well.

898
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And that kind of shot plans for another Dark Stalkers game in the foot.

899
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:06,000
But, anyway. Alright, we could talk about this Capcom reviving thing all night long.

900
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
But, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see if they actually do it or not.

901
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Dark Soccer in the meantime.

902
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Well, do we remember Majesco?

903
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yes.

904
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Do you remember what they've more recently been known for was Gone Home? Which is pretty good.

905
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Did they publish that?

906
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And they did, yeah.

907
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I think they published, like, a version of it.

908
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
The console versions.

909
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Yeah, not the PC original.

910
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And A Boy and His Blob.

911
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Well, they have been acquired, actually. They're not really disappearing, but they're being merged into PolarityTE, which is a biotech company.

912
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
They do regenerative tissue tech.

913
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
That's weird. That's very weird.

914
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:01,000
In fact, PolarityTE will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Majesco, but Majesco's dropping its name and operating under PolarityTE.

915
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And they are bowing out of the entertainment business.

916
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And we know that Majesco's had some definite financial problems.

917
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:28,000
The last founder of the company left in 2015, and their new leader was more of a gold mining and energy person before going into games.

918
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So they pretty much dropped all of the entertainment, except for one recent tweet about ABC's BattleBots.

919
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Whatever.

920
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
But they are going fully into medical tech.

921
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Bye!

922
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Do you know what by far the most important- I mean, Majesco's published a lot of games, but do you know which one by far is the most important contribution they've given to gaming?

923
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Cooking Mama.

924
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yes.

925
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So, this effectively means that the Mama series is done.

926
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
No, they're just- you were talking about regenerative tissue. Mama's now gonna fix that.

927
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
No, Mama's gonna fix it. Don't worry.

928
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Damn it, Loki. I was trying to set up for that joke, and you just jumped in there with a punchline.

929
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:22,000
To be honest, I've been saying for years now, even back when I was at the distribution company I was at, they've been out of the gaming business for a while.

930
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I mean, they've been hardly publishing anything throughout the year.

931
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Are you kidding? They published Hello Kitty Party on the DS.

932
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So what?

933
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
How dare you.

934
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I wonder if they would sell those licenses.

935
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Like Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009 and 2010?

936
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Who gives a crap about that? I'm talking about Cooking Mama.

937
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Maybe they would sell the licenses-

938
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
This is a fitness ultimatum. You're either gonna be fit or not. I choose not.

939
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well, if you're going into tissue regeneration, then that means that you just hack off a few ounces of body fat, and then they'll just heal the skin. That's it.

940
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:10,000
SSG100Matt says, Mama's going into the home. Someone will be fixing Mama breakfast now. That's sad.

941
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, Wow, I guess Majesco never really recovered after Advent Rising. Remember Advent Rising?

942
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yes, that was, what, 2007?

943
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
That was a while ago. Wasn't that the whole million dollar Xbox game? That was that whole thing, right?

944
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
That was a pretty big Xbox game, yeah, I remember that.

945
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:34,000
That whole they were gonna give away a million dollars to whoever, I don't know, beat it or found some secret or something. Am I mixing that up with something else?

946
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I swear that was Advent Rising.

947
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
You can't beat that one, I don't remember.

948
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Alright.

949
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
That's it. It made such an impression on me.

950
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Alright, moving on, Loki. Maybe talk about some games that did make an impression on you.

951
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Well, this is kind of funny. Sony's talking about their mobile plans now, with what, their cancelled mobile, you know, gaming device, and their cancelled Sony mobile, what was it, Sony PlayStation mobile?

952
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah. So now they're talking mobile again, because now everybody's getting into it. Everybody's citing Pokemon Go.

953
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:13,000
My fucking god. Can we seriously stop using Pokemon Go as like the indicator that you should get in this marketplace?

954
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Because everybody fucking wants a piece of it.

955
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Do we not? Do we not remember fucking Angry Birds? Do we not remember Angry Birds where I was insanely successful and fucking everybody's like, oh, I'm gonna get in that market because they made it so they were so successful. How many people have actually succeeded?

956
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Well, the guy who did Flappy Bird did pretty well for himself.

957
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Yeah, and that was a fucking fluke. That was a fucking fluke.

958
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Talk about a game that got ripped off.

959
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I mean, Sony should be familiar with Angry Birds because they made the movie, or published the movie, so I guess.

960
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
But now they're going to be getting back into mobile with some of their first party titles that were on PlayStation platforms.

961
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So, for example, Hot Shots Golf is going to be one of the first games that's going to be coming out on iOS and Android.

962
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
They also have a game called No Heroes Allowed Dash.

963
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Ark the Lad and Wild Arms are going to be rebooted on those platforms as well.

964
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Also, Parappa the Rapper, Disgaea, and some other untitled games.

965
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:31,000
They've got a collaboration with Square Enix. They have an original IP from ForwardWorks called Sora to Emi no Aida.

966
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And some collectible card game called Project Field.

967
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
That would be, if it's T-O, that would be T-O.

968
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Man, if only Sony had their own portable platform they could release these types of things on.

969
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I know, I mean, really. It's really...

970
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Gosh, it's a shame nothing like that exists.

971
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah, unfortunately, you know, it just doesn't exist.

972
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:02,000
But to be fair, though, as much as I can sass that point, Nintendo has a 3DS, yet they're still putting Mario Run out, so, you know.

973
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Oh my god.

974
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
What?

975
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:13,000
No, I'm just looking at this picture of this thing that they have, you know, that card game that I was talking about.

976
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Getting the, you know, Eye of Judgment vibe from this.

977
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Oh, I thought you were going to say it reminded you of your own card game. I was going to be a little worried for you there.

978
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Oh, no, no, no. Fuck no, I'm not making a card game. No, it's giving me an Eye of Judgment vibe from this thing.

979
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Alright, well, moving on to another story about Final Fantasy XV.

980
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
You know, now some of the reception is out there. A lot of people played the game.

981
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And Square Enix talking about some of the changes that they're going to make with Final Fantasy XV.

982
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Hajime Tabata actually made a blog post this week on the Square Enix site talking about fan feedback to the game and what's going to happen to make the title better.

983
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And in the post, Tabata says,

984
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Our early plans are to enrich certain aspects of the game, adding gameplay enhancements for Chapter 13, buffing ring magic, etc.

985
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
We'll have the specifics of what and when for you at a later date.

986
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So, again, I'm actually playing Chapter 13 right now and it is, again, I'm really, really, really trying not to spoil.

987
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:25,000
But just like some things that you're used to as the game change and it seems like it might be like a temporary type of thing.

988
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And so it's a little bit, it's one of those things that I feel like it's lasting longer than it needs to.

989
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
That's the whole thing. Sometimes, like, the game gets flipped on its script for a little bit. It's temporary.

990
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
This feels like it's lasting a little longer than it needs to.

991
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Again, but for me, it doesn't ruin Chapters 1 through 12.

992
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
That's, I guess, the difference I'm having than what some other people are having. I don't know.

993
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Anyway, they're also saying, We're hoping to delve deeper into the story, adding scenes that will give you new insight to character motivations.

994
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Such as why Ravis walked the path he did.

995
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
We need a little time with these. They'll need to be localized and voiced in other languages.

996
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:10,000
For the long term, we're looking at making certain key characters playable and even considering the possibility of customizable avatars in addition to other features over time.

997
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Other features we have in mind is letting you carry over stats from a previous playthrough and adding in items that introduce new play styles.

998
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Such as low level runs and god mode.

999
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
We're also examining readability tweaks, increasing font size for certain languages.

1000
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:31,000
On top of that, we're looking at content you can enjoy in real time, including new bosses with exclusive rewards and achievements and limited time hunts.

1001
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I don't know how I feel about this.

1002
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
There's a lot about this I'm not liking.

1003
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Don't get me wrong. I'm cool with the fact that they want to add to the game and add this new stuff.

1004
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But when they talk about changing story elements, now the biggest thing I'm seeing on Twitter is,

1005
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Well, guess I better stop playing Final Fantasy 15 or guess I better not buy Final Fantasy 15 because they're gonna go and change the story.

1006
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And since apparently everybody hates the story, I'm gonna wait and go play through this when they fix it.

1007
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And I'm just sitting here going, okay, I guess I'm like the one guy who isn't understanding the big problem right now.

1008
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Like again, I think the game is fine.

1009
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Again, it's not the best Final Fantasy game, but it's definitely not the worst.

1010
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So, I don't know. I feel like that comment kind of shot themselves in the foot with that.

1011
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Like, well, there went the second and third week sales for Final Fantasy 15 because now people are gonna wait until there's a story patch to see what all has changed and all this stuff.

1012
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I mean, as far as the other stuff goes, like font sizes, new bosses with new achievements, limited time hunts, that all sounds fine.

1013
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
That's the type of, you know, continuing support for 15 I would have expected.

1014
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,000
But this is also just a weird, I don't know, this is just a weird place, this whole Final Fantasy game in a DLC era.

1015
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Like, I know, it didn't really happen with 13, 13-2 it did, but because of the way 13-2 was set up, I don't know, it just didn't, it's not as weird to me as something like this is.

1016
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm just, I don't know.

1017
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Loki, what do you think when you hear this? They want to patch the story. Isn't that weird?

1018
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
It's Mass Effect 3 all over again.

1019
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
But Mass Effect 3...

1020
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I know, they're clarifying the ending.

1021
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:45,000
It was also, it was the ending. And, I don't know, again, I kind of feel like, although I enjoyed Mass Effect 3's extended cut, and I appreciate that it exists, I did not, again, have the same hate boner for the way Mass Effect 3 ended originally that everybody else did.

1022
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I understood why people took issue with it, but I didn't think it was the worst ending to a video game I'd ever played.

1023
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And sometimes video games have bad endings. Sometimes movies have bad endings. Sometimes stories have endings you don't like.

1024
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And it's, you know, again, does that ruin the entire journey of getting there? I don't know, it doesn't always for me.

1025
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I don't know, I guess an ending, if an ending is really, really, really bad, then maybe. Like, didn't that ruin The Village? The M. Night Shyamalan movie for a lot of people?

1026
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
No, M. Night Shyamalan ruined The Village.

1027
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
The signs, no, the ending of signs.

1028
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:27,000
The ending of signs I thought was fine. It was stupid, but, you know, I chalked that up as like, oh, haha, it's War of the Worlds.

1029
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I just thought that it was just kind of a take, sort of like on that, where it's like, oh, yeah, I mean, granted, you can poke a million holes through that whole movie.

1030
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
The Mist. They changed the ending from the book.

1031
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Yeah, no, I'm aware of-

1032
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And it ruined the whole movie.

1033
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Yeah. But didn't Stephen King say he actually kind of liked it?

1034
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Yes, which is stupid. The whole movie was great until the end, and I can never watch that again.

1035
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Yeah, no, again, even though it's a ten year old movie, I don't necessarily want to ruin it for people, but I understand the controversy behind that whole change, for sure.

1036
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:13,000
For those that don't know, it's a real downer ending. Let's just leave it at that. It's a bit of a downer.

1037
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Keep in mind, I like The Grudge.

1038
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Yeah.

1039
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,000
ActDeftInChat says, do we need director's cut of video games now? The end was fine for me, but I will.

1040
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I'm fine with them doing a director's cut thing, because they did that with the other Final Fantasy games, where they re-released them later on with the international versions, if you will, where they tweak stuff and add bosses and all that fun stuff. That's cool.

1041
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm fine with that. But, like, don't change the story. You can add to the story. If you want to add stuff that adds more clarification to the story, that's cool, but you can't just change the story.

1042
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I also, okay, like...

1043
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
That's like saying, oh hey, we patched Final Fantasy VII. Eret's not dead, just kidding, it was just a flesh wound.

1044
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Oh my god, if Final Fantasy VII had existed in the age of the internet, which, the internet's infancy was happening with Final Fantasy VII.

1045
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
We still don't have the remake coming. There's still time.

1046
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Anyway, um, but I just...

1047
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
As long as the bitch still dies.

1048
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Bring her back, bring her back.

1049
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
She's alive again! And he kills her again. Ah, she's dead again.

1050
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Eret, Eret's Resurrection DLC, just $9.99.

1051
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Oh my god, they killed Eret, you bastards!

1052
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Maybe, would that be DLC you would buy Dark Sakura, where you could just kill her over and over again? Like, it's just, you know, different ways to see her die.

1053
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Once is satisfying.

1054
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
When was it? Okay, let's...

1055
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I want there to be blood this time.

1056
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Now that we're like, now that we're kind of going back here, okay...

1057
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:46,000
The fuck is a Phoenix down for if you can't fucking resurrect the bitch? I mean, like, I mean, seriously, like, well, this time she's completely dead.

1058
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
But wait a second, all these other times you've died, we've been able to resurrect you just fine.

1059
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Yeah, but, eh, this time...

1060
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
You're not reading what it says. In Final Fantasy you get KO'd.

1061
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
You don't die, you get KO'd.

1062
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Killed off, yes, I got it.

1063
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And when your entire party gets KO'd, that's when you lose the battle.

1064
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
That's when you get eaten by the monsters.

1065
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And Phoenix down removes the KO status.

1066
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
That's, that's what it, that's the technicality they get you on.

1067
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Okay.

1068
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Jeez.

1069
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Alright, anyway, uh, let's move on. I, I do feel the need, I really feel the need, like, I need to finish 15. I need to see what this...

1070
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I guess I'll play more of it.

1071
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I need to see what this clusterfuck that's supposed to happen in Chapter 13, like, I need to see, like, what is ruining this game for me.

1072
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Like, the spoil, like, the first, like, five minutes of the game.

1073
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Okay, first five minutes I don't think is a spoiler.

1074
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Alright, it's maybe not first, like, first hour.

1075
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Um, like, you get to a point in the game where you have to go to a ferry, and then you get there, and the guys, the ferry's not there, because they closed the ferry thing down.

1076
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
And there's this reporter who's like,

1077
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yeah, I could get the ferry here, but I need you to go get me some gems.

1078
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It's like, what the fuck is this shit?

1079
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
It's like, why?

1080
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:07,000
It's like, I'm sorry, this train will come, but I need you to go into a cave and get me some gems.

1081
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
What?

1082
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Well, I'm not going to try to explain side quests.

1083
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:17,000
But as far as the main story goes, I do want to reiterate this, like, I don't, I didn't watch the movie still.

1084
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I still have not watched the movie, I still haven't watched the anime.

1085
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I feel like I understand well enough what's going on.

1086
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I understand this game better than I did 13.

1087
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
No one understood.

1088
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
No one fucking understood 13.

1089
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
No, I kind of tease a little bit, actually.

1090
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
13 starts to come together in about the 30th hour of the game.

1091
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
But, like, I'm not, I'm not feeling that with Final Fantasy 50.

1092
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
My other feedback to that, as far as, like, the story doesn't make any fucking sense, would go,

1093
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
what the fuck did you expect from the guy who made fucking Kingdom Hearts?

1094
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:55,000
What the fuck did you expect with a story that's suddenly going to make sense from the guy that made Kingdom Hearts?

1095
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:03,000
If you can understand Kingdom Hearts well enough to get through the game, you can understand Final Fantasy 15.

1096
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I don't understand Kingdom Hearts.

1097
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Like, I watch the trailers for it now, and I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on at all.

1098
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Where's Mickey? Okay, there's Mickey. I don't know what the hell's going on.

1099
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Alright. Well, you know what, we gotta, we gotta take a step back.

1100
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
We gotta travel back in time.

1101
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Back to when you couldn't patch the story in games.

1102
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
If you released a game and it sucked, oh well.

1103
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
You're fucked. That's, that's just all it is.

1104
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1105
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And Dark Sakura, she's back. No radio magic needed, but she could use a lozenge.

1106
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
No, I could use it going away all together.

1107
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Well, sorry to hear it, but at least you have a classic game of the week to entertain us all with this week.

1108
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Yes, I do.

1109
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And you didn't even realize that this classic game of the week kind of, kind of starts a theme going with what we had the last couple weeks of the show.

1110
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Well, it's the theme that's ending after today.

1111
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So, so Dark Sakura just came here to kill something off. That's what she did.

1112
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yes, I did.

1113
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week tonight?

1114
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I picked Pokemon Pinball, which is a pinball game in the Pokemon series.

1115
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It came out on Game Boy Color in Japan, April 14th, 1999, in North America, June 28th, 1999.

1116
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Your ball is a Pokeball, and all the objects on the table are clearly Pokemon based.

1117
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Um, so you just basically have to hit points and play the different little sub-games, you know, or hit the targets or do things a certain way.

1118
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:44,000
You also have a secondary objective in the game where you have to collect all 151 Pokemon in your Pokedex in the game.

1119
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:58,000
So your Pokedex is saved, um, in the individual game, well, it's saved in between the games, so you can collect them over a period of several games.

1120
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So you have two tables in the game, one is red, one is blue, and each have its own elements.

1121
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Um, they have different locations that you play on as well that determine which Pokemon are available for you to capture.

1122
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So as you play through it, you go and catch them.

1123
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:20,000
And then when you have catch mode activated, you have a two minute window, um, that you can attempt to capture Pokemon.

1124
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:33,000
So once you activate catch mode, you have to hit the, the pop bumpers, uh, six times, and then it unlocks a sixth of, well, each hit unlocks, uh, a sixth of an image of the Pokemon that's up for capture.

1125
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,000
So once you get them alighted six times, and you get all six parts, then you get evolution mode.

1126
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That's another two minute window where when you select a captured Pokemon, you can then evolve it.

1127
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Um, and then that's the only way that you can add the evolved form to your Pokedex.

1128
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
So you have to hit these particular targets on the play field once you get six targets.

1129
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Um, only three of them have what you need to do it.

1130
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Um, but you have to hit those specific targets to get this to happen.

1131
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Um, I mean it really is just, you know, it's Spinball, but cute with PokeBands.

1132
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Um, it was pretty positively ranked when it came out.

1133
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Um, it had a rumble feature, do you remember that?

1134
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I do.

1135
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Um, although-

1136
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It was like built into the cartridge.

1137
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It was built into the cartridge.

1138
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But, um, my favorite, uh, quote about it is that it was called a waste of a AAA battery.

1139
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Um, it was novel, but I don't think it added too much to it, you know.

1140
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Um, but it, it was, uh, a pretty, a pretty fun little game.

1141
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Um, Famitsu, when it came out, gave it a 32 out of 40, which is a decent rating.

1142
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Um, and it was enough to, uh, make it spawn a sequel, which was, uh, Pokemon Pinball Ruby and Sapphire.

1143
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Um, which came out in, uh, 2003, but I'm not talking about that one now. I'm talking about this one.

1144
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:09,000
So, um, it, as I recall, I think it did, um, it didn't make it to the Virtual Console, did it?

1145
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I know the, the Ruby and Sapphire one that you don't want to talk about did.

1146
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I know for sure that's on Wii U.

1147
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I don't know about this one.

1148
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I don't think this one did.

1149
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
But at any rate-

1150
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Sorry, I just love that the very first Pokemon this guy got was a Magikarp.

1151
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
It's LARP.

1152
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Splash.

1153
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
But that's really all there is to say about it. It's a pinball game.

1154
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
It's got Pokemon.

1155
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
You can get 151 Pokemans.

1156
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Yeah, good luck with that.

1157
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Right?

1158
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It's probably, it'll probably be easier to fill up your decks in Pokemon Go than it was in this game.

1159
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I'm still trying to get a Ditto, you know.

1160
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
That's it. Pokemon pinball.

1161
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1162
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Pokemon pinball.

1163
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
On the Game Boy.

1164
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And Game Boy really, just get it on the color.

1165
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Because it has a lot of color in it.

1166
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Yes.

1167
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break.

1168
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
But when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we have rapid fire news.

1169
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Mailbag and Skypline over at Orange Lounge Radio.

1170
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
All one word on Skype.

1171
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
We will get to your emails.

1172
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1173
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Right after this.

1174
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1175
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
In Progress live tonight.

1176
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Episode 669 for this.

1177
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
December the 11th of 2016.

1178
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I can't believe we're going to be in 2017.

1179
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And at the same time, I'm ready to be done with this dumpster fire of the year.

1180
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And I really hope next year is going to be different.

1181
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I totally expect Dumpster Fire of the Year Part 2.

1182
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
You want Dumpster Fire 2 Electric Bulu?

1183
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Electric Dumpster Fire?

1184
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
It not only is on fire, but it's shocking.

1185
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It's just absolutely shocking.

1186
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
It will drown you in lightning and water.

1187
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
We'll see, we'll see.

1188
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Well hopefully it's going to start off great.

1189
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
And I'm expecting to have a fantastic time there.

1190
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Not doing anything at least that I know of.

1191
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
With like any panels or planned appearances.

1192
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
But sometimes I like to just go to these things and just listen to concerts.

1193
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Play old school games.

1194
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I want to play more old school games this year for sure.

1195
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
And yeah, I decided to just kick back and have fun.

1196
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
And hopefully find more places to eat.

1197
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
That's the other thing that's concerning me.

1198
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Is that in the freezing cold weather it's not exactly going to be easy to walk around and get stuff to eat.

1199
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
So I really hope there's some, I hope they're getting a lot of food trucks this year.

1200
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Every food truck in the D.C. area better be at Magfest this year.

1201
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I'll put it this way.

1202
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
We have nine years to prevent 2017 through 2020 being further Dumpster Fires.

1203
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You know, but you would just think that the cosmos will give us like one really awesome year.

1204
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Like I don't know, and I'm not even talking about politics.

1205
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Like what could happen outside politics that could make next year awesome?

1206
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Like, I don't know, would that be like sending...

1207
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
A meteor landing?

1208
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
The aliens being discovered.

1209
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
That might be, I don't know, that could also be scary.

1210
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Friendly aliens, Klingons being discovered.

1211
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Klingons are friendly.

1212
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Sorry, not Klingons.

1213
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Vulcan. God, I'm a horrible Trekkie.

1214
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Vulcans. Vulcans being discovered.

1215
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Like it wasn't first contact.

1216
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Not Klingons.

1217
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
That would be bad if they were first.

1218
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Well, I honestly think that any intelligent alien life would look at this planet and go,

1219
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Fuck that.

1220
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Just keep on driving.

1221
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
And piss right on off.

1222
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Just said, screw that.

1223
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:42,000
They would look at our planet and just treat it like when you're driving down the 99 and you go by Bakersfield.

1224
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

1225
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's like these people are too primitive.

1226
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Let's not pay any attention to them.

1227
01:37:49,000 --> 01:38:00,000
But in all honesty, I would hope that people start acting like we are a civilized society.

1228
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
That's what I would hope for.

1229
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It may be too much to ask for, but I would like, instead of this cult of ignorance that's been fostered, especially in America,

1230
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I'd like to see people read a fucking book, study their fucking history, and get over what people look like, worship, who they sleep with.

1231
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Get the fuck over it.

1232
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I just want people to get the fuck over it.

1233
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
And Betty White to stay alive.

1234
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Oh yeah.

1235
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
No celebrity deaths in 2017.

1236
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
None. Well, maybe a couple. Maybe a couple.

1237
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I don't know. Who do you think will die first?

1238
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Betty White or Kirk Douglas?

1239
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Oh, well let's...

1240
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
He's a hundred now.

1241
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I know, and I hate to say this. I hate to say this, but can I say Zsa Zsa Gabor?

1242
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Okay, Zsa Zsa.

1243
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
She's one of those people where you go, how?

1244
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Right?

1245
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
How?

1246
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Preservatives.

1247
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I'm fine with her being one of the three.

1248
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:00,000
If there's certain sacrificial lambs we have to offer 2017, then it's like, okay.

1249
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
If she has to die so Betty White can live, then by all means.

1250
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Kirk Douglas. I mean, this is horrible. We're horrible people.

1251
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
We should, no, just, you know, but.

1252
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Betty White seems to be in the best health of them all.

1253
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yeah, because she's probably still having sex.

1254
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Who wouldn't want to sleep with Betty White?

1255
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I'm serious.

1256
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Should we do an OLR quick poll?

1257
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Oh wait, that's literally nothing to do with video games.

1258
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Would you with Betty White?

1259
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Alright.

1260
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
That's just you 100 Matt and Chet says, let's not play this game.

1261
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
That statement literally could be anything we talked about in the last five minutes.

1262
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Alright, let's talk about other video games.

1263
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I doubt.

1264
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
What?

1265
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I doubt says maybe.

1266
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Maybe? Alright.

1267
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Hey, if nothing else, Dark Sakura 2017 is going to give us Mass Effect Andromeda.

1268
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
So let's just, let's hope for a great Mass Effect Andromeda.

1269
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I hope that we are still free to say what we think of Mass Effect Andromeda and gather in large groups while playing it.

1270
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And that my uterus isn't going to be our right to send cupcakes to EA.

1271
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Well, besides that, and that, you know, I won't have, you know, my uterus being legislated by old white men.

1272
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Hey, I'm not that old.

1273
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
While I'm playing, while I'm playing my Mass Effect Andromeda.

1274
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Let's hope that Dark Sakura doesn't try to be in Mass Effect Andromeda because she wants to beam the fuck off this planet.

1275
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I want the fuck off this planet right the fuck now.

1276
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,000
She could be in Mass Effect Andromeda since they're going to be looking for all those voice actors.

1277
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Yeah, let's hope that gets resolved too. That's not, that's not going to be pretty.

1278
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Pay our voice actors.

1279
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,000
All right. Well, and to be fair, pay the people making the games too, as well.

1280
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
All right. Just, and people that are...

1281
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Not just pay our voice actors, but give them safe conditions to work in.

1282
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
That would be a good place to start.

1283
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Your voice is your instrument.

1284
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And as you can tell right now, a damaged voice is not what you want to listen to in your games.

1285
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Yes, if you're sick of Dark Sakura coughing on this show, you can pay her.

1286
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:24,000
You can pay for me to go, for Kaiser to not fucking go, no, you might have to cough for another six weeks.

1287
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Can we, can we start a Kickstarter to get your vocal cords removed?

1288
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Girl.

1289
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I'm just kidding.

1290
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
You left yourself wide open for that. All right.

1291
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
No, I, you.

1292
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,000
You took a sledge hammer and open and made your own opening in the side of the house.

1293
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
That's what I do.

1294
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
To let yourself in like the Kool-Aid man.

1295
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
You're like, Oh yeah.

1296
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I'm like, Oh no.

1297
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
You take that sledge hammer back.

1298
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
No, no Kool-Aid for you, Kool-Aid man.

1299
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
All right. News, video games, news about video games, Loki.

1300
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,000
So I actually had this problem on my TV as well, Final Fantasy 15, because I had set it up.

1301
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I'm like, you know, this looks like part of the picture is being cut off on the TV here.

1302
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Do they have an option to fit that to the screen?

1303
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
No. Okay. That's unusual because most games have that.

1304
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And it's supposed to be built into the PlayStation four.

1305
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
You tell the PlayStation four how big your TV is and then all the games know that, but I'm noticing the same thing.

1306
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I'm not noticing major cutoff.

1307
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It's just enough.

1308
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Yeah. It's just like enough where I'm like, okay, why is it getting cut off?

1309
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Because I told my PlayStation how big my TV is.

1310
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
So it forgot.

1311
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I guess so.

1312
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So, yeah, unfortunately that is an issue that is affecting copies of the game right now.

1313
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,000
However, Square Enix is going to be fixing that.

1314
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
They're going to be, I guess, patching that out at some point soon.

1315
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
So, yeah.

1316
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
That is kind of lame.

1317
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Also, it looks like Elite Dangerous is going to be coming to PlayStation four in 2017.

1318
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:17,000
They just announced that sometime in the middle of 2017, apparently it's going to include the Horizon season expansion as well.

1319
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I haven't heard of VR support, but that would be nice.

1320
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Please.

1321
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Just wanted to see.

1322
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:36,000
All right. Well, earlier in the show, we talked about Capcom reboots, but this is a little bit about Sega and some very old Sega franchises that could be coming back, but not as games.

1323
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
That's the difference.

1324
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Pachinko Machines?

1325
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
No, but the good news is not Pachinko Machines either.

1326
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Oh, that's good.

1327
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So we're talking about Altered Beast and Streets of Rage.

1328
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So get ready to rise from your grave all over again.

1329
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Here's the deal.

1330
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
It's a report from Variety, so you know what that means, entertainment industry.

1331
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Sega is teaming up with Circle of Confusion and Stories International to adapt these games as potential movies or TV series.

1332
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Now, if you're a little concerned about that, you should consider, though, that Circle of Confusion, some of the shows they've been involved with, Outcast, Dirk Gently, and The Walking Dead.

1333
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Just this little show we have to...

1334
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I haven't heard of any of those.

1335
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Just this little show we have to compete against on Sunday night on Twitter and all that stuff.

1336
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
But it's probably not The Good Walking Dead, it's like another show that also happens to be called...

1337
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
The Walking Dead shooter game that was on 360.

1338
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Activision?

1339
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Yeah, not the Telltale Walking Dead, which is pretty good.

1340
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Yeah, that's Activision. That's Activision's fault. They suck.

1341
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Like, their version, they also had the Fast and the Furious game, which also blew ass as well.

1342
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Now, I guess the interesting thing about these games, they're kind of generic. Like, Streets of Rage, I mean, everybody knows it for the soundtrack, and it's not that it was a bad game, but it was, like, there's not a lot of...

1343
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Gang show.

1344
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I know, there's not a lot of stories there in Streets of Rage. Same thing with Altered Beast. Altered Beast could just be...

1345
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Werewolf show.

1346
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Greek mythology show. Zeus and Friends. Like, that's all...

1347
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Zeus and Friends!

1348
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
That's how Altered Beast needs to be.

1349
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Altered Beast, the, like, sitcom sensation.

1350
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:27,000
You know what show I wish they'd bring back, and maybe Altered Beast could somehow help with this? I don't know why my mind is going there, but when we talk about, like, Zeus and Friends, I think about Xeno Warrior Princess.

1351
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And just, like, that whole mythos that existed on it, because that was tied in with Hercules, right? Wasn't there a third show at one point as well?

1352
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Was Jack of All Trades in that universe?

1353
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
No, I don't think it was, but...

1354
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But, like, those fantasy shows...

1355
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I thought he was part of the Xenoverse.

1356
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
They played Autocus, didn't he?

1357
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Huh?

1358
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Bruce Campbell had a character in Xeno.

1359
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yeah, I thought that was...

1360
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
And he was a different character for...

1361
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Jack of All Trades?

1362
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I thought that was the spinoff.

1363
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
They're telling us in chat it was Xeno, Act F says it was Xeno in Hercules only. Alright, that's fine.

1364
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:05,000
But I'm just saying, I kinda miss those, like, super, like, cheesy budget TV shows, fantasy stuff. That's what I want Altered Beast to be.

1365
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Silk stockings.

1366
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Like, FOREVER NIGHT.

1367
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Like, I want...

1368
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I'm fine with the reboot of the Silk Stocking series. Softcore porn, hell yes.

1369
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I want the dinosaur to be, like, a guy in a pterodactyl suit.

1370
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That's what pterodactyls do.

1371
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
It's like...

1372
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It's like a guy with one of those...

1373
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
What do they call those suits?

1374
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
The, like, the green man thing?

1375
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
They have, like, a name for it.

1376
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
The Unitards? I don't know.

1377
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Not the Unitards. They actually have, like...

1378
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I can't remember what they're called now.

1379
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
But they have a specific name for those, like, spandex full bodied suits.

1380
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Don't Wear Me Ever? Is that what they're called?

1381
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Yeah, there's a name for them. It's escaping me.

1382
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
But yeah, it's something like that.

1383
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
It could be a pterodactyl.

1384
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:54,000
They have dinosaurs, actually, with, you know, the Jurassic Park inflatable dinosaur costume that they have with the floppy head.

1385
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Brad from Paw Culture thinks you're talking about a mocap suit?

1386
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
No, not a mocap suit. I'm gonna have to look this up now. Alright.

1387
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Anyhow, let me move on to something completely different.

1388
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
This is news that might...

1389
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
We're having a very Final Fantasy night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1390
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:12,000
But these are some rumors going around about Final Fantasy's 30th anniversary.

1391
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,000
VG Leaks is publishing this, saying they have a pretty reliable source on this information.

1392
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
But 2017 is the 30th anniversary.

1393
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
That's what they're called. Morph Suits.

1394
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Thank you. Alright, back to Final Fantasy.

1395
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
So 2017 is gonna be the 30th anniversary of the Final Fantasy franchise.

1396
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:40,000
And these rumors are saying that the Final Fantasy VII remake and Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age, will be the big releases next year to celebrate Final Fantasy's birthday.

1397
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Which, you know, I would believe that at least the first episode of the remake, anyway, is gonna be ready to go next year.

1398
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And I was kind of talking about that on a previous episode of OLR where I said, you know, we finally got some of these PlayStation 4 wishes this year with XV and with Last Guardian.

1399
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:05,000
But, you know, next year they're gonna have to deliver two, and I really think Square especially is kind of on the hook to either deliver Kingdom Hearts III or the VII remake next year.

1400
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And for some reason my gut tells me we're still gonna be waiting on Kingdom Hearts III.

1401
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
So, but the VII remake, I have a feeling the VII remake is just in XV's engine.

1402
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
It is.

1403
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Yeah, well, but that, so that makes me wonder how the battles are gonna play out.

1404
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Are the battles gonna be XV's battles?

1405
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Because that's gonna rub some people the wrong way.

1406
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I don't know, anyway.

1407
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:36,000
See, now if they're not, if they're not like XV's battles and are like VII's battles, that's gonna be the most fucking amazing game right there because that's how XV should have been.

1408
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
We'll see.

1409
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Anyway, but anyway, besides those games, there's some other things that are supposed to be coming next year for the 30th anniversary.

1410
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Such as the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy coming to PlayStation 4.

1411
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:55,000
XIII, XIII-2 and Lightning Returns on separate discs and they will be 1080p and 60 frames a second.

1412
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Which, to be fair, you, finally they fixed some of the graphic patches.

1413
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
You can kind of do that on the PC.

1414
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:06,000
So I can't imagine that the transition to PlayStation 4 for those games would be very hard.

1415
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So I don't want to use that word that you all tease me for saying too much.

1416
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:17,000
But this is one of those things that we've been waiting for for a while and it just, it seems like an easy thing for Square to do.

1417
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:24,000
So, we'll see. I mean, that just, I feel like if you're gonna make up bullshit, that's a pretty easy one to make up.

1418
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So, I don't know, we'll see.

1419
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,000
But this is the real whopper in this whole leak or whatever rumor thing.

1420
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Is that there's going to be also a Final Fantasy 30th anniversary collection.

1421
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:41,000
It will have Final Fantasies 1 through 9.

1422
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,000
All of them will be on this collection and it will be released on PlayStation 4.

1423
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
And PlayStation Vita.

1424
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
That's where I start to go, this rumor's bullshit.

1425
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
What's a Vita?

1426
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:01,000
But that's, anyway, 1 through 9 and they say it will have two versions of Final Fantasy 1 through 6.

1427
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
The originals and the modern ports.

1428
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:14,000
This would mean that Final Fantasy 2 and 3's NES versions will get an official English translation for the very first time.

1429
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
7 through 9 will only exist in their newer ports.

1430
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I'm assuming that means the PC Steam versions that are out there.

1431
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Not the 7 remake, obviously, but what you can already purchase on the PlayStation 4 as far as 7 is concerned.

1432
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
This doesn't seem like too much of a stretch as far as translating Final Fantasy 2 and 3.

1433
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
My understanding is 2 is already translated.

1434
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Like, 2 is ready to go and for whatever reason they pulled the plug on it at the last minute.

1435
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
3, on the other hand, I mean, well both of those games have been translated.

1436
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:51,000
You know, there was the Game Boy Advance, right, had it?

1437
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
The PlayStation Portable, PSP?

1438
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I know they put those games out elsewhere and they had to translate the games for that.

1439
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Well, of course, the DS version of Final Fantasy 3, of course.

1440
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
But to translate the original NES versions would be very, very, very interesting.

1441
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Because that would be the first time that a lot of people would get to play those original versions of 2 and 3.

1442
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
But again, the fact that they say it's coming to the Vita as well, to me, that debunks the whole rumor.

1443
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I'm sorry to be so negative, but...

1444
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
It could be a digital only release.

1445
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I guess.

1446
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I mean, if they're just, like, ROMs, if it's the ROM with the front end type thing.

1447
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
You know what? ActDeft brings up a really good point. I gotta honor this.

1448
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:37,000
ActDeft says, Japan loves the Vita, though. Remember that World of Final Fantasy got released on the Vita.

1449
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Weird, but that Sony doesn't love the Vita. That's kind of odd.

1450
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:47,000
That's a good point. So if that collection exists for the Vita in Japan, it will never get released here.

1451
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Why aren't they trying to push the Vita? I mean, I don't understand this.

1452
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
They're putting out so much content for it. Like, way more than the 3DS is getting.

1453
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
But it's like, eh, fuck it. You know, whatever.

1454
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I don't know.

1455
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
It's dead to us.

1456
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:05,000
And then, Raginator in chat, of course, says, I would love to see the missing games show up on Steam.

1457
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Well, funny that you mention that, because, apparently, they are saying that the Final Fantasy VII Remake

1458
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:19,000
and Final Fantasy XV will come to PC, but not until early to mid-2018.

1459
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
So, sorry, you're gonna have to wait a little while.

1460
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
But they're also saying with this, again, these rumors, like, don't stop.

1461
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
And that's why I'm like, the more that you put out. Like, if it had just been the XIII trilogy,

1462
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I would have been like, alright, this is gonna happen.

1463
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:40,000
But then they say Final Fantasy I, II, XII, Tactics, and Chrono Trigger, for some reason,

1464
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
we're throwing that in the Final Fantasy anniversary, will be released on Steam before the end of 2017.

1465
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,000
See, it's like, the more and more we add to this, the more I go, I don't know.

1466
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:57,000
We'll see. It would be great if it was all true. I think there's, for all those things I named,

1467
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I know there's an audience for it out there, so it would be great if it was true.

1468
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Anyway, sorry, that's supposed to be rapid fire, that turned a little long, but there's just a lot to that.

1469
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Dark Sakura, what else do you have?

1470
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Tekken 7 is getting Kuma and Panda, which technically is the same character just for Pallet Swap.

1471
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Right.

1472
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:19,000
But, we like Kuma and Panda, and they're there in all their fuzzy glory.

1473
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:26,000
And then, last but not least, it looks like there's going to be a new addition to World of Final Fantasy.

1474
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Sora, from Kingdom Hearts, is showing up. Yay.

1475
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And I think it's more to promote the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8.

1476
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Ah, clever little bit of crossover, right?

1477
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Yup.

1478
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:48,000
In chat, SJ100Matt wants to point out, Chrono Trigger was in the Final Fantasy Anthology disc with Final Fantasy IV for PlayStation 1.

1479
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
True that.

1480
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Good point, I forgot about that. So, alright, well played.

1481
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Well played.

1482
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Alright, let's check out what's in stores this week as we travel around the world, starting with the US.

1483
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Not a whole lot of stuff being released this week, but we do have a few things.

1484
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So, starting off, looks like Bastion is going to be out on Xbox One.

1485
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Filthy Lucre, I guess? Lucre? I'm not sure how you pronounce that.

1486
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
It's going to be out on PC.

1487
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Batman the Telltale series, episode 5, City of Light, out on pretty much all the platforms.

1488
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:34,000
A game called Drive Drive Drive on PC and PlayStation 4, which is like a driving, racing game that you actually race down three tracks at the same time.

1489
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
It's kind of fun.

1490
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Feist on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1491
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Stardew Valley on PlayStation 4 this week.

1492
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,000
The Little Acre on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1493
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator on PC.

1494
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Space Hulk Deathwing on PC.

1495
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Stardew Valley also making its way out to Xbox One as well.

1496
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Akiba is Beat on PlayStation 4.

1497
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Botolo on PC and Mac.

1498
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And then on Vita we have Saga, Scarlet Grace, and of course Super Mario Runout on iOS.

1499
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And then that would be it.

1500
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Going to Japan, things slowing down there a little bit as well.

1501
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,000
But on the PlayStation 4 this week you have Akiba's Beat comes out on December the 15th.

1502
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And there's also some new DualShock 4 controllers in Gold and Silver that will be out this week for the PlayStation 4.

1503
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:44,000
As we talked about earlier, yes, we do have releases on the Vita such as Saga, Scarlet Grace comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1504
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Adventure Time, Secrets of the Nameless Kingdom.

1505
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Yes, Adventure Time is making its way to Japan as well, so that's pretty cool.

1506
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
And then lastly, looking at the 3DS this week in Japan, Yokai Watch 3.

1507
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Oh, that's why this is a slower week.

1508
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
There's a Yokai Watch 3 coming out this week in Japan.

1509
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Sukiyaki is the game that's out this week.

1510
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Is that like a greatest... because there was already Sushi and Tempura which looks like it's getting some sort of box release.

1511
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:23,000
So is this Sukiyaki kind of like what Pokemon Yellow would be?

1512
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Where it's kind of like the best parts of the first two?

1513
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Sukiyaki is delicious.

1514
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Yes, but that would also go in line with the fact that the other two games are called Sushi and Tempura.

1515
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Both of which are?

1516
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Delicious!

1517
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Let's see, that is it.

1518
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I'm looking at the Sega 3D archives, but sadly that's next week.

1519
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
But that looks like it's going to be awesome as well.

1520
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Dude, those Sega 3D things on the DS are pretty awesome.

1521
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Anyhow, how about Europe, Dark Sakura?

1522
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
On the 11th is Bastion for Xbox One.

1523
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
On the 12th is Bridge Constructor for PlayStation 4.

1524
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
The 13th has Feist for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1525
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:16,000
And the 14th is Guilty Gear XRD 3rd Xrd Revelator for PC.

1526
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Alright, let's open up the mailbag.

1527
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangelandradio.com if you want to participate with our mailbag segment.

1528
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Again, that's participate at orangelandradio.com.

1529
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Dark Sakura's back!

1530
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
And that means I get to make her read emails once again on the show.

1531
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
You've missed her, so she's going to cough her way through a few emails tonight, but just a couple, right?

1532
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Since the last show.

1533
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Since the last show discussed anime shows the hosted scene,

1534
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:55,000
I recently began using Netflix's download feature to finally start using my commute to watch the over-the-top revenge fantasy Kill la Kill.

1535
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Kill la Kill is great.

1536
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Which I am definitely seeing the hype for that show, although who the hell do I think I am not watching Gurren Lagann first?

1537
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Previously, I watched the dub of Squid Girl slash Shinryaku Ikamusume.

1538
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Though, I'm sorry, through, which was cute enough, although I don't see nearly enough mention of that one in the anime circles.

1539
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I also, just for the heck of it, got the Cowboy Bebop box set, always a classic.

1540
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I've seen the first two episodes up to now.

1541
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Just to ask a rather unrelated animation series, by the way, am I imagining things,

1542
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:41,000
or was the DuckTales-era Disney cartoon Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers supposed to be in some way a spiritual follow-up to The Rescuers?

1543
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Um, no. Not really. Not to my experience. It was more just a scenario for adventures.

1544
01:58:48,000 --> 01:59:01,000
But, um, the only anime that I've watched recently is I watched all of Danganronpa, Future in Despair, and then Hope.

1545
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Which, don't watch it unless you've played the other games. It won't make much sense.

1546
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I was going to say, you missed last, I don't remember if it was last week or the week before,

1547
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
but somebody had emailed us, like, looking for anime recommendations.

1548
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
You know me, I went blank, because I don't watch a lot of it.

1549
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Loki had some good ideas, and the chat helped out a lot, too.

1550
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
But Dark Sakura, I know you used to watch a lot. I don't know if you do as much anymore.

1551
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Well, Attack on Titan season 2 is coming out. Or Shingeki no Kyojin is the Japanese name.

1552
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Um, I've really been out of those circles for a while.

1553
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Um, I tried, the last one I tried to watch with any seriousness was Gachomon Crowds,

1554
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:46,000
which, it ended up just completely not being good at all, because it's not real Gachomon.

1555
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I know Tatsunoko produced it, but it's not fucking Gachomon. So, no.

1556
01:59:51,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Um, I've watched, um, Macross Frontier was pretty good. It's a little old now.

1557
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Um, and there was a Trigun OAV that came out not too long ago.

1558
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Um, and then of course I've seen some of the Ghibli movies that have come out, so.

1559
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Yeah, that was my best suggestion. I mean, everybody talks about them for a reason.

1560
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I always tell people to start with the classics, though. I mean, and actually, and this one was from Robert M.

1561
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Um, I've got the Cowboy Bebop box set that came out when the series was still relatively new,

1562
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
and we marathoned all of it in one night.

1563
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Um, if you're looking for something around that era of anime, you could also look for Trigun.

1564
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
That, you know, that one's really good.

1565
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:45,000
If you like Cowboy Bebop and you want something a little bit more raunchy, there's also Space Dandy,

1566
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:52,000
which is by the same, uh, artist. It's definitely out there. It's pretty fun.

1567
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Um, and, uh, goodness.

1568
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Let me get, while you brainstorm, let me get to a chat comment here.

1569
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Raginator in Chat says Netflix has a download feature.

1570
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Yeah, that was, uh, that was a pretty big deal in some of the news, uh, tech news like last week or the week before.

1571
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Yeah, certain titles.

1572
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Yeah, not all of them, but certain titles you can now download.

1573
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,000
And he asked a follow-up question. What's to stop people from abusing that feature by pirating the shit out of videos?

1574
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
My assumption is that they're encoded somehow, probably using some PC or personal information as the key.

1575
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:31,000
So that way, if it ended up on a website, they'd know who did it and it wouldn't be viewable without your ID or something like that.

1576
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:38,000
So that's my guess. I don't know that to be true, but I would assume that something with the technology of Netflix behind it

1577
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:44,000
probably has the power to encrypt the file, uh, that your device only can view it.

1578
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:50,000
And also, as far as, like, androids, I guess, are a little different, but as far as, like, the iOS devices,

1579
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
it's not exactly the easiest thing in the world to go pull a file.

1580
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I mean, yes, I know there's third-party apps that do it, but it's not, like, something everybody uses.

1581
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
No supported way.

1582
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Yeah, exactly. So, anyway, any other quick anime recommendations for the next month?

1583
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Off to the top of my head, I tell everyone, of course, to go back and watch the classics. Watch Gachamon. It is the best.

1584
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Fair enough.

1585
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Um, the last one actually has already been covered in a topic. It says, Greetings, Peoples, and there's a link to the Vivendi article.

1586
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Sure.

1587
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Um, this week I saw another development in Vivendi's bid to take over Ubisoft.

1588
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Um, I heard people decrying this action for months, but have yet to hear an answer to this question.

1589
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Why is this a bad thing?

1590
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Uh, staycare, entertainment, trainer.

1591
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:36,000
The most simple answer I have for that is because some of Activision's worst years were under that.

1592
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
That's right, Logie. That's pretty much the quickest answer for that.

1593
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Why people are afraid about the Vivendi thing.

1594
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Um, yeah, I mean, just I think how well they did with Activision, basically.

1595
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
That's essentially what it was.

1596
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Kill off Sierra Games and like all of it.

1597
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Uh, yeah.

1598
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Westwood.

1599
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
There was that, yep, there was that whole stuff with like King's Quest and then the whole like...

1600
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Or Westwood, that might have been EA.

1601
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I don't know.

1602
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
But still, um, yeah. In a nutshell, that's part of it.

1603
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Um, I think at the end of the day, if the games are there, nobody's gonna care.

1604
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:14,000
But, I think that it's, their track record is what concerns people.

1605
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Alright, that's it for emails.

1606
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1607
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
We are almost to calls, but we have a few more stories before that.

1608
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Starting with Logie.

1609
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Alright, um, so this is pretty cool that...

1610
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Thank you.

1611
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Um, Valve is doing a major update for, uh, Dota 2.

1612
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
And so now this is a 7.0 update.

1613
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
They're doing, I guess it's in a test client right now.

1614
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Um, and they're calling the patch the New Journey.

1615
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,000
So, what they're gonna be changing on that, the user interface has been reworked.

1616
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
They're, I guess, opening up more space on screen so you can see more of the action.

1617
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Uh, they're also, uh, big gameplay changes have been made, including reworks of old heroes, a branching talent system.

1618
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Um, they're saying, like, in Heroes of the Storm, a small fountain strewn around the map to allow characters to swap inventory while away from their base.

1619
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
And the map has also been altered.

1620
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
There are, um, also some other changes they made as well.

1621
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:27,000
A new backpack system allows, uh, players to compete in multi-part items without having to return to base.

1622
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,000
And also, three heroes have received model updates.

1623
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Looks like Slaughter, Viper, and Enigma.

1624
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And then also, users can now script computer-controlled characters when creating custom game modes.

1625
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
So, quite a bit of stuff, it looks like.

1626
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I need to go back and revisit Dota 2, clearly, because that's, uh, that's a lot of changes, uh, in this game.

1627
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Especially, like, when they change the interface, uh, a lot to, you know, uh...

1628
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Yeah, it's very minimal now, so that's kinda nice.

1629
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:03,000
That'll be, I'm sure that'll be good for people that stream this game, uh, quite a bit.

1630
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:09,000
So, yeah, I gotta, I have to admit, guys, you know, I don't, there's a lot of those lane games out, right?

1631
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
You know, you got League of Legends, you got Dota, you got Heroes of the Storm, Smite is a lane game.

1632
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,000
You know, there's a lot of these out there, it's, it's hard for me to follow them all.

1633
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
But I know this is, like, an insanely popular title, especially on Twitch.

1634
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And it seems like this is, like, a global, like, there's a huge global following for this game, right?

1635
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Yeah, definitely.

1636
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:33,000
So, uh, but I'm very curious about the fact that they also put in the branching talent system, similar to what they have in Heroes of the Storm.

1637
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So, um, maybe they're trying to make it a little more accessible, or easier for people to understand, I don't know.

1638
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Anyhow, uh, lots and lots of news on Pokemon Go these past few weeks.

1639
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Uh, dataminers went to town on a new version of Pokemon Go that was pushed out to devices.

1640
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Uh, the Silph Road is the, uh, is it the Reddit or the website? I think it's both. It's a Reddit and a website.

1641
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Yeah, it's both.

1642
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Uh, that really goes to town on Pokemon and Pokemon Go.

1643
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,000
And, uh, they did some datamining of the game.

1644
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:06,000
And, uh, they found, within the game, the sound files for 100 new monsters.

1645
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
That would be the Gen 2 monsters.

1646
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
They're not able to find graphics, though, because apparently graphics went back server-side.

1647
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
So, you can't see the graphics, uh, in these patches anymore.

1648
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:22,000
There is also a new section for Shinies, which, uh, I'm sure if Shane was out there, he would perk up.

1649
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Actually, I did, I did message Shane as soon as I saw this.

1650
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I said, Shane, did you hear about Shinies and Pokemon Go?

1651
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:33,000
And he's kinda, like, he was not, he did not go, like, oh, I gotta play it again.

1652
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
He was kinda, like, eh.

1653
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
So, I don't know. I think, I think it'll be all about implementation.

1654
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
How are Shinies gonna be in there? Who knows?

1655
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
But what's also interesting in the datamining, you're supposed to be able to add costumes to your companions.

1656
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Uh, a holiday section is one of the ones that's there.

1657
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Uh, there's also gonna be avatar customization, including sponsored content.

1658
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:58,000
And, uh, Pokemon will now have genders outside of Nidoran male and female,

1659
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,000
which would be in line with what happened in Gen 2 in the main games anyway.

1660
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
What about my non-binary Pokemon?

1661
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Uh, in the Pokemon games, as of Gen 7, that doesn't exist.

1662
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Damn them.

1663
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:21,000
So, um, but anyway, um, so, that pretty much confirms that Gen 2 is happening.

1664
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
It's just a matter of when.

1665
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Well, that when could be as soon as Monday, uh, tomorrow.

1666
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
By the time you hear this, perhaps.

1667
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Uh, apparently, Niantic is gonna be doing a huge, uh, release of information on Monday.

1668
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:40,000
They have actually said so much as information on new Pokemon coming out Monday.

1669
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:45,000
However, a lot of folks jumping to conclusions that that means Gen 2.

1670
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:52,000
But before you get your hopes up, I wanna remind you, there are three legendary birds that you still cannot get in Gen 1.

1671
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
They could do a holiday event that will involve those birds.

1672
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:00,000
And that would be new Pokemon. So, lowered expectations, people.

1673
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:06,000
But the fact that the sound files exist, I mean, it's very clear that they will implement Gen 2 at some point.

1674
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Yeah.

1675
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
It may not be Monday.

1676
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Meanwhile, though, uh, sponsorships galore for Pokemon Go, including a Starbucks just went live, uh, on Friday at 11 AM.

1677
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,000
7,800 stores turned into PokeStops and gyms.

1678
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Most across the street from each other.

1679
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Right? Or, like, at least one year my work, um, it's right next door to what's a grocery store called The Nugget that I don't think probably exists anywhere but Northern California.

1680
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Um, but The Nugget is a PokeStop. So, literally, you have two PokeStops, like, right next to each other that you can hit from Starbucks.

1681
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Because they're both, uh, the one was a portal in Ingress. Which, by the way, none of these are portals in Ingress.

1682
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Thanks, Niantic.

1683
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Thanks, Niantic.

1684
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Now we have, uh, diversion. Well, did the Union Banks go into Pokemon Go? I didn't check for that.

1685
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
They did go into Ingress?

1686
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Yeah, Union Bank went into Ingress. When SoftBank, uh, acquired Union Bank, those all became, uh, Ingress portals.

1687
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Like, in Roseville on Douglas Boulevard. Sorry to get local, guys, but I have to for Loki.

1688
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Uh, on Douglas Boulevard by the Mongolian BBQ, we really like. You know what I'm talking about?

1689
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Uh-huh.

1690
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Not, okay, there's a Union Bank there, and that's now an Ingress portal.

1691
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Eh.

1692
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
But I don't know if it's a PokeStop. I didn't check.

1693
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I'm still not interested in the fact that the Circle Ks became Ingress, uh, portals.

1694
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Because they don't have the cool, like, where you buy stuff from there and you get the, you know, receipt with code that you can turn into items.

1695
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Yeah, yeah, no, and the hint water thing went away, too.

1696
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Um, but anyway, so, yeah, all the Starbucks, and there's a Frappuccino that they advertise in the game, but they don't advertise it in stores.

1697
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:45,000
And so you can actually order this at the, and they know how to make it, because this whole thing got leaked through an internal memo anyway.

1698
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:52,000
But the, um, the frappe, which I actually ordered one yesterday, because I was just like, fuck it, I'll try it, and, you know, see what it is.

1699
02:09:52,000 --> 02:10:01,000
It's a vanilla frappe. There's no coffee in it, so it's a non-coffee frappe. It's vanilla, and they put blackberries in it and blend it, and then I think some raspberry sauce?

1700
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Get it? It's berries. Because Pokemon Go, the berries, get it? Anyway.

1701
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Um, but, I have to admit, I don't know if I walked in on something else going on, but I feel like the employees at Starbucks laughed at me when I ordered the Pokemon Go thing, and that really wasn't cool.

1702
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Like, don't fucking have this promotion where people are giving you money and then laugh at people who are buying them.

1703
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
But I don't know, what are you uh-oh-ing there? Oh, did you get your ditto here?

1704
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Yep.

1705
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
There's a ditto out?

1706
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I just got a ditto.

1707
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Hey, Alan! Alan!

1708
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
It's a Pidgey!

1709
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Ditto!

1710
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
It's a Pidgey.

1711
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Have you caught a ditto yet, Alan?

1712
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I have not.

1713
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
He's got his phone out. Loki's got his phone out.

1714
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I sort of want to do it.

1715
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Yeah, apparently dittos hang out at the house.

1716
02:10:47,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Alright, um, where was I going with that? Oh yes, so that is not the only sponsorship that's happening at Starbucks, but Sprint also announced that Sprint stores will be turning into Pokestops.

1717
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,000
It's weird, though, because the Sprint announcement came first, but the Sprint stores are still not Pokestops.

1718
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:09,000
But I believe that happens on Monday, is when that whole thing starts.

1719
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:16,000
So, gonna be lots of new Pokestops popping up between Starbucks and what used to be Radio Shack.

1720
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
So, there you go.

1721
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
And he ran away, that asshole.

1722
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Everybody in chat is going, this is not a drill, ditto alert, stop the show, ditto alert.

1723
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Another Rhyhorn, though.

1724
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
I just think it's great that right after you catch it, it goes, oh?

1725
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Alright, anyway, let's move on, whoever's next, because I'm not looking at show roll, because I gotta catch this Pidgey wink.

1726
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I guess that's me, isn't it?

1727
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Yes, well you already caught the Pokemon anyway.

1728
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Whatever, I have to post it all over the internet.

1729
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Nintendo is, looks like the Nintendo Switch is going to have GameCube titles on it via virtual console.

1730
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Eurogamer heard from three separate sources about this, and that they've already confirmed three titles.

1731
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, and Super Smash Brothers Melee.

1732
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:14,000
There's also a possibility that Animal Crossing might be included, so everyone can go back and play the old schoolness of the old Animal Crossing.

1733
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:23,000
They're also saying that there should be an update program where you can upgrade previous virtual console purchases to use on the Switch, instead of having to buy them again.

1734
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
So, let's hope so.

1735
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Uh oh.

1736
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Oh, oh, because we all heard Loki take a breath, isn't that why we're O-ing?

1737
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:39,000
No, I was just thinking, yeah, I'm sure that's going to work, just like the stupid virtual console shit that we're in the fuck.

1738
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Hey, you know what? I gotta say, I gotta say this.

1739
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:48,000
The classic NES is the best interface I've seen yet for the virtual console.

1740
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:57,000
So if those guys are doing the Switch's virtual console, then I am cautiously optimistic, I think is the best way to put it.

1741
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I'm cautiously optimistic.

1742
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:05,000
But I guess this is all really rumor anyway, and we won't really know until the 12th of January.

1743
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Aw, Alan, come here. Alan has to tell this story on air.

1744
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Alan, he's probably, he might be in the middle of playing Morrowind, however, though, because I know he's been playing that recently.

1745
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Or, come here, Alan, you have to tell this story to the listeners.

1746
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Because the listeners are commenting, it's been a while since Pokemon go, derailed the show.

1747
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:37,000
So Alan, who I woke up out of slumber one day to say, there's a ditto outside, get it, and then the Pokemon was already gone by the time he reached over and got his phone.

1748
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
What happened with this ditto just now?

1749
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I threw two Ultra Balls, I went straight for the big leagues, I got a great throw and a nice throw, and it broke out both times and then ran away.

1750
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
So I didn't get shit.

1751
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
You know what?

1752
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,000
What?

1753
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
I used a regular Poke Ball and it was red.

1754
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Yeah, because we didn't know it was a ditto until you caught it.

1755
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Yeah.

1756
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I'm sorry, Alan. Alan, I have two, so when they finally release trading, I'll give you a ditto. How's that sound?

1757
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
That's fine.

1758
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,000
If I find another one, I will alert you to its existence.

1759
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
We are on ditto alert here at Studio N7.

1760
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Who cares about baby watch? This is ditto watch.

1761
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Yeah.

1762
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Ditto!

1763
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Who cares about babies?

1764
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Ditto!

1765
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

1766
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:33,000
In a move that I'm sure is going to make for incredibly great movies, or not.

1767
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:40,000
We have Will Ferrell starring in a movie based off an esports player.

1768
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Nope.

1769
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Yes, so...

1770
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Nope.

1771
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Nope.

1772
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Nope.

1773
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I don't even need to know anymore about this movie.

1774
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Nope.

1775
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
But hold on.

1776
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Nope.

1777
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It's written by the guy that did the script for the SpongeBob SquarePants 3 movie.

1778
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Nope 2.

1779
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
And apparently he's going to be a similar character as the one he played in Talladega Nights.

1780
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Nope.

1781
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Will this be insulting to video game players?

1782
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Yep.

1783
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Yeah.

1784
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Yeah, SSG100Matt in chat says, surprise, this wasn't an Adam Sandler movie.

1785
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
No, Adam Sandler now has that deal with Netflix.

1786
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
So that, because fucking everybody's on Netflix now.

1787
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,000
But Adam Sandler has that deal with Netflix where now his movies just go directly to Netflix.

1788
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
So you don't have to tell or admit to anybody that you're watching them.

1789
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
So.

1790
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I just, I mean, I like Will Ferrell.

1791
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I mean, I think he's funny.

1792
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,000
But there's no way this movie's not going to be completely insulting to everybody.

1793
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I know.

1794
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I'm very worried about it.

1795
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I don't know.

1796
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I mean, I guess, like, Talladega Nights was insulting to NASCAR fans.

1797
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
So I don't really care about that, but I mean, you know.

1798
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:55,000
And I'm not really huge into esports, but like, can we get past the stigma like,

1799
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:00,000
oh my god, there's people who play games for, for like, you know, professionally.

1800
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Oh, the what nerds.

1801
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I mean, like, what year is this?

1802
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I mean, seriously.

1803
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
That we're devolving this as, like, funny.

1804
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:14,000
But yet, you know, we are all impressed when there's football players in their late 30s and all this stuff.

1805
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
It's like, I don't know, it's a bit of a double standard, but anyway.

1806
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Whatever.

1807
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Yeah.

1808
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Anyhow.

1809
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Moving on to other news.

1810
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Darksacra, where did you find that Psyduck?

1811
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Right here?

1812
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I just hatched it.

1813
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Sorry.

1814
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Oh, you hatched it?

1815
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Yeah.

1816
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I keep finding Rhyhorns in your front yard.

1817
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Yeah, I know.

1818
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
There's tons of Rhyhorns and tons of Pikachus.

1819
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Here.

1820
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Anyway.

1821
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
How have I not caught any more Pikachus?

1822
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I need a Raichu.

1823
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,000
And the rest of y'all stopped playing Pokemon Go.

1824
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Yeah, I did, because it's fucking boring.

1825
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
At least I didn't go back to Ingress.

1826
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Hey, watch it.

1827
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
All right.

1828
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
We could use your help, you know.

1829
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I did find someone, by the way, working on the portal by my house.

1830
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Did you really?

1831
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Yeah.

1832
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Did you pull over where you're like, green or blue?

1833
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And if they said blue, I'm calling the cops.

1834
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
No, I can't.

1835
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I always see people stopped at places.

1836
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I could see.

1837
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,000
It was, they were blue.

1838
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:06,000
It was one of our neighborhood people, but I didn't see anything.

1839
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Because I was like, I didn't want them to know I was a Defector.

1840
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Oh.

1841
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
We need Defector.

1842
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I didn't go green.

1843
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I went to Pokemon Go.

1844
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Oh.

1845
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Which is better.

1846
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Whatever.

1847
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Anyway.

1848
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Ingress was giving me stress.

1849
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
On Pokemon Go.

1850
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
It was making me throw up because I'd get mad at the red team.

1851
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
There's no fucking red team.

1852
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Not red.

1853
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I meant green.

1854
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Did you know what game you were playing?

1855
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Where were you with the green team?

1856
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Did you?

1857
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Who are you?

1858
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
You know what I mean?

1859
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
She was the fucking mole the whole time.

1860
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
No, I wasn't.

1861
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I mean.

1862
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
That's why our farms get smashed.

1863
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
It was you.

1864
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
No.

1865
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
You know what I mean?

1866
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I know what you mean.

1867
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,000
It was that same person who had pissed me off, so I finally just stopped playing.

1868
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
All right.

1869
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Look.

1870
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Anyway.

1871
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Moving on to our final news story tonight.

1872
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Speaking of tragedy.

1873
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
The show?

1874
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
No.

1875
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Konami, actually.

1876
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
That's a big tragedy.

1877
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Okay.

1878
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
That counts.

1879
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
It's a story about Konami.

1880
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Do you remember a few weeks ago on the show, we talked about the Castlevania remade game,

1881
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
which was being made in Unreal Engine.

1882
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
It was a fan game.

1883
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:13,000
It was going to remake all of the NES Castlevania, but within the Unreal Engine, and it looked

1884
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
really good.

1885
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Y'all know the rest of the story.

1886
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Where am I going with it?

1887
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
This is why we can't have nice things.

1888
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
What's the punchline, everybody?

1889
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
What happened to the Castlevania remake?

1890
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Konami will sue.

1891
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Cease and desist.

1892
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
That's right, y'all.

1893
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Castlevania dark-sided C and D. That's it.

1894
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Cease and desist sent from Konami to the developers, and Deja Wolves, which was the developer,

1895
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,000
announced that all updates and production of the game was ordered to stop.

1896
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:48,000
However, also said that they have been allowed to keep the files for now, and still hopeful

1897
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
the development can continue in the future.

1898
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
He's talking to someone from Konami UK about acquiring an official license.

1899
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Here comes the Kickstarter.

1900
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,000
That way, he can continue to work on the game.

1901
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
So, interesting that the files are still out there.

1902
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
At least perhaps this presents an awareness that once it's on the internet, it's always

1903
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
on the internet, and it wasn't going to go anywhere.

1904
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So, maybe there's that, if nothing else.

1905
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
But for now, no more work to come on that game.

1906
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:22,000
For what it's worth, as much as we envision that Konami is nothing but a pachinko company now,

1907
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,000
perhaps they are going to put their foot in gaming once again.

1908
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:36,000
There's a recent, what is this, a trademark that was filed by Konami for Turbo Graphics.

1909
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,000
What the fuck is Konami doing involved with Turbo Graphics?

1910
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Well, remember, the Turbo Graphics was from NEC and Hudson Soft.

1911
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:46,000
And who bought Hudson several years ago?

1912
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Many years ago at this point.

1913
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
That was Konami. Yep.

1914
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:54,000
So, Konami technically owns basically those IPs in that license now.

1915
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
So, Konami filed a trademark for Turbo Graphics.

1916
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
It was filed on December 1st.

1917
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:04,000
A lot of different classifications, including video games and game consoles.

1918
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Kanye West album not mentioned.

1919
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I don't know if you all know that.

1920
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Did you know Kanye West working on an album called Turbo Graphics 16?

1921
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I mean, he's had some personal difficulties that are going to delay that album a bit.

1922
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I don't fucking care.

1923
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I know, I know.

1924
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
But anyway, so what does this mean?

1925
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Will they be bringing, I think this is very clear exactly what it means.

1926
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I see NES minis on the shelf.

1927
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
I see classic Genesis stuff on the shelf.

1928
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
You mean Phil Collins?

1929
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Right.

1930
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:41,000
So, I'm sure this just means a mini Turbo Graphics 16 will be on its way before too long.

1931
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I want it to play HuCards.

1932
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:49,000
If it had, oh my god, what if it actually had like duo hookups and had a built-in arcade card?

1933
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:57,000
I would weep happy tears because then I could finally play the Super CD version of Strider.

1934
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I wouldn't expect it.

1935
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:02,000
But maybe that version of Strider will be built into the device.

1936
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I doubt that seriously.

1937
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I doubt it.

1938
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I think it'll be, ooh, it's Bonk and Keith Courage all over again.

1939
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Yippee yay.

1940
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
It'll be all the same stuff they released on Virtual Console.

1941
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Which would at least include Aliens Crush and Devil's Crush.

1942
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
So maybe this isn't the end of the world.

1943
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
What? Those games are awesome.

1944
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
They are, but I'm just thinking of the other ones.

1945
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I mean, at least, I mean, can't we get like Legendary Wings or one of the...

1946
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Crap, what was one of the other?

1947
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Crap, I forgot.

1948
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I think it was one of the Thunder Force games.

1949
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I don't know.

1950
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Alright, maybe you know and you want to call us to tell us.

1951
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:45,000
We're going to do, I know, we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lawns Radio on Skype,

1952
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,000
but before we get there, one more story, right, Jamie?

1953
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Yes, and this is just a little bit of interest.

1954
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:58,000
There have been very bad Akira games that came out, and we all know what Akira is from the movie, right?

1955
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:07,000
And manga that involved Kaneda and his awesome bike and Tetsuo who got really screwed over in the end.

1956
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:23,000
But a guy named Patrick Scott Peterson got his hand on four copies of an unfinished prototype for a Game Boy version of an Akira game.

1957
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:31,000
And they were all at different build stages as well, so he was able to go through and see how much of the game had been done.

1958
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:40,000
It kind of, the first levels play like Excitebike to be honest, you know, complete with, you know, obstacles and jumping ramps and things.

1959
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,000
But then it had platforming levels as well.

1960
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,000
It didn't really have much in the way of all the graphics done.

1961
02:22:48,000 --> 02:23:00,000
There were plenty of placeholders left, and it had like the same stage over, but it had the final boss in it, which was the kind of messed up Tetsuo from the end of the movie.

1962
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,000
But the placeholder music also was really terrible.

1963
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I don't think it had anything really to do with the series, but it was interesting seeing it.

1964
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:19,000
And I like when people find just those little prototypes after, you know, when you're finding these unlabeled copies.

1965
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:24,000
And lo and behold, it's something that was never released, so that was pretty good.

1966
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Little unearthed treasures, even if it was probably not that great of a game.

1967
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:34,000
It's like the type of, you know, treasure, like when you find dog poo.

1968
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
It didn't look very fun.

1969
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Skypline's open, y'all. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1970
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:47,000
If you want to give us a call, we will take your calls about something we have talked about, or perhaps something we haven't.

1971
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:50,000
We'll find out. Let's get to it, though.

1972
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
We got the Skype line lighting up, but we'll start off with this call.

1973
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1974
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Hi, this is Bobby from Atlanta.

1975
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Hi, Bobby. It's nice to have you.

1976
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
You know, you are kind enough to have us on your show every week.

1977
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:05,000
It's nice to have this show graced with your presence once in a while. Thanks for calling in.

1978
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Yeah, so I'm asking for some receipts.

1979
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
All right.

1980
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Because there was an assertion, or an accusation, really, made on this fine program of yours several hours ago, way back in Part A.

1981
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And I'm trying to figure out, like, I want to see the receipts, because it doesn't seem plausible to me that a company named Nintendo,

1982
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:33,000
four months before they are supposed to release a new console thingy to the world,

1983
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:40,000
has not actually figured out the core gimmick technology of that console.

1984
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:47,000
And I'm trying to figure out why it seems, because I watched the video on The Tonight Show again,

1985
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:53,000
and I noticed that, you know, when they were on the screen, they moved the character and moved the camera,

1986
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:57,000
and then when the tablet had the game on, it was in the exact same place.

1987
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:02,000
And I'm hearing on this show that it was faked with two feeds.

1988
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:07,000
And I'm wondering what clued you into that, because I am not seeing this.

1989
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Well, because the vast delay between switching from their overhead screen to the other screen. There you go.

1990
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,000
That's it?

1991
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:21,000
So how did they get the camera position in the exact right space on the tablet?

1992
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I don't know if it was in the exact space.

1993
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I mean, if that's really good of them to watch and have a second person move the, or put the main feed on the same, at the same place before they shut it off.

1994
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,000
And I had theorized in chat, I didn't say this on air, but I theorized in chat when this topic was coming up,

1995
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:47,000
was that, well, I could see that they perhaps do some pre-recorded things to prevent a technical foul,

1996
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:53,000
especially because the environment of a television studio live TV broadcast is not somebody's living room.

1997
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
And Tonight Show is not live. It is live to tape.

1998
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Well, I guess, okay, that's true. That's fair. Well, they still wouldn't want to screw. It is in front of a live audience, however, still.

1999
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Yes.

2000
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:06,000
So they probably want to minimize those types of screw-ups. So that I could see.

2001
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:12,000
But when Reggie did whatever he did, like he was talking to buy time or whatever,

2002
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:19,000
I figured that what he's hiding is that, yes, there is a transition time between moving it from the dock to the handheld.

2003
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,000
And that's, but that's okay. Like if there's, I mean, it wasn't more than 15 seconds.

2004
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:29,000
And so I think that's reasonable. But, Loki, do you still think it was faked?

2005
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I just don't, I don't think that necessarily technology is not working.

2006
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I just think maybe what their, whatever dev unit they're using out there isn't ready to do that.

2007
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:43,000
But they're four months away from mass production.

2008
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Right. And I'm not saying that...

2009
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Do you really think, like, do you think it's not coming out in March?

2010
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Because if it's not working on their dev units now, they're not going to have a production ready in four months.

2011
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I don't know what's working on their dev units, to be honest with me, but honestly, I don't care.

2012
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
So it just doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel true to you.

2013
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Yes, it doesn't feel like, okay, let's put it this way.

2014
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:08,000
It doesn't feel like the initial thing that they showed off on their trailer, if you will,

2015
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,000
which was totally faked. The trailer was totally faked.

2016
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Well, right.

2017
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Because they even said the actors were playing with a blank screen.

2018
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:21,000
All the screens were put in post-production in the three-minute teaser trailer.

2019
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Okay, so now we're starting to find some common ground here, at least, in trying to mediate this whole thing.

2020
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I feel like now I'm starting to see where the thing is.

2021
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:35,000
So, Loki, you're seeing, like, this does not function the way that it functioned in the trailer.

2022
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Well, it just doesn't seem like that, like, it was odd that he was buying time.

2023
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Like, and I'm always curious when someone's buying time for something.

2024
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Okay.

2025
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
It's like, well, what are you not showing me?

2026
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Okay, okay, so then that, so it's the buying time that leads you to suspect something's fishy.

2027
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Yeah, I just figured that they're showing kind of an example of what it looked like on this, you know,

2028
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,000
version of the device that they had, that maybe they had two devices.

2029
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
One was hooked up, you know, via HDMI to their display or whatever it was,

2030
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:09,000
and they had a second one that was, you know, running the game on the tablet,

2031
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
and just to kind of give you an idea of what it looked like.

2032
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:15,000
And they were just amazingly able to get the camera angle and the character in the exact same position

2033
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:18,000
on both of those on live national television.

2034
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Yes, sure, why not?

2035
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Because Occam's Razor says it was all the same device.

2036
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:30,000
True, but Nintendo's Razor says that I don't believe they're bullshit, so, you know.

2037
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:37,000
So it just doesn't fit your worldview, so you're going to make the truthiness of it couldn't have been real

2038
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:42,000
instead of the more likely scenario of it was actually real, and there is something in the dev unit

2039
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,000
that caused him to have to buy time for 15 seconds.

2040
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I really don't care. Like, I literally didn't care at all because the footage they were showing me

2041
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:54,000
of Zelda Breath of the Wild was unimpressive, because I've already seen that bullshit.

2042
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,000
But you see, it's still a huge accusation to say they haven't figured out the tech for months before the show's coming.

2043
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Did I say that? Because I sure as hell did not fucking say that.

2044
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:04,000
You did say that you don't think they figured it out yet, which is why they had to fake it.

2045
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
They're online they haven't figured out yet.

2046
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I was talking about the fact that they have always online for the stupid Super Mario run.

2047
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
I said that's where they're behind. I never said they didn't figure out the tech switching between a screen,

2048
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:20,000
and obviously this is the only gimmick that's on that machine.

2049
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:25,000
I would hope that they have that figured out. Never did I quote that they didn't have that part figured out yet.

2050
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Because I would have probably asserted that that system would be delayed if that was the case.

2051
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Alright. I love you, Loki.

2052
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Good talk.

2053
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Alright, it was a good idea. I feel like we worked it out.

2054
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Hug it out, hug it out.

2055
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I saw some receipts. I maybe didn't agree with the receipts, but I saw them.

2056
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Alright, fair enough. And I also feel like, okay, I feel like when we kind of hit on the differences between the trailer

2057
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,000
and what we saw on the Tonight Show, now we're starting to, I'm starting to see what the difference is.

2058
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:01,000
I just wish there was some new footage for like, like we've seen the same damn area of that map for like ever now.

2059
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
January 12th. 31 days.

2060
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
January 12th. 31 days.

2061
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Like even what they showed off at the Game Awards where it's like, it's like we've already seen this shit.

2062
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Like, come on. Just like, show us something new. Different. That's like, wow, that's really got me interested.

2063
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Let me, let me ask this, and I think Bobby, you'd want to stay on the line for this one.

2064
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Let me ask this. What, what would it take on January 12th for you to be like, okay, I was wrong. I'm pre-ordering a Switch.

2065
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Well, I already want a pre-order one, but like, how about, how about this?

2066
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Hi, Bobby. Thanks for the call. No, I'm just kidding.

2067
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:41,000
No, how about this? That we're not going to fuck up our stupid supply and demand shit and they're going to be available in stores.

2068
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
So you want, you want Reggie to say we're not going to fuck up our supply and demand?

2069
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Well, I want them to actually not fuck it up because I don't care what he says, you know, what will happen in stores.

2070
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Yeah, we just didn't anticipate the demand on this system. Bull fucking shit.

2071
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:58,000
You know what, Loki? I, I honestly, I think you, that is a completely fair criticism.

2072
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:02,000
It's a completely fair criticism of Nintendo based on their track record of the Wii.

2073
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Yeah, don't get me wrong. I like Nintendo's system.

2074
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:10,000
The Amiibos, the, probably would have been the Wii U if more people had been into it, and the classic NES Mini.

2075
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I mean, we do have a pattern.

2076
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:16,000
It was still the Wii U. Even when that first came out, even though that many people weren't into it, it was still the Wii U.

2077
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,000
All right. That, that, Bobby, I would say that's a fair criticism, right?

2078
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Yes, absolutely.

2079
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Absolutely.

2080
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
All right. I hope they don't fuck it up either.

2081
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Like, like, come on.

2082
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
It's so refreshing to hear you swear on this program.

2083
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Well, it's just like, I mean, you don't have your, you don't have any idea how to do supply chain at this point.

2084
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:36,000
I mean, come on. I mean, who's, who's actually going to believe that at this point?

2085
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:40,000
It's just the fucking drive up the hype because, oh, people must have it.

2086
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Put it out there so people can actually buy it.

2087
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,000
The fact that units were available for the Wii U wasn't what killed the Wii U.

2088
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:51,000
It was because there wasn't software to support it.

2089
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And again, I, I stressed this last week, I'm stressing it again.

2090
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:01,000
You better be ready to do your pre-order on January 12th if you want this thing in the first six months next year.

2091
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Because I don't trust Nintendo's track record either, and I don't think anybody here does at this point.

2092
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Especially, especially which has me very suspect right now.

2093
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:13,000
We're talking, like, pre-orders are going to start less than three months before that system comes out.

2094
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
That is going to be a fucking mess.

2095
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Just coming from a distribution standpoint, that is going to be a huge fucking mess.

2096
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Because you know why?

2097
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Because Nintendo fucking demands that retail has their orders in 60 days in advance at least.

2098
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
So what, you're saying you're going to just take those orders day one?

2099
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
I mean, how many days are you going to open this pre-order for?

2100
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Nintendo already knows, because Nintendo already knows exactly how many each store is getting, and it's up to the stores to figure it out.

2101
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Exactly, because it's going to be a fucking mess all over again because they don't have their shit together.

2102
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Yep, alright. Bobby, anything else you want to comment on or talk about before we let you go?

2103
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
No, no, that was it.

2104
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Alright, good discussion. Check out the Bobby Blackwell Show, of course.

2105
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Every Sunday night, well, most Sunday nights, right? Here at the Voice Against Network.

2106
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Not next week, but I will be here Christmas night, just like you guys.

2107
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Well, it's not like you don't have an archive of hundreds of shows to go check out.

2108
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Exactly.

2109
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
There you go. Alright, thank you Bobby.

2110
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Thank you.

2111
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Take care.

2112
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2113
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2114
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,000
ActDeftInChat says Nintendo Switch is going to be a bitch to get.

2115
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Yeah, I agree.

2116
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Yes, incredibly, and it's unfortunate.

2117
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I'm worried because I'm going to be in class that day, I'm almost positive, so I'm not going to be able to be there at noon or 10 AM or whenever this goes live.

2118
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Like, I'm going to have to enlist, like, I'm seriously going to be probably asking Alan to help with that.

2119
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I'm going to be asking Shane to help with that because that boy has stupid dumb luck with those types of things and will probably get one when nobody else does.

2120
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I'm going to be enlisting the help of as many people as possible to make sure that I get that stinking Nintendo Switch when it comes out.

2121
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Like, is there anybody at Nintendo that listens to this show?

2122
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Also the price point too, because if that price point's not right, then who cares?

2123
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Actually, if anybody from Nintendo did listen to this show, they probably stopped because of a certain individual.

2124
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
But I'm so lovable.

2125
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
He really is.

2126
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:13,000
If you're still out there, because you want to hear the ugly truths and the ugly truthiness on both sides of whatever.

2127
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:18,000
If you're still out there, I just want to know, how can I make sure I get one of these things?

2128
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I'm not even asking for a free one. Look, I'm not even going to ask for that.

2129
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,000
How do I ensure that I get one?

2130
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Well, you see, you've got to play Super Mario Run. You've got to go pick that up.

2131
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Which I'll do.

2132
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:38,000
You've got to get all the black coins in the different levels, and then you've got to make a blood sacrifice in Nintendo.

2133
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:45,000
How old does the animal need to be? No, I'm kidding. I would never PETA don't call a show.

2134
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Alright, can I sacrifice food?

2135
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:51,000
That's okay, Rob. PETA kills more animals than it saves.

2136
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
It's true.

2137
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Here comes the slice hammer.

2138
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
PETA isn't very good bread either, so.

2139
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
No, PETA's amazing bread. What are you talking about?

2140
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
PETA Kitchen is even better.

2141
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Alright, let's go to the phones. We've got another call coming in. Let's get to it.

2142
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

2143
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Hi, this is Ray Treneter.

2144
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Hey, buddy. What's on your mind?

2145
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:23,000
No, a whole lot. I was going to say that I recently discovered a game. I don't know if it's new per se.

2146
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:31,000
It's new to me, but I was wondering if the three of you have heard of it. It's called Planescape Torment.

2147
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Yes.

2148
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Yeah, I've heard of it, but I've not played it.

2149
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,000
I played D&D for a long time, and that game completely didn't interest me.

2150
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Why not, Darcyra?

2151
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Because I'd rather actually play a Planescape scenario instead of a game based on it.

2152
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Now that you mention it, Planescape's been around for a while, huh?

2153
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Planescape's been D&D at least since the mid to early 90s.

2154
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Okay, we played Planescape, my high school group. When I was a senior in high school, we played Planescape.

2155
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Yeah.

2156
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Now that this is all coming up, I'm like-

2157
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Because it was the one where the elves were super tall.

2158
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Yeah.

2159
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:12,000
No, that was the other one. Planescape was the one that had the tieflings and the-

2160
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
That was my first D&D.

2161
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Yeah.

2162
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Was this. Yes. Okay.

2163
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,000
But I know the game. I just didn't play it.

2164
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:26,000
So yeah, but I have to admit, D&D has a ton of games that are available on PC and stuff, and I really haven't played a lot of them.

2165
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Again, it's just a matter of there's so many games. I could play one game a day, and I still wouldn't be able to play them all.

2166
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,000
But have you checked out the game?

2167
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Sorry, go ahead. I didn't mean to cut you off.

2168
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I was just saying, have you checked out the game, and what are your thoughts?

2169
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Yeah, actually, I discovered the game because, well, you know how I've been mentioning the GOG is having their winner.

2170
02:36:52,000 --> 02:37:09,000
And one thing they've been doing is on their Twitch channel, they've been having their people show off some of the games that are on Seattle, one of which was Planescape Torment.

2171
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:34,000
And that game really caught my eye. It had like isometric dungeon crawling, almost like a cross between old school Diablo meets, I'm trying to think here.

2172
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Like Baldur's Gate, because they say it was on that engine.

2173
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Yeah, Baldur's Gate.

2174
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Yep. So here's the thing. I didn't realize just how old this game was, believe it or not, Raginator. And that makes sense. You discovered it through Good Old Games, which does a lot of the old games. Get this, it's older than the show. December 12, 1999 was when this game came out.

2175
02:37:52,000 --> 02:38:02,000
And now that I'm looking at the box art, I'm like, I do remember this, because this came out not long after we were playing this D&D thing. So I remember it did catch my eye at first.

2176
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Yeah, the game definitely looks interesting. In fact, it looked interesting to the point where I decided to fork over the money to get it, especially since it was on sale at the time.

2177
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:32,000
The only downside is, it'll probably be a while before I can install it, because my hard drives are filled to the brim with games right now. So I have to invest in another hard drive so I can install it.

2178
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Well, this should be a way smaller game than probably some of the other stuff you're rocking on your hard drive. So you may have to sacrifice something to at least free up the space for this.

2179
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Yeah, in fact, I had to uninstall quite a few of my larger games, just to make room for the smaller ones already. Like I had to uninstall Final Fantasy XIII-2, for example.

2180
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Okay, well that's a whopper of an install. That's like a 60GB install. You should be able to install the entire library of Good Old Games with that type of space.

2181
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Yeah, in fact, right now I'm trying to save up my nickels and dimes so I can get another hard drive. But I just wanted to point that game out to you, just in case the three of you haven't heard of it.

2182
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:43,000
It definitely looks interesting, at least to me anyway. Plus, as long as I'm on the subject of GOG, it's a little bit too late to do it right now for the recent Bachelor games that they had.

2183
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:51,000
But they got a feature on there called GOG Connect. The three of you familiar with that?

2184
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I feel like yes, but I keep thinking of GOG Galaxy, the client. What's GOG Connect?

2185
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Basically, the short version is, it's so many that you have a Steam account.

2186
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Oh, right, right. Yes, you can get the Steam stuff on GOG. Yes, I do know that.

2187
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Sometimes it's not worth it, in my opinion. Sometimes it is. It's weird. A lot of times Steam has better deals in terms of prices, but they don't have all the nice little extras like the soundtrack or behind the scenes stuff or whatever.

2188
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Whereas the GOG version does. On the rare occasion, you happen to have, let's say, Dragon Age Origin on Steam.

2189
02:40:54,000 --> 02:41:13,000
All of a sudden, you connect your two accounts together, you might get Dragon Age Origin for free on GOG, and they'll give you the soundtrack and avatars and stuff like that.

2190
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Yes, but the companies have to agree to it, right? So it's a very limited selection of games. It's not going to be like your entire Steam library or anything crazy.

2191
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Exactly, and even then, you have to check it on a fairly regular basis, because there's a limited window for you to grab the free games.

2192
02:41:38,000 --> 02:42:01,000
On average, maybe four or five days, a window period where you can grab the games for free. Occasionally, they do repeat certain titles every so often, but you never know when those titles are going to show up and if it's going to show up again.

2193
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
It's to encourage you to check often, for sure.

2194
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Exactly.

2195
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

2196
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Sure, have a nice night.

2197
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
You too, take care, bye.

2198
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Let's see, I'm going to try and sneak one more call in if anybody's trying to get an orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. Last minute stories, anyone?

2199
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Yeah, as I mentioned, Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered is getting some updates for their multiplayer maps, which is nice. They're getting some new free maps to go along with that.

2200
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Some, actually, they were pretty awesome. They're going to be redoing, what was it? They've got Crash, the holiday version of Crash, which is pretty awesome, Wetworks, I'm trying to write the rest of the names, it's been so long since I played.

2201
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:59,000
But it was basically a lot of the maps, because the multiplayer maps that came with HD Remastered were all of them, and now these are like the rest of them. And it's free, so that's awesome.

2202
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Free is always good.

2203
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
And all the more reason to purchase it.

2204
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Alright. Well, since the phone lines aren't lighting up, I assume that is it for calls tonight, thanks to those that called in. If you change your mind, you do want to interact with the show later on, you can always send us an email.

2205
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. We will be back in seven days to do it all over again on December 18th, and I can't believe we are actually two weeks away from Christmas as of today.

2206
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Uh-uh, the start of Hanukkah.

2207
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Whatever it is you celebrate, just the fact that that's so close to the end of the year is more what I'm talking about. It's like, wow, we're already there at the end of dumpster fire of the year.

2208
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Just remember latkes on Christmas.

2209
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Yay, or Asian food if we can find anything open.

2210
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:50,000
You know what? We could do latkes on the weekend after, because it's still during Hanukkah.

2211
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Okay, that works.

2212
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
And then we can do...

2213
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I'll take food anytime.

2214
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Asian food of choice.

2215
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Awesome.

2216
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Or whatever's open.

2217
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Asian food of availability.

2218
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Of availability.

2219
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Yeah.

2220
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Alright, um, yes, because this isn't New York City.

2221
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Because it's Gay Jumis.

2222
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:09,000
This is not New York City. This is Sacramento, California, and a lot of stuff's still closed, so.

2223
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back in seven days.

2224
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:20,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or seven about the show.

2225
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if your voices aren't here, we can't air them.

2226
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:30,000
You can also leave us a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, Google Play.

2227
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Wherever it is that you found this show, that goes a very long way, let me tell you.

2228
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I really appreciate folks that take 30 seconds out of their day to do that.

2229
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Anyhow, Dark Sakura, welcome back. Great to have you here. We'll see you in seven days.

2230
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:46,000
And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2231
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Uh... I missed you guys. But my aim is improving.

2232
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I knew there was a punchline coming to that.

2233
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Whoa.

2234
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:08,000
My final thought tonight is I'm ready to finish up chapter 13 of Final Fantasy XV and see just if it's as bad as some of my Twitter friends made it out to be.

2235
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:13,000
I'm really, I'm like, I'm excited to see how bad is this going to get at the end of the game.

2236
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:19,000
And to come back next week on the show and let you know, hopefully, my final thoughts on Final Fantasy XV.

2237
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Loki, your final thought, last but not least.

2238
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:25,000
I have to shop for tablets for my kids now.

2239
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Really? Is that what they want for Christmas?

2240
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:31,000
That's what my wife wants to get them.

2241
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:37,000
And I have to fix her laptop because her hard drive corrupted, so it doesn't work anymore.

2242
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Alright. Well, we'll be back in seven more days to do this all again.

2243
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:46,000
In the meantime, happy gaming, happy holidays, season, for whatever it is you're celebrating.

2244
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And we'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Bye.
