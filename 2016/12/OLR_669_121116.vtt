00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, the world saw Jimmy Fallon nerdgasm over the televised reveal of a playable Nintendo Switch running Zelda Breath of the Wild.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll have more about this and the most important part all three co-hosts you know and love, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Live tonight, episode number 669 for this December the 11th of 2016.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you from Sacramento, California's Studio N7 with my co-host to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
First off, welcome back. DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. How you doing? Is your mic on though? You're not going to be able to do very much without a mic on.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
As I was saying, I'm back bitches. A little rusty. I had it off because I still have a bit of a cough left.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
Feel better for one. It's just leftovers. But nice to have you back. How was your month?

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, kind of boring and weird for having to work weekends and I spent the past three weeks sick, so.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yuck.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah, so that's pretty much it.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
But at least all's changed now and your schedule clears your way to do OLR again for the rest of time.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
And the funny thing is that I didn't realize I had done a day trade with somebody.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Uh huh.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
So I had to work yesterday.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Uh huh.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
But I have a three day weekend coming up so.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Nice.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Nothing wrong with three day weekends. I like three day weekends.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Also a fan of three day weekends. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Like everybody else in the face of the planet.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
That's right. Who hates three day weekends? Bring them to me.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Well, I can find reasons to hate three day weekends, yes.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
Loki, you missed out, man. Last night here in Sacramento we had a double feature and I was fortunate enough to get to host this.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
We had a double feature of Kung Fury and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Your favorite movie, Kung Fury.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
But I just figured you didn't go because of, you know, family stuff. The wife probably wouldn't let you in.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, and I completely forgot about it.

02:22.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, you know what? For what it's worth, while I was there, since, you know, I got to do interviews and stuff, I brought a little piece of it back for you since I know you're such a fan of Kung Fury.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
So there's a little, uh.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So wait on my Blu-rays too. Apparently those haven't shipped ever. So.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That's awesome.

02:39.000 --> 02:50.000
So anyway, that's an autographed picture of Andreas Kaling who plays Thor in the movie. We actually had a special guest last night and I actually had to make it out to Loki.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So there it is. He was a great guy.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
That's awesome. I wanna hang that at my desk.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Alright, awesome. So I knew you'd get a kick out of that. Dark Soccer, I'm sorry. I would have got you one too. You haven't even seen the movie yet, right?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
No.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
You need to see it at some point. It's so ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
It's on YouTube. It's like 45 minutes long.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I just haven't been interested.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Not even that. 30 minutes.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Really? It's like 40 minutes?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, it's like 30 minutes. Yeah, it's short.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It's got David Hasselhoff theme song.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
It's one of those things where you're like, this is so fucking ridiculous. I actually kinda like it.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
It stars one of the guys from Lonely Island as Hitler.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
It's ridiculous. Totally ridiculous. Anyway.

03:28.000 --> 03:37.000
Anyway. Let's see. And of course, always joining us here in our chat room, our live audience in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And hello everybody to our chatters.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Starting with SSJ100Matt who says,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I hate three-day weekends because they're not four-day weekends.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
There's no pleasing some of you out there. No pleasing some of you.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
And then a few people talking about Kung Fury there in chat.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Act F says it's hilarious. And Bob Coffey says,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Best part of that is Triceracops. Yes.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yes.

04:09.000 --> 04:20.000
It's awesome. I made some joke on stage last night because there's this scene where the gold bird and the dinosaur fight each other with their tiny little hands.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
They're fighting each other. So I made a tiny hands joke and I'll just let you fill in the gaps where I went with that joke.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
All right. Oh, yes. And hacker man. Oh, my God.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Anyway. All right. Look, this isn't a Kung Fury podcast. It's a video game podcast.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
So we're going to get some gaming news here at the top of the show.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's talk about we've had a lot of big anticipated game releases this year.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Final Fantasy 15, of course, we were talking about last week.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
The Last Guardian just came out in the last week and a lot of people picked that up.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Very excited to play that, you know, and that's just kind of the end cap.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
The last two delayed games that were supposed to come out earlier in the year.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
But here they are. So we're really only left with one big game release left for this year.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
And that is this week's Super Mario Run is coming out on mobile.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Lower your expectations. I'm saying some people would say that's not a major release.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. A lot of people have been pressuring Nintendo to do mobile.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
And Pokemon Go doesn't super count because that was the Pokemon company, which isn't it's complicated.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
This is but this is Nintendo actual Nintendo IP and property like they're putting Mario on a non Nintendo device.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
This is kind of a big deal because this could be, you know, a huge thing for Nintendo.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
It could be the CDI. I mean, the CDI.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I was going to say they put it on the film CDI.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
So, yeah, but because of that, they haven't done it a long time. So I don't know.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
I kind of think Super Mario Run is a big, big deal.

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
And, you know, I I'm sure a lot of you saw the piece on Jimmy Fallon this week or heard about the fact that Super Mario Run demo is out in stores now.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Right. The Apple stores. I think I'll have it. Let me run right out.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, play a demo of a game. Well, OK.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
Some people did because some of the YouTubers saw the opportunity to if I can get the recording of it first and get it on my YouTube channel, I'll get lots of hits.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
There's lots of YouTubers out out there who went and played the demo.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And, you know, you can see this out there now so you can get a pretty good sense for what the game is going to be like.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
And I have to admit, I it looks neat. I'll probably pick it up. Why not?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And you'll probably finish it in an hour. And then that will be that.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
And I'm I'm goddamn serious because I was reading the early impressions from people and they said, yeah, it's a neat game.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
But it's short. It's like 24 levels. And that's it.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
J.D. is in our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com who asked, does Miitomo not count?

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah, it probably should, based on the words I chose.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
But the reason why I'm not considering Miitomo is because Miitomo was kind of like a new thing where it's like Mario is a very established kind of thing.

06:56.000 --> 07:05.000
Like, I just don't put I don't put the Mii caricatures and Mario on the same level of Nintendo like stuff to put out there.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
I point out Act of the Same Portal can be finished in 30 minutes and Portal is one of the best games ever.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, well, that's speedrunning that shit. And you know what? I'm not talking about speedrunning this game.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm talking about that is the actual playtime of the game is one hour when you visit all the content.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
I mean, shit, you could beat certain games in like a couple minutes.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
That doesn't mean that they're great.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
The old school Atari 2600 games.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Here's my thing is they're hoping for a repeat of the craziness that was Pokémon GO.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
This is not going to happen with this game. I'm sorry.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
It's just not because it's not a completely social phenomenon.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
It's not something that gets people out and changes the way that they play gaming.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
Just like, you know, we did this is just another fucking runner game on a mobile platform that has a million fucking runner games,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
but it has another licensed property that people like. That's it.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
Lower your fucking expectations because it's not the fucking godsend of like mobile gaming.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
This is not going to change mobile gaming. People are going to forget about this shit in about a month.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
And I would ultimately say, to be fair, I would only say almost everything you said ultimately doesn't matter.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
The part I agree with, it's not going to do as well as Pokémon GO.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
And that's where I stop agreeing with you because and it's not like, look, I don't think that this game is going to be a critical darling by any means.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I don't even think it's necessarily going to be a good Mario game.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
It'll probably be a competent Mario game, but it's I don't think it's going to stand the test of time as a Mario Brothers 3 or a Mario World or something like that.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
But at the end of the day, Loki, here's my argument.

08:31.000 --> 08:40.000
It doesn't matter what you are. I think it doesn't matter what most of the listeners of this program think because the majority of the people, I mean, sorry, but that's my honest answer.

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
The majority of the people who are going to buy this are not your, using my quotey fingers, hardcore gamers.

08:47.000 --> 08:57.000
It's not even really your casual gamers because now, you know, a lot of the 30 and 40 year olds in this day and age remember Mario and played it at some point in their lives.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
And I think there's just going to be a lot of people who buy it because, oh, hey, it's a Mario game on my device.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
And it's people who probably like otherwise would never buy a Wii U for themselves, maybe for their kid.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
I just think there's a whole, and I think that's the whole reason why Nintendo's pushing mobile is this is a game for them.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
This is not a game for the rest of us.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And you kind of have to realize that's where it is now.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Nintendo's going to chase the money.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah, I understand Nintendo's going to chase the money.

09:23.000 --> 09:34.000
It's nice to see them have, you know, this is the first step for them being, you know, a non console publisher and just, you know, third party and all this shit, which I'd be totally fine with playing Mario games on my PlayStation 4.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
That's all the hardcore gamers are frothing over, but I don't, we're not ready for that yet.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
We need to get, we need to see what happens with the Switch and then we can start having those discussions.

09:41.000 --> 09:53.000
All I'm saying is though, it's like, I don't know, fine. I'm sure it'll do well. I'm sure they'll say, oh, it was a great success, but my expectations aren't very high for it.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Now, Animal Crossing.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Okay.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
That may be different.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
All right.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Well, look, and this, Loki, this probably won't make you happy either.

10:03.000 --> 10:14.000
And this is, it's one of the things where it's surprising and it's not, was this little tidbit of information that came out this week because Nintendo has been pushing the publicity tour for this so hard.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
They want the day one to be big.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
I don't think the Apple store has ever done a notify me of when this comes out thing before.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I don't think that's ever happened before on the stores.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
This is like a new thing.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So Nintendo really wants day one to be big for this thing, right?

10:30.000 --> 10:40.000
But with the publicity tour comes the Q&A and a lot of things have come out about the game and this one is going to, I don't know, some people are going to be concerned about it.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
Super Mario Run is going to require you to be online at all times.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
I don't think that's a huge deal breaker because there's a lot of online games that do require that, or mobile games, I should say.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
I think. I mean, I don't play a ton of mobile games, but I know there are others out there, some major ones.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, Pokemon Go would be a great example, actually.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
Well, that's a little different. I mean, that's not a game that you can really play without an internet connection anyways.

11:07.000 --> 11:15.000
And it's, but this is not, it's, this is a platformer game. This is something that you should potentially not need that connection.

11:15.000 --> 11:23.000
I mean, I can see the update. If you want to submit that score you just got to an online leaderboard, then yeah, you need an internet connection.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
I'm actually kind of surprised that you are accepting this.

11:28.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, I'm fully accepting that Nintendo is several decades behind the trend of networking and so this always online connection thing, that was a few years ago.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
So they're catching up. It's just, they're slowly getting around to it.

11:41.000 --> 11:51.000
Here's what's interesting about this, too. Whereas, you know, when Diablo 3 did it, they tried to come up with a whole list of reasons on why it needed to be always online, right?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
And that was about stopping the cheating, which got through anyway, and all this other stuff, right?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Right. SimCity can only really be always online.

11:57.000 --> 12:05.000
Oh, right. Oh, boy. Okay. But, interestingly enough, Nintendo has basically just come out and said, no, it's because of piracy. We don't want this game to get pirated.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
So, you've got to give up. I know, I know, right? Have another laugh, Loki. Have another laugh.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
But you've got to at least admire that they're being upfront in that regard.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
No, I don't. I don't have to admire that at all because this is the platform that you're on and I'm sorry, too bad.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
I want to give you the exact words here. In an interview with Mashable, Miyamoto said,

12:27.000 --> 12:37.000
For consumers who are purchasing the game, we want to be sure, or excuse me, to make sure that we're able to offer it to them in a way that the software is secure and they're able to play it in a stable environment.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
Went on to comment about the number of countries the game is launching in, as opposed to a normal Nintendo product, so there's all these additional countries.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
And they want to make sure that all the services are as secure as possible.

12:47.000 --> 13:01.000
Security is also being cited as part of the reason why the game is an iOS exclusive for those, however long it's going to be, I don't know, a month or two months or whenever the gap is until it's on Android.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
So, Loki dying not to laugh over there.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
Yes, I'm totally sure it was a security issue. They were so concerned about security and not that they were being paid by Apple to have a timed exclusive.

13:14.000 --> 13:21.000
I'm sure that has nothing to do with it at all. Please. They think I'm fucking stupid?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
To be fair, Loki, I'd buy it.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
What does it matter anyway? The decision is made. We don't need a reason. It just is what it is.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
What are your thoughts on Super Mario Run? Not even necessarily this whole piracy thing, but just the game in general.

13:35.000 --> 13:47.000
I'll play it, you know, but I don't really care why it's exclusive to one versus the other. If that's their decision, that's their decision and the reasons don't matter. What can we do about it?

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And it's not even really an exclusive, it's a timed thing.

13:51.000 --> 14:01.000
Even so, it's not our decision and their reasons. Knowing the reason why changes nothing.

14:02.000 --> 14:11.000
Which, to be fair, Ingress was an Android exclusive and I still play the crap out of that, unfortunately. So, I mean, it can work both ways.

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah. So, let's see. The other thing I wanted to say, because I kind of agree with this comment in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
It's Raginator in chat says, mark the date and time, everybody. I really agree with Raginator on something.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
Raginator says, wouldn't the always online thing kill your mobile data cap? That's the first place my mind went.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
How much is this always online thing going to use?

14:37.000 --> 14:47.000
But the security, you got to be secure in this day and age and you wouldn't want piracy. God forbid, Nintendo, think about other people.

14:47.000 --> 14:57.000
How much of my two gigabyte plan, which I don't actually have, I'm clinging to my unlimited plan through my carrier that they don't offer anymore.

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
Like a frickin' nobody's business. I won't get rid of it. And if they force me to get rid of it, I will switch carriers.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
I've been with the same cell phone company for 10 years. If they make me get off my unlimited plan, I'm switching to Sprint or T-Mobile.

15:11.000 --> 15:19.000
I don't even care that their networks, or I guess Sprint's pretty good. I don't even care that T-Mobile's network is not so hot, at least in this area.

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
So, I will jump ship to that if they make me lose that. And this is part of the reason why it's crap like this.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
It's like, you know, all these data providers keep saying, like Comcast and all these other providers keep saying,

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
oh, well, with this, you can do so much of this and this and this. And it's like, okay, that's what grandma does.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
I play a lot of games that use a lot of bit rate, you know? So, anyway, sorry, I don't mean to get on tangent.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
But my point is, how much of this data cap am I gonna use playing Mario Run?

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
Now, granted, if I'm at home and I remember to put my phone on the Wi-Fi network, then I guess that won't matter.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Well, there's my Comcast cap, but that one's pretty big.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I wouldn't worry about it too much. I mean, the game's only about an hour long, so you're not gonna use much of your data caps.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
You're gonna be bored of it before, you know, before it gets to be a problem.

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
Okay, so ActDeft goes here and says, I don't think Super Mario Run is going to use more than Pokemon Go.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Probably some kilobytes at most.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
You're right, ActDeft, but I think at the same time we have to recognize those are both clearly different games.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
And I guess I do agree with Loki on something here, is that with Pokemon Go, there's that expectation that,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
okay, yes, if I'm gonna be out in the real world, of course this is using data downloading maps and so forth.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
But Mario Run, being a platforming game that has nothing to do with online environments outside of high scoreboards,

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
and that sort of exchange, if I'm not mistaken, doesn't necessarily need that data consumption. You know what I mean?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Like, you expect it with Pokemon Go. You know that going in.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
At least I give them props. I mean, albeit they weren't entirely direct, but I mean, I give them props saying,

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
oh, it's because of copy protection. It's a shitty reason to do it.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
But unless it's, at least they didn't try to spin it with some sort of, oh, multiplayer leaderboards,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
and oh, it's a social aspect. It needs to be connected.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
I mean, I don't know. It's stupid. But you know what? I don't care because I'm not gonna download it.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
So, whatever. It doesn't matter.

17:15.000 --> 17:23.000
But it's seriously, you gotta understand, Nintendo, yes, people love Mario, but it's a mobile platform you're on.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
There's a million fucking runner games out there, and I'll be honest, yeah, they may not have Mario with them,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
but there may be other games that are much better than yours.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
And even, like, I gotta, I really don't like the new Super Mario Brother art style.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I really wish they would just have done away with that.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
But whatever. I mean, that's what they decided to use and reuse those assets and everything for this game.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
So, whatever. I mean, I don't care. It doesn't appeal to me. I'm not gonna play it. That's it.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
So, you don't think there's anything this game can do to win you over?

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
No, I've watched how the game plays. I know that the game's short.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
I don't give a shit about the Kingdom Building part of it. I don't care. There is nothing that appeals to me in this game.

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
They didn't really explain enough about the Kingdom Building part for me to understand, like, what that is.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Does that make sense?

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
You just don't care, yeah. I mean, it's just, watching him play it, I'm like, wow, this is not exciting.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
So, okay, so I'm looking, I just was curious, because I see in chat, Act F says,

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
I do have a two gigabyte data cap. I don't ever get to two gigabytes, even with Pokemon Go.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
I decided to look up what my usage looks like right now. Okay, since December 3rd, you ready for this?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Since December 3rd, I've used 2.2 gigs.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, I believe that. I have three gigs and I normally use almost all of it.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
And I wanna say in the past month, like when I pull my reports, I'm usually like about eight gigs a month.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
And I'm not using my phone for anything illegitimate. I don't do piracy or any of that garbage on my phone.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
Like, everything I do is either, it's Spotify or it's probably fucking Ingress and Pokemon Go and shit.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Like, I'm starting to question, like, how much data am I really using with those games? You know what I mean?

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
But it could be Spotify. I listen to Spotify a lot in the car, like that, I don't...

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Occasionally, you know what lot will kill my data cap is?

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
Occasionally, I'll... Because my... For whatever reason, Ingress doesn't work on my Wi-Fi network at home.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't know why, but for some reason, it just doesn't work with it, which is odd.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Because I didn't do anything to it, so I'm not sure why.

19:36.000 --> 19:45.000
But, so I'll shut off the Wi-Fi to, you know, if I wanna recharge or whatever, play, you know, do organization crap with it.

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
And so, sometimes I forget to turn it back on, and then I go watch a YouTube video, and it's like, oh shit, there goes like a...

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
I do the same thing. I do the same thing, is that sometimes my Wi-Fi, like, screws up and it doesn't, like, work the internet the same way,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
so I turn it off, and then I forget to turn it back on, and I'll do the exact same thing.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
Or my work Wi-Fi, it's slow, so like, I'll be trying to view a web page or something, the page isn't loading,

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
so I'll switch the Wi-Fi off to load it faster over 4G, and I forget when I'm listening to, like, a podcast or something.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
You know what would be great? I need to submit that. Does Tim Cook have a suggestion box? Does he have an email address I can email him at?

20:23.000 --> 20:30.000
Because I wanna send a suggestion that says, put a button in the next iOS that disables Wi-Fi for five minutes.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
That would be brilliant, and then it just automatically comes back on.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Apple.com slash feedback.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Okay, all right, I'm gonna do it.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm serious.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I would do it live during the show if we didn't have stories coming up, I gotta focus on first.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
All right, so anyway, we will see. I'm very curious to see how well this Super Mario run does.

20:49.000 --> 20:57.000
Are there gonna be a lot of folks like Loki who say, pass, this just looks like a throwaway garbage type of game?

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Or are there gonna be enough other people where this thing makes tons and tons of money?

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
I'm not saying it's garbage, I'm just saying that it's not, it's lazy is what it is.

21:06.000 --> 21:15.000
It's just, it's just a lazy game. They're reusing assets, they're putting minimal effort into creating a game,

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
and then they're just throwing it out there because they figure it's Mario, people are gonna eat the shit up, and we're gonna make a quick buck.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
And they know they're gonna make a quick buck, because that's why they were on Jimmy Fallon fucking promoting an iOS game.

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
Is because they know they're gonna make bank off of it, because people are like, oh my god, Mario, I gotta buy that!

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Do they promote like, Clash of Kings, or what are those games, what's the Mariah Carey game?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
They have commercials for that shit all the time, like Bubble Strike.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Do they promote that stuff on Jimmy Fallon?

21:45.000 --> 21:52.000
Neither do I. I don't watch like any, the only late night TV thing I watch is on Netflix.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
I know he does game stuff usually during E3, and that's kind of a mix everywhere, and they do Nintendo stuff a lot, but

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Interesting.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
You know, I don't watch him.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah, the only late night show I watch, I don't know if I should talk about this on the show, but I watch Chelsea pretty religiously on Netflix.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
I think she's hilarious, even though I understand why a lot of people don't like her.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
But she was more the type that she sent somebody to BlizzCon to make fun of it.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
So, she sent that guy from American Pie, was it Jason Biggs? Is that his name? The guy that was on Orange is the New Black?

22:23.000 --> 22:29.000
She sent him to BlizzCon, he's on her show all the time, and she sent him to BlizzCon, because she's like, I don't want to fucking go.

22:29.000 --> 22:40.000
So, she sends him, and it was, I actually did not find the piece to be insulting or anything like that, or I'd probably be really mad and say, like I just, I thought it was, it was silly.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
As a late night talk show ought to be is a little silly, so anyway, that's just my take on late night.

22:45.000 --> 22:52.000
Alright, we're moving on to late night TV, we've obviously exhausted the topic of Super Mario Run, but we'll see how the game does this week.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
I'd be very curious for those of you that pick up Super Mario Run this week, what your thoughts are on the game.

22:57.000 --> 23:09.000
Like, here's, here's what would be fantastic, which is impossible because it doesn't have any controls, so you can't really play games with the precision that you need for, but, like a game like Super Mario Maker on iOS would be fucking amazing.

23:09.000 --> 23:17.000
That would be like, that would probably be like crazy, you know, awesome, that this could be like a big social thing, but no.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
No. No, I don't want that. No, I don't want it.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It wouldn't work because there's no buttons.

23:22.000 --> 23:43.000
Yeah, exactly. That's the one reason I don't want it. Until there's a standardized D-pad controller type thing that Apple, Android, whatever, like Ecosystem puts out, and I'm not talking third party, like I'm saying, either Apple puts out a joystick themselves, or there's some type of, I know that's harder to do on Android, but some type of officially adopted standard at least or something.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
I don't want that to happen because those games that do the D-pad on the touchscreen end up being garbage.

23:49.000 --> 24:06.000
Like, how many times has Luminous fooled me with a mobile release, like, oh, I'm gonna love it because it's Luminous, I'm gonna eat this shit up because I love Mizuguchi and I'll play anything he puts out, and then I play Luminous on mobile devices, and I'm like, god dammit, this game sucks without a D-pad.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
So, how many times are they gonna fool me?

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
I actually have a really good controller that works on my Apple TV.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Does it, well, but...

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It also works for iOS.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Does it work with a phone?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
It's Bluetooth, probably.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
It's Bluetooth. It's the SteelSeries.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
Okay, because I have that iCade thing that I've used my iPad with.

24:29.000 --> 24:38.000
Not quite the same, but it's like a standard, maybe about the size of an Xbox controller, and we were playing Sonic CD with it.

24:38.000 --> 24:45.000
If I'm not mistaken, though, I could be wrong, but because those things are not, is it an official Apple device?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
No, it's a third party, but it's...

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
So there's no standard?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But it's sold on the Apple website.

24:50.000 --> 25:01.000
It's a thing that you can use for, like, I have the iOS, or not iOS, the Android version of it, because that doesn't make any fucking sense that a Bluetooth device can't fucking work on one platform and another platform.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Thank you, Apple, for that shit.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
But, I don't know, it's just, it works good for, like, Minecraft.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Wait, but doesn't a game have to choose to enable that?

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah, the games have to be compatible with Bluetooth for it to work.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
See, and that ends up being the real problem.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Like, even though those devices are good, it's not a standard. It's not a universal standard.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
But they've had that available. That was one of the standards I thought they introduced with iOS 7, but...

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
I don't know.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Whether or not it's on the operating system is one thing. The game has to support it.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
Exactly. Exactly. And I don't know. Maybe Luminous does support it. To be fair, I haven't tried. But anyway...

25:47.000 --> 25:56.000
I do want to move on and talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we have been playing this week, be it mobile devices, or consoles, or PCs, or whatever.

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
Uh, Loki. Actually, no, I'll start with Dark Sakura. You've been gone for so... Sorry, I'm so out of practice with you being gone for three months. I can simply go to Loki first.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Dark Sakura, now that you're back, how was your gaming week?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Uh...

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Maybe I should have started with Loki.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I played Animal Crossing.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Like the DS one?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, did you finally get that patch? Okay, okay.

26:19.000 --> 26:34.000
You get a campsite. That's it. Like Amiibo support. I haven't played with the Amiibo stuff yet, but it was kind of neat walking around. Because of the changes, you get a new dream address. So you make a new dream town and everything.

26:35.000 --> 26:47.000
It was nice. All my people were there, and Isabel cleaned the town. And I harassed Resetti. Reset Sun. And that was great.

26:49.000 --> 26:59.000
I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft, because I missed it so much. And it is far superior to Final Fantasy XIV in every way. Except for graphics.

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
Even though she's incorrect, she was bragging about her eye level when she walked in here.

27:05.000 --> 27:27.000
I hit eye level 863. I went from 856 to 863 because of one epic item. And now I can handle elites by myself so I don't have to party with other people. Because I hate that. I play an MMO to play by myself. And to play with my guild friends.

27:28.000 --> 27:40.000
She's a strong, independent MMO player. Who don't need no man. No need no party. Exactly. She's a strong, independent mage. Yeah, well actually I'm playing a demon hunter.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
Oh, excuse me. I've been playing my mage some. She doesn't party with you, she hunts you.

27:45.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, we've been calling them demon hunties. I've also been playing a little bit of Danganronpa 2. Sonic CD on the Apple TV. Because it's got the Japanese track. Hello.

28:07.000 --> 28:27.000
Of course. It's great. Both of the theme songs. Well, the Sonic Boom one was there. But the Japanese one had no lyrics. It was just instrumental like they did for the Steam release. It handles really, really well with that controller that I have.

28:27.000 --> 28:41.000
The Seal series. It's a really nice controller. Very comfortable. Pretty hefty though. I know I've played some other stuff. I've played some Pinball actually. Blastroids. Because we have that Blastroids cabinet.

28:41.000 --> 29:00.000
And Dan's been playing a lot of UNO. Random. Online. Like the new one? Or the 360 one? Whatever some online website thing is. I'm like what are you doing this for? Because I want to say Ubisoft or somebody put out a new UNO like a month or two ago.

29:01.000 --> 29:24.000
About UNO a month ago? Well Ubisoft better be watching their ass in other ways. News to come later. Was that it for your gaming week? Yeah I guess. Then we'll go to Loki. Oh wait, wait. I'm still trying to catch a ditto. I caught one here at the house. Well I'm going to pull it off my phone. It was a Rattata. Everybody else I know got it from a Pidgey but I got one from a Rattata. Rattata, tat, tat. Rattata, tat, tat.

29:25.000 --> 29:51.000
And if nothing else, like seriously this is a Pikachu farm. I catch a Pikachu outside like every hour. And the other thing, Miitomo is actually a lot more fun now. I heard they did a lot of changes to it. I decorated my room so I have like six posters in my room. I have Garrus, Cullen, Illidan. I have Sonic and Amy. Because I took a picture for Sonic CD. And like the other one is the Japanese Guardian Legend art.

29:51.000 --> 30:00.000
I keep meaning to go back and check out Miitomo because everybody is telling me how it's different now but I've been too lazy. It really is a lot different. Loki, how was your gaming week?

30:01.000 --> 30:17.000
I played this week more Skyrim on Playstation 4. So I'm like level 160 now. But I haven't really done anything. I'm just leveling because I can.

30:17.000 --> 30:33.000
Then I did try out a little bit of Final Fantasy XV. I did not play very far into it because I'm not very interested in it. And you know what? That is their fault to be honest because you're supposed to hook me from the get go.

30:33.000 --> 30:53.000
I was hooked with the other games like Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy VII. You know what those had in common? Fucking kickass beginnings. Where it actually felt like there was some sort of, you know, something on the line. Some sort of motivation for your character other than, yeah let's go drive. Let's go drive to get married.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I want to play it to cook stuff.

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
But you don't really cook anything though. You just say, hey you make this based off of like...

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
But the pictures are so real. Like the food looks so real.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
That's what my son said. He's like, oh man that looks good. The egg like jiggles and stuff.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
I've actually decided that I want to make that braised beef stew because I've never considered caramelizing the onions.

31:19.000 --> 31:29.000
I bet there could be a market at like conventions for like cooking dishes from Final Fantasy XV. But you better bring lots of cup of noodle. Just saying. Bring lots and lots of cup of noodle.

31:30.000 --> 31:42.000
That's pretty much just like, they have channels for that. I know there is like a channel with, not Freddy Wong, but his brother. They do like game based stuff and cartoon stuff.

31:42.000 --> 31:52.000
Anyways, so I played that and then other than that I played Excite Truck. I actually worked on my Unity project thing.

31:52.000 --> 32:00.000
And it's weird, like I was working, like my wife wants me to make like an Excite Truck type game.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
So the first thing I did was make the terrain deformation script and stuff.

32:05.000 --> 32:14.000
And so it works part of the way. Like normally in the game when you hit an icon or something it makes like a hill appear and then after a while it goes away.

32:14.000 --> 32:27.000
And so I have it and the hill appears and then it doesn't go away. Which is weird because I literally copied the script and then just reversed the order that goes in and it should work just fine.

32:27.000 --> 32:40.000
But Unity is being special and just saying, no. We're not going to tell you what's wrong, but there's something wrong. Fantastic. I get to dive into that and figure out what the hell is wrong with that.

32:40.000 --> 32:47.000
So I worked on that and then Ingress a little bit. I haven't been playing too much though, but a little bit of that.

32:47.000 --> 32:56.000
I think that's it. Just buying games from the sale with new VR games. I'm probably not going to end up playing them.

32:56.000 --> 33:03.000
Alright, that's it for your gaming week. My gaming week, honestly, 100% Final Fantasy 15.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
I haven't even been playing Final Fantasy 14. Which is so funny to talk about those games back to back because they're so, so different to me.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
But anyway, regardless, I've been playing Final Fantasy 15. I've just been progressing in the story. I really wanted to beat it.

33:18.000 --> 33:29.000
I was going to try to beat it before tonight's show, but with the performance last night and everything I just didn't have enough hours in the week to do it for me for doing that.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
I know some people have already powered their way through the game. They powered their way through the game in like four days.

33:35.000 --> 33:43.000
I can't do the same thing just because I have other priorities I have to juggle. But I would say I've spent, I think I'm 26 hours in at this point.

33:43.000 --> 33:53.000
I mean, for me, for one game, you guys, that's pretty good. Like, again, I know I had Alan vouch for this last week, but it does look like I'm going to beat this game.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
Or I'll be that person that gets all the way to the final boss and then says, fuck this game and then quits.

33:58.000 --> 34:05.000
So one of the two is bound to happen with Final Fantasy 15. But I gotta say, I know we got into it a little bit last week when we had Shane Collin and all that stuff.

34:05.000 --> 34:12.000
But, and I don't want to repeat myself too much, but it is kind of funny because, you know, Shane and I have been kind of continuing our discussions.

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
He's actually been watching me play. I haven't been streaming on Twitch, but I've been doing SharePlay, like private streaming.

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
So he's been watching me play some of the game, which is, for somebody that hates the game so much, he sure has watched me replay a lot of it.

34:25.000 --> 34:31.000
But I guess he really wants to, like, he wants to know what I like about it or wants to see if his opinion changes on it or whatever.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
I know there is a particular chapter he did really like and he wanted to watch me play that chapter.

34:37.000 --> 34:46.000
But I'm, again, obviously keeping the spoiler free because I know a lot of people have not progressed 26 hours like I have, or even 10 hours like Loki.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
But, I gotta say, like, I think Shane and I's opinions on this game are gonna stay polar opposites.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
Like, I am really enjoying the game. I am up to chapter 13, I got to today.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
So for everybody who has beaten the game, I'll speak in vague terms, I got to chapter 13.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
And my understanding is, this is the chapter where the game shits the bed for a lot of people.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
And just reading what I'm reading on Twitter.

35:11.000 --> 35:20.000
But, I, again, trying to keep this very vague, I can see why it's very annoying, this particular chapter.

35:20.000 --> 35:33.000
But it's not a deal breaker for me yet. I think for me it's one of those things where it's like, okay, if you watch an entire series of, let's say, I don't know, Doctor Who, and there's one bad episode, you don't necessarily hate the whole show.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
You go, okay, it was still a pretty good show, just, you know, there was a bad episode or two.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
Because, honestly, I've really enjoyed all the chapters leading up to this.

35:43.000 --> 35:51.000
I still am feeling the problem of this doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game to me at all.

35:51.000 --> 35:57.000
But, I'm at the point where I would say this game does feel more Final Fantasy than the movie.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Remember Final Fantasy The Spirits Within? Remember that?

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
I would say Final Fantasy XV is more of a Final Fantasy product than that. I'm willing to move it up to that.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
That's not much.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
Exactly. I'm willing to move it up to that rank, at least.

36:10.000 --> 36:21.000
But it's still, it does start, the story does start to go places that at least involve creatures that you would know from Final Fantasy games and stuff, so there's at least some of that.

36:21.000 --> 36:28.000
But again, I'm just really put off by the whole fact that nobody can fucking cast cure. Nobody casts cure.

36:28.000 --> 36:42.000
Like, you can use potions and shit like you do in other Final Fantasy games, and there is a cure type ability, something else that kind of does what cure does, but it's, it's just, it's so off-putting to me and I can't explain it.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
Like, the fact that there's, you would expect that there's a white mage and a thief and a butt, and like, that whole system is gone.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
And it's, it's, that part is still a little weird to me.

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
But again, and like I said last week, I'm still okay with it because at the end of the day, I actually am enjoying the game.

36:58.000 --> 37:09.000
I just kind of say, okay, Rob, just approach this like it is Final Fantasy 13 versus and stop thinking that it's Final Fantasy 15 and just enjoy the game for what it is and not what it needs to be.

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
And once I kind of like let that go, I'm like, yeah, I actually kind of enjoy this game quite a bit, and I actually, I kind of like the battle system.

37:16.000 --> 37:28.000
The battle system is like, and I don't play wait mode either. I do the whole live thing. I love the whole like warping in, warping out, creating chains with people, getting other party members to use their abilities so I can piggyback off of them, trying to get behind the enemy.

37:28.000 --> 37:40.000
Like, I'm actually really enjoying that side of it. It's just not Final Fantasy battles, but it's fun. So, but that's it. Otherwise, I, otherwise I'm, yeah, I'm still enjoying the game.

37:40.000 --> 37:55.000
I feel like my opinion of this once I'm done is going to be favorable. Again, if the ending completely shits itself, like a lot of people are leading me to believe, maybe it'll knock down a peg or two, but I can say I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience of getting to where I am in the game right now.

37:55.000 --> 38:11.000
And I thought some of the, some of the cut scenes were amazing and some of the graphics and things you see, all I'm going to say is that, you know, everybody knows that Final Fantasy 15, one of its large part, one of its large things that there's a big open world thing, right?

38:11.000 --> 38:28.000
But as the story progresses, you start to, you know, go somewhere else. And the events that kind of lead to that are pretty, pretty awesome. But it does start to get a little tunnel-y. And that was the thing that everybody complained about with Final Fantasy 13.

38:28.000 --> 38:49.000
See, I kind of don't mind that because everything is still varied and different and I don't know. But I like it. So, that's me. Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster in chat says, I'm not a fan of the spell system in Final Fantasy 15. My inner Vivi isn't happy.

38:49.000 --> 39:00.000
Yes, totally agree. Like, I think that's what, that's what kind of ruins the Final Fantasy vibe for me is that the spell system is, it just, it doesn't, it doesn't connect like the other Final Fantasy games. This is weird.

39:00.000 --> 39:12.000
Dungeonbuster also continues and says, the battle system can be a lot of fun, especially when link attacks kick in with massive crit bonuses. But Final Fantasy 15 feels really rough to me. Not the best Final Fantasy I've played so far.

39:13.000 --> 39:31.000
Yeah, you know what? The game crashed on me today in Chapter 11. There's a pretty graphics-intensive sequence in Chapter 11. And the game crashed on me during that sequence. And I was like, fucking gaming in 2016. Like, what the fuck? Like, this is some bosses missing on level 30 shit.

39:31.000 --> 39:43.000
Luckily the game, the game auto-saves, so I only lost maybe five minutes of gaming time and I went, and I just played through that point again and I got through it fine. But that was a little irritating to say the least.

39:43.000 --> 40:06.000
I do think though that as much as I'm enjoying this game, if I do have to compare it to the other Final Fantasy games, which is still a weird thing for me to do, it's not going to be my favorite either. It's going to be very, very, very difficult to top Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy XIV's expansion.

40:06.000 --> 40:28.000
VI is what I'm talking about, like the mix of the technology and the magic and stuff. That was, I think, was a perfect balance. And even that battle system, I don't see anything wrong with that battle system at all. And just modernize everything. Make it more modern-looking, make it 3D. But keep it like that. What's wrong with that? That's perfectly fine.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
But I would say it's better than VIII. Bring on the hate mail. Bring it on. It's better than VIII.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
VIII was fine until the third disc. It was nothing but repetitive bullshit.

40:38.000 --> 40:51.000
And if you don't want to argue about, because I know Final Fantasy VIII is a polarizing one for people, it's better than Final Fantasy II, NES Final Fantasy II, which I think is one of the worst Final Fantasy games in the franchise. Like, out of all the games, I think Final Fantasy II is one of the worst.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
What, the NES one?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah, the NES II.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Okay.

40:54.000 --> 41:00.000
Yeah, no, god no. No, Super Nintendo II, or IV, which I would call IV, is one of the top.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
III was great.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
Yeah, III is where a lot of the future games kind of draw its inspiration, really.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
III gave us the job system.

41:07.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah. But I made a list some time ago about where I'd rank them all, and I think VIII was in last. No, well, XIV 1.0 was in last place, then VIII, then II, and then I think I, which I don't dislike Final Fantasy I.

41:21.000 --> 41:36.000
But XV is probably somewhere in that mid-lower tier. I would still put stuff like X, XIV's expansion, VI, IV. I would still put those games above XV.

41:36.000 --> 41:46.000
But anyway, let's see, looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says, still waiting for that 6-2, Square Enix.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
And JD follows up, oh man, if any game deserves a huge expanded universe, it is 6. Totally agreed.

41:52.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah, but C4 got that, and it was extremely mediocre. The after years, remember that? It was on the WiiWare.

42:01.000 --> 42:10.000
It was cool to play something new that was totally in Final Fantasy IV's engine, but at the same time, the game itself is extremely mediocre.

42:10.000 --> 42:21.000
So, I don't know if I would want them to do that to VI. Dungeon Buster points out the XII Zodiac remake is coming up too. I can't wait. I'm really excited for XII Zodiac remake.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
We'll get a VI remake someday.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.000
Technically we did, because the phone games are a remake, because they went back and redid all the art, but it's...

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Did they do VI in the phone games?

42:30.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah, they did VI and they redid all the art and all that, and it's not good. It's just not good. So VI needs a proper remake.

42:39.000 --> 42:52.000
See, I like the phone games when they just up, you know, like they did the II, or was it II, no, Final Fantasy I. They redid that, remember that? It was just kinda like 16-bit looking graphics or something like that. That was cool.

42:53.000 --> 43:04.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, no love for Final Fantasy V, which is still my favorite Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy V is an interesting one, because V, I think the story in V is just really...

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
I think it's one of the weakest stories in the entire franchise. I'm sorry, and I know people love the characters, and I know Ferris is cool and all that.

43:11.000 --> 43:23.000
I just think V is one of the weakest stories in the entire franchise, but the battle system and the job system is an insane amount of fun, and it's one of the better battle systems in the entire franchise.

43:23.000 --> 43:31.000
So it walks this weird line between, it's a lot of fun to play, but the story's just really not interesting.

43:31.000 --> 43:39.000
Compared to the game that followed it and the game that was before it, it just falls in this really weird place for me.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
But that's my personal opinion, and you know what? Obviously, opinions, we all got them.

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
And XV is apparently going to be no different. XV is the new VIII. It's just what it is, apparently.

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
Alright, we gotta move on with some other gaming news, though. First off, I want to do some quick housekeeping and announcements.

43:58.000 --> 44:08.000
So, here's the deal. We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can also follow us on Google Plus, google.com slash plus orange launch radio.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
We're on Facebook as well, facebook.com slash orange launch radio.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
Holidays, you guys have been wondering what's going to happen during the holiday.

44:14.000 --> 44:23.000
So, on Christmas Day, December 25th, we will be here. Dark Soccer and I will be holding down the fort with a special Christmas edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
And, I don't know, what will we do?

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
It'll be a first day of Hanukkah Orange Lounge Radio. No, a second day of Hanukkah Orange Lounge Radio.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Whose nuts will you roast on an open fire?

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
I'll bring my menorah.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Okay.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
We can light the menorah.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
We can do the nut roasting.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
She will roast nuts with a menorah, yes.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
Will you make latkes?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I suppose I can make latkes.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
There we go.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
But, I thought that we normally do like...

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
We do. We do. We just have to do like...

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
We should just get takeout.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Yeah, we'll get takeout. If we can find what's open.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
We like to get Chinese food.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Panda!

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Was Panda going to be open on Christmas?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
I don't know. We got full one year.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
I know. Figure that out. It'll be like a Christmas story.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
And then we went to Denny's one year.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Bleh. That was a mistake.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
You had those red velvet pancake pops.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
It was like red food coloring in generic pancake pops.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Anyway, we will be here on December 25th.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
We will have a show on January 1st, but it may be recorded in advance.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
But there will be something that week.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
It may just not be live.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
We're still working the details out on that.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
We will not be here at all January 8th, which I know is weird.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
And that's going to be the first week back for a lot of your favorite podcasts who are taking the holidays off.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
However, MAGFest is that weekend.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
And so I will be coming back from Washington, D.C. at the time that OLR would normally be on.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
So we won't be here January 8th.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
So we do the holidays late around here, all right?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So you'll just have to deal with a delayed schedule there.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
But we will be here on Christmas night.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
And the good news is that even if you have other things to do, well, that's why this is a podcast.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
And you can download it whenever you want.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
And you can subscribe wherever you find podcasts.

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
Whether that be iTunes Store, whether that be Google Play Store, whether that be TuneIn or another third-party app, you can catch up on OLR.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Whenever you want through the podcast feed.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
And I know a lot of you do listen on the podcast feed.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
So hello and thanks for being here.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Send us an email sometime.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Let's see.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
Over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell reminding us that he will be here, too.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
So we're going to have a very full night.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
It's a VOG holiday present on December 25th.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
And SHO 100 Matt says, hopefully the weather is good for MAGFest.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah, that is the thing I fear the most, honestly, is the fucking weather when I go out to D.C.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
And I just, look, my California ass can't handle a blizzard.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
So just please do whatever.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
Cross your fingers and whatever deities you believe in.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
Just make it a smooth trip for me, please.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
All right.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Let's get into some gaming news, however.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
I was expecting this to be a completely dead week for news.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
However, there's still a lot going on this week, right, Logie?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Yeah.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
So there's apparently a new law that has just passed in China that will be going to affect May 1st.

47:09.000 --> 47:16.000
And what that's going to do is actually govern loot boxes or those random crate drops that you get in some games,

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
which they're classifying them as almost a form of gambling.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
So publishers will be required to give players information about them,

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
including the draw, quantity, content, names and properties.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
Also the percentage chance that you have of actually getting the blind box item.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
So basically the, you know, percentage to win or something like that.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
I think that's a good thing.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
And yeah, they are basically gambling.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
I mean, the whole CSGO stuff is for this shit.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
So, I mean, that was actually a little bit different.

47:54.000 --> 48:03.000
But still though, I mean, I don't like this trend of paying for a full game, you know, like Overwatch and then having this shit on top of it.

48:03.000 --> 48:13.000
Yeah, I have to admit, I also kind of like the idea about companies having to be transparent about what the odds really are for some of the items.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
And, you know, I have done loot boxes.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
I've done them in games like Mass Effect, which was the first one, Mass Effect 3 specifically,

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
which is the first game that I remember doing this that had loot boxes.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
But obviously Overwatch has this as well.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
You know, and I get that it's all cosmetic.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
Everything that comes out of these things is cosmetic and nothing really impacts the game itself.

48:31.000 --> 48:39.000
But I do, in Mass Effect 3, you can't really say the same thing because you had the guns and you had the other characters that were locked in there.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
And it always starts off as cosmetic and there's a lot of things like Call of Duty used to do that as well.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
But then eventually that's not enough and then it goes beyond that.

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
But in Mass Effect 3, you could earn the in-game currency pretty fast to get the loot boxes yourself.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
So I just kind of looked at it as an experience.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I never bought a loot box in Mass Effect 3, never did.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
And I still got all the characters I wanted and everything I needed.

49:01.000 --> 49:09.000
So, you know, if the system is going to only be in-game currency, then fine.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
I don't think they need to be in-game.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Who cares about that?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Yeah, who cares? They can keep the loot to themselves if they want.

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
But I have to admit, maybe you guys can help me out and chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

49:18.000 --> 49:29.000
But I don't see the bad thing about companies having to be transparent with what is the percentage that I will get Sombra's taunt that I really want.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
Or D.Va's thing where she plays the video games and eats Cheetos emote.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
What is really the percentage chance of that?

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
And where's the accountability on the company because they are taking money?

49:42.000 --> 49:48.000
Where's the accountability on them to ensure that things are actually dropping at that rate and that they're not making it up?

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
Now the one drawback I could see is that maybe the government doesn't need to oversee that.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
And I can totally see that perspective as well as that maybe we don't need that oversight.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
But I can kind of see the perspective that this is getting into gambling a little bit.

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
And maybe not necessarily the same way we oversee slot machines in Reno and Vegas.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
But maybe a similar arm of that does need to take some of this into consideration.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
It's sort of like a lottery ticket. I mean, you're basically picking for a random outcome.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
And I honestly don't think they should be doing the whole loot craze.

50:21.000 --> 50:29.000
I'm fine with in-game currency, but if they have skins and stuff for sale, which I guess they can do that.

50:29.000 --> 50:35.000
Just offer, okay, here's the skins for this character. Here's the price point for it.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
And then allow them to choose that way instead of, oh man, I really want that taunt. Let me buy some loot crates.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
Ah crap, I got a whole bunch of repeats of shit I already have, which are completely fucking useless.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
Or I can sell it back for some low amount of currency.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
Well yeah, you do get the gold or whatever, and then the gold ultimately you can buy whatever you want.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
So it's like if you are trying to save up for that particular taunt and you just keep not getting it,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
eventually you're going to get enough gold where you can buy it.

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
But yeah, I'm also kind of with Brad from Pod Culture in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
who says that's the one flipping drawback of Overwatch that annoys me.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
Overwatch takes a long time to get the loot boxes for free. It really does.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
Not in the beginning, not in the first few levels, but later on, yeah.

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
Maybe it's just because I also kind of more casually play Overwatch. I don't play a ton of it.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
I think the people that play a ton of it probably don't have a problem getting what they want in-game.

51:27.000 --> 51:35.000
But god, I just, yeah, I'm not, I don't feel like you get enough loot boxes really in the game.

51:35.000 --> 51:42.000
But what's interesting is that now that this is going to be a law in China, what next year is the implementation or whatever?

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
May next year.

51:43.000 --> 51:50.000
So if Blizzard wants to have Overwatch in China, they're going to have to publish these numbers.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
And do you think the US won't find them?

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
So those numbers are going to be out there. Now, granted, they could change it up.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
China could have different drop rates from the US.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
But I think Blizzard would have to be a little more transparent with that.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
And I keep picking on Blizzard. That's just because that's the game I play right now that does this as Overwatch.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
But there's a lot of games that do this.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
There's some that are even worse, especially when you get into the mobile space.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah, the mobile space, yeah.

52:14.000 --> 52:20.000
You can buy $25 worth of in-game currency and you unlock absolutely jack shit with that.

52:20.000 --> 52:27.000
It's ridiculous. I watched there was an Angry Joe video that they had where he was playing a DC type of game.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
It was some DC beat-em-up game.

52:30.000 --> 52:35.000
And to unlock the characters, you had to get these cards and stuff.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
And it took 25 cards per character to actually unlock them.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
So he bought $25 worth of in-game currency and bought the chests with that.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
And he got literally no characters unlocked with all that shit.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
It would have taken more, like $50 at least, to unlock something.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Which is fucking stupid.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
But that's mobile for you.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I mean, it's just a mess.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
But that's kind of where it can go.

53:00.000 --> 53:07.000
And unfortunately, console games, whereas they have an upfront price point to them, it's starting to head in that direction.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Yeah.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Kaijuto in chat says,

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
How is this Overwatch or Rocket League not free-to-play games when they have this loot system?

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
You know, it's not that I always agree with it.

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
But just to present the other perspective, with Overwatch, you don't need any of it.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
You can be a world-class Overwatch champion.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
You can be the best Overwatch player in the world with none of the loot stuff.

53:30.000 --> 53:37.000
All of it is just taunts, art, cosmetic stuff that ultimately the actual game itself doesn't really have an impact on.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
And to be honest, most of it is ridiculous.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
And I think that's why I don't even bother to buy the loot boxes, really.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
It's because I don't really need any of it that bad.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
Like, none of the items I get in there are going to make me any better at Overwatch.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I'm already pretty bad, you know?

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
So that's, I don't know.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
I guess that's the other side of it, is that it ultimately doesn't impact the game.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Also, Overwatch is starting to come down in price.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
Like, you know, Black Friday was like 35 bucks for Overwatch.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
And I think Overwatch is not really going to be a $60 game much longer.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
And I'm kind of curious what the long-term game looks like for Overwatch.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Because it hasn't even been out a year.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
So what's going to happen next for Overwatch?

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
How are they going to keep that money coming in?

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
Is it just, are they going to rely completely on the loot boxes thing?

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Or is there going to be something else in the future?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I don't know.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Let's see.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Let's move on.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
I want to talk about some other news because we have plenty of stuff to talk about as well.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I've already pretty much talked about this in the intro.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
But just to bring it up officially here.

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
The Nintendo Switch was officially unveiled this week beyond just the trailer.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
It was actually brought to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I almost said Jimmy Kimmel.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
I always get their names mixed up even though I know they're different people.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
But it went to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And they were doing a Super Mario Run preview.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
But Reggie Fils-Aime did the whole,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Oh but I have one more thing because you're such a big fan.

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
And right there under a question mark block there it was an actual Nintendo Switch.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
And Jimmy Fallon did the dorky little Jimmy Fallon thing.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
Where he pretended to fanboy over it and all this other stuff.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Which I don't doubt that he is legit a Nintendo fan.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
But the whole thing did feel very calculated and scripted.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Like you know he knew what was under that question mark block.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Which is fine.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
Honestly that's kind of his excited look.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
He kind of reacts that way a lot of the times.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Like kind of overreacts I guess.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
Yeah he does. He does.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
But that's part of being a business person.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
Which even yes late night talk shows are a business.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
But anyway that's fine.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I'm not really shading him too bad.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
Because at least we got to see the Switch on TV.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
And a lot of people doing heavy analysis of freeze frames of this device.

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
Did you catch that whole thing about there's a European trademark symbol on the back.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
So either the device was a European device or this is confirmation that the thing is region free.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Like people are like going all out on their analysis of this thing.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
So but the good news is we're only a few weeks away from the official Nintendo unveil.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Where supposedly we get all the details.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
I'm just going to reiterate what I said last week about Breath of the Wild.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
The more I see of it the less interested in it I am.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
And here's why.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
And it's because that first time that they were showing it off at E3.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
It's like wow this is so amazing.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
And they keep showing the same shit over and over.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
It's like okay I get it.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
There's nothing new that they're showing me that's really wowing me.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
I hate to say it guys but I kind of agree with Loki on this one.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
Because in the beginning I really was feeling like oh this Breath of the Wild is going to be completely new and different.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
And influenced by these other games.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
And then to see it in motion you're like oh okay.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
It's like I've almost seen like all of the entire game already.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
Yeah it's kind of like oh okay yeah I know this formula.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Not to say it's going to be a terrible game.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Zelda games it's a good formula.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Maybe they don't need to rock the boat too much.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
So I don't know I'll still buy it I'll play it.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Of course I will.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
But anyway so yeah you got to see the Switch.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And they did the whole thing where they actually popped the device out.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
So they actually kind of showed that in motion.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
And you could see the time to transition between the two devices.

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
It wasn't instant because Reggie Fils-Aime did buy a little time when he pulled it out.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
And he kind of talked for a minute and then handed it to Jimmy.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
So there is definitely a 20 second transition.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
I still don't think that they actually have that working yet on that demo.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
I think there was two separate feeds and they had one.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Really?

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
I don't think it's the same thing because I don't know.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
It just didn't seem like that was the case.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
I think they had two separate things of the game running or something.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
But we get the idea though at least.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
Well and then in the rumors and potentials department.

57:56.000 --> 58:04.000
There is a rumor that was going around this week that From Software has Dark Souls 3 running on the Switch.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Not to say that they are going to sell Dark Souls 3 on the Switch.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
But that From Software has that going on there.

58:11.000 --> 58:19.000
And apparently From Software is currently mulling over do we release the entire Dark Souls trilogy on the Nintendo Switch.

58:19.000 --> 58:25.000
Including the DLC as some type of trilogy collection which I imagine...

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Dark Souls trilogy praises edition.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
There you go.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Something like that.

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
But you know I could see that something like that they could release on the Switch at the same time.

58:34.000 --> 58:40.000
As they do on the Xbox One, the Playstation 4, the PC and all that stuff.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
So I guess that's cool.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
But I have to admit my gut reaction to those of you that follow me on Twitter.

58:46.000 --> 58:53.000
No my gut reaction to this was don't go down this path.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Because I'm getting nervous.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
Because the games that we're seeing are Skyrim, Dark Souls 3.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Oh granted we haven't seen Dark Souls 3.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
But still this is where my mind is going.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
I can't help it when I see these rumors.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
It's last generation shit on the Switch.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Stop it.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
That's how third parties fucked up the Wii U launch.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Don't do it.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
It's got to be new stuff.

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
Or at least if nothing else, stuff you release on the Switch at the same time you release on the other consoles.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
So at least everybody has a fighting chance.

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
But if you released last year's shit on the Switch, it's going to be shot in the foot from the beginning.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
Please don't do this third parties.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Don't do this.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I'd still buy Skyrim on the Switch.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Alright well...

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
It's an older game but I'm getting a lot of use out of it.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
And I own several versions of the game.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
So it's just...

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I don't know.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
For example, I played more Skyrim.

59:53.000 --> 59:59.000
This is so weird to me that the few things you're going to throw a bone at Nintendo for and give them credit for are the one things where I'm like...

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
No!

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No, hold on.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I'm in agreement with you.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's kind of what botched the whole launch lineup with the Wii U.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Because they're like Batman Arkham Asylum or Arkham City or whatever it was.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Well that game came out last year.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
That is like a launch title.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I don't have a problem with them throwing Dark Souls on there.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
But as long as that's not the only thing that they're launching with is old stuff.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Let's see some new stuff as well.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And yeah, you can always go ahead and throw out those trilogies and stuff later on to port those older games over.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But just don't heavily rely on that.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Okay, and ActEftInChat continues on to say...

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
But at the same time, Dark Souls on the go?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I don't think that's bad.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I understand that and I understand this whole enthusiasm about Skyrim being on the go and everything as well.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
But I don't know. Maybe this is because I don't commute on a subway.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Or I don't sit down with nothing else to do for long periods of time during the day.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So maybe my perspective is just a little different.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But I just think Dark Souls would be fucking horrible to play on a portable device.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Because a game like that is so hard and so challenging.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It kind of commands a lot of precision and a lot of attention that I'm not sure I can get on a portable device.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Is that weird?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Yes?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Okay!

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I don't know.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I kind of feel like, especially if you're in a subway that's bouncing all around and moving all around you.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Well yeah, it's like a subway train would be a little bit difficult.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Or in a plane. I do a lot of portable gaming when I'm on the plane.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But I'll play Dragon Quest VII. That's okay if that bounces around a little bit or I have a hard time hearing something.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Because of the plane engine or something.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I just don't think Dark Souls would...

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I mean, I know the concept sounds awesome.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Like, yes, PlayStation 3 and 4 games. I can take Wibby on the go.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
That concept sounds awesome.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
But then in execution, I just think those games would really not be fun on portable.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I'm sorry.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We need to know.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I don't know.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
That is just my opinion.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
If enough of you disagree with me, then go by and support the game and prove me wrong.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I mean, you can go and pre-order that shit, but good luck getting it.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And JD points out, yeah, if you have two hours a day to kill on a train, it definitely changes your perspective.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And I can respect that.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But again, I just feel like Dark Souls would not be the game to play.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Pokemon is great.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
That's why those games do so well.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But not every game works the same portable as it does on the TV.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I don't know.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Alright.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Well, we'll see.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Again, those are just rumors of Dark Souls 3, so we'll see what happens January 12th.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It's going to be a big day.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Moving on.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Dark Sakura.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Well, we have some news, as I alluded to earlier, about Ubisoft.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Oh, when will people learn about insider trading?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So they have been fined, or will be fined, by the AMF, which is, I'm going to mispronounce this,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Autorte de Moche Financier, basically the finance commission in France, for being accused of insider trading,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
where they offloaded some of their shares of Ubisoft.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Before the publisher announced the delays that made their stock drop by 25%.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:36.000
However, they have sent direct messages to certain publishers saying that while they acknowledged the AMF's decision,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000
they still assert that they acted in good faith and have appealed the decision.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So they're hoping that it gets overturned, but it's pretty, at the very least, quite a coincidence,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
that they would sell their shares just prior to this happening.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And I believe that it's five different executives that are being held accountable for this.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So there you go.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Don't cheat.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Don't cheat.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Yeah, it's a tough one for them to prove, because, you know, executives, wouldn't you think they're going to know

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
when a game's going to be delayed?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
That's not something you wake up in the morning, roll out of bed, and go,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I think a game's going to get delayed today.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Well, depending on how quickly they sold their stock before that happened,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
it would have had to have been that they sold their stock very quickly before that delay happened

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and would have anticipated that the delay would also cause the stock to drop that drastically.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Because a 25% drop in value is pretty big.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So, just saying.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Let's see, DungeonBuster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.000
instead of insider trading, maybe they should figure out how to allocate funds to properly test their PC releases.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Going to need some salve for that burn.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Maybe they knew how it was running. I don't know.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I think they had to have done something.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But then again, I will point out that.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Because this all dates back to stuff in 2013, right?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
This isn't like insider trading alleged that happened like yesterday.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
This is something that happened years ago that's been investigated and now they've been fined.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I guess, alleging guilt from this organization is giving, what would you say?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Basically saying that they're guilty.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The Ubisoft Montreal CEO was fined 700,000 euros.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And everyone else between, well the smallest was 15,000 euros and then we had 100 and then 200.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So a total, approximately in American money, about 1.28 million dollars.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So, it's quite a bit of money spread across 5 people.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I mean, even for the one who had to pay the least, that's roughly.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I'd give approximately an average year's salary on the low end, middle class wage.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So, of course, if there are executives, they probably can afford it easy.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Though I do tend to see a trend that the higher up that you get on the corporate ladder, the less touch you have with the way people are working.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And so, if the delay was impending, they might not have found out about it until the memo made it to them.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So, take that as you will.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Loki, you have somewhat of a follow up to this, right?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Yeah, in regards to Ubisoft as well.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
As you may remember, Vivendi is purchasing shares of the company.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So, right now, with their last acquisition, they own 25.15% of the company and almost 23% of its voting rights.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Apparently, though, they are saying that Vivendi's been discussing their objectives for the next six months.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:37.000
They're not considering to acquire shares, depending on the market conditions, but not considering the launch of public tender on Ubisoft, nor acquiring the control of the company.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:49.000
However, though, it says a recommission of Ubisoft board directors in order to, and among other things, obtain the board representation consistent with its shareholder position.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
They're going to be seeking that.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:03.000
However, though, according to French law, though, they will need to submit a bid for an actual takeover bid if they reach 30% of ownership in the company.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yes, it looks like Vivendi wants to own a video game company very badly again.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It says that they don't, though, so I don't know. Maybe they just want...

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Actions speak louder than words.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
We'll see, I mean, I don't know.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Well, and then this whole thing, that Jamie just talked about, seems quite the setback. Like, it just primes them in ready for something like this, you know?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Maybe.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I don't know. We'll see, we'll see.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Capcom, which, you know, has been in the news recently at the PlayStation Experience.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:48.000
You know, they have the whole unveil of a new Marvel vs. Capcom game, which, by the way, Dark Soccer, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, because I know you are a big fan of fighting games and Capcom games and all that.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
What did you think of the Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite reveal?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I'm still reserving judgement.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
That's fair. Obviously, you don't want to just base the whole thing off four characters, but did it get you hyped?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Because I'd written off that we'd ever get another one, to be honest.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I had some Doki Doki moments.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Well, we have six characters, remember.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Oh, right, right, right. I forgot about the two that came later. I'm thinking about the four in the trailer. Anyway.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And remember, it's Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, and there's going to be infinite DLC Loki, so we're going to have an infinite number of characters.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
If they run out, they'll just come up with new ones.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Alright, anyway. But Capcom has also talked about in a press release that they're looking to revive some franchises that have been forgotten.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Let's see, as part of the press release, it said, quote,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:42.000
In addition to regular major title releases each fiscal year, Capcom is currently focused on reviving series that have not had new entries recently or otherwise dormant IP,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000
beginning with Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, a return for the series following a five-year hiatus.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Capcom looks to enhance its corporate value even further by utilizing its library of rich contents.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Which, I don't know, I think most of us would look at this and go, how about fucking Mega Man?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Right? It's like, would you like to enrich your company more? Freaking give back, give the people what they want.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
How about fucking Mega Man? I don't care if it's Mega Man Legends. I'll take a fucking Mega Man X game at this point.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Yeah, I don't want to take these proposed redesign of Mega Man that was supposed to be that Bomberman X-Zero type Mega Man game.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Yeah, I don't want that one. But I'll take the other ones.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And don't make it suck. Because, my God, if the creator of Mega Man... Like, I watched a documentary on that.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Like, they had a fan documentary thing about the whole Mighty No. 9 bullshit.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Oh, did they? Oh, I got to check it out.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Is that on Steam?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:46.000
It's on YouTube. It's like a 45-minute long thing that they talk about what happened with all the, like, just the whole drama from beginning to end.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Interesting.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's interesting. It's like, how could they have fucked that up so bad? But seriously, how could they have fucked that up so bad?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Just make a good game if you're going to do that.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Brad from Pod Culture in chat suggests, Mega Man Run?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
No.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I'll take it. I will take it at this point.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
What about... I'm sure Dark Soccer has got to be sitting there going, Rival Schools?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Right? Oh, my God. I would love... Or at least I would like some of the Rival Schools characters to show up in at least some of the other ones, you know.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I'm trying to...

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:36.000
What dormant Capcom... I mean, it was suggested to us behind the scenes that this would make a great List List segment.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But I don't... I don't know. You need, like, 18 different options for a List List. I'm not sure I could come up with that many.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I'll take another Bionic Commando.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Like, we'll just forget the last one happened?

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Rearmed was fine.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Yeah, that's true. Rearmed was fine.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
The 3D one was kind of stupid, but, you know, it had potential, like, on paper and, like, in the trailers.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
It was like, wow, this is going to be fucking amazing, but, like, then it just didn't quite come together.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But I'd be willing to have them try again.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I'll take UN Squadron. How about that?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Take a new UN Squadron game.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Captain Commando.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Hell yes.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Or if we want to get more obscure, we can do, like, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
You know, just all the beat-em-up.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
How about Final Fight?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Bring back Three Wonders.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Power Stone.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Fucking Power Stone.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Hell yes.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Powerful.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I wouldn't mind, though, a follow-up to Three Wonders.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Dark Tetsuya says, UN Squadron was a licensed game based off the anime or manga area 88.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Oh.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
See, 12-year-old me didn't understand all that.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I just rented a game called UN Squadron once and thought it was badass.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So, I guess I don't get that.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And, that's what you wanted to know. Matt says, Power Stone discussion over.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
No, because Mega Man is first. I'm sorry.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Yes, Mega Man needs to come before Power Stone.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
This is long overdue.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Act F says, Gotcha Force. Shut up.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Dungeon Buster says, New Magic Sword.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Ooh, fuck. Maybe we could come up with 18 games, because we need to talk about Magic Sword.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And how fucking underrated that game is.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Oh, god, that was such a good series.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Well, series of one game.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Let's see. Act Def wants to point out, Dark Soccer, there's rumors of a rival school's character appearing in Street Fighter V Season 2.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That's a character.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That's one lousy character.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
What about bringing Dark Soccer's back? Didn't they do a Dark Soccer's 3?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
They were teasing at one point that Dark Soccer's was supposed to come back.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Well, there was a Dark Soccer's 3. It was Vampire Savior.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Yeah. No, beyond that.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:41.000
They were teasing a 4, but I don't know if they actually said it got cancelled, but something caused Dark Stalkers 4 to get pushed back.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I think it was the sales of Dark Stalkers 1 and 2 on 360.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I think there was something, I remember we talked about it a long time ago, but it was something about the 360 reinventions of Dark Stalkers the first game did not do well.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
And that kind of shot plans for another Dark Stalkers game in the foot.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.000
But, anyway. Alright, we could talk about this Capcom reviving thing all night long.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
But, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see if they actually do it or not.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Dark Soccer in the meantime.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Well, do we remember Majesco?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Yes.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Do you remember what they've more recently been known for was Gone Home? Which is pretty good.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Did they publish that?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And they did, yeah.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I think they published, like, a version of it.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
The console versions.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Yeah, not the PC original.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And A Boy and His Blob.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Well, they have been acquired, actually. They're not really disappearing, but they're being merged into PolarityTE, which is a biotech company.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
They do regenerative tissue tech.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
That's weird. That's very weird.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000
In fact, PolarityTE will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Majesco, but Majesco's dropping its name and operating under PolarityTE.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And they are bowing out of the entertainment business.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And we know that Majesco's had some definite financial problems.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:28.000
The last founder of the company left in 2015, and their new leader was more of a gold mining and energy person before going into games.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So they pretty much dropped all of the entertainment, except for one recent tweet about ABC's BattleBots.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Whatever.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
But they are going fully into medical tech.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Bye!

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Do you know what by far the most important- I mean, Majesco's published a lot of games, but do you know which one by far is the most important contribution they've given to gaming?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Cooking Mama.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Yes.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
So, this effectively means that the Mama series is done.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
No, they're just- you were talking about regenerative tissue. Mama's now gonna fix that.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
No, Mama's gonna fix it. Don't worry.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Damn it, Loki. I was trying to set up for that joke, and you just jumped in there with a punchline.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:22.000
To be honest, I've been saying for years now, even back when I was at the distribution company I was at, they've been out of the gaming business for a while.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I mean, they've been hardly publishing anything throughout the year.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Are you kidding? They published Hello Kitty Party on the DS.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
So what?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
How dare you.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I wonder if they would sell those licenses.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Like Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009 and 2010?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Who gives a crap about that? I'm talking about Cooking Mama.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Maybe they would sell the licenses-

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
This is a fitness ultimatum. You're either gonna be fit or not. I choose not.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Well, if you're going into tissue regeneration, then that means that you just hack off a few ounces of body fat, and then they'll just heal the skin. That's it.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
SSG100Matt says, Mama's going into the home. Someone will be fixing Mama breakfast now. That's sad.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, Wow, I guess Majesco never really recovered after Advent Rising. Remember Advent Rising?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Yes, that was, what, 2007?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
That was a while ago. Wasn't that the whole million dollar Xbox game? That was that whole thing, right?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
That was a pretty big Xbox game, yeah, I remember that.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:34.000
That whole they were gonna give away a million dollars to whoever, I don't know, beat it or found some secret or something. Am I mixing that up with something else?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I swear that was Advent Rising.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You can't beat that one, I don't remember.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Alright.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
That's it. It made such an impression on me.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Alright, moving on, Loki. Maybe talk about some games that did make an impression on you.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Well, this is kind of funny. Sony's talking about their mobile plans now, with what, their cancelled mobile, you know, gaming device, and their cancelled Sony mobile, what was it, Sony PlayStation mobile?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Yeah. So now they're talking mobile again, because now everybody's getting into it. Everybody's citing Pokemon Go.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:13.000
My fucking god. Can we seriously stop using Pokemon Go as like the indicator that you should get in this marketplace?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Because everybody fucking wants a piece of it.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Do we not? Do we not remember fucking Angry Birds? Do we not remember Angry Birds where I was insanely successful and fucking everybody's like, oh, I'm gonna get in that market because they made it so they were so successful. How many people have actually succeeded?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Well, the guy who did Flappy Bird did pretty well for himself.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Yeah, and that was a fucking fluke. That was a fucking fluke.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Talk about a game that got ripped off.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I mean, Sony should be familiar with Angry Birds because they made the movie, or published the movie, so I guess.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
But now they're going to be getting back into mobile with some of their first party titles that were on PlayStation platforms.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So, for example, Hot Shots Golf is going to be one of the first games that's going to be coming out on iOS and Android.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000
They also have a game called No Heroes Allowed Dash.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Ark the Lad and Wild Arms are going to be rebooted on those platforms as well.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Also, Parappa the Rapper, Disgaea, and some other untitled games.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:31.000
They've got a collaboration with Square Enix. They have an original IP from ForwardWorks called Sora to Emi no Aida.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
And some collectible card game called Project Field.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
That would be, if it's T-O, that would be T-O.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Man, if only Sony had their own portable platform they could release these types of things on.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I know, I mean, really. It's really...

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Gosh, it's a shame nothing like that exists.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Yeah, unfortunately, you know, it just doesn't exist.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:02.000
But to be fair, though, as much as I can sass that point, Nintendo has a 3DS, yet they're still putting Mario Run out, so, you know.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Oh my god.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
What?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:13.000
No, I'm just looking at this picture of this thing that they have, you know, that card game that I was talking about.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Getting the, you know, Eye of Judgment vibe from this.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Oh, I thought you were going to say it reminded you of your own card game. I was going to be a little worried for you there.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Oh, no, no, no. Fuck no, I'm not making a card game. No, it's giving me an Eye of Judgment vibe from this thing.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Alright, well, moving on to another story about Final Fantasy XV.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
You know, now some of the reception is out there. A lot of people played the game.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And Square Enix talking about some of the changes that they're going to make with Final Fantasy XV.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Hajime Tabata actually made a blog post this week on the Square Enix site talking about fan feedback to the game and what's going to happen to make the title better.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And in the post, Tabata says,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Our early plans are to enrich certain aspects of the game, adding gameplay enhancements for Chapter 13, buffing ring magic, etc.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
We'll have the specifics of what and when for you at a later date.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:17.000
So, again, I'm actually playing Chapter 13 right now and it is, again, I'm really, really, really trying not to spoil.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But just like some things that you're used to as the game change and it seems like it might be like a temporary type of thing.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And so it's a little bit, it's one of those things that I feel like it's lasting longer than it needs to.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
That's the whole thing. Sometimes, like, the game gets flipped on its script for a little bit. It's temporary.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
This feels like it's lasting a little longer than it needs to.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Again, but for me, it doesn't ruin Chapters 1 through 12.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
That's, I guess, the difference I'm having than what some other people are having. I don't know.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Anyway, they're also saying, We're hoping to delve deeper into the story, adding scenes that will give you new insight to character motivations.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Such as why Ravis walked the path he did.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
We need a little time with these. They'll need to be localized and voiced in other languages.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:10.000
For the long term, we're looking at making certain key characters playable and even considering the possibility of customizable avatars in addition to other features over time.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Other features we have in mind is letting you carry over stats from a previous playthrough and adding in items that introduce new play styles.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Such as low level runs and god mode.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
We're also examining readability tweaks, increasing font size for certain languages.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:31.000
On top of that, we're looking at content you can enjoy in real time, including new bosses with exclusive rewards and achievements and limited time hunts.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I don't know how I feel about this.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
There's a lot about this I'm not liking.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Don't get me wrong. I'm cool with the fact that they want to add to the game and add this new stuff.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:50.000
But when they talk about changing story elements, now the biggest thing I'm seeing on Twitter is,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Well, guess I better stop playing Final Fantasy 15 or guess I better not buy Final Fantasy 15 because they're gonna go and change the story.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And since apparently everybody hates the story, I'm gonna wait and go play through this when they fix it.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:12.000
And I'm just sitting here going, okay, I guess I'm like the one guy who isn't understanding the big problem right now.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Like again, I think the game is fine.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Again, it's not the best Final Fantasy game, but it's definitely not the worst.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So, I don't know. I feel like that comment kind of shot themselves in the foot with that.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Like, well, there went the second and third week sales for Final Fantasy 15 because now people are gonna wait until there's a story patch to see what all has changed and all this stuff.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I mean, as far as the other stuff goes, like font sizes, new bosses with new achievements, limited time hunts, that all sounds fine.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
That's the type of, you know, continuing support for 15 I would have expected.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:57.000
But this is also just a weird, I don't know, this is just a weird place, this whole Final Fantasy game in a DLC era.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Like, I know, it didn't really happen with 13, 13-2 it did, but because of the way 13-2 was set up, I don't know, it just didn't, it's not as weird to me as something like this is.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm just, I don't know.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Loki, what do you think when you hear this? They want to patch the story. Isn't that weird?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
It's Mass Effect 3 all over again.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
But Mass Effect 3...

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I know, they're clarifying the ending.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:45.000
It was also, it was the ending. And, I don't know, again, I kind of feel like, although I enjoyed Mass Effect 3's extended cut, and I appreciate that it exists, I did not, again, have the same hate boner for the way Mass Effect 3 ended originally that everybody else did.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I understood why people took issue with it, but I didn't think it was the worst ending to a video game I'd ever played.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And sometimes video games have bad endings. Sometimes movies have bad endings. Sometimes stories have endings you don't like.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And it's, you know, again, does that ruin the entire journey of getting there? I don't know, it doesn't always for me.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I don't know, I guess an ending, if an ending is really, really, really bad, then maybe. Like, didn't that ruin The Village? The M. Night Shyamalan movie for a lot of people?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
No, M. Night Shyamalan ruined The Village.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
The signs, no, the ending of signs.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:27.000
The ending of signs I thought was fine. It was stupid, but, you know, I chalked that up as like, oh, haha, it's War of the Worlds.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I just thought that it was just kind of a take, sort of like on that, where it's like, oh, yeah, I mean, granted, you can poke a million holes through that whole movie.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
The Mist. They changed the ending from the book.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Yeah, no, I'm aware of-

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And it ruined the whole movie.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah. But didn't Stephen King say he actually kind of liked it?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Yes, which is stupid. The whole movie was great until the end, and I can never watch that again.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Yeah, no, again, even though it's a ten year old movie, I don't necessarily want to ruin it for people, but I understand the controversy behind that whole change, for sure.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
For those that don't know, it's a real downer ending. Let's just leave it at that. It's a bit of a downer.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Keep in mind, I like The Grudge.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Yeah.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.000
ActDeftInChat says, do we need director's cut of video games now? The end was fine for me, but I will.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I'm fine with them doing a director's cut thing, because they did that with the other Final Fantasy games, where they re-released them later on with the international versions, if you will, where they tweak stuff and add bosses and all that fun stuff. That's cool.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I'm fine with that. But, like, don't change the story. You can add to the story. If you want to add stuff that adds more clarification to the story, that's cool, but you can't just change the story.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I also, okay, like...

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
That's like saying, oh hey, we patched Final Fantasy VII. Eret's not dead, just kidding, it was just a flesh wound.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Oh my god, if Final Fantasy VII had existed in the age of the internet, which, the internet's infancy was happening with Final Fantasy VII.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
We still don't have the remake coming. There's still time.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Anyway, um, but I just...

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
As long as the bitch still dies.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Bring her back, bring her back.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
She's alive again! And he kills her again. Ah, she's dead again.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Eret, Eret's Resurrection DLC, just $9.99.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Oh my god, they killed Eret, you bastards!

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Maybe, would that be DLC you would buy Dark Sakura, where you could just kill her over and over again? Like, it's just, you know, different ways to see her die.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Once is satisfying.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
When was it? Okay, let's...

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I want there to be blood this time.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Now that we're like, now that we're kind of going back here, okay...

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:46.000
The fuck is a Phoenix down for if you can't fucking resurrect the bitch? I mean, like, I mean, seriously, like, well, this time she's completely dead.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
But wait a second, all these other times you've died, we've been able to resurrect you just fine.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yeah, but, eh, this time...

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
You're not reading what it says. In Final Fantasy you get KO'd.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You don't die, you get KO'd.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Killed off, yes, I got it.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And when your entire party gets KO'd, that's when you lose the battle.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
That's when you get eaten by the monsters.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And Phoenix down removes the KO status.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
That's, that's what it, that's the technicality they get you on.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Okay.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Jeez.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Alright, anyway, uh, let's move on. I, I do feel the need, I really feel the need, like, I need to finish 15. I need to see what this...

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I guess I'll play more of it.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I need to see what this clusterfuck that's supposed to happen in Chapter 13, like, I need to see, like, what is ruining this game for me.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Like, the spoil, like, the first, like, five minutes of the game.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Okay, first five minutes I don't think is a spoiler.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Alright, it's maybe not first, like, first hour.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Um, like, you get to a point in the game where you have to go to a ferry, and then you get there, and the guys, the ferry's not there, because they closed the ferry thing down.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And there's this reporter who's like,

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Yeah, I could get the ferry here, but I need you to go get me some gems.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It's like, what the fuck is this shit?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
It's like, why?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's like, I'm sorry, this train will come, but I need you to go into a cave and get me some gems.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
What?

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Well, I'm not going to try to explain side quests.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.000
But as far as the main story goes, I do want to reiterate this, like, I don't, I didn't watch the movie still.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I still have not watched the movie, I still haven't watched the anime.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I feel like I understand well enough what's going on.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I understand this game better than I did 13.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
No one understood.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
No one fucking understood 13.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
No, I kind of tease a little bit, actually.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
13 starts to come together in about the 30th hour of the game.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
But, like, I'm not, I'm not feeling that with Final Fantasy 50.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
My other feedback to that, as far as, like, the story doesn't make any fucking sense, would go,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
what the fuck did you expect from the guy who made fucking Kingdom Hearts?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000
What the fuck did you expect with a story that's suddenly going to make sense from the guy that made Kingdom Hearts?

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:03.000
If you can understand Kingdom Hearts well enough to get through the game, you can understand Final Fantasy 15.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I don't understand Kingdom Hearts.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Like, I watch the trailers for it now, and I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on at all.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Where's Mickey? Okay, there's Mickey. I don't know what the hell's going on.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Alright. Well, you know what, we gotta, we gotta take a step back.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
We gotta travel back in time.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Back to when you couldn't patch the story in games.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
If you released a game and it sucked, oh well.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
You're fucked. That's, that's just all it is.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And Dark Sakura, she's back. No radio magic needed, but she could use a lozenge.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
No, I could use it going away all together.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Well, sorry to hear it, but at least you have a classic game of the week to entertain us all with this week.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Yes, I do.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And you didn't even realize that this classic game of the week kind of, kind of starts a theme going with what we had the last couple weeks of the show.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Well, it's the theme that's ending after today.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
So, so Dark Sakura just came here to kill something off. That's what she did.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Yes, I did.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week tonight?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I picked Pokemon Pinball, which is a pinball game in the Pokemon series.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It came out on Game Boy Color in Japan, April 14th, 1999, in North America, June 28th, 1999.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Your ball is a Pokeball, and all the objects on the table are clearly Pokemon based.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Um, so you just basically have to hit points and play the different little sub-games, you know, or hit the targets or do things a certain way.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:44.000
You also have a secondary objective in the game where you have to collect all 151 Pokemon in your Pokedex in the game.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:58.000
So your Pokedex is saved, um, in the individual game, well, it's saved in between the games, so you can collect them over a period of several games.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So you have two tables in the game, one is red, one is blue, and each have its own elements.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Um, they have different locations that you play on as well that determine which Pokemon are available for you to capture.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
So as you play through it, you go and catch them.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And then when you have catch mode activated, you have a two minute window, um, that you can attempt to capture Pokemon.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:33.000
So once you activate catch mode, you have to hit the, the pop bumpers, uh, six times, and then it unlocks a sixth of, well, each hit unlocks, uh, a sixth of an image of the Pokemon that's up for capture.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
So once you get them alighted six times, and you get all six parts, then you get evolution mode.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:46.000
That's another two minute window where when you select a captured Pokemon, you can then evolve it.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Um, and then that's the only way that you can add the evolved form to your Pokedex.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
So you have to hit these particular targets on the play field once you get six targets.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Um, only three of them have what you need to do it.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Um, but you have to hit those specific targets to get this to happen.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Um, I mean it really is just, you know, it's Spinball, but cute with PokeBands.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Um, it was pretty positively ranked when it came out.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Um, it had a rumble feature, do you remember that?

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I do.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Um, although-

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
It was like built into the cartridge.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It was built into the cartridge.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000
But, um, my favorite, uh, quote about it is that it was called a waste of a AAA battery.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Um, it was novel, but I don't think it added too much to it, you know.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Um, but it, it was, uh, a pretty, a pretty fun little game.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Um, Famitsu, when it came out, gave it a 32 out of 40, which is a decent rating.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Um, and it was enough to, uh, make it spawn a sequel, which was, uh, Pokemon Pinball Ruby and Sapphire.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Um, which came out in, uh, 2003, but I'm not talking about that one now. I'm talking about this one.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:09.000
So, um, it, as I recall, I think it did, um, it didn't make it to the Virtual Console, did it?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I know the, the Ruby and Sapphire one that you don't want to talk about did.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I know for sure that's on Wii U.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I don't know about this one.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I don't think this one did.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
But at any rate-

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Sorry, I just love that the very first Pokemon this guy got was a Magikarp.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
It's LARP.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Splash.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
But that's really all there is to say about it. It's a pinball game.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
It's got Pokemon.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You can get 151 Pokemans.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Yeah, good luck with that.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Right?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000
It's probably, it'll probably be easier to fill up your decks in Pokemon Go than it was in this game.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I'm still trying to get a Ditto, you know.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
That's it. Pokemon pinball.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Pokemon pinball.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
On the Game Boy.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And Game Boy really, just get it on the color.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Because it has a lot of color in it.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Yes.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
But when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we have rapid fire news.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Mailbag and Skypline over at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
All one word on Skype.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
We will get to your emails.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Right after this.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
In Progress live tonight.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Episode 669 for this.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
December the 11th of 2016.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I can't believe we're going to be in 2017.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
And at the same time, I'm ready to be done with this dumpster fire of the year.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And I really hope next year is going to be different.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I totally expect Dumpster Fire of the Year Part 2.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
You want Dumpster Fire 2 Electric Bulu?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Electric Dumpster Fire?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
It not only is on fire, but it's shocking.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It's just absolutely shocking.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
It will drown you in lightning and water.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
We'll see, we'll see.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Well hopefully it's going to start off great.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
And I'm expecting to have a fantastic time there.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Not doing anything at least that I know of.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
With like any panels or planned appearances.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
But sometimes I like to just go to these things and just listen to concerts.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Play old school games.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I want to play more old school games this year for sure.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And yeah, I decided to just kick back and have fun.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
And hopefully find more places to eat.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
That's the other thing that's concerning me.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Is that in the freezing cold weather it's not exactly going to be easy to walk around and get stuff to eat.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000
So I really hope there's some, I hope they're getting a lot of food trucks this year.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Every food truck in the D.C. area better be at Magfest this year.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I'll put it this way.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000
We have nine years to prevent 2017 through 2020 being further Dumpster Fires.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
You know, but you would just think that the cosmos will give us like one really awesome year.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Like I don't know, and I'm not even talking about politics.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Like what could happen outside politics that could make next year awesome?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Like, I don't know, would that be like sending...

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
A meteor landing?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
The aliens being discovered.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
That might be, I don't know, that could also be scary.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Friendly aliens, Klingons being discovered.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Klingons are friendly.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Sorry, not Klingons.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Vulcan. God, I'm a horrible Trekkie.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Vulcans. Vulcans being discovered.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Like it wasn't first contact.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Not Klingons.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
That would be bad if they were first.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Well, I honestly think that any intelligent alien life would look at this planet and go,

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Fuck that.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Just keep on driving.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And piss right on off.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Just said, screw that.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:42.000
They would look at our planet and just treat it like when you're driving down the 99 and you go by Bakersfield.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
It's like these people are too primitive.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Let's not pay any attention to them.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:38:00.000
But in all honesty, I would hope that people start acting like we are a civilized society.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
That's what I would hope for.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:11.000
It may be too much to ask for, but I would like, instead of this cult of ignorance that's been fostered, especially in America,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I'd like to see people read a fucking book, study their fucking history, and get over what people look like, worship, who they sleep with.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Get the fuck over it.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I just want people to get the fuck over it.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And Betty White to stay alive.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Oh yeah.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
No celebrity deaths in 2017.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
None. Well, maybe a couple. Maybe a couple.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I don't know. Who do you think will die first?

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Betty White or Kirk Douglas?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Oh, well let's...

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
He's a hundred now.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I know, and I hate to say this. I hate to say this, but can I say Zsa Zsa Gabor?

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Okay, Zsa Zsa.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
She's one of those people where you go, how?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Right?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
How?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Preservatives.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I'm fine with her being one of the three.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
If there's certain sacrificial lambs we have to offer 2017, then it's like, okay.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
If she has to die so Betty White can live, then by all means.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Kirk Douglas. I mean, this is horrible. We're horrible people.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
We should, no, just, you know, but.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Betty White seems to be in the best health of them all.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Yeah, because she's probably still having sex.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Who wouldn't want to sleep with Betty White?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I'm serious.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Should we do an OLR quick poll?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Oh wait, that's literally nothing to do with video games.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Would you with Betty White?

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Alright.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
That's just you 100 Matt and Chet says, let's not play this game.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
That statement literally could be anything we talked about in the last five minutes.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Alright, let's talk about other video games.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I doubt.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
What?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I doubt says maybe.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Maybe? Alright.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Hey, if nothing else, Dark Sakura 2017 is going to give us Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
So let's just, let's hope for a great Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I hope that we are still free to say what we think of Mass Effect Andromeda and gather in large groups while playing it.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And that my uterus isn't going to be our right to send cupcakes to EA.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Well, besides that, and that, you know, I won't have, you know, my uterus being legislated by old white men.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Hey, I'm not that old.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
While I'm playing, while I'm playing my Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Let's hope that Dark Sakura doesn't try to be in Mass Effect Andromeda because she wants to beam the fuck off this planet.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I want the fuck off this planet right the fuck now.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:41.000
She could be in Mass Effect Andromeda since they're going to be looking for all those voice actors.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Yeah, let's hope that gets resolved too. That's not, that's not going to be pretty.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Pay our voice actors.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.000
All right. Well, and to be fair, pay the people making the games too, as well.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
All right. Just, and people that are...

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Not just pay our voice actors, but give them safe conditions to work in.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
That would be a good place to start.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Your voice is your instrument.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And as you can tell right now, a damaged voice is not what you want to listen to in your games.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Yes, if you're sick of Dark Sakura coughing on this show, you can pay her.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:24.000
You can pay for me to go, for Kaiser to not fucking go, no, you might have to cough for another six weeks.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Can we, can we start a Kickstarter to get your vocal cords removed?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Girl.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I'm just kidding.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
You left yourself wide open for that. All right.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
No, I, you.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
You took a sledge hammer and open and made your own opening in the side of the house.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
That's what I do.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
To let yourself in like the Kool-Aid man.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You're like, Oh yeah.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
I'm like, Oh no.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
You take that sledge hammer back.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
No, no Kool-Aid for you, Kool-Aid man.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
All right. News, video games, news about video games, Loki.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:06.000
So I actually had this problem on my TV as well, Final Fantasy 15, because I had set it up.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I'm like, you know, this looks like part of the picture is being cut off on the TV here.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Do they have an option to fit that to the screen?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
No. Okay. That's unusual because most games have that.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And it's supposed to be built into the PlayStation four.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000
You tell the PlayStation four how big your TV is and then all the games know that, but I'm noticing the same thing.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I'm not noticing major cutoff.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
It's just enough.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Yeah. It's just like enough where I'm like, okay, why is it getting cut off?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Because I told my PlayStation how big my TV is.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
So it forgot.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I guess so.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So, yeah, unfortunately that is an issue that is affecting copies of the game right now.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
However, Square Enix is going to be fixing that.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
They're going to be, I guess, patching that out at some point soon.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
So, yeah.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
That is kind of lame.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Also, it looks like Elite Dangerous is going to be coming to PlayStation four in 2017.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:17.000
They just announced that sometime in the middle of 2017, apparently it's going to include the Horizon season expansion as well.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I haven't heard of VR support, but that would be nice.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Please.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Just wanted to see.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:36.000
All right. Well, earlier in the show, we talked about Capcom reboots, but this is a little bit about Sega and some very old Sega franchises that could be coming back, but not as games.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
That's the difference.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Pachinko Machines?

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
No, but the good news is not Pachinko Machines either.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Oh, that's good.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So we're talking about Altered Beast and Streets of Rage.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So get ready to rise from your grave all over again.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Here's the deal.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
It's a report from Variety, so you know what that means, entertainment industry.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Sega is teaming up with Circle of Confusion and Stories International to adapt these games as potential movies or TV series.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Now, if you're a little concerned about that, you should consider, though, that Circle of Confusion, some of the shows they've been involved with, Outcast, Dirk Gently, and The Walking Dead.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Just this little show we have to...

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I haven't heard of any of those.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Just this little show we have to compete against on Sunday night on Twitter and all that stuff.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000
But it's probably not The Good Walking Dead, it's like another show that also happens to be called...

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
The Walking Dead shooter game that was on 360.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Activision?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Yeah, not the Telltale Walking Dead, which is pretty good.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Yeah, that's Activision. That's Activision's fault. They suck.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Like, their version, they also had the Fast and the Furious game, which also blew ass as well.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Now, I guess the interesting thing about these games, they're kind of generic. Like, Streets of Rage, I mean, everybody knows it for the soundtrack, and it's not that it was a bad game, but it was, like, there's not a lot of...

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Gang show.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I know, there's not a lot of stories there in Streets of Rage. Same thing with Altered Beast. Altered Beast could just be...

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Werewolf show.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Greek mythology show. Zeus and Friends. Like, that's all...

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Zeus and Friends!

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
That's how Altered Beast needs to be.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Altered Beast, the, like, sitcom sensation.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:27.000
You know what show I wish they'd bring back, and maybe Altered Beast could somehow help with this? I don't know why my mind is going there, but when we talk about, like, Zeus and Friends, I think about Xeno Warrior Princess.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And just, like, that whole mythos that existed on it, because that was tied in with Hercules, right? Wasn't there a third show at one point as well?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Was Jack of All Trades in that universe?

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
No, I don't think it was, but...

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
But, like, those fantasy shows...

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I thought he was part of the Xenoverse.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
They played Autocus, didn't he?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Huh?

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Bruce Campbell had a character in Xeno.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Yeah, I thought that was...

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
And he was a different character for...

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Jack of All Trades?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I thought that was the spinoff.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
They're telling us in chat it was Xeno, Act F says it was Xeno in Hercules only. Alright, that's fine.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:05.000
But I'm just saying, I kinda miss those, like, super, like, cheesy budget TV shows, fantasy stuff. That's what I want Altered Beast to be.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Silk stockings.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Like, FOREVER NIGHT.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Like, I want...

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I'm fine with the reboot of the Silk Stocking series. Softcore porn, hell yes.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I want the dinosaur to be, like, a guy in a pterodactyl suit.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
That's what pterodactyls do.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
It's like...

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It's like a guy with one of those...

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
What do they call those suits?

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
The, like, the green man thing?

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
They have, like, a name for it.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
The Unitards? I don't know.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Not the Unitards. They actually have, like...

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I can't remember what they're called now.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
But they have a specific name for those, like, spandex full bodied suits.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Don't Wear Me Ever? Is that what they're called?

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Yeah, there's a name for them. It's escaping me.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
But yeah, it's something like that.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
It could be a pterodactyl.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.000
They have dinosaurs, actually, with, you know, the Jurassic Park inflatable dinosaur costume that they have with the floppy head.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Brad from Paw Culture thinks you're talking about a mocap suit?

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
No, not a mocap suit. I'm gonna have to look this up now. Alright.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Anyhow, let me move on to something completely different.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
This is news that might...

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
We're having a very Final Fantasy night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000
But these are some rumors going around about Final Fantasy's 30th anniversary.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:18.000
VG Leaks is publishing this, saying they have a pretty reliable source on this information.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
But 2017 is the 30th anniversary.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
That's what they're called. Morph Suits.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Thank you. Alright, back to Final Fantasy.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
So 2017 is gonna be the 30th anniversary of the Final Fantasy franchise.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And these rumors are saying that the Final Fantasy VII remake and Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age, will be the big releases next year to celebrate Final Fantasy's birthday.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Which, you know, I would believe that at least the first episode of the remake, anyway, is gonna be ready to go next year.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And I was kind of talking about that on a previous episode of OLR where I said, you know, we finally got some of these PlayStation 4 wishes this year with XV and with Last Guardian.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:05.000
But, you know, next year they're gonna have to deliver two, and I really think Square especially is kind of on the hook to either deliver Kingdom Hearts III or the VII remake next year.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
And for some reason my gut tells me we're still gonna be waiting on Kingdom Hearts III.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
So, but the VII remake, I have a feeling the VII remake is just in XV's engine.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
It is.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Yeah, well, but that, so that makes me wonder how the battles are gonna play out.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Are the battles gonna be XV's battles?

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Because that's gonna rub some people the wrong way.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
I don't know, anyway.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:36.000
See, now if they're not, if they're not like XV's battles and are like VII's battles, that's gonna be the most fucking amazing game right there because that's how XV should have been.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
We'll see.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Anyway, but anyway, besides those games, there's some other things that are supposed to be coming next year for the 30th anniversary.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Such as the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy coming to PlayStation 4.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000
XIII, XIII-2 and Lightning Returns on separate discs and they will be 1080p and 60 frames a second.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Which, to be fair, you, finally they fixed some of the graphic patches.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
You can kind of do that on the PC.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.000
So I can't imagine that the transition to PlayStation 4 for those games would be very hard.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
So I don't want to use that word that you all tease me for saying too much.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:17.000
But this is one of those things that we've been waiting for for a while and it just, it seems like an easy thing for Square to do.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:24.000
So, we'll see. I mean, that just, I feel like if you're gonna make up bullshit, that's a pretty easy one to make up.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
So, I don't know, we'll see.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
But this is the real whopper in this whole leak or whatever rumor thing.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Is that there's going to be also a Final Fantasy 30th anniversary collection.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
It will have Final Fantasies 1 through 9.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000
All of them will be on this collection and it will be released on PlayStation 4.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
And PlayStation Vita.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
That's where I start to go, this rumor's bullshit.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
What's a Vita?

01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:01.000
But that's, anyway, 1 through 9 and they say it will have two versions of Final Fantasy 1 through 6.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
The originals and the modern ports.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:14.000
This would mean that Final Fantasy 2 and 3's NES versions will get an official English translation for the very first time.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000
7 through 9 will only exist in their newer ports.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I'm assuming that means the PC Steam versions that are out there.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Not the 7 remake, obviously, but what you can already purchase on the PlayStation 4 as far as 7 is concerned.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
This doesn't seem like too much of a stretch as far as translating Final Fantasy 2 and 3.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
My understanding is 2 is already translated.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Like, 2 is ready to go and for whatever reason they pulled the plug on it at the last minute.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
3, on the other hand, I mean, well both of those games have been translated.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
You know, there was the Game Boy Advance, right, had it?

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
The PlayStation Portable, PSP?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I know they put those games out elsewhere and they had to translate the games for that.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Well, of course, the DS version of Final Fantasy 3, of course.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
But to translate the original NES versions would be very, very, very interesting.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Because that would be the first time that a lot of people would get to play those original versions of 2 and 3.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:16.000
But again, the fact that they say it's coming to the Vita as well, to me, that debunks the whole rumor.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I'm sorry to be so negative, but...

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It could be a digital only release.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I guess.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I mean, if they're just, like, ROMs, if it's the ROM with the front end type thing.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000
You know what? ActDeft brings up a really good point. I gotta honor this.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:37.000
ActDeft says, Japan loves the Vita, though. Remember that World of Final Fantasy got released on the Vita.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Weird, but that Sony doesn't love the Vita. That's kind of odd.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:47.000
That's a good point. So if that collection exists for the Vita in Japan, it will never get released here.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Why aren't they trying to push the Vita? I mean, I don't understand this.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
They're putting out so much content for it. Like, way more than the 3DS is getting.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
But it's like, eh, fuck it. You know, whatever.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I don't know.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
It's dead to us.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.000
And then, Raginator in chat, of course, says, I would love to see the missing games show up on Steam.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Well, funny that you mention that, because, apparently, they are saying that the Final Fantasy VII Remake

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:19.000
and Final Fantasy XV will come to PC, but not until early to mid-2018.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
So, sorry, you're gonna have to wait a little while.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000
But they're also saying with this, again, these rumors, like, don't stop.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000
And that's why I'm like, the more that you put out. Like, if it had just been the XIII trilogy,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I would have been like, alright, this is gonna happen.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:40.000
But then they say Final Fantasy I, II, XII, Tactics, and Chrono Trigger, for some reason,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:45.000
we're throwing that in the Final Fantasy anniversary, will be released on Steam before the end of 2017.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:51.000
See, it's like, the more and more we add to this, the more I go, I don't know.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:57.000
We'll see. It would be great if it was all true. I think there's, for all those things I named,

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I know there's an audience for it out there, so it would be great if it was true.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Anyway, sorry, that's supposed to be rapid fire, that turned a little long, but there's just a lot to that.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Dark Sakura, what else do you have?

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Tekken 7 is getting Kuma and Panda, which technically is the same character just for Pallet Swap.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Right.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:19.000
But, we like Kuma and Panda, and they're there in all their fuzzy glory.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:26.000
And then, last but not least, it looks like there's going to be a new addition to World of Final Fantasy.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Sora, from Kingdom Hearts, is showing up. Yay.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And I think it's more to promote the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Ah, clever little bit of crossover, right?

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Yup.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:48.000
In chat, SJ100Matt wants to point out, Chrono Trigger was in the Final Fantasy Anthology disc with Final Fantasy IV for PlayStation 1.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
True that.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Good point, I forgot about that. So, alright, well played.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Well played.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Alright, let's check out what's in stores this week as we travel around the world, starting with the US.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Not a whole lot of stuff being released this week, but we do have a few things.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So, starting off, looks like Bastion is going to be out on Xbox One.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Filthy Lucre, I guess? Lucre? I'm not sure how you pronounce that.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It's going to be out on PC.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Batman the Telltale series, episode 5, City of Light, out on pretty much all the platforms.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:34.000
A game called Drive Drive Drive on PC and PlayStation 4, which is like a driving, racing game that you actually race down three tracks at the same time.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
It's kind of fun.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Feist on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Stardew Valley on PlayStation 4 this week.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000
The Little Acre on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator on PC.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Space Hulk Deathwing on PC.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Stardew Valley also making its way out to Xbox One as well.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Akiba is Beat on PlayStation 4.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Botolo on PC and Mac.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And then on Vita we have Saga, Scarlet Grace, and of course Super Mario Runout on iOS.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.000
And then that would be it.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Going to Japan, things slowing down there a little bit as well.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.000
But on the PlayStation 4 this week you have Akiba's Beat comes out on December the 15th.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And there's also some new DualShock 4 controllers in Gold and Silver that will be out this week for the PlayStation 4.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:44.000
As we talked about earlier, yes, we do have releases on the Vita such as Saga, Scarlet Grace comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Adventure Time, Secrets of the Nameless Kingdom.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Yes, Adventure Time is making its way to Japan as well, so that's pretty cool.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000
And then lastly, looking at the 3DS this week in Japan, Yokai Watch 3.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Oh, that's why this is a slower week.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
There's a Yokai Watch 3 coming out this week in Japan.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Sukiyaki is the game that's out this week.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Is that like a greatest... because there was already Sushi and Tempura which looks like it's getting some sort of box release.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:23.000
So is this Sukiyaki kind of like what Pokemon Yellow would be?

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Where it's kind of like the best parts of the first two?

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Sukiyaki is delicious.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Yes, but that would also go in line with the fact that the other two games are called Sushi and Tempura.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Both of which are?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Delicious!

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Let's see, that is it.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I'm looking at the Sega 3D archives, but sadly that's next week.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
But that looks like it's going to be awesome as well.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Dude, those Sega 3D things on the DS are pretty awesome.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Anyhow, how about Europe, Dark Sakura?

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
On the 11th is Bastion for Xbox One.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.000
On the 12th is Bridge Constructor for PlayStation 4.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:07.000
The 13th has Feist for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:16.000
And the 14th is Guilty Gear XRD 3rd Xrd Revelator for PC.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Alright, let's open up the mailbag.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangelandradio.com if you want to participate with our mailbag segment.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Again, that's participate at orangelandradio.com.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Dark Sakura's back!

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And that means I get to make her read emails once again on the show.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
You've missed her, so she's going to cough her way through a few emails tonight, but just a couple, right?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Since the last show.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Since the last show discussed anime shows the hosted scene,

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:55.000
I recently began using Netflix's download feature to finally start using my commute to watch the over-the-top revenge fantasy Kill la Kill.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Kill la Kill is great.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Which I am definitely seeing the hype for that show, although who the hell do I think I am not watching Gurren Lagann first?

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Previously, I watched the dub of Squid Girl slash Shinryaku Ikamusume.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Though, I'm sorry, through, which was cute enough, although I don't see nearly enough mention of that one in the anime circles.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I also, just for the heck of it, got the Cowboy Bebop box set, always a classic.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I've seen the first two episodes up to now.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Just to ask a rather unrelated animation series, by the way, am I imagining things,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:41.000
or was the DuckTales-era Disney cartoon Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers supposed to be in some way a spiritual follow-up to The Rescuers?

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Um, no. Not really. Not to my experience. It was more just a scenario for adventures.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:59:01.000
But, um, the only anime that I've watched recently is I watched all of Danganronpa, Future in Despair, and then Hope.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Which, don't watch it unless you've played the other games. It won't make much sense.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I was going to say, you missed last, I don't remember if it was last week or the week before,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
but somebody had emailed us, like, looking for anime recommendations.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
You know me, I went blank, because I don't watch a lot of it.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Loki had some good ideas, and the chat helped out a lot, too.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.000
But Dark Sakura, I know you used to watch a lot. I don't know if you do as much anymore.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Well, Attack on Titan season 2 is coming out. Or Shingeki no Kyojin is the Japanese name.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Um, I've really been out of those circles for a while.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Um, I tried, the last one I tried to watch with any seriousness was Gachomon Crowds,

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:46.000
which, it ended up just completely not being good at all, because it's not real Gachomon.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I know Tatsunoko produced it, but it's not fucking Gachomon. So, no.

01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Um, I've watched, um, Macross Frontier was pretty good. It's a little old now.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Um, and there was a Trigun OAV that came out not too long ago.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Um, and then of course I've seen some of the Ghibli movies that have come out, so.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Yeah, that was my best suggestion. I mean, everybody talks about them for a reason.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I always tell people to start with the classics, though. I mean, and actually, and this one was from Robert M.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Um, I've got the Cowboy Bebop box set that came out when the series was still relatively new,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000
and we marathoned all of it in one night.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Um, if you're looking for something around that era of anime, you could also look for Trigun.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
That, you know, that one's really good.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.000
If you like Cowboy Bebop and you want something a little bit more raunchy, there's also Space Dandy,

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:52.000
which is by the same, uh, artist. It's definitely out there. It's pretty fun.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Um, and, uh, goodness.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Let me get, while you brainstorm, let me get to a chat comment here.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Raginator in Chat says Netflix has a download feature.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Yeah, that was, uh, that was a pretty big deal in some of the news, uh, tech news like last week or the week before.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Yeah, certain titles.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Yeah, not all of them, but certain titles you can now download.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And he asked a follow-up question. What's to stop people from abusing that feature by pirating the shit out of videos?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000
My assumption is that they're encoded somehow, probably using some PC or personal information as the key.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:31.000
So that way, if it ended up on a website, they'd know who did it and it wouldn't be viewable without your ID or something like that.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:38.000
So that's my guess. I don't know that to be true, but I would assume that something with the technology of Netflix behind it

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:44.000
probably has the power to encrypt the file, uh, that your device only can view it.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And also, as far as, like, androids, I guess, are a little different, but as far as, like, the iOS devices,

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
it's not exactly the easiest thing in the world to go pull a file.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I mean, yes, I know there's third-party apps that do it, but it's not, like, something everybody uses.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
No supported way.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Yeah, exactly. So, anyway, any other quick anime recommendations for the next month?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Off to the top of my head, I tell everyone, of course, to go back and watch the classics. Watch Gachamon. It is the best.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Fair enough.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Um, the last one actually has already been covered in a topic. It says, Greetings, Peoples, and there's a link to the Vivendi article.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Sure.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Um, this week I saw another development in Vivendi's bid to take over Ubisoft.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Um, I heard people decrying this action for months, but have yet to hear an answer to this question.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Why is this a bad thing?

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Uh, staycare, entertainment, trainer.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.000
The most simple answer I have for that is because some of Activision's worst years were under that.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
That's right, Logie. That's pretty much the quickest answer for that.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Why people are afraid about the Vivendi thing.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Um, yeah, I mean, just I think how well they did with Activision, basically.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
That's essentially what it was.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Kill off Sierra Games and like all of it.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Uh, yeah.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Westwood.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
There was that, yep, there was that whole stuff with like King's Quest and then the whole like...

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Or Westwood, that might have been EA.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I don't know.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
But still, um, yeah. In a nutshell, that's part of it.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Um, I think at the end of the day, if the games are there, nobody's gonna care.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.000
But, I think that it's, their track record is what concerns people.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Alright, that's it for emails.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
We are almost to calls, but we have a few more stories before that.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Starting with Logie.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Alright, um, so this is pretty cool that...

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Thank you.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Um, Valve is doing a major update for, uh, Dota 2.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
And so now this is a 7.0 update.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
They're doing, I guess it's in a test client right now.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Um, and they're calling the patch the New Journey.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.000
So, what they're gonna be changing on that, the user interface has been reworked.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
They're, I guess, opening up more space on screen so you can see more of the action.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Uh, they're also, uh, big gameplay changes have been made, including reworks of old heroes, a branching talent system.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Um, they're saying, like, in Heroes of the Storm, a small fountain strewn around the map to allow characters to swap inventory while away from their base.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
And the map has also been altered.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
There are, um, also some other changes they made as well.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:27.000
A new backpack system allows, uh, players to compete in multi-part items without having to return to base.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
And also, three heroes have received model updates.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Looks like Slaughter, Viper, and Enigma.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:45.000
And then also, users can now script computer-controlled characters when creating custom game modes.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
So, quite a bit of stuff, it looks like.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I need to go back and revisit Dota 2, clearly, because that's, uh, that's a lot of changes, uh, in this game.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Especially, like, when they change the interface, uh, a lot to, you know, uh...

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Yeah, it's very minimal now, so that's kinda nice.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000
That'll be, I'm sure that'll be good for people that stream this game, uh, quite a bit.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000
So, yeah, I gotta, I have to admit, guys, you know, I don't, there's a lot of those lane games out, right?

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
You know, you got League of Legends, you got Dota, you got Heroes of the Storm, Smite is a lane game.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.000
You know, there's a lot of these out there, it's, it's hard for me to follow them all.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000
But I know this is, like, an insanely popular title, especially on Twitch.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And it seems like this is, like, a global, like, there's a huge global following for this game, right?

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Yeah, definitely.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:33.000
So, uh, but I'm very curious about the fact that they also put in the branching talent system, similar to what they have in Heroes of the Storm.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So, um, maybe they're trying to make it a little more accessible, or easier for people to understand, I don't know.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Anyhow, uh, lots and lots of news on Pokemon Go these past few weeks.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Uh, dataminers went to town on a new version of Pokemon Go that was pushed out to devices.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Uh, the Silph Road is the, uh, is it the Reddit or the website? I think it's both. It's a Reddit and a website.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Yeah, it's both.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Uh, that really goes to town on Pokemon and Pokemon Go.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
And, uh, they did some datamining of the game.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:06.000
And, uh, they found, within the game, the sound files for 100 new monsters.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
That would be the Gen 2 monsters.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
They're not able to find graphics, though, because apparently graphics went back server-side.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
So, you can't see the graphics, uh, in these patches anymore.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:22.000
There is also a new section for Shinies, which, uh, I'm sure if Shane was out there, he would perk up.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Actually, I did, I did message Shane as soon as I saw this.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I said, Shane, did you hear about Shinies and Pokemon Go?

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:33.000
And he's kinda, like, he was not, he did not go, like, oh, I gotta play it again.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
He was kinda, like, eh.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
So, I don't know. I think, I think it'll be all about implementation.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
How are Shinies gonna be in there? Who knows?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:45.000
But what's also interesting in the datamining, you're supposed to be able to add costumes to your companions.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Uh, a holiday section is one of the ones that's there.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Uh, there's also gonna be avatar customization, including sponsored content.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:58.000
And, uh, Pokemon will now have genders outside of Nidoran male and female,

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000
which would be in line with what happened in Gen 2 in the main games anyway.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
What about my non-binary Pokemon?

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Uh, in the Pokemon games, as of Gen 7, that doesn't exist.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Damn them.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:21.000
So, um, but anyway, um, so, that pretty much confirms that Gen 2 is happening.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
It's just a matter of when.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Well, that when could be as soon as Monday, uh, tomorrow.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
By the time you hear this, perhaps.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Uh, apparently, Niantic is gonna be doing a huge, uh, release of information on Monday.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:40.000
They have actually said so much as information on new Pokemon coming out Monday.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.000
However, a lot of folks jumping to conclusions that that means Gen 2.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:52.000
But before you get your hopes up, I wanna remind you, there are three legendary birds that you still cannot get in Gen 1.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
They could do a holiday event that will involve those birds.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:00.000
And that would be new Pokemon. So, lowered expectations, people.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:06.000
But the fact that the sound files exist, I mean, it's very clear that they will implement Gen 2 at some point.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Yeah.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
It may not be Monday.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Meanwhile, though, uh, sponsorships galore for Pokemon Go, including a Starbucks just went live, uh, on Friday at 11 AM.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000
7,800 stores turned into PokeStops and gyms.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Most across the street from each other.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Right? Or, like, at least one year my work, um, it's right next door to what's a grocery store called The Nugget that I don't think probably exists anywhere but Northern California.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Um, but The Nugget is a PokeStop. So, literally, you have two PokeStops, like, right next to each other that you can hit from Starbucks.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Because they're both, uh, the one was a portal in Ingress. Which, by the way, none of these are portals in Ingress.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Thanks, Niantic.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Thanks, Niantic.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Now we have, uh, diversion. Well, did the Union Banks go into Pokemon Go? I didn't check for that.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
They did go into Ingress?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Yeah, Union Bank went into Ingress. When SoftBank, uh, acquired Union Bank, those all became, uh, Ingress portals.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Like, in Roseville on Douglas Boulevard. Sorry to get local, guys, but I have to for Loki.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Uh, on Douglas Boulevard by the Mongolian BBQ, we really like. You know what I'm talking about?

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Uh-huh.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Not, okay, there's a Union Bank there, and that's now an Ingress portal.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Eh.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
But I don't know if it's a PokeStop. I didn't check.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I'm still not interested in the fact that the Circle Ks became Ingress, uh, portals.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Because they don't have the cool, like, where you buy stuff from there and you get the, you know, receipt with code that you can turn into items.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Yeah, yeah, no, and the hint water thing went away, too.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Um, but anyway, so, yeah, all the Starbucks, and there's a Frappuccino that they advertise in the game, but they don't advertise it in stores.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:45.000
And so you can actually order this at the, and they know how to make it, because this whole thing got leaked through an internal memo anyway.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:52.000
But the, um, the frappe, which I actually ordered one yesterday, because I was just like, fuck it, I'll try it, and, you know, see what it is.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:10:01.000
It's a vanilla frappe. There's no coffee in it, so it's a non-coffee frappe. It's vanilla, and they put blackberries in it and blend it, and then I think some raspberry sauce?

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Get it? It's berries. Because Pokemon Go, the berries, get it? Anyway.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Um, but, I have to admit, I don't know if I walked in on something else going on, but I feel like the employees at Starbucks laughed at me when I ordered the Pokemon Go thing, and that really wasn't cool.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Like, don't fucking have this promotion where people are giving you money and then laugh at people who are buying them.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000
But I don't know, what are you uh-oh-ing there? Oh, did you get your ditto here?

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Yep.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000
There's a ditto out?

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I just got a ditto.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Hey, Alan! Alan!

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
It's a Pidgey!

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Ditto!

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
It's a Pidgey.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Have you caught a ditto yet, Alan?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I have not.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.000
He's got his phone out. Loki's got his phone out.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
I sort of want to do it.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Yeah, apparently dittos hang out at the house.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Alright, um, where was I going with that? Oh yes, so that is not the only sponsorship that's happening at Starbucks, but Sprint also announced that Sprint stores will be turning into Pokestops.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.000
It's weird, though, because the Sprint announcement came first, but the Sprint stores are still not Pokestops.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.000
But I believe that happens on Monday, is when that whole thing starts.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So, gonna be lots of new Pokestops popping up between Starbucks and what used to be Radio Shack.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
So, there you go.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And he ran away, that asshole.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Everybody in chat is going, this is not a drill, ditto alert, stop the show, ditto alert.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Another Rhyhorn, though.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I just think it's great that right after you catch it, it goes, oh?

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Alright, anyway, let's move on, whoever's next, because I'm not looking at show roll, because I gotta catch this Pidgey wink.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I guess that's me, isn't it?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Yes, well you already caught the Pokemon anyway.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Whatever, I have to post it all over the internet.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Nintendo is, looks like the Nintendo Switch is going to have GameCube titles on it via virtual console.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Eurogamer heard from three separate sources about this, and that they've already confirmed three titles.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, and Super Smash Brothers Melee.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:14.000
There's also a possibility that Animal Crossing might be included, so everyone can go back and play the old schoolness of the old Animal Crossing.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:23.000
They're also saying that there should be an update program where you can upgrade previous virtual console purchases to use on the Switch, instead of having to buy them again.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
So, let's hope so.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Uh oh.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Oh, oh, because we all heard Loki take a breath, isn't that why we're O-ing?

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000
No, I was just thinking, yeah, I'm sure that's going to work, just like the stupid virtual console shit that we're in the fuck.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Hey, you know what? I gotta say, I gotta say this.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:48.000
The classic NES is the best interface I've seen yet for the virtual console.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:57.000
So if those guys are doing the Switch's virtual console, then I am cautiously optimistic, I think is the best way to put it.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I'm cautiously optimistic.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:05.000
But I guess this is all really rumor anyway, and we won't really know until the 12th of January.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Aw, Alan, come here. Alan has to tell this story on air.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Alan, he's probably, he might be in the middle of playing Morrowind, however, though, because I know he's been playing that recently.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Or, come here, Alan, you have to tell this story to the listeners.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Because the listeners are commenting, it's been a while since Pokemon go, derailed the show.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:37.000
So Alan, who I woke up out of slumber one day to say, there's a ditto outside, get it, and then the Pokemon was already gone by the time he reached over and got his phone.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
What happened with this ditto just now?

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:47.000
I threw two Ultra Balls, I went straight for the big leagues, I got a great throw and a nice throw, and it broke out both times and then ran away.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
So I didn't get shit.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:50.000
You know what?

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
What?

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
I used a regular Poke Ball and it was red.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Yeah, because we didn't know it was a ditto until you caught it.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Yeah.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:04.000
I'm sorry, Alan. Alan, I have two, so when they finally release trading, I'll give you a ditto. How's that sound?

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
That's fine.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000
If I find another one, I will alert you to its existence.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
We are on ditto alert here at Studio N7.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Who cares about baby watch? This is ditto watch.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Yeah.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Ditto!

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Who cares about babies?

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Ditto!

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:33.000
In a move that I'm sure is going to make for incredibly great movies, or not.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:40.000
We have Will Ferrell starring in a movie based off an esports player.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Nope.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Yes, so...

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Nope.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Nope.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Nope.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I don't even need to know anymore about this movie.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Nope.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
But hold on.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Nope.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
It's written by the guy that did the script for the SpongeBob SquarePants 3 movie.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Nope 2.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.000
And apparently he's going to be a similar character as the one he played in Talladega Nights.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Nope.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Will this be insulting to video game players?

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Yep.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Yeah.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Yeah, SSG100Matt in chat says, surprise, this wasn't an Adam Sandler movie.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
No, Adam Sandler now has that deal with Netflix.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
So that, because fucking everybody's on Netflix now.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.000
But Adam Sandler has that deal with Netflix where now his movies just go directly to Netflix.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000
So you don't have to tell or admit to anybody that you're watching them.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
So.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I just, I mean, I like Will Ferrell.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
I mean, I think he's funny.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000
But there's no way this movie's not going to be completely insulting to everybody.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I know.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
I'm very worried about it.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I don't know.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000
I mean, I guess, like, Talladega Nights was insulting to NASCAR fans.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
So I don't really care about that, but I mean, you know.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.000
And I'm not really huge into esports, but like, can we get past the stigma like,

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:00.000
oh my god, there's people who play games for, for like, you know, professionally.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Oh, the what nerds.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I mean, like, what year is this?

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
I mean, seriously.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
That we're devolving this as, like, funny.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:14.000
But yet, you know, we are all impressed when there's football players in their late 30s and all this stuff.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
It's like, I don't know, it's a bit of a double standard, but anyway.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Whatever.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Yeah.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Anyhow.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Moving on to other news.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Darksacra, where did you find that Psyduck?

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Right here?

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
I just hatched it.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Sorry.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Oh, you hatched it?

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Yeah.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I keep finding Rhyhorns in your front yard.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Yeah, I know.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
There's tons of Rhyhorns and tons of Pikachus.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Here.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Anyway.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
How have I not caught any more Pikachus?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I need a Raichu.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
And the rest of y'all stopped playing Pokemon Go.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Yeah, I did, because it's fucking boring.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
At least I didn't go back to Ingress.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Hey, watch it.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.000
All right.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000
We could use your help, you know.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
I did find someone, by the way, working on the portal by my house.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Did you really?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Yeah.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Did you pull over where you're like, green or blue?

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
And if they said blue, I'm calling the cops.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
No, I can't.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
I always see people stopped at places.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.000
I could see.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000
It was, they were blue.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.000
It was one of our neighborhood people, but I didn't see anything.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Because I was like, I didn't want them to know I was a Defector.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Oh.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
We need Defector.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
I didn't go green.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.000
I went to Pokemon Go.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Oh.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Which is better.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Whatever.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Anyway.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Ingress was giving me stress.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
On Pokemon Go.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
It was making me throw up because I'd get mad at the red team.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.000
There's no fucking red team.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Not red.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I meant green.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Did you know what game you were playing?

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Where were you with the green team?

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Did you?

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Who are you?

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
You know what I mean?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
She was the fucking mole the whole time.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
No, I wasn't.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I mean.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
That's why our farms get smashed.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
It was you.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
No.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
You know what I mean?

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
I know what you mean.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000
It was that same person who had pissed me off, so I finally just stopped playing.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
All right.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Look.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Anyway.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Moving on to our final news story tonight.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Speaking of tragedy.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
The show?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
No.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Konami, actually.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000
That's a big tragedy.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Okay.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
That counts.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
It's a story about Konami.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Do you remember a few weeks ago on the show, we talked about the Castlevania remade game,

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
which was being made in Unreal Engine.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000
It was a fan game.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.000
It was going to remake all of the NES Castlevania, but within the Unreal Engine, and it looked

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
really good.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Y'all know the rest of the story.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Where am I going with it?

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
This is why we can't have nice things.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
What's the punchline, everybody?

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
What happened to the Castlevania remake?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Konami will sue.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Cease and desist.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
That's right, y'all.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Castlevania dark-sided C and D. That's it.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Cease and desist sent from Konami to the developers, and Deja Wolves, which was the developer,

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.000
announced that all updates and production of the game was ordered to stop.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:48.000
However, also said that they have been allowed to keep the files for now, and still hopeful

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
the development can continue in the future.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
He's talking to someone from Konami UK about acquiring an official license.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Here comes the Kickstarter.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.000
That way, he can continue to work on the game.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
So, interesting that the files are still out there.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000
At least perhaps this presents an awareness that once it's on the internet, it's always

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
on the internet, and it wasn't going to go anywhere.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
So, maybe there's that, if nothing else.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000
But for now, no more work to come on that game.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:22.000
For what it's worth, as much as we envision that Konami is nothing but a pachinko company now,

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.000
perhaps they are going to put their foot in gaming once again.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:36.000
There's a recent, what is this, a trademark that was filed by Konami for Turbo Graphics.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
What the fuck is Konami doing involved with Turbo Graphics?

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Well, remember, the Turbo Graphics was from NEC and Hudson Soft.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.000
And who bought Hudson several years ago?

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Many years ago at this point.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
That was Konami. Yep.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:54.000
So, Konami technically owns basically those IPs in that license now.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
So, Konami filed a trademark for Turbo Graphics.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
It was filed on December 1st.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:04.000
A lot of different classifications, including video games and game consoles.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Kanye West album not mentioned.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
I don't know if you all know that.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Did you know Kanye West working on an album called Turbo Graphics 16?

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I mean, he's had some personal difficulties that are going to delay that album a bit.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I don't fucking care.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I know, I know.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
But anyway, so what does this mean?

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Will they be bringing, I think this is very clear exactly what it means.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I see NES minis on the shelf.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
I see classic Genesis stuff on the shelf.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
You mean Phil Collins?

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Right.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:41.000
So, I'm sure this just means a mini Turbo Graphics 16 will be on its way before too long.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
I want it to play HuCards.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:49.000
If it had, oh my god, what if it actually had like duo hookups and had a built-in arcade card?

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I would weep happy tears because then I could finally play the Super CD version of Strider.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I wouldn't expect it.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000
But maybe that version of Strider will be built into the device.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I doubt that seriously.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I doubt it.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
I think it'll be, ooh, it's Bonk and Keith Courage all over again.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Yippee yay.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
It'll be all the same stuff they released on Virtual Console.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Which would at least include Aliens Crush and Devil's Crush.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
So maybe this isn't the end of the world.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
What? Those games are awesome.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000
They are, but I'm just thinking of the other ones.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I mean, at least, I mean, can't we get like Legendary Wings or one of the...

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Crap, what was one of the other?

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Crap, I forgot.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
I think it was one of the Thunder Force games.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I don't know.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Alright, maybe you know and you want to call us to tell us.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.000
We're going to do, I know, we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lawns Radio on Skype,

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.000
but before we get there, one more story, right, Jamie?

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Yes, and this is just a little bit of interest.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:58.000
There have been very bad Akira games that came out, and we all know what Akira is from the movie, right?

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:07.000
And manga that involved Kaneda and his awesome bike and Tetsuo who got really screwed over in the end.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:23.000
But a guy named Patrick Scott Peterson got his hand on four copies of an unfinished prototype for a Game Boy version of an Akira game.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:31.000
And they were all at different build stages as well, so he was able to go through and see how much of the game had been done.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:40.000
It kind of, the first levels play like Excitebike to be honest, you know, complete with, you know, obstacles and jumping ramps and things.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.000
But then it had platforming levels as well.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000
It didn't really have much in the way of all the graphics done.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:23:00.000
There were plenty of placeholders left, and it had like the same stage over, but it had the final boss in it, which was the kind of messed up Tetsuo from the end of the movie.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.000
But the placeholder music also was really terrible.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I don't think it had anything really to do with the series, but it was interesting seeing it.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:19.000
And I like when people find just those little prototypes after, you know, when you're finding these unlabeled copies.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.000
And lo and behold, it's something that was never released, so that was pretty good.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Little unearthed treasures, even if it was probably not that great of a game.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:34.000
It's like the type of, you know, treasure, like when you find dog poo.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
It didn't look very fun.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Skypline's open, y'all. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:47.000
If you want to give us a call, we will take your calls about something we have talked about, or perhaps something we haven't.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:50.000
We'll find out. Let's get to it, though.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
We got the Skype line lighting up, but we'll start off with this call.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Hi, this is Bobby from Atlanta.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Hi, Bobby. It's nice to have you.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000
You know, you are kind enough to have us on your show every week.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:05.000
It's nice to have this show graced with your presence once in a while. Thanks for calling in.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Yeah, so I'm asking for some receipts.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
All right.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Because there was an assertion, or an accusation, really, made on this fine program of yours several hours ago, way back in Part A.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:27.000
And I'm trying to figure out, like, I want to see the receipts, because it doesn't seem plausible to me that a company named Nintendo,

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:33.000
four months before they are supposed to release a new console thingy to the world,

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:40.000
has not actually figured out the core gimmick technology of that console.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:47.000
And I'm trying to figure out why it seems, because I watched the video on The Tonight Show again,

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:53.000
and I noticed that, you know, when they were on the screen, they moved the character and moved the camera,

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:57.000
and then when the tablet had the game on, it was in the exact same place.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And I'm hearing on this show that it was faked with two feeds.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:07.000
And I'm wondering what clued you into that, because I am not seeing this.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Well, because the vast delay between switching from their overhead screen to the other screen. There you go.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.000
That's it?

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:21.000
So how did they get the camera position in the exact right space on the tablet?

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I don't know if it was in the exact space.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:34.000
I mean, if that's really good of them to watch and have a second person move the, or put the main feed on the same, at the same place before they shut it off.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:39.000
And I had theorized in chat, I didn't say this on air, but I theorized in chat when this topic was coming up,

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:47.000
was that, well, I could see that they perhaps do some pre-recorded things to prevent a technical foul,

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:53.000
especially because the environment of a television studio live TV broadcast is not somebody's living room.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
And Tonight Show is not live. It is live to tape.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Well, I guess, okay, that's true. That's fair. Well, they still wouldn't want to screw. It is in front of a live audience, however, still.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Yes.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:06.000
So they probably want to minimize those types of screw-ups. So that I could see.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.000
But when Reggie did whatever he did, like he was talking to buy time or whatever,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:19.000
I figured that what he's hiding is that, yes, there is a transition time between moving it from the dock to the handheld.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000
And that's, but that's okay. Like if there's, I mean, it wasn't more than 15 seconds.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.000
And so I think that's reasonable. But, Loki, do you still think it was faked?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
I just don't, I don't think that necessarily technology is not working.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I just think maybe what their, whatever dev unit they're using out there isn't ready to do that.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000
But they're four months away from mass production.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Right. And I'm not saying that...

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Do you really think, like, do you think it's not coming out in March?

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Because if it's not working on their dev units now, they're not going to have a production ready in four months.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I don't know what's working on their dev units, to be honest with me, but honestly, I don't care.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000
So it just doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel true to you.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Yes, it doesn't feel like, okay, let's put it this way.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.000
It doesn't feel like the initial thing that they showed off on their trailer, if you will,

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
which was totally faked. The trailer was totally faked.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Well, right.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Because they even said the actors were playing with a blank screen.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:21.000
All the screens were put in post-production in the three-minute teaser trailer.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Okay, so now we're starting to find some common ground here, at least, in trying to mediate this whole thing.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I feel like now I'm starting to see where the thing is.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.000
So, Loki, you're seeing, like, this does not function the way that it functioned in the trailer.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Well, it just doesn't seem like that, like, it was odd that he was buying time.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Like, and I'm always curious when someone's buying time for something.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Okay.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
It's like, well, what are you not showing me?

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Okay, okay, so then that, so it's the buying time that leads you to suspect something's fishy.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Yeah, I just figured that they're showing kind of an example of what it looked like on this, you know,

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
version of the device that they had, that maybe they had two devices.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
One was hooked up, you know, via HDMI to their display or whatever it was,

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.000
and they had a second one that was, you know, running the game on the tablet,

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
and just to kind of give you an idea of what it looked like.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.000
And they were just amazingly able to get the camera angle and the character in the exact same position

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.000
on both of those on live national television.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Yes, sure, why not?

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Because Occam's Razor says it was all the same device.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.000
True, but Nintendo's Razor says that I don't believe they're bullshit, so, you know.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:37.000
So it just doesn't fit your worldview, so you're going to make the truthiness of it couldn't have been real

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.000
instead of the more likely scenario of it was actually real, and there is something in the dev unit

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:45.000
that caused him to have to buy time for 15 seconds.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I really don't care. Like, I literally didn't care at all because the footage they were showing me

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.000
of Zelda Breath of the Wild was unimpressive, because I've already seen that bullshit.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.000
But you see, it's still a huge accusation to say they haven't figured out the tech for months before the show's coming.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Did I say that? Because I sure as hell did not fucking say that.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
You did say that you don't think they figured it out yet, which is why they had to fake it.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000
They're online they haven't figured out yet.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I was talking about the fact that they have always online for the stupid Super Mario run.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000
I said that's where they're behind. I never said they didn't figure out the tech switching between a screen,

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.000
and obviously this is the only gimmick that's on that machine.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:25.000
I would hope that they have that figured out. Never did I quote that they didn't have that part figured out yet.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Because I would have probably asserted that that system would be delayed if that was the case.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Alright. I love you, Loki.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Good talk.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Alright, it was a good idea. I feel like we worked it out.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Hug it out, hug it out.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I saw some receipts. I maybe didn't agree with the receipts, but I saw them.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Alright, fair enough. And I also feel like, okay, I feel like when we kind of hit on the differences between the trailer

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:55.000
and what we saw on the Tonight Show, now we're starting to, I'm starting to see what the difference is.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:01.000
I just wish there was some new footage for like, like we've seen the same damn area of that map for like ever now.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
January 12th. 31 days.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
January 12th. 31 days.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Like even what they showed off at the Game Awards where it's like, it's like we've already seen this shit.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Like, come on. Just like, show us something new. Different. That's like, wow, that's really got me interested.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Let me, let me ask this, and I think Bobby, you'd want to stay on the line for this one.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Let me ask this. What, what would it take on January 12th for you to be like, okay, I was wrong. I'm pre-ordering a Switch.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Well, I already want a pre-order one, but like, how about, how about this?

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Hi, Bobby. Thanks for the call. No, I'm just kidding.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:41.000
No, how about this? That we're not going to fuck up our stupid supply and demand shit and they're going to be available in stores.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
So you want, you want Reggie to say we're not going to fuck up our supply and demand?

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Well, I want them to actually not fuck it up because I don't care what he says, you know, what will happen in stores.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Yeah, we just didn't anticipate the demand on this system. Bull fucking shit.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:58.000
You know what, Loki? I, I honestly, I think you, that is a completely fair criticism.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:02.000
It's a completely fair criticism of Nintendo based on their track record of the Wii.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Yeah, don't get me wrong. I like Nintendo's system.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.000
The Amiibos, the, probably would have been the Wii U if more people had been into it, and the classic NES Mini.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I mean, we do have a pattern.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:16.000
It was still the Wii U. Even when that first came out, even though that many people weren't into it, it was still the Wii U.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000
All right. That, that, Bobby, I would say that's a fair criticism, right?

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Yes, absolutely.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Absolutely.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
All right. I hope they don't fuck it up either.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Like, like, come on.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
It's so refreshing to hear you swear on this program.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Well, it's just like, I mean, you don't have your, you don't have any idea how to do supply chain at this point.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000
I mean, come on. I mean, who's, who's actually going to believe that at this point?

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:40.000
It's just the fucking drive up the hype because, oh, people must have it.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Put it out there so people can actually buy it.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000
The fact that units were available for the Wii U wasn't what killed the Wii U.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:51.000
It was because there wasn't software to support it.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And again, I, I stressed this last week, I'm stressing it again.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:01.000
You better be ready to do your pre-order on January 12th if you want this thing in the first six months next year.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Because I don't trust Nintendo's track record either, and I don't think anybody here does at this point.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Especially, especially which has me very suspect right now.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:13.000
We're talking, like, pre-orders are going to start less than three months before that system comes out.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
That is going to be a fucking mess.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Just coming from a distribution standpoint, that is going to be a huge fucking mess.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Because you know why?

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Because Nintendo fucking demands that retail has their orders in 60 days in advance at least.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:31.000
So what, you're saying you're going to just take those orders day one?

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I mean, how many days are you going to open this pre-order for?

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Nintendo already knows, because Nintendo already knows exactly how many each store is getting, and it's up to the stores to figure it out.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Exactly, because it's going to be a fucking mess all over again because they don't have their shit together.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Yep, alright. Bobby, anything else you want to comment on or talk about before we let you go?

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
No, no, that was it.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Alright, good discussion. Check out the Bobby Blackwell Show, of course.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Every Sunday night, well, most Sunday nights, right? Here at the Voice Against Network.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Not next week, but I will be here Christmas night, just like you guys.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Well, it's not like you don't have an archive of hundreds of shows to go check out.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Exactly.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
There you go. Alright, thank you Bobby.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Thank you.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Take care.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.000
ActDeftInChat says Nintendo Switch is going to be a bitch to get.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Yeah, I agree.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Yes, incredibly, and it's unfortunate.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I'm worried because I'm going to be in class that day, I'm almost positive, so I'm not going to be able to be there at noon or 10 AM or whenever this goes live.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Like, I'm going to have to enlist, like, I'm seriously going to be probably asking Alan to help with that.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I'm going to be asking Shane to help with that because that boy has stupid dumb luck with those types of things and will probably get one when nobody else does.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:46.000
I'm going to be enlisting the help of as many people as possible to make sure that I get that stinking Nintendo Switch when it comes out.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Like, is there anybody at Nintendo that listens to this show?

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Also the price point too, because if that price point's not right, then who cares?

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Actually, if anybody from Nintendo did listen to this show, they probably stopped because of a certain individual.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
But I'm so lovable.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:03.000
He really is.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:13.000
If you're still out there, because you want to hear the ugly truths and the ugly truthiness on both sides of whatever.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:18.000
If you're still out there, I just want to know, how can I make sure I get one of these things?

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:23.000
I'm not even asking for a free one. Look, I'm not even going to ask for that.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.000
How do I ensure that I get one?

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Well, you see, you've got to play Super Mario Run. You've got to go pick that up.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Which I'll do.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000
You've got to get all the black coins in the different levels, and then you've got to make a blood sacrifice in Nintendo.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:45.000
How old does the animal need to be? No, I'm kidding. I would never PETA don't call a show.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Alright, can I sacrifice food?

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:51.000
That's okay, Rob. PETA kills more animals than it saves.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
It's true.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Here comes the slice hammer.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
PETA isn't very good bread either, so.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000
No, PETA's amazing bread. What are you talking about?

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000
PETA Kitchen is even better.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Alright, let's go to the phones. We've got another call coming in. Let's get to it.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Hi, this is Ray Treneter.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Hey, buddy. What's on your mind?

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:23.000
No, a whole lot. I was going to say that I recently discovered a game. I don't know if it's new per se.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It's new to me, but I was wondering if the three of you have heard of it. It's called Planescape Torment.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Yes.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Yeah, I've heard of it, but I've not played it.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000
I played D&D for a long time, and that game completely didn't interest me.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Why not, Darcyra?

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Because I'd rather actually play a Planescape scenario instead of a game based on it.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Now that you mention it, Planescape's been around for a while, huh?

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Planescape's been D&D at least since the mid to early 90s.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Okay, we played Planescape, my high school group. When I was a senior in high school, we played Planescape.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Yeah.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Now that this is all coming up, I'm like-

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Because it was the one where the elves were super tall.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Yeah.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:12.000
No, that was the other one. Planescape was the one that had the tieflings and the-

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.000
That was my first D&D.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Yeah.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Was this. Yes. Okay.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
But I know the game. I just didn't play it.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:26.000
So yeah, but I have to admit, D&D has a ton of games that are available on PC and stuff, and I really haven't played a lot of them.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Again, it's just a matter of there's so many games. I could play one game a day, and I still wouldn't be able to play them all.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000
But have you checked out the game?

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Sorry, go ahead. I didn't mean to cut you off.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
I was just saying, have you checked out the game, and what are your thoughts?

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Yeah, actually, I discovered the game because, well, you know how I've been mentioning the GOG is having their winner.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:37:09.000
And one thing they've been doing is on their Twitch channel, they've been having their people show off some of the games that are on Seattle, one of which was Planescape Torment.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:34.000
And that game really caught my eye. It had like isometric dungeon crawling, almost like a cross between old school Diablo meets, I'm trying to think here.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Like Baldur's Gate, because they say it was on that engine.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Yeah, Baldur's Gate.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Yep. So here's the thing. I didn't realize just how old this game was, believe it or not, Raginator. And that makes sense. You discovered it through Good Old Games, which does a lot of the old games. Get this, it's older than the show. December 12, 1999 was when this game came out.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:38:02.000
And now that I'm looking at the box art, I'm like, I do remember this, because this came out not long after we were playing this D&D thing. So I remember it did catch my eye at first.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Yeah, the game definitely looks interesting. In fact, it looked interesting to the point where I decided to fork over the money to get it, especially since it was on sale at the time.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:32.000
The only downside is, it'll probably be a while before I can install it, because my hard drives are filled to the brim with games right now. So I have to invest in another hard drive so I can install it.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Well, this should be a way smaller game than probably some of the other stuff you're rocking on your hard drive. So you may have to sacrifice something to at least free up the space for this.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Yeah, in fact, I had to uninstall quite a few of my larger games, just to make room for the smaller ones already. Like I had to uninstall Final Fantasy XIII-2, for example.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Okay, well that's a whopper of an install. That's like a 60GB install. You should be able to install the entire library of Good Old Games with that type of space.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Yeah, in fact, right now I'm trying to save up my nickels and dimes so I can get another hard drive. But I just wanted to point that game out to you, just in case the three of you haven't heard of it.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:43.000
It definitely looks interesting, at least to me anyway. Plus, as long as I'm on the subject of GOG, it's a little bit too late to do it right now for the recent Bachelor games that they had.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:51.000
But they got a feature on there called GOG Connect. The three of you familiar with that?

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:58.000
I feel like yes, but I keep thinking of GOG Galaxy, the client. What's GOG Connect?

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Basically, the short version is, it's so many that you have a Steam account.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Oh, right, right. Yes, you can get the Steam stuff on GOG. Yes, I do know that.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Sometimes it's not worth it, in my opinion. Sometimes it is. It's weird. A lot of times Steam has better deals in terms of prices, but they don't have all the nice little extras like the soundtrack or behind the scenes stuff or whatever.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Whereas the GOG version does. On the rare occasion, you happen to have, let's say, Dragon Age Origin on Steam.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:13.000
All of a sudden, you connect your two accounts together, you might get Dragon Age Origin for free on GOG, and they'll give you the soundtrack and avatars and stuff like that.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Yes, but the companies have to agree to it, right? So it's a very limited selection of games. It's not going to be like your entire Steam library or anything crazy.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Exactly, and even then, you have to check it on a fairly regular basis, because there's a limited window for you to grab the free games.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:42:01.000
On average, maybe four or five days, a window period where you can grab the games for free. Occasionally, they do repeat certain titles every so often, but you never know when those titles are going to show up and if it's going to show up again.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
It's to encourage you to check often, for sure.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Exactly.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Sure, have a nice night.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
You too, take care, bye.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Let's see, I'm going to try and sneak one more call in if anybody's trying to get an orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. Last minute stories, anyone?

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Yeah, as I mentioned, Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered is getting some updates for their multiplayer maps, which is nice. They're getting some new free maps to go along with that.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Some, actually, they were pretty awesome. They're going to be redoing, what was it? They've got Crash, the holiday version of Crash, which is pretty awesome, Wetworks, I'm trying to write the rest of the names, it's been so long since I played.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:59.000
But it was basically a lot of the maps, because the multiplayer maps that came with HD Remastered were all of them, and now these are like the rest of them. And it's free, so that's awesome.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Free is always good.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
And all the more reason to purchase it.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Alright. Well, since the phone lines aren't lighting up, I assume that is it for calls tonight, thanks to those that called in. If you change your mind, you do want to interact with the show later on, you can always send us an email.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. We will be back in seven days to do it all over again on December 18th, and I can't believe we are actually two weeks away from Christmas as of today.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Uh-uh, the start of Hanukkah.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Whatever it is you celebrate, just the fact that that's so close to the end of the year is more what I'm talking about. It's like, wow, we're already there at the end of dumpster fire of the year.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Just remember latkes on Christmas.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Yay, or Asian food if we can find anything open.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:50.000
You know what? We could do latkes on the weekend after, because it's still during Hanukkah.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Okay, that works.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000
And then we can do...

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I'll take food anytime.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Asian food of choice.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Awesome.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Or whatever's open.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Asian food of availability.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Of availability.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Yeah.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Alright, um, yes, because this isn't New York City.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Because it's Gay Jumis.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:09.000
This is not New York City. This is Sacramento, California, and a lot of stuff's still closed, so.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back in seven days.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:20.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or seven about the show.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if your voices aren't here, we can't air them.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000
You can also leave us a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, Google Play.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Wherever it is that you found this show, that goes a very long way, let me tell you.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.000
I really appreciate folks that take 30 seconds out of their day to do that.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Anyhow, Dark Sakura, welcome back. Great to have you here. We'll see you in seven days.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.000
And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Uh... I missed you guys. But my aim is improving.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
I knew there was a punchline coming to that.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Whoa.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:08.000
My final thought tonight is I'm ready to finish up chapter 13 of Final Fantasy XV and see just if it's as bad as some of my Twitter friends made it out to be.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:13.000
I'm really, I'm like, I'm excited to see how bad is this going to get at the end of the game.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:19.000
And to come back next week on the show and let you know, hopefully, my final thoughts on Final Fantasy XV.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Loki, your final thought, last but not least.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:25.000
I have to shop for tablets for my kids now.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Really? Is that what they want for Christmas?

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.000
That's what my wife wants to get them.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:37.000
And I have to fix her laptop because her hard drive corrupted, so it doesn't work anymore.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Alright. Well, we'll be back in seven more days to do this all again.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:46.000
In the meantime, happy gaming, happy holidays, season, for whatever it is you're celebrating.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And we'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Bye.
