7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week, the world saw Jimmy Fallon nerdgasm over the televised reveal of a playable Nintendo Switch running Zelda Breath of the Wild.
20000	27000	We'll have more about this and the most important part all three co-hosts you know and love, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	45000	Live tonight, episode number 669 for this December the 11th of 2016.
45000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you from Sacramento, California's Studio N7 with my co-host to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
55000	64000	First off, welcome back. DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. How you doing? Is your mic on though? You're not going to be able to do very much without a mic on.
64000	72000	As I was saying, I'm back bitches. A little rusty. I had it off because I still have a bit of a cough left.
72000	79000	Feel better for one. It's just leftovers. But nice to have you back. How was your month?
80000	88000	Well, kind of boring and weird for having to work weekends and I spent the past three weeks sick, so.
88000	89000	Yuck.
89000	91000	Yeah, so that's pretty much it.
91000	99000	But at least all's changed now and your schedule clears your way to do OLR again for the rest of time.
99000	103000	And the funny thing is that I didn't realize I had done a day trade with somebody.
103000	104000	Uh huh.
104000	105000	So I had to work yesterday.
105000	106000	Uh huh.
106000	107000	But I have a three day weekend coming up so.
107000	108000	Nice.
108000	111000	Nothing wrong with three day weekends. I like three day weekends.
111000	115000	Also a fan of three day weekends. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
115000	117000	Like everybody else in the face of the planet.
117000	120000	That's right. Who hates three day weekends? Bring them to me.
120000	123000	Well, I can find reasons to hate three day weekends, yes.
123000	131000	Loki, you missed out, man. Last night here in Sacramento we had a double feature and I was fortunate enough to get to host this.
131000	136000	We had a double feature of Kung Fury and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Your favorite movie, Kung Fury.
136000	140000	But I just figured you didn't go because of, you know, family stuff. The wife probably wouldn't let you in.
140000	142000	Yeah, and I completely forgot about it.
142000	153000	Well, you know what? For what it's worth, while I was there, since, you know, I got to do interviews and stuff, I brought a little piece of it back for you since I know you're such a fan of Kung Fury.
153000	155000	So there's a little, uh.
155000	158000	So wait on my Blu-rays too. Apparently those haven't shipped ever. So.
158000	159000	That's awesome.
159000	170000	So anyway, that's an autographed picture of Andreas Kaling who plays Thor in the movie. We actually had a special guest last night and I actually had to make it out to Loki.
170000	172000	So there it is. He was a great guy.
172000	174000	That's awesome. I wanna hang that at my desk.
174000	181000	Alright, awesome. So I knew you'd get a kick out of that. Dark Soccer, I'm sorry. I would have got you one too. You haven't even seen the movie yet, right?
181000	182000	No.
182000	184000	You need to see it at some point. It's so ridiculous. It's ridiculous.
184000	187000	It's on YouTube. It's like 45 minutes long.
187000	188000	I just haven't been interested.
188000	190000	Not even that. 30 minutes.
190000	192000	Really? It's like 40 minutes?
192000	194000	Yeah, it's like 30 minutes. Yeah, it's short.
194000	196000	It's got David Hasselhoff theme song.
196000	202000	It's one of those things where you're like, this is so fucking ridiculous. I actually kinda like it.
202000	205000	It stars one of the guys from Lonely Island as Hitler.
205000	208000	It's ridiculous. Totally ridiculous. Anyway.
208000	217000	Anyway. Let's see. And of course, always joining us here in our chat room, our live audience in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
217000	224000	because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
224000	227000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
227000	229000	And hello everybody to our chatters.
229000	232000	Starting with SSJ100Matt who says,
232000	236000	I hate three-day weekends because they're not four-day weekends.
236000	240000	There's no pleasing some of you out there. No pleasing some of you.
240000	243000	And then a few people talking about Kung Fury there in chat.
243000	245000	Act F says it's hilarious. And Bob Coffey says,
245000	248000	Best part of that is Triceracops. Yes.
248000	249000	Yes.
249000	260000	It's awesome. I made some joke on stage last night because there's this scene where the gold bird and the dinosaur fight each other with their tiny little hands.
260000	265000	They're fighting each other. So I made a tiny hands joke and I'll just let you fill in the gaps where I went with that joke.
265000	268000	All right. Oh, yes. And hacker man. Oh, my God.
268000	272000	Anyway. All right. Look, this isn't a Kung Fury podcast. It's a video game podcast.
272000	275000	So we're going to get some gaming news here at the top of the show.
275000	280000	Let's talk about we've had a lot of big anticipated game releases this year.
280000	284000	Final Fantasy 15, of course, we were talking about last week.
284000	287000	The Last Guardian just came out in the last week and a lot of people picked that up.
287000	291000	Very excited to play that, you know, and that's just kind of the end cap.
291000	295000	The last two delayed games that were supposed to come out earlier in the year.
295000	301000	But here they are. So we're really only left with one big game release left for this year.
301000	306000	And that is this week's Super Mario Run is coming out on mobile.
306000	312000	Lower your expectations. I'm saying some people would say that's not a major release.
312000	318000	I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. A lot of people have been pressuring Nintendo to do mobile.
318000	324000	And Pokemon Go doesn't super count because that was the Pokemon company, which isn't it's complicated.
324000	330000	This is but this is Nintendo actual Nintendo IP and property like they're putting Mario on a non Nintendo device.
330000	335000	This is kind of a big deal because this could be, you know, a huge thing for Nintendo.
335000	338000	It could be the CDI. I mean, the CDI.
338000	341000	I was going to say they put it on the film CDI.
341000	345000	So, yeah, but because of that, they haven't done it a long time. So I don't know.
345000	349000	I kind of think Super Mario Run is a big, big deal.
349000	357000	And, you know, I I'm sure a lot of you saw the piece on Jimmy Fallon this week or heard about the fact that Super Mario Run demo is out in stores now.
357000	361000	Right. The Apple stores. I think I'll have it. Let me run right out.
361000	363000	Well, play a demo of a game. Well, OK.
363000	370000	Some people did because some of the YouTubers saw the opportunity to if I can get the recording of it first and get it on my YouTube channel, I'll get lots of hits.
370000	374000	There's lots of YouTubers out out there who went and played the demo.
374000	379000	And, you know, you can see this out there now so you can get a pretty good sense for what the game is going to be like.
379000	384000	And I have to admit, I it looks neat. I'll probably pick it up. Why not?
384000	386000	And you'll probably finish it in an hour. And then that will be that.
386000	392000	And I'm I'm goddamn serious because I was reading the early impressions from people and they said, yeah, it's a neat game.
392000	398000	But it's short. It's like 24 levels. And that's it.
398000	404000	J.D. is in our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com who asked, does Miitomo not count?
404000	408000	Yeah, it probably should, based on the words I chose.
408000	416000	But the reason why I'm not considering Miitomo is because Miitomo was kind of like a new thing where it's like Mario is a very established kind of thing.
416000	425000	Like, I just don't put I don't put the Mii caricatures and Mario on the same level of Nintendo like stuff to put out there.
425000	430000	I point out Act of the Same Portal can be finished in 30 minutes and Portal is one of the best games ever.
430000	435000	Yeah, well, that's speedrunning that shit. And you know what? I'm not talking about speedrunning this game.
435000	440000	I'm talking about that is the actual playtime of the game is one hour when you visit all the content.
440000	444000	I mean, shit, you could beat certain games in like a couple minutes.
444000	447000	That doesn't mean that they're great.
447000	449000	The old school Atari 2600 games.
449000	454000	Here's my thing is they're hoping for a repeat of the craziness that was Pokémon GO.
454000	457000	This is not going to happen with this game. I'm sorry.
457000	461000	It's just not because it's not a completely social phenomenon.
461000	465000	It's not something that gets people out and changes the way that they play gaming.
466000	472000	Just like, you know, we did this is just another fucking runner game on a mobile platform that has a million fucking runner games,
472000	475000	but it has another licensed property that people like. That's it.
475000	480000	Lower your fucking expectations because it's not the fucking godsend of like mobile gaming.
480000	484000	This is not going to change mobile gaming. People are going to forget about this shit in about a month.
484000	489000	And I would ultimately say, to be fair, I would only say almost everything you said ultimately doesn't matter.
489000	492000	The part I agree with, it's not going to do as well as Pokémon GO.
492000	499000	And that's where I stop agreeing with you because and it's not like, look, I don't think that this game is going to be a critical darling by any means.
499000	502000	I don't even think it's necessarily going to be a good Mario game.
502000	509000	It'll probably be a competent Mario game, but it's I don't think it's going to stand the test of time as a Mario Brothers 3 or a Mario World or something like that.
509000	511000	But at the end of the day, Loki, here's my argument.
511000	520000	It doesn't matter what you are. I think it doesn't matter what most of the listeners of this program think because the majority of the people, I mean, sorry, but that's my honest answer.
520000	527000	The majority of the people who are going to buy this are not your, using my quotey fingers, hardcore gamers.
527000	537000	It's not even really your casual gamers because now, you know, a lot of the 30 and 40 year olds in this day and age remember Mario and played it at some point in their lives.
537000	543000	And I think there's just going to be a lot of people who buy it because, oh, hey, it's a Mario game on my device.
543000	549000	And it's people who probably like otherwise would never buy a Wii U for themselves, maybe for their kid.
549000	555000	I just think there's a whole, and I think that's the whole reason why Nintendo's pushing mobile is this is a game for them.
555000	557000	This is not a game for the rest of us.
557000	560000	And you kind of have to realize that's where it is now.
560000	561000	Nintendo's going to chase the money.
561000	563000	Yeah, I understand Nintendo's going to chase the money.
563000	574000	It's nice to see them have, you know, this is the first step for them being, you know, a non console publisher and just, you know, third party and all this shit, which I'd be totally fine with playing Mario games on my PlayStation 4.
574000	578000	That's all the hardcore gamers are frothing over, but I don't, we're not ready for that yet.
578000	581000	We need to get, we need to see what happens with the Switch and then we can start having those discussions.
581000	593000	All I'm saying is though, it's like, I don't know, fine. I'm sure it'll do well. I'm sure they'll say, oh, it was a great success, but my expectations aren't very high for it.
593000	595000	Now, Animal Crossing.
595000	596000	Okay.
596000	597000	That may be different.
597000	598000	All right.
599000	603000	Well, look, and this, Loki, this probably won't make you happy either.
603000	614000	And this is, it's one of the things where it's surprising and it's not, was this little tidbit of information that came out this week because Nintendo has been pushing the publicity tour for this so hard.
614000	616000	They want the day one to be big.
616000	623000	I don't think the Apple store has ever done a notify me of when this comes out thing before.
623000	626000	I don't think that's ever happened before on the stores.
626000	627000	This is like a new thing.
627000	630000	So Nintendo really wants day one to be big for this thing, right?
630000	640000	But with the publicity tour comes the Q&A and a lot of things have come out about the game and this one is going to, I don't know, some people are going to be concerned about it.
640000	645000	Super Mario Run is going to require you to be online at all times.
645000	653000	I don't think that's a huge deal breaker because there's a lot of online games that do require that, or mobile games, I should say.
653000	658000	I think. I mean, I don't play a ton of mobile games, but I know there are others out there, some major ones.
658000	661000	Well, Pokemon Go would be a great example, actually.
661000	667000	Well, that's a little different. I mean, that's not a game that you can really play without an internet connection anyways.
667000	675000	And it's, but this is not, it's, this is a platformer game. This is something that you should potentially not need that connection.
675000	683000	I mean, I can see the update. If you want to submit that score you just got to an online leaderboard, then yeah, you need an internet connection.
683000	688000	I'm actually kind of surprised that you are accepting this.
688000	697000	Well, I'm fully accepting that Nintendo is several decades behind the trend of networking and so this always online connection thing, that was a few years ago.
697000	701000	So they're catching up. It's just, they're slowly getting around to it.
701000	711000	Here's what's interesting about this, too. Whereas, you know, when Diablo 3 did it, they tried to come up with a whole list of reasons on why it needed to be always online, right?
711000	715000	And that was about stopping the cheating, which got through anyway, and all this other stuff, right?
715000	717000	Right. SimCity can only really be always online.
717000	725000	Oh, right. Oh, boy. Okay. But, interestingly enough, Nintendo has basically just come out and said, no, it's because of piracy. We don't want this game to get pirated.
726000	731000	So, you've got to give up. I know, I know, right? Have another laugh, Loki. Have another laugh.
731000	735000	But you've got to at least admire that they're being upfront in that regard.
735000	741000	No, I don't. I don't have to admire that at all because this is the platform that you're on and I'm sorry, too bad.
741000	747000	I want to give you the exact words here. In an interview with Mashable, Miyamoto said,
747000	757000	For consumers who are purchasing the game, we want to be sure, or excuse me, to make sure that we're able to offer it to them in a way that the software is secure and they're able to play it in a stable environment.
757000	764000	Went on to comment about the number of countries the game is launching in, as opposed to a normal Nintendo product, so there's all these additional countries.
764000	767000	And they want to make sure that all the services are as secure as possible.
767000	781000	Security is also being cited as part of the reason why the game is an iOS exclusive for those, however long it's going to be, I don't know, a month or two months or whenever the gap is until it's on Android.
781000	786000	So, Loki dying not to laugh over there.
786000	794000	Yes, I'm totally sure it was a security issue. They were so concerned about security and not that they were being paid by Apple to have a timed exclusive.
794000	801000	I'm sure that has nothing to do with it at all. Please. They think I'm fucking stupid?
801000	803000	To be fair, Loki, I'd buy it.
803000	810000	What does it matter anyway? The decision is made. We don't need a reason. It just is what it is.
810000	814000	What are your thoughts on Super Mario Run? Not even necessarily this whole piracy thing, but just the game in general.
815000	827000	I'll play it, you know, but I don't really care why it's exclusive to one versus the other. If that's their decision, that's their decision and the reasons don't matter. What can we do about it?
827000	831000	And it's not even really an exclusive, it's a timed thing.
831000	841000	Even so, it's not our decision and their reasons. Knowing the reason why changes nothing.
842000	851000	Which, to be fair, Ingress was an Android exclusive and I still play the crap out of that, unfortunately. So, I mean, it can work both ways.
851000	859000	Yeah. So, let's see. The other thing I wanted to say, because I kind of agree with this comment in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
859000	865000	It's Raginator in chat says, mark the date and time, everybody. I really agree with Raginator on something.
865000	872000	Raginator says, wouldn't the always online thing kill your mobile data cap? That's the first place my mind went.
872000	877000	How much is this always online thing going to use?
877000	887000	But the security, you got to be secure in this day and age and you wouldn't want piracy. God forbid, Nintendo, think about other people.
887000	897000	How much of my two gigabyte plan, which I don't actually have, I'm clinging to my unlimited plan through my carrier that they don't offer anymore.
897000	905000	Like a frickin' nobody's business. I won't get rid of it. And if they force me to get rid of it, I will switch carriers.
905000	911000	I've been with the same cell phone company for 10 years. If they make me get off my unlimited plan, I'm switching to Sprint or T-Mobile.
911000	919000	I don't even care that their networks, or I guess Sprint's pretty good. I don't even care that T-Mobile's network is not so hot, at least in this area.
919000	926000	So, I will jump ship to that if they make me lose that. And this is part of the reason why it's crap like this.
926000	932000	It's like, you know, all these data providers keep saying, like Comcast and all these other providers keep saying,
932000	938000	oh, well, with this, you can do so much of this and this and this. And it's like, okay, that's what grandma does.
938000	943000	I play a lot of games that use a lot of bit rate, you know? So, anyway, sorry, I don't mean to get on tangent.
943000	948000	But my point is, how much of this data cap am I gonna use playing Mario Run?
948000	955000	Now, granted, if I'm at home and I remember to put my phone on the Wi-Fi network, then I guess that won't matter.
955000	958000	Well, there's my Comcast cap, but that one's pretty big.
958000	962000	I wouldn't worry about it too much. I mean, the game's only about an hour long, so you're not gonna use much of your data caps.
962000	966000	You're gonna be bored of it before, you know, before it gets to be a problem.
966000	973000	Okay, so ActDeft goes here and says, I don't think Super Mario Run is going to use more than Pokemon Go.
973000	975000	Probably some kilobytes at most.
975000	980000	You're right, ActDeft, but I think at the same time we have to recognize those are both clearly different games.
980000	986000	And I guess I do agree with Loki on something here, is that with Pokemon Go, there's that expectation that,
986000	991000	okay, yes, if I'm gonna be out in the real world, of course this is using data downloading maps and so forth.
991000	998000	But Mario Run, being a platforming game that has nothing to do with online environments outside of high scoreboards,
998000	1004000	and that sort of exchange, if I'm not mistaken, doesn't necessarily need that data consumption. You know what I mean?
1004000	1007000	Like, you expect it with Pokemon Go. You know that going in.
1007000	1014000	At least I give them props. I mean, albeit they weren't entirely direct, but I mean, I give them props saying,
1014000	1018000	oh, it's because of copy protection. It's a shitty reason to do it.
1018000	1024000	But unless it's, at least they didn't try to spin it with some sort of, oh, multiplayer leaderboards,
1024000	1027000	and oh, it's a social aspect. It needs to be connected.
1027000	1033000	I mean, I don't know. It's stupid. But you know what? I don't care because I'm not gonna download it.
1033000	1035000	So, whatever. It doesn't matter.
1035000	1043000	But it's seriously, you gotta understand, Nintendo, yes, people love Mario, but it's a mobile platform you're on.
1043000	1050000	There's a million fucking runner games out there, and I'll be honest, yeah, they may not have Mario with them,
1050000	1054000	but there may be other games that are much better than yours.
1054000	1060000	And even, like, I gotta, I really don't like the new Super Mario Brother art style.
1060000	1063000	I really wish they would just have done away with that.
1063000	1069000	But whatever. I mean, that's what they decided to use and reuse those assets and everything for this game.
1069000	1075000	So, whatever. I mean, I don't care. It doesn't appeal to me. I'm not gonna play it. That's it.
1075000	1079000	So, you don't think there's anything this game can do to win you over?
1079000	1085000	No, I've watched how the game plays. I know that the game's short.
1085000	1092000	I don't give a shit about the Kingdom Building part of it. I don't care. There is nothing that appeals to me in this game.
1092000	1099000	They didn't really explain enough about the Kingdom Building part for me to understand, like, what that is.
1099000	1101000	Does that make sense?
1101000	1107000	You just don't care, yeah. I mean, it's just, watching him play it, I'm like, wow, this is not exciting.
1107000	1114000	So, okay, so I'm looking, I just was curious, because I see in chat, Act F says,
1114000	1121000	I do have a two gigabyte data cap. I don't ever get to two gigabytes, even with Pokemon Go.
1121000	1126000	I decided to look up what my usage looks like right now. Okay, since December 3rd, you ready for this?
1126000	1129000	Since December 3rd, I've used 2.2 gigs.
1129000	1133000	Yeah, I believe that. I have three gigs and I normally use almost all of it.
1133000	1138000	And I wanna say in the past month, like when I pull my reports, I'm usually like about eight gigs a month.
1138000	1144000	And I'm not using my phone for anything illegitimate. I don't do piracy or any of that garbage on my phone.
1144000	1150000	Like, everything I do is either, it's Spotify or it's probably fucking Ingress and Pokemon Go and shit.
1150000	1155000	Like, I'm starting to question, like, how much data am I really using with those games? You know what I mean?
1155000	1159000	But it could be Spotify. I listen to Spotify a lot in the car, like that, I don't...
1159000	1163000	Occasionally, you know what lot will kill my data cap is?
1163000	1168000	Occasionally, I'll... Because my... For whatever reason, Ingress doesn't work on my Wi-Fi network at home.
1168000	1173000	I don't know why, but for some reason, it just doesn't work with it, which is odd.
1173000	1176000	Because I didn't do anything to it, so I'm not sure why.
1176000	1185000	But, so I'll shut off the Wi-Fi to, you know, if I wanna recharge or whatever, play, you know, do organization crap with it.
1185000	1193000	And so, sometimes I forget to turn it back on, and then I go watch a YouTube video, and it's like, oh shit, there goes like a...
1193000	1200000	I do the same thing. I do the same thing, is that sometimes my Wi-Fi, like, screws up and it doesn't, like, work the internet the same way,
1200000	1204000	so I turn it off, and then I forget to turn it back on, and I'll do the exact same thing.
1204000	1211000	Or my work Wi-Fi, it's slow, so like, I'll be trying to view a web page or something, the page isn't loading,
1211000	1217000	so I'll switch the Wi-Fi off to load it faster over 4G, and I forget when I'm listening to, like, a podcast or something.
1217000	1223000	You know what would be great? I need to submit that. Does Tim Cook have a suggestion box? Does he have an email address I can email him at?
1223000	1230000	Because I wanna send a suggestion that says, put a button in the next iOS that disables Wi-Fi for five minutes.
1230000	1234000	That would be brilliant, and then it just automatically comes back on.
1234000	1236000	Apple.com slash feedback.
1236000	1237000	Okay, all right, I'm gonna do it.
1237000	1238000	I'm serious.
1238000	1244000	I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I would do it live during the show if we didn't have stories coming up, I gotta focus on first.
1244000	1249000	All right, so anyway, we will see. I'm very curious to see how well this Super Mario run does.
1249000	1257000	Are there gonna be a lot of folks like Loki who say, pass, this just looks like a throwaway garbage type of game?
1257000	1261000	Or are there gonna be enough other people where this thing makes tons and tons of money?
1261000	1266000	I'm not saying it's garbage, I'm just saying that it's not, it's lazy is what it is.
1266000	1275000	It's just, it's just a lazy game. They're reusing assets, they're putting minimal effort into creating a game,
1275000	1282000	and then they're just throwing it out there because they figure it's Mario, people are gonna eat the shit up, and we're gonna make a quick buck.
1282000	1288000	And they know they're gonna make a quick buck, because that's why they were on Jimmy Fallon fucking promoting an iOS game.
1288000	1294000	Is because they know they're gonna make bank off of it, because people are like, oh my god, Mario, I gotta buy that!
1294000	1298000	Do they promote like, Clash of Kings, or what are those games, what's the Mariah Carey game?
1298000	1302000	They have commercials for that shit all the time, like Bubble Strike.
1302000	1305000	Do they promote that stuff on Jimmy Fallon?
1305000	1312000	Neither do I. I don't watch like any, the only late night TV thing I watch is on Netflix.
1312000	1317000	I know he does game stuff usually during E3, and that's kind of a mix everywhere, and they do Nintendo stuff a lot, but
1317000	1319000	Interesting.
1319000	1322000	You know, I don't watch him.
1322000	1328000	Yeah, the only late night show I watch, I don't know if I should talk about this on the show, but I watch Chelsea pretty religiously on Netflix.
1328000	1332000	I think she's hilarious, even though I understand why a lot of people don't like her.
1332000	1336000	But she was more the type that she sent somebody to BlizzCon to make fun of it.
1336000	1343000	So, she sent that guy from American Pie, was it Jason Biggs? Is that his name? The guy that was on Orange is the New Black?
1343000	1349000	She sent him to BlizzCon, he's on her show all the time, and she sent him to BlizzCon, because she's like, I don't want to fucking go.
1349000	1360000	So, she sends him, and it was, I actually did not find the piece to be insulting or anything like that, or I'd probably be really mad and say, like I just, I thought it was, it was silly.
1360000	1365000	As a late night talk show ought to be is a little silly, so anyway, that's just my take on late night.
1365000	1372000	Alright, we're moving on to late night TV, we've obviously exhausted the topic of Super Mario Run, but we'll see how the game does this week.
1372000	1377000	I'd be very curious for those of you that pick up Super Mario Run this week, what your thoughts are on the game.
1377000	1389000	Like, here's, here's what would be fantastic, which is impossible because it doesn't have any controls, so you can't really play games with the precision that you need for, but, like a game like Super Mario Maker on iOS would be fucking amazing.
1389000	1397000	That would be like, that would probably be like crazy, you know, awesome, that this could be like a big social thing, but no.
1397000	1400000	No. No, I don't want that. No, I don't want it.
1400000	1402000	It wouldn't work because there's no buttons.
1402000	1423000	Yeah, exactly. That's the one reason I don't want it. Until there's a standardized D-pad controller type thing that Apple, Android, whatever, like Ecosystem puts out, and I'm not talking third party, like I'm saying, either Apple puts out a joystick themselves, or there's some type of, I know that's harder to do on Android, but some type of officially adopted standard at least or something.
1423000	1429000	I don't want that to happen because those games that do the D-pad on the touchscreen end up being garbage.
1429000	1446000	Like, how many times has Luminous fooled me with a mobile release, like, oh, I'm gonna love it because it's Luminous, I'm gonna eat this shit up because I love Mizuguchi and I'll play anything he puts out, and then I play Luminous on mobile devices, and I'm like, god dammit, this game sucks without a D-pad.
1446000	1450000	So, how many times are they gonna fool me?
1450000	1454000	I actually have a really good controller that works on my Apple TV.
1454000	1456000	Does it, well, but...
1456000	1458000	It also works for iOS.
1458000	1459000	Does it work with a phone?
1459000	1460000	Yeah.
1460000	1461000	It's Bluetooth, probably.
1461000	1463000	It's Bluetooth. It's the SteelSeries.
1463000	1469000	Okay, because I have that iCade thing that I've used my iPad with.
1469000	1478000	Not quite the same, but it's like a standard, maybe about the size of an Xbox controller, and we were playing Sonic CD with it.
1478000	1485000	If I'm not mistaken, though, I could be wrong, but because those things are not, is it an official Apple device?
1485000	1487000	No, it's a third party, but it's...
1487000	1488000	So there's no standard?
1488000	1490000	But it's sold on the Apple website.
1490000	1501000	It's a thing that you can use for, like, I have the iOS, or not iOS, the Android version of it, because that doesn't make any fucking sense that a Bluetooth device can't fucking work on one platform and another platform.
1501000	1503000	Thank you, Apple, for that shit.
1503000	1507000	But, I don't know, it's just, it works good for, like, Minecraft.
1507000	1510000	Wait, but doesn't a game have to choose to enable that?
1510000	1515000	Yeah, the games have to be compatible with Bluetooth for it to work.
1515000	1518000	See, and that ends up being the real problem.
1518000	1522000	Like, even though those devices are good, it's not a standard. It's not a universal standard.
1522000	1527000	But they've had that available. That was one of the standards I thought they introduced with iOS 7, but...
1527000	1528000	I don't know.
1528000	1533000	Whether or not it's on the operating system is one thing. The game has to support it.
1533000	1539000	Exactly. Exactly. And I don't know. Maybe Luminous does support it. To be fair, I haven't tried. But anyway...
1547000	1556000	I do want to move on and talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we have been playing this week, be it mobile devices, or consoles, or PCs, or whatever.
1556000	1563000	Uh, Loki. Actually, no, I'll start with Dark Sakura. You've been gone for so... Sorry, I'm so out of practice with you being gone for three months. I can simply go to Loki first.
1563000	1566000	Dark Sakura, now that you're back, how was your gaming week?
1566000	1569000	Uh...
1569000	1571000	Maybe I should have started with Loki.
1571000	1573000	I played Animal Crossing.
1573000	1575000	Like the DS one?
1575000	1576000	Yeah.
1576000	1578000	Oh, did you finally get that patch? Okay, okay.
1579000	1594000	You get a campsite. That's it. Like Amiibo support. I haven't played with the Amiibo stuff yet, but it was kind of neat walking around. Because of the changes, you get a new dream address. So you make a new dream town and everything.
1595000	1607000	It was nice. All my people were there, and Isabel cleaned the town. And I harassed Resetti. Reset Sun. And that was great.
1609000	1619000	I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft, because I missed it so much. And it is far superior to Final Fantasy XIV in every way. Except for graphics.
1619000	1625000	Even though she's incorrect, she was bragging about her eye level when she walked in here.
1625000	1647000	I hit eye level 863. I went from 856 to 863 because of one epic item. And now I can handle elites by myself so I don't have to party with other people. Because I hate that. I play an MMO to play by myself. And to play with my guild friends.
1648000	1660000	She's a strong, independent MMO player. Who don't need no man. No need no party. Exactly. She's a strong, independent mage. Yeah, well actually I'm playing a demon hunter.
1660000	1665000	Oh, excuse me. I've been playing my mage some. She doesn't party with you, she hunts you.
1665000	1687000	Well, we've been calling them demon hunties. I've also been playing a little bit of Danganronpa 2. Sonic CD on the Apple TV. Because it's got the Japanese track. Hello.
1687000	1707000	Of course. It's great. Both of the theme songs. Well, the Sonic Boom one was there. But the Japanese one had no lyrics. It was just instrumental like they did for the Steam release. It handles really, really well with that controller that I have.
1707000	1721000	The Seal series. It's a really nice controller. Very comfortable. Pretty hefty though. I know I've played some other stuff. I've played some Pinball actually. Blastroids. Because we have that Blastroids cabinet.
1721000	1740000	And Dan's been playing a lot of UNO. Random. Online. Like the new one? Or the 360 one? Whatever some online website thing is. I'm like what are you doing this for? Because I want to say Ubisoft or somebody put out a new UNO like a month or two ago.
1741000	1764000	About UNO a month ago? Well Ubisoft better be watching their ass in other ways. News to come later. Was that it for your gaming week? Yeah I guess. Then we'll go to Loki. Oh wait, wait. I'm still trying to catch a ditto. I caught one here at the house. Well I'm going to pull it off my phone. It was a Rattata. Everybody else I know got it from a Pidgey but I got one from a Rattata. Rattata, tat, tat. Rattata, tat, tat.
1765000	1791000	And if nothing else, like seriously this is a Pikachu farm. I catch a Pikachu outside like every hour. And the other thing, Miitomo is actually a lot more fun now. I heard they did a lot of changes to it. I decorated my room so I have like six posters in my room. I have Garrus, Cullen, Illidan. I have Sonic and Amy. Because I took a picture for Sonic CD. And like the other one is the Japanese Guardian Legend art.
1791000	1800000	I keep meaning to go back and check out Miitomo because everybody is telling me how it's different now but I've been too lazy. It really is a lot different. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1801000	1817000	I played this week more Skyrim on Playstation 4. So I'm like level 160 now. But I haven't really done anything. I'm just leveling because I can.
1817000	1833000	Then I did try out a little bit of Final Fantasy XV. I did not play very far into it because I'm not very interested in it. And you know what? That is their fault to be honest because you're supposed to hook me from the get go.
1833000	1853000	I was hooked with the other games like Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy VII. You know what those had in common? Fucking kickass beginnings. Where it actually felt like there was some sort of, you know, something on the line. Some sort of motivation for your character other than, yeah let's go drive. Let's go drive to get married.
1853000	1855000	I want to play it to cook stuff.
1856000	1862000	But you don't really cook anything though. You just say, hey you make this based off of like...
1862000	1866000	But the pictures are so real. Like the food looks so real.
1866000	1872000	That's what my son said. He's like, oh man that looks good. The egg like jiggles and stuff.
1873000	1879000	I've actually decided that I want to make that braised beef stew because I've never considered caramelizing the onions.
1879000	1889000	I bet there could be a market at like conventions for like cooking dishes from Final Fantasy XV. But you better bring lots of cup of noodle. Just saying. Bring lots and lots of cup of noodle.
1890000	1902000	That's pretty much just like, they have channels for that. I know there is like a channel with, not Freddy Wong, but his brother. They do like game based stuff and cartoon stuff.
1902000	1912000	Anyways, so I played that and then other than that I played Excite Truck. I actually worked on my Unity project thing.
1912000	1920000	And it's weird, like I was working, like my wife wants me to make like an Excite Truck type game.
1920000	1925000	So the first thing I did was make the terrain deformation script and stuff.
1925000	1934000	And so it works part of the way. Like normally in the game when you hit an icon or something it makes like a hill appear and then after a while it goes away.
1934000	1947000	And so I have it and the hill appears and then it doesn't go away. Which is weird because I literally copied the script and then just reversed the order that goes in and it should work just fine.
1947000	1960000	But Unity is being special and just saying, no. We're not going to tell you what's wrong, but there's something wrong. Fantastic. I get to dive into that and figure out what the hell is wrong with that.
1960000	1967000	So I worked on that and then Ingress a little bit. I haven't been playing too much though, but a little bit of that.
1967000	1976000	I think that's it. Just buying games from the sale with new VR games. I'm probably not going to end up playing them.
1976000	1983000	Alright, that's it for your gaming week. My gaming week, honestly, 100% Final Fantasy 15.
1983000	1991000	I haven't even been playing Final Fantasy 14. Which is so funny to talk about those games back to back because they're so, so different to me.
1991000	1998000	But anyway, regardless, I've been playing Final Fantasy 15. I've just been progressing in the story. I really wanted to beat it.
1998000	2009000	I was going to try to beat it before tonight's show, but with the performance last night and everything I just didn't have enough hours in the week to do it for me for doing that.
2010000	2015000	I know some people have already powered their way through the game. They powered their way through the game in like four days.
2015000	2023000	I can't do the same thing just because I have other priorities I have to juggle. But I would say I've spent, I think I'm 26 hours in at this point.
2023000	2033000	I mean, for me, for one game, you guys, that's pretty good. Like, again, I know I had Alan vouch for this last week, but it does look like I'm going to beat this game.
2033000	2038000	Or I'll be that person that gets all the way to the final boss and then says, fuck this game and then quits.
2038000	2045000	So one of the two is bound to happen with Final Fantasy 15. But I gotta say, I know we got into it a little bit last week when we had Shane Collin and all that stuff.
2045000	2052000	But, and I don't want to repeat myself too much, but it is kind of funny because, you know, Shane and I have been kind of continuing our discussions.
2052000	2058000	He's actually been watching me play. I haven't been streaming on Twitch, but I've been doing SharePlay, like private streaming.
2058000	2065000	So he's been watching me play some of the game, which is, for somebody that hates the game so much, he sure has watched me replay a lot of it.
2065000	2071000	But I guess he really wants to, like, he wants to know what I like about it or wants to see if his opinion changes on it or whatever.
2071000	2077000	I know there is a particular chapter he did really like and he wanted to watch me play that chapter.
2077000	2086000	But I'm, again, obviously keeping the spoiler free because I know a lot of people have not progressed 26 hours like I have, or even 10 hours like Loki.
2086000	2092000	But, I gotta say, like, I think Shane and I's opinions on this game are gonna stay polar opposites.
2092000	2097000	Like, I am really enjoying the game. I am up to chapter 13, I got to today.
2097000	2102000	So for everybody who has beaten the game, I'll speak in vague terms, I got to chapter 13.
2102000	2107000	And my understanding is, this is the chapter where the game shits the bed for a lot of people.
2107000	2110000	And just reading what I'm reading on Twitter.
2111000	2120000	But, I, again, trying to keep this very vague, I can see why it's very annoying, this particular chapter.
2120000	2133000	But it's not a deal breaker for me yet. I think for me it's one of those things where it's like, okay, if you watch an entire series of, let's say, I don't know, Doctor Who, and there's one bad episode, you don't necessarily hate the whole show.
2133000	2138000	You go, okay, it was still a pretty good show, just, you know, there was a bad episode or two.
2139000	2143000	Because, honestly, I've really enjoyed all the chapters leading up to this.
2143000	2151000	I still am feeling the problem of this doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game to me at all.
2151000	2157000	But, I'm at the point where I would say this game does feel more Final Fantasy than the movie.
2157000	2160000	Remember Final Fantasy The Spirits Within? Remember that?
2160000	2166000	I would say Final Fantasy XV is more of a Final Fantasy product than that. I'm willing to move it up to that.
2166000	2167000	That's not much.
2167000	2170000	Exactly. I'm willing to move it up to that rank, at least.
2170000	2181000	But it's still, it does start, the story does start to go places that at least involve creatures that you would know from Final Fantasy games and stuff, so there's at least some of that.
2181000	2188000	But again, I'm just really put off by the whole fact that nobody can fucking cast cure. Nobody casts cure.
2188000	2202000	Like, you can use potions and shit like you do in other Final Fantasy games, and there is a cure type ability, something else that kind of does what cure does, but it's, it's just, it's so off-putting to me and I can't explain it.
2202000	2208000	Like, the fact that there's, you would expect that there's a white mage and a thief and a butt, and like, that whole system is gone.
2208000	2211000	And it's, it's, that part is still a little weird to me.
2211000	2218000	But again, and like I said last week, I'm still okay with it because at the end of the day, I actually am enjoying the game.
2218000	2229000	I just kind of say, okay, Rob, just approach this like it is Final Fantasy 13 versus and stop thinking that it's Final Fantasy 15 and just enjoy the game for what it is and not what it needs to be.
2229000	2235000	And once I kind of like let that go, I'm like, yeah, I actually kind of enjoy this game quite a bit, and I actually, I kind of like the battle system.
2236000	2248000	The battle system is like, and I don't play wait mode either. I do the whole live thing. I love the whole like warping in, warping out, creating chains with people, getting other party members to use their abilities so I can piggyback off of them, trying to get behind the enemy.
2248000	2260000	Like, I'm actually really enjoying that side of it. It's just not Final Fantasy battles, but it's fun. So, but that's it. Otherwise, I, otherwise I'm, yeah, I'm still enjoying the game.
2260000	2275000	I feel like my opinion of this once I'm done is going to be favorable. Again, if the ending completely shits itself, like a lot of people are leading me to believe, maybe it'll knock down a peg or two, but I can say I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience of getting to where I am in the game right now.
2275000	2291000	And I thought some of the, some of the cut scenes were amazing and some of the graphics and things you see, all I'm going to say is that, you know, everybody knows that Final Fantasy 15, one of its large part, one of its large things that there's a big open world thing, right?
2291000	2308000	But as the story progresses, you start to, you know, go somewhere else. And the events that kind of lead to that are pretty, pretty awesome. But it does start to get a little tunnel-y. And that was the thing that everybody complained about with Final Fantasy 13.
2308000	2329000	See, I kind of don't mind that because everything is still varied and different and I don't know. But I like it. So, that's me. Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster in chat says, I'm not a fan of the spell system in Final Fantasy 15. My inner Vivi isn't happy.
2329000	2340000	Yes, totally agree. Like, I think that's what, that's what kind of ruins the Final Fantasy vibe for me is that the spell system is, it just, it doesn't, it doesn't connect like the other Final Fantasy games. This is weird.
2340000	2352000	Dungeonbuster also continues and says, the battle system can be a lot of fun, especially when link attacks kick in with massive crit bonuses. But Final Fantasy 15 feels really rough to me. Not the best Final Fantasy I've played so far.
2353000	2371000	Yeah, you know what? The game crashed on me today in Chapter 11. There's a pretty graphics-intensive sequence in Chapter 11. And the game crashed on me during that sequence. And I was like, fucking gaming in 2016. Like, what the fuck? Like, this is some bosses missing on level 30 shit.
2371000	2383000	Luckily the game, the game auto-saves, so I only lost maybe five minutes of gaming time and I went, and I just played through that point again and I got through it fine. But that was a little irritating to say the least.
2383000	2406000	I do think though that as much as I'm enjoying this game, if I do have to compare it to the other Final Fantasy games, which is still a weird thing for me to do, it's not going to be my favorite either. It's going to be very, very, very difficult to top Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy XIV's expansion.
2406000	2428000	VI is what I'm talking about, like the mix of the technology and the magic and stuff. That was, I think, was a perfect balance. And even that battle system, I don't see anything wrong with that battle system at all. And just modernize everything. Make it more modern-looking, make it 3D. But keep it like that. What's wrong with that? That's perfectly fine.
2428000	2433000	But I would say it's better than VIII. Bring on the hate mail. Bring it on. It's better than VIII.
2433000	2438000	VIII was fine until the third disc. It was nothing but repetitive bullshit.
2438000	2451000	And if you don't want to argue about, because I know Final Fantasy VIII is a polarizing one for people, it's better than Final Fantasy II, NES Final Fantasy II, which I think is one of the worst Final Fantasy games in the franchise. Like, out of all the games, I think Final Fantasy II is one of the worst.
2451000	2452000	What, the NES one?
2452000	2453000	Yeah, the NES II.
2453000	2454000	Okay.
2454000	2460000	Yeah, no, god no. No, Super Nintendo II, or IV, which I would call IV, is one of the top.
2460000	2461000	III was great.
2461000	2465000	Yeah, III is where a lot of the future games kind of draw its inspiration, really.
2465000	2467000	III gave us the job system.
2467000	2481000	Yeah. But I made a list some time ago about where I'd rank them all, and I think VIII was in last. No, well, XIV 1.0 was in last place, then VIII, then II, and then I think I, which I don't dislike Final Fantasy I.
2481000	2496000	But XV is probably somewhere in that mid-lower tier. I would still put stuff like X, XIV's expansion, VI, IV. I would still put those games above XV.
2496000	2506000	But anyway, let's see, looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says, still waiting for that 6-2, Square Enix.
2506000	2512000	And JD follows up, oh man, if any game deserves a huge expanded universe, it is 6. Totally agreed.
2512000	2521000	Yeah, but C4 got that, and it was extremely mediocre. The after years, remember that? It was on the WiiWare.
2521000	2530000	It was cool to play something new that was totally in Final Fantasy IV's engine, but at the same time, the game itself is extremely mediocre.
2530000	2541000	So, I don't know if I would want them to do that to VI. Dungeon Buster points out the XII Zodiac remake is coming up too. I can't wait. I'm really excited for XII Zodiac remake.
2541000	2543000	We'll get a VI remake someday.
2543000	2548000	Technically we did, because the phone games are a remake, because they went back and redid all the art, but it's...
2548000	2550000	Did they do VI in the phone games?
2550000	2559000	Yeah, they did VI and they redid all the art and all that, and it's not good. It's just not good. So VI needs a proper remake.
2559000	2572000	See, I like the phone games when they just up, you know, like they did the II, or was it II, no, Final Fantasy I. They redid that, remember that? It was just kinda like 16-bit looking graphics or something like that. That was cool.
2573000	2584000	SSJ100Matt in chat says, no love for Final Fantasy V, which is still my favorite Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy V is an interesting one, because V, I think the story in V is just really...
2584000	2590000	I think it's one of the weakest stories in the entire franchise. I'm sorry, and I know people love the characters, and I know Ferris is cool and all that.
2591000	2603000	I just think V is one of the weakest stories in the entire franchise, but the battle system and the job system is an insane amount of fun, and it's one of the better battle systems in the entire franchise.
2603000	2611000	So it walks this weird line between, it's a lot of fun to play, but the story's just really not interesting.
2611000	2619000	Compared to the game that followed it and the game that was before it, it just falls in this really weird place for me.
2619000	2625000	But that's my personal opinion, and you know what? Obviously, opinions, we all got them.
2625000	2632000	And XV is apparently going to be no different. XV is the new VIII. It's just what it is, apparently.
2633000	2638000	Alright, we gotta move on with some other gaming news, though. First off, I want to do some quick housekeeping and announcements.
2638000	2648000	So, here's the deal. We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can also follow us on Google Plus, google.com slash plus orange launch radio.
2648000	2651000	We're on Facebook as well, facebook.com slash orange launch radio.
2651000	2654000	Holidays, you guys have been wondering what's going to happen during the holiday.
2654000	2663000	So, on Christmas Day, December 25th, we will be here. Dark Soccer and I will be holding down the fort with a special Christmas edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
2663000	2666000	And, I don't know, what will we do?
2666000	2671000	It'll be a first day of Hanukkah Orange Lounge Radio. No, a second day of Hanukkah Orange Lounge Radio.
2671000	2673000	Whose nuts will you roast on an open fire?
2673000	2676000	I'll bring my menorah.
2676000	2677000	Okay.
2677000	2678000	We can light the menorah.
2678000	2679000	We can do the nut roasting.
2680000	2683000	She will roast nuts with a menorah, yes.
2683000	2686000	Will you make latkes?
2686000	2688000	I suppose I can make latkes.
2688000	2689000	There we go.
2689000	2691000	But, I thought that we normally do like...
2691000	2693000	We do. We do. We just have to do like...
2693000	2694000	We should just get takeout.
2694000	2697000	Yeah, we'll get takeout. If we can find what's open.
2697000	2699000	We like to get Chinese food.
2699000	2700000	Panda!
2700000	2701000	Was Panda going to be open on Christmas?
2701000	2702000	I don't know. We got full one year.
2702000	2705000	I know. Figure that out. It'll be like a Christmas story.
2705000	2707000	And then we went to Denny's one year.
2707000	2708000	Bleh. That was a mistake.
2708000	2711000	You had those red velvet pancake pops.
2711000	2715000	It was like red food coloring in generic pancake pops.
2715000	2717000	Anyway, we will be here on December 25th.
2717000	2722000	We will have a show on January 1st, but it may be recorded in advance.
2722000	2724000	But there will be something that week.
2724000	2726000	It may just not be live.
2726000	2728000	We're still working the details out on that.
2728000	2731000	We will not be here at all January 8th, which I know is weird.
2731000	2735000	And that's going to be the first week back for a lot of your favorite podcasts who are taking the holidays off.
2736000	2738000	However, MAGFest is that weekend.
2738000	2743000	And so I will be coming back from Washington, D.C. at the time that OLR would normally be on.
2743000	2745000	So we won't be here January 8th.
2745000	2748000	So we do the holidays late around here, all right?
2748000	2750000	So you'll just have to deal with a delayed schedule there.
2750000	2753000	But we will be here on Christmas night.
2753000	2758000	And the good news is that even if you have other things to do, well, that's why this is a podcast.
2758000	2760000	And you can download it whenever you want.
2760000	2763000	And you can subscribe wherever you find podcasts.
2763000	2771000	Whether that be iTunes Store, whether that be Google Play Store, whether that be TuneIn or another third-party app, you can catch up on OLR.
2771000	2773000	Whenever you want through the podcast feed.
2773000	2775000	And I know a lot of you do listen on the podcast feed.
2775000	2776000	So hello and thanks for being here.
2776000	2778000	Send us an email sometime.
2778000	2780000	Let's see.
2780000	2786000	Over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell reminding us that he will be here, too.
2786000	2788000	So we're going to have a very full night.
2788000	2791000	It's a VOG holiday present on December 25th.
2792000	2795000	And SHO 100 Matt says, hopefully the weather is good for MAGFest.
2795000	2800000	Yeah, that is the thing I fear the most, honestly, is the fucking weather when I go out to D.C.
2800000	2805000	And I just, look, my California ass can't handle a blizzard.
2805000	2807000	So just please do whatever.
2807000	2810000	Cross your fingers and whatever deities you believe in.
2810000	2813000	Just make it a smooth trip for me, please.
2813000	2814000	All right.
2814000	2816000	Let's get into some gaming news, however.
2816000	2819000	I was expecting this to be a completely dead week for news.
2819000	2822000	However, there's still a lot going on this week, right, Logie?
2822000	2823000	Yeah.
2823000	2829000	So there's apparently a new law that has just passed in China that will be going to affect May 1st.
2829000	2836000	And what that's going to do is actually govern loot boxes or those random crate drops that you get in some games,
2836000	2841000	which they're classifying them as almost a form of gambling.
2841000	2845000	So publishers will be required to give players information about them,
2845000	2850000	including the draw, quantity, content, names and properties.
2850000	2855000	Also the percentage chance that you have of actually getting the blind box item.
2855000	2860000	So basically the, you know, percentage to win or something like that.
2860000	2864000	I think that's a good thing.
2864000	2867000	And yeah, they are basically gambling.
2867000	2871000	I mean, the whole CSGO stuff is for this shit.
2871000	2874000	So, I mean, that was actually a little bit different.
2874000	2883000	But still though, I mean, I don't like this trend of paying for a full game, you know, like Overwatch and then having this shit on top of it.
2883000	2893000	Yeah, I have to admit, I also kind of like the idea about companies having to be transparent about what the odds really are for some of the items.
2893000	2895000	And, you know, I have done loot boxes.
2895000	2899000	I've done them in games like Mass Effect, which was the first one, Mass Effect 3 specifically,
2899000	2902000	which is the first game that I remember doing this that had loot boxes.
2902000	2904000	But obviously Overwatch has this as well.
2904000	2907000	You know, and I get that it's all cosmetic.
2907000	2911000	Everything that comes out of these things is cosmetic and nothing really impacts the game itself.
2911000	2919000	But I do, in Mass Effect 3, you can't really say the same thing because you had the guns and you had the other characters that were locked in there.
2919000	2924000	And it always starts off as cosmetic and there's a lot of things like Call of Duty used to do that as well.
2924000	2928000	But then eventually that's not enough and then it goes beyond that.
2928000	2934000	But in Mass Effect 3, you could earn the in-game currency pretty fast to get the loot boxes yourself.
2934000	2936000	So I just kind of looked at it as an experience.
2936000	2938000	I never bought a loot box in Mass Effect 3, never did.
2938000	2941000	And I still got all the characters I wanted and everything I needed.
2941000	2949000	So, you know, if the system is going to only be in-game currency, then fine.
2949000	2950000	I don't think they need to be in-game.
2950000	2951000	Who cares about that?
2951000	2953000	Yeah, who cares? They can keep the loot to themselves if they want.
2953000	2958000	But I have to admit, maybe you guys can help me out and chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
2958000	2969000	But I don't see the bad thing about companies having to be transparent with what is the percentage that I will get Sombra's taunt that I really want.
2969000	2975000	Or D.Va's thing where she plays the video games and eats Cheetos emote.
2975000	2977000	What is really the percentage chance of that?
2977000	2982000	And where's the accountability on the company because they are taking money?
2982000	2988000	Where's the accountability on them to ensure that things are actually dropping at that rate and that they're not making it up?
2988000	2993000	Now the one drawback I could see is that maybe the government doesn't need to oversee that.
2993000	2997000	And I can totally see that perspective as well as that maybe we don't need that oversight.
2997000	3002000	But I can kind of see the perspective that this is getting into gambling a little bit.
3002000	3008000	And maybe not necessarily the same way we oversee slot machines in Reno and Vegas.
3008000	3013000	But maybe a similar arm of that does need to take some of this into consideration.
3013000	3017000	It's sort of like a lottery ticket. I mean, you're basically picking for a random outcome.
3017000	3021000	And I honestly don't think they should be doing the whole loot craze.
3021000	3029000	I'm fine with in-game currency, but if they have skins and stuff for sale, which I guess they can do that.
3029000	3035000	Just offer, okay, here's the skins for this character. Here's the price point for it.
3035000	3040000	And then allow them to choose that way instead of, oh man, I really want that taunt. Let me buy some loot crates.
3040000	3045000	Ah crap, I got a whole bunch of repeats of shit I already have, which are completely fucking useless.
3045000	3048000	Or I can sell it back for some low amount of currency.
3048000	3054000	Well yeah, you do get the gold or whatever, and then the gold ultimately you can buy whatever you want.
3054000	3059000	So it's like if you are trying to save up for that particular taunt and you just keep not getting it,
3059000	3061000	eventually you're going to get enough gold where you can buy it.
3061000	3067000	But yeah, I'm also kind of with Brad from Pod Culture in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
3067000	3070000	who says that's the one flipping drawback of Overwatch that annoys me.
3070000	3074000	Overwatch takes a long time to get the loot boxes for free. It really does.
3074000	3077000	Not in the beginning, not in the first few levels, but later on, yeah.
3077000	3083000	Maybe it's just because I also kind of more casually play Overwatch. I don't play a ton of it.
3083000	3087000	I think the people that play a ton of it probably don't have a problem getting what they want in-game.
3087000	3095000	But god, I just, yeah, I'm not, I don't feel like you get enough loot boxes really in the game.
3095000	3102000	But what's interesting is that now that this is going to be a law in China, what next year is the implementation or whatever?
3102000	3103000	May next year.
3103000	3110000	So if Blizzard wants to have Overwatch in China, they're going to have to publish these numbers.
3110000	3113000	And do you think the US won't find them?
3114000	3117000	So those numbers are going to be out there. Now, granted, they could change it up.
3117000	3119000	China could have different drop rates from the US.
3119000	3122000	But I think Blizzard would have to be a little more transparent with that.
3122000	3127000	And I keep picking on Blizzard. That's just because that's the game I play right now that does this as Overwatch.
3127000	3129000	But there's a lot of games that do this.
3129000	3132000	There's some that are even worse, especially when you get into the mobile space.
3132000	3134000	Yeah, the mobile space, yeah.
3134000	3140000	You can buy $25 worth of in-game currency and you unlock absolutely jack shit with that.
3140000	3147000	It's ridiculous. I watched there was an Angry Joe video that they had where he was playing a DC type of game.
3147000	3150000	It was some DC beat-em-up game.
3150000	3155000	And to unlock the characters, you had to get these cards and stuff.
3155000	3159000	And it took 25 cards per character to actually unlock them.
3159000	3163000	So he bought $25 worth of in-game currency and bought the chests with that.
3163000	3167000	And he got literally no characters unlocked with all that shit.
3167000	3171000	It would have taken more, like $50 at least, to unlock something.
3171000	3173000	Which is fucking stupid.
3173000	3175000	But that's mobile for you.
3175000	3177000	I mean, it's just a mess.
3177000	3180000	But that's kind of where it can go.
3180000	3187000	And unfortunately, console games, whereas they have an upfront price point to them, it's starting to head in that direction.
3187000	3188000	Yeah.
3188000	3190000	Kaijuto in chat says,
3190000	3194000	How is this Overwatch or Rocket League not free-to-play games when they have this loot system?
3194000	3197000	You know, it's not that I always agree with it.
3197000	3203000	But just to present the other perspective, with Overwatch, you don't need any of it.
3203000	3206000	You can be a world-class Overwatch champion.
3206000	3210000	You can be the best Overwatch player in the world with none of the loot stuff.
3210000	3217000	All of it is just taunts, art, cosmetic stuff that ultimately the actual game itself doesn't really have an impact on.
3217000	3220000	And to be honest, most of it is ridiculous.
3220000	3223000	And I think that's why I don't even bother to buy the loot boxes, really.
3223000	3225000	It's because I don't really need any of it that bad.
3225000	3229000	Like, none of the items I get in there are going to make me any better at Overwatch.
3229000	3231000	I'm already pretty bad, you know?
3231000	3233000	So that's, I don't know.
3233000	3236000	I guess that's the other side of it, is that it ultimately doesn't impact the game.
3236000	3240000	Also, Overwatch is starting to come down in price.
3240000	3244000	Like, you know, Black Friday was like 35 bucks for Overwatch.
3244000	3248000	And I think Overwatch is not really going to be a $60 game much longer.
3248000	3253000	And I'm kind of curious what the long-term game looks like for Overwatch.
3253000	3255000	Because it hasn't even been out a year.
3255000	3258000	So what's going to happen next for Overwatch?
3258000	3260000	How are they going to keep that money coming in?
3260000	3264000	Is it just, are they going to rely completely on the loot boxes thing?
3264000	3266000	Or is there going to be something else in the future?
3266000	3268000	I don't know.
3268000	3270000	Let's see.
3270000	3272000	Let's move on.
3272000	3276000	I want to talk about some other news because we have plenty of stuff to talk about as well.
3276000	3278000	I've already pretty much talked about this in the intro.
3278000	3281000	But just to bring it up officially here.
3281000	3287000	The Nintendo Switch was officially unveiled this week beyond just the trailer.
3287000	3291000	It was actually brought to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
3291000	3293000	I almost said Jimmy Kimmel.
3293000	3296000	I always get their names mixed up even though I know they're different people.
3296000	3299000	But it went to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
3299000	3301000	And they were doing a Super Mario Run preview.
3301000	3303000	But Reggie Fils-Aime did the whole,
3303000	3305000	Oh but I have one more thing because you're such a big fan.
3305000	3310000	And right there under a question mark block there it was an actual Nintendo Switch.
3310000	3314000	And Jimmy Fallon did the dorky little Jimmy Fallon thing.
3314000	3317000	Where he pretended to fanboy over it and all this other stuff.
3317000	3320000	Which I don't doubt that he is legit a Nintendo fan.
3320000	3323000	But the whole thing did feel very calculated and scripted.
3323000	3326000	Like you know he knew what was under that question mark block.
3326000	3328000	Which is fine.
3328000	3332000	Honestly that's kind of his excited look.
3332000	3334000	He kind of reacts that way a lot of the times.
3334000	3336000	Like kind of overreacts I guess.
3336000	3337000	Yeah he does. He does.
3337000	3340000	But that's part of being a business person.
3340000	3343000	Which even yes late night talk shows are a business.
3343000	3345000	But anyway that's fine.
3345000	3347000	I'm not really shading him too bad.
3347000	3350000	Because at least we got to see the Switch on TV.
3350000	3354000	And a lot of people doing heavy analysis of freeze frames of this device.
3354000	3359000	Did you catch that whole thing about there's a European trademark symbol on the back.
3359000	3363000	So either the device was a European device or this is confirmation that the thing is region free.
3363000	3367000	Like people are like going all out on their analysis of this thing.
3367000	3371000	So but the good news is we're only a few weeks away from the official Nintendo unveil.
3371000	3373000	Where supposedly we get all the details.
3373000	3377000	I'm just going to reiterate what I said last week about Breath of the Wild.
3377000	3380000	The more I see of it the less interested in it I am.
3380000	3383000	And here's why.
3383000	3386000	And it's because that first time that they were showing it off at E3.
3386000	3388000	It's like wow this is so amazing.
3388000	3392000	And they keep showing the same shit over and over.
3392000	3394000	It's like okay I get it.
3394000	3397000	There's nothing new that they're showing me that's really wowing me.
3397000	3401000	I hate to say it guys but I kind of agree with Loki on this one.
3401000	3407000	Because in the beginning I really was feeling like oh this Breath of the Wild is going to be completely new and different.
3407000	3409000	And influenced by these other games.
3409000	3411000	And then to see it in motion you're like oh okay.
3411000	3414000	It's like I've almost seen like all of the entire game already.
3414000	3417000	Yeah it's kind of like oh okay yeah I know this formula.
3418000	3420000	Not to say it's going to be a terrible game.
3420000	3422000	Zelda games it's a good formula.
3422000	3424000	Maybe they don't need to rock the boat too much.
3424000	3426000	So I don't know I'll still buy it I'll play it.
3426000	3427000	Of course I will.
3427000	3431000	But anyway so yeah you got to see the Switch.
3431000	3433000	And they did the whole thing where they actually popped the device out.
3433000	3436000	So they actually kind of showed that in motion.
3436000	3440000	And you could see the time to transition between the two devices.
3440000	3445000	It wasn't instant because Reggie Fils-Aime did buy a little time when he pulled it out.
3445000	3448000	And he kind of talked for a minute and then handed it to Jimmy.
3448000	3450000	So there is definitely a 20 second transition.
3450000	3453000	I still don't think that they actually have that working yet on that demo.
3453000	3456000	I think there was two separate feeds and they had one.
3456000	3457000	Really?
3457000	3461000	I don't think it's the same thing because I don't know.
3461000	3464000	It just didn't seem like that was the case.
3464000	3467000	I think they had two separate things of the game running or something.
3467000	3471000	But we get the idea though at least.
3471000	3476000	Well and then in the rumors and potentials department.
3476000	3484000	There is a rumor that was going around this week that From Software has Dark Souls 3 running on the Switch.
3484000	3487000	Not to say that they are going to sell Dark Souls 3 on the Switch.
3487000	3491000	But that From Software has that going on there.
3491000	3499000	And apparently From Software is currently mulling over do we release the entire Dark Souls trilogy on the Nintendo Switch.
3499000	3505000	Including the DLC as some type of trilogy collection which I imagine...
3505000	3507000	Dark Souls trilogy praises edition.
3507000	3508000	There you go.
3508000	3509000	Something like that.
3509000	3514000	But you know I could see that something like that they could release on the Switch at the same time.
3514000	3520000	As they do on the Xbox One, the Playstation 4, the PC and all that stuff.
3520000	3523000	So I guess that's cool.
3523000	3526000	But I have to admit my gut reaction to those of you that follow me on Twitter.
3526000	3533000	No my gut reaction to this was don't go down this path.
3533000	3535000	Because I'm getting nervous.
3535000	3540000	Because the games that we're seeing are Skyrim, Dark Souls 3.
3540000	3542000	Oh granted we haven't seen Dark Souls 3.
3542000	3544000	But still this is where my mind is going.
3544000	3545000	I can't help it when I see these rumors.
3545000	3549000	It's last generation shit on the Switch.
3549000	3550000	Stop it.
3550000	3554000	That's how third parties fucked up the Wii U launch.
3554000	3555000	Don't do it.
3555000	3558000	It's got to be new stuff.
3558000	3565000	Or at least if nothing else, stuff you release on the Switch at the same time you release on the other consoles.
3565000	3567000	So at least everybody has a fighting chance.
3567000	3572000	But if you released last year's shit on the Switch, it's going to be shot in the foot from the beginning.
3572000	3575000	Please don't do this third parties.
3575000	3576000	Don't do this.
3576000	3578000	I'd still buy Skyrim on the Switch.
3578000	3579000	Alright well...
3579000	3583000	It's an older game but I'm getting a lot of use out of it.
3583000	3587000	And I own several versions of the game.
3587000	3589000	So it's just...
3589000	3591000	I don't know.
3591000	3593000	For example, I played more Skyrim.
3593000	3599000	This is so weird to me that the few things you're going to throw a bone at Nintendo for and give them credit for are the one things where I'm like...
3599000	3600000	No!
3600000	3602000	No, hold on.
3602000	3604000	I'm in agreement with you.
3604000	3607000	That's kind of what botched the whole launch lineup with the Wii U.
3607000	3611000	Because they're like Batman Arkham Asylum or Arkham City or whatever it was.
3611000	3613000	Well that game came out last year.
3613000	3615000	That is like a launch title.
3615000	3618000	I don't have a problem with them throwing Dark Souls on there.
3618000	3623000	But as long as that's not the only thing that they're launching with is old stuff.
3623000	3625000	Let's see some new stuff as well.
3625000	3630000	And yeah, you can always go ahead and throw out those trilogies and stuff later on to port those older games over.
3630000	3634000	But just don't heavily rely on that.
3635000	3638000	Okay, and ActEftInChat continues on to say...
3638000	3641000	But at the same time, Dark Souls on the go?
3641000	3643000	I don't think that's bad.
3643000	3648000	I understand that and I understand this whole enthusiasm about Skyrim being on the go and everything as well.
3648000	3652000	But I don't know. Maybe this is because I don't commute on a subway.
3652000	3656000	Or I don't sit down with nothing else to do for long periods of time during the day.
3656000	3658000	So maybe my perspective is just a little different.
3658000	3663000	But I just think Dark Souls would be fucking horrible to play on a portable device.
3663000	3667000	Because a game like that is so hard and so challenging.
3667000	3673000	It kind of commands a lot of precision and a lot of attention that I'm not sure I can get on a portable device.
3673000	3675000	Is that weird?
3675000	3677000	Yes?
3677000	3678000	Okay!
3678000	3679000	I don't know.
3679000	3683000	I kind of feel like, especially if you're in a subway that's bouncing all around and moving all around you.
3683000	3685000	Well yeah, it's like a subway train would be a little bit difficult.
3685000	3689000	Or in a plane. I do a lot of portable gaming when I'm on the plane.
3689000	3695000	But I'll play Dragon Quest VII. That's okay if that bounces around a little bit or I have a hard time hearing something.
3695000	3697000	Because of the plane engine or something.
3697000	3699000	I just don't think Dark Souls would...
3699000	3702000	I mean, I know the concept sounds awesome.
3702000	3705000	Like, yes, PlayStation 3 and 4 games. I can take Wibby on the go.
3705000	3707000	That concept sounds awesome.
3707000	3712000	But then in execution, I just think those games would really not be fun on portable.
3712000	3713000	I'm sorry.
3713000	3714000	We need to know.
3714000	3715000	I don't know.
3715000	3717000	That is just my opinion.
3717000	3721000	If enough of you disagree with me, then go by and support the game and prove me wrong.
3721000	3726000	I mean, you can go and pre-order that shit, but good luck getting it.
3726000	3732000	And JD points out, yeah, if you have two hours a day to kill on a train, it definitely changes your perspective.
3732000	3733000	And I can respect that.
3733000	3736000	But again, I just feel like Dark Souls would not be the game to play.
3736000	3739000	Pokemon is great.
3739000	3741000	That's why those games do so well.
3741000	3745000	But not every game works the same portable as it does on the TV.
3745000	3746000	I don't know.
3746000	3747000	Alright.
3747000	3748000	Well, we'll see.
3748000	3753000	Again, those are just rumors of Dark Souls 3, so we'll see what happens January 12th.
3753000	3754000	It's going to be a big day.
3754000	3755000	Moving on.
3755000	3756000	Dark Sakura.
3756000	3763000	Well, we have some news, as I alluded to earlier, about Ubisoft.
3763000	3768000	Oh, when will people learn about insider trading?
3769000	3779000	So they have been fined, or will be fined, by the AMF, which is, I'm going to mispronounce this,
3779000	3791000	Autorte de Moche Financier, basically the finance commission in France, for being accused of insider trading,
3791000	3796000	where they offloaded some of their shares of Ubisoft.
3796000	3801000	Before the publisher announced the delays that made their stock drop by 25%.
3801000	3816000	However, they have sent direct messages to certain publishers saying that while they acknowledged the AMF's decision,
3816000	3823000	they still assert that they acted in good faith and have appealed the decision.
3823000	3835000	So they're hoping that it gets overturned, but it's pretty, at the very least, quite a coincidence,
3835000	3839000	that they would sell their shares just prior to this happening.
3839000	3844000	And I believe that it's five different executives that are being held accountable for this.
3844000	3847000	So there you go.
3847000	3849000	Don't cheat.
3849000	3850000	Don't cheat.
3851000	3859000	Yeah, it's a tough one for them to prove, because, you know, executives, wouldn't you think they're going to know
3859000	3861000	when a game's going to be delayed?
3861000	3864000	That's not something you wake up in the morning, roll out of bed, and go,
3864000	3867000	I think a game's going to get delayed today.
3867000	3876000	Well, depending on how quickly they sold their stock before that happened,
3876000	3882000	it would have had to have been that they sold their stock very quickly before that delay happened
3882000	3887000	and would have anticipated that the delay would also cause the stock to drop that drastically.
3887000	3892000	Because a 25% drop in value is pretty big.
3892000	3894000	So, just saying.
3894000	3898000	Let's see, DungeonBuster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3898000	3904000	instead of insider trading, maybe they should figure out how to allocate funds to properly test their PC releases.
3904000	3909000	Going to need some salve for that burn.
3909000	3912000	Maybe they knew how it was running. I don't know.
3912000	3914000	I think they had to have done something.
3914000	3916000	But then again, I will point out that.
3916000	3919000	Because this all dates back to stuff in 2013, right?
3919000	3923000	This isn't like insider trading alleged that happened like yesterday.
3923000	3928000	This is something that happened years ago that's been investigated and now they've been fined.
3928000	3936000	I guess, alleging guilt from this organization is giving, what would you say?
3936000	3938000	Basically saying that they're guilty.
3938000	3945000	The Ubisoft Montreal CEO was fined 700,000 euros.
3946000	3956000	And everyone else between, well the smallest was 15,000 euros and then we had 100 and then 200.
3956000	3962000	So a total, approximately in American money, about 1.28 million dollars.
3962000	3966000	So, it's quite a bit of money spread across 5 people.
3968000	3973000	I mean, even for the one who had to pay the least, that's roughly.
3973000	3980000	I'd give approximately an average year's salary on the low end, middle class wage.
3980000	3985000	So, of course, if there are executives, they probably can afford it easy.
3985000	3999000	Though I do tend to see a trend that the higher up that you get on the corporate ladder, the less touch you have with the way people are working.
3999000	4009000	And so, if the delay was impending, they might not have found out about it until the memo made it to them.
4009000	4012000	So, take that as you will.
4014000	4017000	Loki, you have somewhat of a follow up to this, right?
4017000	4019000	Yeah, in regards to Ubisoft as well.
4019000	4025000	As you may remember, Vivendi is purchasing shares of the company.
4025000	4035000	So, right now, with their last acquisition, they own 25.15% of the company and almost 23% of its voting rights.
4035000	4042000	Apparently, though, they are saying that Vivendi's been discussing their objectives for the next six months.
4043000	4057000	They're not considering to acquire shares, depending on the market conditions, but not considering the launch of public tender on Ubisoft, nor acquiring the control of the company.
4057000	4069000	However, though, it says a recommission of Ubisoft board directors in order to, and among other things, obtain the board representation consistent with its shareholder position.
4069000	4071000	They're going to be seeking that.
4071000	4083000	However, though, according to French law, though, they will need to submit a bid for an actual takeover bid if they reach 30% of ownership in the company.
4087000	4091000	Yes, it looks like Vivendi wants to own a video game company very badly again.
4091000	4095000	It says that they don't, though, so I don't know. Maybe they just want...
4095000	4097000	Actions speak louder than words.
4097000	4098000	We'll see, I mean, I don't know.
4098000	4105000	Well, and then this whole thing, that Jamie just talked about, seems quite the setback. Like, it just primes them in ready for something like this, you know?
4105000	4106000	Maybe.
4106000	4108000	I don't know. We'll see, we'll see.
4108000	4118000	Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Capcom, which, you know, has been in the news recently at the PlayStation Experience.
4118000	4128000	You know, they have the whole unveil of a new Marvel vs. Capcom game, which, by the way, Dark Soccer, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, because I know you are a big fan of fighting games and Capcom games and all that.
4128000	4131000	What did you think of the Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite reveal?
4131000	4134000	I'm still reserving judgement.
4134000	4139000	That's fair. Obviously, you don't want to just base the whole thing off four characters, but did it get you hyped?
4139000	4142000	Because I'd written off that we'd ever get another one, to be honest.
4142000	4144000	I had some Doki Doki moments.
4144000	4146000	Alright, fair enough.
4146000	4148000	Well, we have six characters, remember.
4148000	4151000	Oh, right, right, right. I forgot about the two that came later. I'm thinking about the four in the trailer. Anyway.
4151000	4157000	And remember, it's Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, and there's going to be infinite DLC Loki, so we're going to have an infinite number of characters.
4157000	4160000	If they run out, they'll just come up with new ones.
4160000	4169000	Alright, anyway. But Capcom has also talked about in a press release that they're looking to revive some franchises that have been forgotten.
4169000	4172000	Let's see, as part of the press release, it said, quote,
4172000	4182000	In addition to regular major title releases each fiscal year, Capcom is currently focused on reviving series that have not had new entries recently or otherwise dormant IP,
4182000	4188000	beginning with Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, a return for the series following a five-year hiatus.
4188000	4194000	Capcom looks to enhance its corporate value even further by utilizing its library of rich contents.
4194000	4198000	Which, I don't know, I think most of us would look at this and go, how about fucking Mega Man?
4198000	4207000	Right? It's like, would you like to enrich your company more? Freaking give back, give the people what they want.
4207000	4213000	How about fucking Mega Man? I don't care if it's Mega Man Legends. I'll take a fucking Mega Man X game at this point.
4213000	4221000	Yeah, I don't want to take these proposed redesign of Mega Man that was supposed to be that Bomberman X-Zero type Mega Man game.
4221000	4224000	Yeah, I don't want that one. But I'll take the other ones.
4225000	4231000	And don't make it suck. Because, my God, if the creator of Mega Man... Like, I watched a documentary on that.
4231000	4235000	Like, they had a fan documentary thing about the whole Mighty No. 9 bullshit.
4235000	4237000	Oh, did they? Oh, I got to check it out.
4237000	4238000	Is that on Steam?
4238000	4246000	It's on YouTube. It's like a 45-minute long thing that they talk about what happened with all the, like, just the whole drama from beginning to end.
4246000	4247000	Interesting.
4248000	4254000	It's interesting. It's like, how could they have fucked that up so bad? But seriously, how could they have fucked that up so bad?
4254000	4258000	Just make a good game if you're going to do that.
4259000	4263000	Brad from Pod Culture in chat suggests, Mega Man Run?
4266000	4267000	No.
4267000	4270000	I'll take it. I will take it at this point.
4271000	4276000	What about... I'm sure Dark Soccer has got to be sitting there going, Rival Schools?
4276000	4286000	Right? Oh, my God. I would love... Or at least I would like some of the Rival Schools characters to show up in at least some of the other ones, you know.
4286000	4288000	I'm trying to...
4288000	4296000	What dormant Capcom... I mean, it was suggested to us behind the scenes that this would make a great List List segment.
4297000	4302000	But I don't... I don't know. You need, like, 18 different options for a List List. I'm not sure I could come up with that many.
4302000	4304000	I'll take another Bionic Commando.
4304000	4306000	Like, we'll just forget the last one happened?
4306000	4307000	Rearmed was fine.
4307000	4309000	Yeah, that's true. Rearmed was fine.
4309000	4315000	The 3D one was kind of stupid, but, you know, it had potential, like, on paper and, like, in the trailers.
4315000	4319000	It was like, wow, this is going to be fucking amazing, but, like, then it just didn't quite come together.
4319000	4322000	But I'd be willing to have them try again.
4322000	4324000	I'll take UN Squadron. How about that?
4324000	4325000	Yeah, that'd be cool.
4325000	4327000	Take a new UN Squadron game.
4327000	4328000	Captain Commando.
4328000	4330000	Hell yes.
4330000	4333000	Or if we want to get more obscure, we can do, like, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.
4333000	4335000	You know, just all the beat-em-up.
4335000	4337000	How about Final Fight?
4337000	4339000	Bring back Three Wonders.
4339000	4340000	Power Stone.
4340000	4342000	Fucking Power Stone.
4342000	4344000	Hell yes.
4344000	4345000	Powerful.
4345000	4348000	I wouldn't mind, though, a follow-up to Three Wonders.
4349000	4354000	Dark Tetsuya says, UN Squadron was a licensed game based off the anime or manga area 88.
4354000	4355000	Oh.
4355000	4357000	See, 12-year-old me didn't understand all that.
4357000	4361000	I just rented a game called UN Squadron once and thought it was badass.
4361000	4363000	So, I guess I don't get that.
4363000	4366000	And, that's what you wanted to know. Matt says, Power Stone discussion over.
4366000	4369000	No, because Mega Man is first. I'm sorry.
4369000	4371000	Yes, Mega Man needs to come before Power Stone.
4371000	4374000	This is long overdue.
4374000	4377000	Act F says, Gotcha Force. Shut up.
4377000	4380000	Dungeon Buster says, New Magic Sword.
4380000	4384000	Ooh, fuck. Maybe we could come up with 18 games, because we need to talk about Magic Sword.
4384000	4386000	And how fucking underrated that game is.
4386000	4388000	Oh, god, that was such a good series.
4388000	4391000	Well, series of one game.
4391000	4398000	Let's see. Act Def wants to point out, Dark Soccer, there's rumors of a rival school's character appearing in Street Fighter V Season 2.
4398000	4400000	That's a character.
4400000	4402000	That's one lousy character.
4402000	4405000	What about bringing Dark Soccer's back? Didn't they do a Dark Soccer's 3?
4405000	4408000	They were teasing at one point that Dark Soccer's was supposed to come back.
4408000	4411000	Well, there was a Dark Soccer's 3. It was Vampire Savior.
4411000	4413000	Yeah. No, beyond that.
4413000	4421000	They were teasing a 4, but I don't know if they actually said it got cancelled, but something caused Dark Stalkers 4 to get pushed back.
4421000	4425000	I think it was the sales of Dark Stalkers 1 and 2 on 360.
4425000	4433000	I think there was something, I remember we talked about it a long time ago, but it was something about the 360 reinventions of Dark Stalkers the first game did not do well.
4433000	4437000	And that kind of shot plans for another Dark Stalkers game in the foot.
4437000	4446000	But, anyway. Alright, we could talk about this Capcom reviving thing all night long.
4446000	4450000	But, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see if they actually do it or not.
4450000	4452000	Dark Soccer in the meantime.
4452000	4455000	Well, do we remember Majesco?
4455000	4456000	Yes.
4456000	4462000	Do you remember what they've more recently been known for was Gone Home? Which is pretty good.
4462000	4463000	Did they publish that?
4463000	4464000	And they did, yeah.
4464000	4467000	I think they published, like, a version of it.
4467000	4468000	The console versions.
4468000	4470000	Yeah, not the PC original.
4470000	4472000	And A Boy and His Blob.
4472000	4485000	Well, they have been acquired, actually. They're not really disappearing, but they're being merged into PolarityTE, which is a biotech company.
4485000	4490000	They do regenerative tissue tech.
4490000	4493000	That's weird. That's very weird.
4493000	4501000	In fact, PolarityTE will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Majesco, but Majesco's dropping its name and operating under PolarityTE.
4501000	4505000	And they are bowing out of the entertainment business.
4505000	4510000	And we know that Majesco's had some definite financial problems.
4511000	4528000	The last founder of the company left in 2015, and their new leader was more of a gold mining and energy person before going into games.
4528000	4537000	So they pretty much dropped all of the entertainment, except for one recent tweet about ABC's BattleBots.
4537000	4538000	Whatever.
4538000	4542000	But they are going fully into medical tech.
4542000	4544000	Bye!
4544000	4552000	Do you know what by far the most important- I mean, Majesco's published a lot of games, but do you know which one by far is the most important contribution they've given to gaming?
4552000	4553000	Cooking Mama.
4553000	4554000	Yes.
4554000	4558000	So, this effectively means that the Mama series is done.
4558000	4562000	No, they're just- you were talking about regenerative tissue. Mama's now gonna fix that.
4562000	4565000	No, Mama's gonna fix it. Don't worry.
4566000	4570000	Damn it, Loki. I was trying to set up for that joke, and you just jumped in there with a punchline.
4570000	4582000	To be honest, I've been saying for years now, even back when I was at the distribution company I was at, they've been out of the gaming business for a while.
4582000	4585000	I mean, they've been hardly publishing anything throughout the year.
4585000	4589000	Are you kidding? They published Hello Kitty Party on the DS.
4590000	4591000	So what?
4591000	4592000	How dare you.
4594000	4597000	I wonder if they would sell those licenses.
4597000	4601000	Like Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009 and 2010?
4601000	4604000	Who gives a crap about that? I'm talking about Cooking Mama.
4604000	4606000	Maybe they would sell the licenses-
4606000	4611000	This is a fitness ultimatum. You're either gonna be fit or not. I choose not.
4611000	4622000	Well, if you're going into tissue regeneration, then that means that you just hack off a few ounces of body fat, and then they'll just heal the skin. That's it.
4623000	4630000	SSG100Matt says, Mama's going into the home. Someone will be fixing Mama breakfast now. That's sad.
4631000	4638000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, Wow, I guess Majesco never really recovered after Advent Rising. Remember Advent Rising?
4638000	4640000	Yes, that was, what, 2007?
4640000	4645000	That was a while ago. Wasn't that the whole million dollar Xbox game? That was that whole thing, right?
4645000	4647000	That was a pretty big Xbox game, yeah, I remember that.
4647000	4654000	That whole they were gonna give away a million dollars to whoever, I don't know, beat it or found some secret or something. Am I mixing that up with something else?
4654000	4656000	I swear that was Advent Rising.
4656000	4658000	You can't beat that one, I don't remember.
4658000	4659000	Alright.
4659000	4661000	That's it. It made such an impression on me.
4663000	4666000	Alright, moving on, Loki. Maybe talk about some games that did make an impression on you.
4666000	4678000	Well, this is kind of funny. Sony's talking about their mobile plans now, with what, their cancelled mobile, you know, gaming device, and their cancelled Sony mobile, what was it, Sony PlayStation mobile?
4678000	4685000	Yeah. So now they're talking mobile again, because now everybody's getting into it. Everybody's citing Pokemon Go.
4685000	4693000	My fucking god. Can we seriously stop using Pokemon Go as like the indicator that you should get in this marketplace?
4694000	4696000	Because everybody fucking wants a piece of it.
4696000	4714000	Do we not? Do we not remember fucking Angry Birds? Do we not remember Angry Birds where I was insanely successful and fucking everybody's like, oh, I'm gonna get in that market because they made it so they were so successful. How many people have actually succeeded?
4714000	4717000	Well, the guy who did Flappy Bird did pretty well for himself.
4717000	4720000	Yeah, and that was a fucking fluke. That was a fucking fluke.
4720000	4722000	Talk about a game that got ripped off.
4722000	4728000	I mean, Sony should be familiar with Angry Birds because they made the movie, or published the movie, so I guess.
4728000	4733000	But now they're going to be getting back into mobile with some of their first party titles that were on PlayStation platforms.
4733000	4739000	So, for example, Hot Shots Golf is going to be one of the first games that's going to be coming out on iOS and Android.
4739000	4744000	They also have a game called No Heroes Allowed Dash.
4744000	4750000	Ark the Lad and Wild Arms are going to be rebooted on those platforms as well.
4750000	4759000	Also, Parappa the Rapper, Disgaea, and some other untitled games.
4759000	4771000	They've got a collaboration with Square Enix. They have an original IP from ForwardWorks called Sora to Emi no Aida.
4771000	4776000	And some collectible card game called Project Field.
4777000	4780000	That would be, if it's T-O, that would be T-O.
4780000	4785000	Man, if only Sony had their own portable platform they could release these types of things on.
4785000	4788000	I know, I mean, really. It's really...
4788000	4790000	Gosh, it's a shame nothing like that exists.
4790000	4794000	Yeah, unfortunately, you know, it just doesn't exist.
4794000	4802000	But to be fair, though, as much as I can sass that point, Nintendo has a 3DS, yet they're still putting Mario Run out, so, you know.
4802000	4805000	Oh my god.
4805000	4806000	What?
4806000	4813000	No, I'm just looking at this picture of this thing that they have, you know, that card game that I was talking about.
4813000	4819000	Getting the, you know, Eye of Judgment vibe from this.
4819000	4824000	Oh, I thought you were going to say it reminded you of your own card game. I was going to be a little worried for you there.
4824000	4830000	Oh, no, no, no. Fuck no, I'm not making a card game. No, it's giving me an Eye of Judgment vibe from this thing.
4831000	4836000	Alright, well, moving on to another story about Final Fantasy XV.
4836000	4839000	You know, now some of the reception is out there. A lot of people played the game.
4839000	4844000	And Square Enix talking about some of the changes that they're going to make with Final Fantasy XV.
4844000	4853000	Hajime Tabata actually made a blog post this week on the Square Enix site talking about fan feedback to the game and what's going to happen to make the title better.
4853000	4856000	And in the post, Tabata says,
4856000	4865000	Our early plans are to enrich certain aspects of the game, adding gameplay enhancements for Chapter 13, buffing ring magic, etc.
4865000	4868000	We'll have the specifics of what and when for you at a later date.
4868000	4877000	So, again, I'm actually playing Chapter 13 right now and it is, again, I'm really, really, really trying not to spoil.
4877000	4885000	But just like some things that you're used to as the game change and it seems like it might be like a temporary type of thing.
4885000	4891000	And so it's a little bit, it's one of those things that I feel like it's lasting longer than it needs to.
4891000	4896000	That's the whole thing. Sometimes, like, the game gets flipped on its script for a little bit. It's temporary.
4896000	4899000	This feels like it's lasting a little longer than it needs to.
4899000	4903000	Again, but for me, it doesn't ruin Chapters 1 through 12.
4903000	4907000	That's, I guess, the difference I'm having than what some other people are having. I don't know.
4907000	4914000	Anyway, they're also saying, We're hoping to delve deeper into the story, adding scenes that will give you new insight to character motivations.
4914000	4917000	Such as why Ravis walked the path he did.
4917000	4921000	We need a little time with these. They'll need to be localized and voiced in other languages.
4921000	4930000	For the long term, we're looking at making certain key characters playable and even considering the possibility of customizable avatars in addition to other features over time.
4930000	4936000	Other features we have in mind is letting you carry over stats from a previous playthrough and adding in items that introduce new play styles.
4936000	4939000	Such as low level runs and god mode.
4939000	4943000	We're also examining readability tweaks, increasing font size for certain languages.
4943000	4951000	On top of that, we're looking at content you can enjoy in real time, including new bosses with exclusive rewards and achievements and limited time hunts.
4951000	4955000	I don't know how I feel about this.
4955000	4959000	There's a lot about this I'm not liking.
4959000	4964000	Don't get me wrong. I'm cool with the fact that they want to add to the game and add this new stuff.
4964000	4970000	But when they talk about changing story elements, now the biggest thing I'm seeing on Twitter is,
4970000	4978000	Well, guess I better stop playing Final Fantasy 15 or guess I better not buy Final Fantasy 15 because they're gonna go and change the story.
4978000	4983000	And since apparently everybody hates the story, I'm gonna wait and go play through this when they fix it.
4983000	4992000	And I'm just sitting here going, okay, I guess I'm like the one guy who isn't understanding the big problem right now.
4992000	4995000	Like again, I think the game is fine.
4995000	5001000	Again, it's not the best Final Fantasy game, but it's definitely not the worst.
5001000	5007000	So, I don't know. I feel like that comment kind of shot themselves in the foot with that.
5007000	5017000	Like, well, there went the second and third week sales for Final Fantasy 15 because now people are gonna wait until there's a story patch to see what all has changed and all this stuff.
5017000	5026000	I mean, as far as the other stuff goes, like font sizes, new bosses with new achievements, limited time hunts, that all sounds fine.
5026000	5031000	That's the type of, you know, continuing support for 15 I would have expected.
5031000	5037000	But this is also just a weird, I don't know, this is just a weird place, this whole Final Fantasy game in a DLC era.
5037000	5049000	Like, I know, it didn't really happen with 13, 13-2 it did, but because of the way 13-2 was set up, I don't know, it just didn't, it's not as weird to me as something like this is.
5049000	5052000	I'm just, I don't know.
5052000	5056000	Loki, what do you think when you hear this? They want to patch the story. Isn't that weird?
5056000	5059000	It's Mass Effect 3 all over again.
5059000	5061000	But Mass Effect 3...
5061000	5064000	I know, they're clarifying the ending.
5064000	5085000	It was also, it was the ending. And, I don't know, again, I kind of feel like, although I enjoyed Mass Effect 3's extended cut, and I appreciate that it exists, I did not, again, have the same hate boner for the way Mass Effect 3 ended originally that everybody else did.
5085000	5092000	I understood why people took issue with it, but I didn't think it was the worst ending to a video game I'd ever played.
5092000	5099000	And sometimes video games have bad endings. Sometimes movies have bad endings. Sometimes stories have endings you don't like.
5099000	5107000	And it's, you know, again, does that ruin the entire journey of getting there? I don't know, it doesn't always for me.
5107000	5115000	I don't know, I guess an ending, if an ending is really, really, really bad, then maybe. Like, didn't that ruin The Village? The M. Night Shyamalan movie for a lot of people?
5115000	5117000	No, M. Night Shyamalan ruined The Village.
5117000	5119000	The signs, no, the ending of signs.
5119000	5127000	The ending of signs I thought was fine. It was stupid, but, you know, I chalked that up as like, oh, haha, it's War of the Worlds.
5128000	5139000	I just thought that it was just kind of a take, sort of like on that, where it's like, oh, yeah, I mean, granted, you can poke a million holes through that whole movie.
5139000	5143000	The Mist. They changed the ending from the book.
5143000	5145000	Yeah, no, I'm aware of-
5145000	5147000	And it ruined the whole movie.
5147000	5151000	Yeah. But didn't Stephen King say he actually kind of liked it?
5152000	5159000	Yes, which is stupid. The whole movie was great until the end, and I can never watch that again.
5159000	5167000	Yeah, no, again, even though it's a ten year old movie, I don't necessarily want to ruin it for people, but I understand the controversy behind that whole change, for sure.
5167000	5173000	For those that don't know, it's a real downer ending. Let's just leave it at that. It's a bit of a downer.
5173000	5175000	Keep in mind, I like The Grudge.
5175000	5177000	Yeah.
5177000	5183000	ActDeftInChat says, do we need director's cut of video games now? The end was fine for me, but I will.
5183000	5194000	I'm fine with them doing a director's cut thing, because they did that with the other Final Fantasy games, where they re-released them later on with the international versions, if you will, where they tweak stuff and add bosses and all that fun stuff. That's cool.
5195000	5208000	I'm fine with that. But, like, don't change the story. You can add to the story. If you want to add stuff that adds more clarification to the story, that's cool, but you can't just change the story.
5208000	5210000	I also, okay, like...
5210000	5214000	That's like saying, oh hey, we patched Final Fantasy VII. Eret's not dead, just kidding, it was just a flesh wound.
5214000	5221000	Oh my god, if Final Fantasy VII had existed in the age of the internet, which, the internet's infancy was happening with Final Fantasy VII.
5221000	5223000	We still don't have the remake coming. There's still time.
5225000	5227000	Anyway, um, but I just...
5227000	5229000	As long as the bitch still dies.
5229000	5231000	Bring her back, bring her back.
5231000	5235000	She's alive again! And he kills her again. Ah, she's dead again.
5235000	5237000	Eret, Eret's Resurrection DLC, just $9.99.
5237000	5239000	Oh my god, they killed Eret, you bastards!
5241000	5248000	Maybe, would that be DLC you would buy Dark Sakura, where you could just kill her over and over again? Like, it's just, you know, different ways to see her die.
5248000	5250000	Once is satisfying.
5250000	5252000	When was it? Okay, let's...
5252000	5254000	I want there to be blood this time.
5254000	5258000	Now that we're like, now that we're kind of going back here, okay...
5258000	5266000	The fuck is a Phoenix down for if you can't fucking resurrect the bitch? I mean, like, I mean, seriously, like, well, this time she's completely dead.
5266000	5270000	But wait a second, all these other times you've died, we've been able to resurrect you just fine.
5270000	5273000	Yeah, but, eh, this time...
5273000	5277000	You're not reading what it says. In Final Fantasy you get KO'd.
5277000	5279000	You don't die, you get KO'd.
5279000	5281000	Killed off, yes, I got it.
5282000	5286000	And when your entire party gets KO'd, that's when you lose the battle.
5286000	5288000	That's when you get eaten by the monsters.
5288000	5290000	And Phoenix down removes the KO status.
5290000	5293000	That's, that's what it, that's the technicality they get you on.
5293000	5295000	Okay.
5297000	5299000	Jeez.
5299000	5307000	Alright, anyway, uh, let's move on. I, I do feel the need, I really feel the need, like, I need to finish 15. I need to see what this...
5307000	5309000	I guess I'll play more of it.
5309000	5316000	I need to see what this clusterfuck that's supposed to happen in Chapter 13, like, I need to see, like, what is ruining this game for me.
5316000	5318000	Like, the spoil, like, the first, like, five minutes of the game.
5318000	5321000	Okay, first five minutes I don't think is a spoiler.
5321000	5323000	Alright, it's maybe not first, like, first hour.
5323000	5331000	Um, like, you get to a point in the game where you have to go to a ferry, and then you get there, and the guys, the ferry's not there, because they closed the ferry thing down.
5331000	5333000	And there's this reporter who's like,
5333000	5337000	Yeah, I could get the ferry here, but I need you to go get me some gems.
5337000	5339000	It's like, what the fuck is this shit?
5339000	5341000	It's like, why?
5341000	5347000	It's like, I'm sorry, this train will come, but I need you to go into a cave and get me some gems.
5347000	5349000	What?
5349000	5351000	Well, I'm not going to try to explain side quests.
5351000	5357000	But as far as the main story goes, I do want to reiterate this, like, I don't, I didn't watch the movie still.
5357000	5359000	I still have not watched the movie, I still haven't watched the anime.
5359000	5362000	I feel like I understand well enough what's going on.
5362000	5365000	I understand this game better than I did 13.
5365000	5367000	No one understood.
5367000	5369000	No one fucking understood 13.
5369000	5371000	No, I kind of tease a little bit, actually.
5371000	5373000	13 starts to come together in about the 30th hour of the game.
5373000	5378000	But, like, I'm not, I'm not feeling that with Final Fantasy 50.
5378000	5384000	My other feedback to that, as far as, like, the story doesn't make any fucking sense, would go,
5384000	5389000	what the fuck did you expect from the guy who made fucking Kingdom Hearts?
5389000	5395000	What the fuck did you expect with a story that's suddenly going to make sense from the guy that made Kingdom Hearts?
5395000	5403000	If you can understand Kingdom Hearts well enough to get through the game, you can understand Final Fantasy 15.
5403000	5406000	I don't understand Kingdom Hearts.
5407000	5411000	Like, I watch the trailers for it now, and I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on at all.
5411000	5415000	Where's Mickey? Okay, there's Mickey. I don't know what the hell's going on.
5415000	5419000	Alright. Well, you know what, we gotta, we gotta take a step back.
5419000	5421000	We gotta travel back in time.
5423000	5425000	Back to when you couldn't patch the story in games.
5425000	5428000	If you released a game and it sucked, oh well.
5428000	5431000	You're fucked. That's, that's just all it is.
5431000	5433000	It's the classic game of the week.
5433000	5439000	And Dark Sakura, she's back. No radio magic needed, but she could use a lozenge.
5439000	5443000	No, I could use it going away all together.
5443000	5448000	Well, sorry to hear it, but at least you have a classic game of the week to entertain us all with this week.
5448000	5449000	Yes, I do.
5449000	5455000	And you didn't even realize that this classic game of the week kind of, kind of starts a theme going with what we had the last couple weeks of the show.
5455000	5457000	Well, it's the theme that's ending after today.
5458000	5462000	So, so Dark Sakura just came here to kill something off. That's what she did.
5462000	5463000	Yes, I did.
5463000	5466000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week tonight?
5466000	5474000	I picked Pokemon Pinball, which is a pinball game in the Pokemon series.
5474000	5481000	It came out on Game Boy Color in Japan, April 14th, 1999, in North America, June 28th, 1999.
5481000	5487000	Your ball is a Pokeball, and all the objects on the table are clearly Pokemon based.
5487000	5496000	Um, so you just basically have to hit points and play the different little sub-games, you know, or hit the targets or do things a certain way.
5496000	5504000	You also have a secondary objective in the game where you have to collect all 151 Pokemon in your Pokedex in the game.
5504000	5518000	So your Pokedex is saved, um, in the individual game, well, it's saved in between the games, so you can collect them over a period of several games.
5518000	5523000	So you have two tables in the game, one is red, one is blue, and each have its own elements.
5523000	5530000	Um, they have different locations that you play on as well that determine which Pokemon are available for you to capture.
5530000	5533000	So as you play through it, you go and catch them.
5533000	5540000	And then when you have catch mode activated, you have a two minute window, um, that you can attempt to capture Pokemon.
5540000	5553000	So once you activate catch mode, you have to hit the, the pop bumpers, uh, six times, and then it unlocks a sixth of, well, each hit unlocks, uh, a sixth of an image of the Pokemon that's up for capture.
5553000	5558000	So once you get them alighted six times, and you get all six parts, then you get evolution mode.
5558000	5566000	That's another two minute window where when you select a captured Pokemon, you can then evolve it.
5566000	5570000	Um, and then that's the only way that you can add the evolved form to your Pokedex.
5570000	5575000	So you have to hit these particular targets on the play field once you get six targets.
5575000	5579000	Um, only three of them have what you need to do it.
5579000	5583000	Um, but you have to hit those specific targets to get this to happen.
5583000	5589000	Um, I mean it really is just, you know, it's Spinball, but cute with PokeBands.
5589000	5594000	Um, it was pretty positively ranked when it came out.
5594000	5597000	Um, it had a rumble feature, do you remember that?
5597000	5598000	I do.
5598000	5599000	Um, although-
5599000	5600000	It was like built into the cartridge.
5600000	5602000	It was built into the cartridge.
5602000	5608000	But, um, my favorite, uh, quote about it is that it was called a waste of a AAA battery.
5608000	5613000	Um, it was novel, but I don't think it added too much to it, you know.
5613000	5619000	Um, but it, it was, uh, a pretty, a pretty fun little game.
5619000	5625000	Um, Famitsu, when it came out, gave it a 32 out of 40, which is a decent rating.
5625000	5632000	Um, and it was enough to, uh, make it spawn a sequel, which was, uh, Pokemon Pinball Ruby and Sapphire.
5632000	5639000	Um, which came out in, uh, 2003, but I'm not talking about that one now. I'm talking about this one.
5639000	5649000	So, um, it, as I recall, I think it did, um, it didn't make it to the Virtual Console, did it?
5649000	5652000	I know the, the Ruby and Sapphire one that you don't want to talk about did.
5652000	5654000	I know for sure that's on Wii U.
5654000	5655000	I don't know about this one.
5655000	5656000	I don't think this one did.
5656000	5657000	But at any rate-
5657000	5661000	Sorry, I just love that the very first Pokemon this guy got was a Magikarp.
5661000	5663000	It's LARP.
5663000	5664000	Splash.
5664000	5668000	But that's really all there is to say about it. It's a pinball game.
5668000	5670000	It's got Pokemon.
5670000	5672000	You can get 151 Pokemans.
5672000	5674000	Yeah, good luck with that.
5674000	5675000	Right?
5675000	5680000	It's probably, it'll probably be easier to fill up your decks in Pokemon Go than it was in this game.
5680000	5682000	I'm still trying to get a Ditto, you know.
5683000	5685000	That's it. Pokemon pinball.
5685000	5687000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5687000	5689000	Pokemon pinball.
5689000	5691000	On the Game Boy.
5691000	5693000	And Game Boy really, just get it on the color.
5693000	5695000	Because it has a lot of color in it.
5695000	5697000	Yes.
5697000	5699000	Alright, we're going to take a quick break.
5699000	5702000	But when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we have rapid fire news.
5702000	5706000	Mailbag and Skypline over at Orange Lounge Radio.
5706000	5708000	All one word on Skype.
5708000	5710000	We will get to your emails.
5710000	5714000	And all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5714000	5716000	Right after this.
5722000	5725000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5725000	5727000	In Progress live tonight.
5727000	5729000	Episode 669 for this.
5729000	5732000	December the 11th of 2016.
5732000	5735000	I can't believe we're going to be in 2017.
5735000	5740000	And at the same time, I'm ready to be done with this dumpster fire of the year.
5740000	5743000	And I really hope next year is going to be different.
5743000	5746000	I totally expect Dumpster Fire of the Year Part 2.
5746000	5748000	You want Dumpster Fire 2 Electric Bulu?
5748000	5750000	Electric Dumpster Fire?
5752000	5755000	It not only is on fire, but it's shocking.
5755000	5757000	It's just absolutely shocking.
5757000	5759000	It will drown you in lightning and water.
5759000	5761000	We'll see, we'll see.
5761000	5763000	Well hopefully it's going to start off great.
5763000	5766000	And I'm expecting to have a fantastic time there.
5766000	5769000	Not doing anything at least that I know of.
5769000	5772000	With like any panels or planned appearances.
5772000	5777000	But sometimes I like to just go to these things and just listen to concerts.
5777000	5779000	Play old school games.
5779000	5781000	I want to play more old school games this year for sure.
5781000	5785000	And yeah, I decided to just kick back and have fun.
5785000	5787000	And hopefully find more places to eat.
5787000	5789000	That's the other thing that's concerning me.
5789000	5793000	Is that in the freezing cold weather it's not exactly going to be easy to walk around and get stuff to eat.
5793000	5798000	So I really hope there's some, I hope they're getting a lot of food trucks this year.
5798000	5801000	Every food truck in the D.C. area better be at Magfest this year.
5801000	5802000	I'll put it this way.
5802000	5807000	We have nine years to prevent 2017 through 2020 being further Dumpster Fires.
5810000	5815000	You know, but you would just think that the cosmos will give us like one really awesome year.
5815000	5818000	Like I don't know, and I'm not even talking about politics.
5818000	5822000	Like what could happen outside politics that could make next year awesome?
5822000	5826000	Like, I don't know, would that be like sending...
5826000	5828000	A meteor landing?
5828000	5830000	The aliens being discovered.
5830000	5832000	That might be, I don't know, that could also be scary.
5832000	5834000	Friendly aliens, Klingons being discovered.
5834000	5835000	Klingons are friendly.
5835000	5836000	Sorry, not Klingons.
5836000	5838000	Vulcan. God, I'm a horrible Trekkie.
5838000	5839000	Vulcans. Vulcans being discovered.
5839000	5841000	Like it wasn't first contact.
5841000	5842000	Not Klingons.
5842000	5844000	That would be bad if they were first.
5845000	5850000	Well, I honestly think that any intelligent alien life would look at this planet and go,
5850000	5851000	Fuck that.
5851000	5852000	Just keep on driving.
5852000	5854000	And piss right on off.
5854000	5855000	Just said, screw that.
5855000	5862000	They would look at our planet and just treat it like when you're driving down the 99 and you go by Bakersfield.
5862000	5864000	Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
5864000	5866000	It's like these people are too primitive.
5866000	5869000	Let's not pay any attention to them.
5869000	5880000	But in all honesty, I would hope that people start acting like we are a civilized society.
5880000	5882000	That's what I would hope for.
5882000	5891000	It may be too much to ask for, but I would like, instead of this cult of ignorance that's been fostered, especially in America,
5891000	5902000	I'd like to see people read a fucking book, study their fucking history, and get over what people look like, worship, who they sleep with.
5902000	5904000	Get the fuck over it.
5904000	5906000	I just want people to get the fuck over it.
5906000	5908000	And Betty White to stay alive.
5908000	5909000	Oh yeah.
5909000	5911000	No celebrity deaths in 2017.
5911000	5913000	None. Well, maybe a couple. Maybe a couple.
5913000	5917000	I don't know. Who do you think will die first?
5917000	5920000	Betty White or Kirk Douglas?
5920000	5922000	Oh, well let's...
5922000	5923000	He's a hundred now.
5923000	5927000	I know, and I hate to say this. I hate to say this, but can I say Zsa Zsa Gabor?
5927000	5928000	Okay, Zsa Zsa.
5928000	5930000	She's one of those people where you go, how?
5930000	5931000	Right?
5931000	5932000	How?
5932000	5933000	Preservatives.
5933000	5935000	I'm fine with her being one of the three.
5935000	5940000	If there's certain sacrificial lambs we have to offer 2017, then it's like, okay.
5940000	5944000	If she has to die so Betty White can live, then by all means.
5944000	5946000	Kirk Douglas. I mean, this is horrible. We're horrible people.
5946000	5949000	We should, no, just, you know, but.
5949000	5952000	Betty White seems to be in the best health of them all.
5952000	5957000	Yeah, because she's probably still having sex.
5957000	5959000	Who wouldn't want to sleep with Betty White?
5959000	5961000	I'm serious.
5961000	5963000	Should we do an OLR quick poll?
5963000	5968000	Oh wait, that's literally nothing to do with video games.
5968000	5971000	Would you with Betty White?
5971000	5972000	Alright.
5972000	5975000	That's just you 100 Matt and Chet says, let's not play this game.
5975000	5979000	That statement literally could be anything we talked about in the last five minutes.
5979000	5981000	Alright, let's talk about other video games.
5981000	5982000	I doubt.
5982000	5983000	What?
5983000	5984000	I doubt says maybe.
5984000	5986000	Maybe? Alright.
5986000	5990000	Hey, if nothing else, Dark Sakura 2017 is going to give us Mass Effect Andromeda.
5990000	5995000	So let's just, let's hope for a great Mass Effect Andromeda.
5995000	6006000	I hope that we are still free to say what we think of Mass Effect Andromeda and gather in large groups while playing it.
6006000	6012000	And that my uterus isn't going to be our right to send cupcakes to EA.
6012000	6020000	Well, besides that, and that, you know, I won't have, you know, my uterus being legislated by old white men.
6020000	6022000	Hey, I'm not that old.
6022000	6026000	While I'm playing, while I'm playing my Mass Effect Andromeda.
6026000	6032000	Let's hope that Dark Sakura doesn't try to be in Mass Effect Andromeda because she wants to beam the fuck off this planet.
6032000	6035000	I want the fuck off this planet right the fuck now.
6035000	6041000	She could be in Mass Effect Andromeda since they're going to be looking for all those voice actors.
6041000	6045000	Yeah, let's hope that gets resolved too. That's not, that's not going to be pretty.
6045000	6048000	Pay our voice actors.
6048000	6053000	All right. Well, and to be fair, pay the people making the games too, as well.
6053000	6055000	All right. Just, and people that are...
6055000	6059000	Not just pay our voice actors, but give them safe conditions to work in.
6059000	6061000	That would be a good place to start.
6061000	6063000	Your voice is your instrument.
6063000	6070000	And as you can tell right now, a damaged voice is not what you want to listen to in your games.
6070000	6074000	Yes, if you're sick of Dark Sakura coughing on this show, you can pay her.
6074000	6084000	You can pay for me to go, for Kaiser to not fucking go, no, you might have to cough for another six weeks.
6084000	6088000	Can we, can we start a Kickstarter to get your vocal cords removed?
6088000	6089000	Girl.
6089000	6091000	I'm just kidding.
6091000	6093000	You left yourself wide open for that. All right.
6093000	6096000	No, I, you.
6097000	6102000	You took a sledge hammer and open and made your own opening in the side of the house.
6102000	6103000	That's what I do.
6103000	6106000	To let yourself in like the Kool-Aid man.
6106000	6108000	You're like, Oh yeah.
6108000	6111000	I'm like, Oh no.
6111000	6113000	You take that sledge hammer back.
6113000	6115000	No, no Kool-Aid for you, Kool-Aid man.
6115000	6120000	All right. News, video games, news about video games, Loki.
6120000	6126000	So I actually had this problem on my TV as well, Final Fantasy 15, because I had set it up.
6126000	6130000	I'm like, you know, this looks like part of the picture is being cut off on the TV here.
6130000	6133000	Do they have an option to fit that to the screen?
6133000	6137000	No. Okay. That's unusual because most games have that.
6137000	6139000	And it's supposed to be built into the PlayStation four.
6139000	6145000	You tell the PlayStation four how big your TV is and then all the games know that, but I'm noticing the same thing.
6145000	6147000	I'm not noticing major cutoff.
6147000	6148000	It's just enough.
6148000	6151000	Yeah. It's just like enough where I'm like, okay, why is it getting cut off?
6151000	6153000	Because I told my PlayStation how big my TV is.
6153000	6156000	So it forgot.
6156000	6158000	I guess so.
6158000	6164000	So, yeah, unfortunately that is an issue that is affecting copies of the game right now.
6164000	6169000	However, Square Enix is going to be fixing that.
6169000	6174000	They're going to be, I guess, patching that out at some point soon.
6175000	6177000	So, yeah.
6177000	6179000	That is kind of lame.
6179000	6186000	Also, it looks like Elite Dangerous is going to be coming to PlayStation four in 2017.
6186000	6197000	They just announced that sometime in the middle of 2017, apparently it's going to include the Horizon season expansion as well.
6197000	6201000	I haven't heard of VR support, but that would be nice.
6201000	6203000	Please.
6204000	6206000	Just wanted to see.
6206000	6216000	All right. Well, earlier in the show, we talked about Capcom reboots, but this is a little bit about Sega and some very old Sega franchises that could be coming back, but not as games.
6216000	6218000	That's the difference.
6218000	6219000	Pachinko Machines?
6219000	6221000	No, but the good news is not Pachinko Machines either.
6221000	6222000	Oh, that's good.
6222000	6225000	So we're talking about Altered Beast and Streets of Rage.
6225000	6230000	So get ready to rise from your grave all over again.
6230000	6231000	Here's the deal.
6231000	6235000	It's a report from Variety, so you know what that means, entertainment industry.
6235000	6245000	Sega is teaming up with Circle of Confusion and Stories International to adapt these games as potential movies or TV series.
6245000	6255000	Now, if you're a little concerned about that, you should consider, though, that Circle of Confusion, some of the shows they've been involved with, Outcast, Dirk Gently, and The Walking Dead.
6255000	6257000	Just this little show we have to...
6257000	6258000	I haven't heard of any of those.
6258000	6262000	Just this little show we have to compete against on Sunday night on Twitter and all that stuff.
6262000	6267000	But it's probably not The Good Walking Dead, it's like another show that also happens to be called...
6267000	6270000	The Walking Dead shooter game that was on 360.
6270000	6271000	Activision?
6271000	6273000	Yeah, not the Telltale Walking Dead, which is pretty good.
6273000	6277000	Yeah, that's Activision. That's Activision's fault. They suck.
6277000	6284000	Like, their version, they also had the Fast and the Furious game, which also blew ass as well.
6284000	6294000	Now, I guess the interesting thing about these games, they're kind of generic. Like, Streets of Rage, I mean, everybody knows it for the soundtrack, and it's not that it was a bad game, but it was, like, there's not a lot of...
6294000	6295000	Gang show.
6295000	6300000	I know, there's not a lot of stories there in Streets of Rage. Same thing with Altered Beast. Altered Beast could just be...
6300000	6301000	Werewolf show.
6301000	6307000	Greek mythology show. Zeus and Friends. Like, that's all...
6307000	6310000	Zeus and Friends!
6310000	6312000	That's how Altered Beast needs to be.
6312000	6315000	Altered Beast, the, like, sitcom sensation.
6315000	6327000	You know what show I wish they'd bring back, and maybe Altered Beast could somehow help with this? I don't know why my mind is going there, but when we talk about, like, Zeus and Friends, I think about Xeno Warrior Princess.
6327000	6335000	And just, like, that whole mythos that existed on it, because that was tied in with Hercules, right? Wasn't there a third show at one point as well?
6335000	6337000	Was Jack of All Trades in that universe?
6337000	6339000	No, I don't think it was, but...
6339000	6341000	But, like, those fantasy shows...
6341000	6343000	I thought he was part of the Xenoverse.
6343000	6345000	They played Autocus, didn't he?
6345000	6346000	Huh?
6346000	6348000	Bruce Campbell had a character in Xeno.
6348000	6349000	Yeah, I thought that was...
6349000	6351000	And he was a different character for...
6351000	6352000	Jack of All Trades?
6352000	6353000	I thought that was the spinoff.
6353000	6357000	They're telling us in chat it was Xeno, Act F says it was Xeno in Hercules only. Alright, that's fine.
6357000	6365000	But I'm just saying, I kinda miss those, like, super, like, cheesy budget TV shows, fantasy stuff. That's what I want Altered Beast to be.
6365000	6368000	Silk stockings.
6368000	6370000	Like, FOREVER NIGHT.
6370000	6372000	Like, I want...
6372000	6375000	I'm fine with the reboot of the Silk Stocking series. Softcore porn, hell yes.
6375000	6378000	I want the dinosaur to be, like, a guy in a pterodactyl suit.
6378000	6380000	That's what pterodactyls do.
6380000	6382000	It's like...
6382000	6384000	It's like a guy with one of those...
6384000	6386000	What do they call those suits?
6386000	6388000	The, like, the green man thing?
6388000	6389000	They have, like, a name for it.
6389000	6390000	The Unitards? I don't know.
6390000	6392000	Not the Unitards. They actually have, like...
6392000	6394000	I can't remember what they're called now.
6394000	6398000	But they have a specific name for those, like, spandex full bodied suits.
6398000	6401000	Don't Wear Me Ever? Is that what they're called?
6401000	6404000	Yeah, there's a name for them. It's escaping me.
6404000	6406000	But yeah, it's something like that.
6406000	6408000	It could be a pterodactyl.
6408000	6414000	They have dinosaurs, actually, with, you know, the Jurassic Park inflatable dinosaur costume that they have with the floppy head.
6414000	6417000	Brad from Paw Culture thinks you're talking about a mocap suit?
6417000	6420000	No, not a mocap suit. I'm gonna have to look this up now. Alright.
6420000	6422000	Anyhow, let me move on to something completely different.
6422000	6424000	This is news that might...
6424000	6427000	We're having a very Final Fantasy night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6427000	6432000	But these are some rumors going around about Final Fantasy's 30th anniversary.
6432000	6438000	VG Leaks is publishing this, saying they have a pretty reliable source on this information.
6438000	6440000	But 2017 is the 30th anniversary.
6440000	6442000	That's what they're called. Morph Suits.
6442000	6445000	Thank you. Alright, back to Final Fantasy.
6445000	6449000	So 2017 is gonna be the 30th anniversary of the Final Fantasy franchise.
6449000	6460000	And these rumors are saying that the Final Fantasy VII remake and Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age, will be the big releases next year to celebrate Final Fantasy's birthday.
6460000	6466000	Which, you know, I would believe that at least the first episode of the remake, anyway, is gonna be ready to go next year.
6466000	6476000	And I was kind of talking about that on a previous episode of OLR where I said, you know, we finally got some of these PlayStation 4 wishes this year with XV and with Last Guardian.
6476000	6485000	But, you know, next year they're gonna have to deliver two, and I really think Square especially is kind of on the hook to either deliver Kingdom Hearts III or the VII remake next year.
6485000	6489000	And for some reason my gut tells me we're still gonna be waiting on Kingdom Hearts III.
6489000	6494000	So, but the VII remake, I have a feeling the VII remake is just in XV's engine.
6494000	6495000	It is.
6495000	6499000	Yeah, well, but that, so that makes me wonder how the battles are gonna play out.
6499000	6501000	Are the battles gonna be XV's battles?
6501000	6505000	Because that's gonna rub some people the wrong way.
6506000	6507000	I don't know, anyway.
6507000	6516000	See, now if they're not, if they're not like XV's battles and are like VII's battles, that's gonna be the most fucking amazing game right there because that's how XV should have been.
6516000	6517000	We'll see.
6517000	6524000	Anyway, but anyway, besides those games, there's some other things that are supposed to be coming next year for the 30th anniversary.
6524000	6528000	Such as the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy coming to PlayStation 4.
6528000	6535000	XIII, XIII-2 and Lightning Returns on separate discs and they will be 1080p and 60 frames a second.
6535000	6539000	Which, to be fair, you, finally they fixed some of the graphic patches.
6539000	6541000	You can kind of do that on the PC.
6541000	6546000	So I can't imagine that the transition to PlayStation 4 for those games would be very hard.
6546000	6550000	So I don't want to use that word that you all tease me for saying too much.
6550000	6557000	But this is one of those things that we've been waiting for for a while and it just, it seems like an easy thing for Square to do.
6557000	6564000	So, we'll see. I mean, that just, I feel like if you're gonna make up bullshit, that's a pretty easy one to make up.
6564000	6566000	So, I don't know, we'll see.
6566000	6571000	But this is the real whopper in this whole leak or whatever rumor thing.
6571000	6576000	Is that there's going to be also a Final Fantasy 30th anniversary collection.
6576000	6581000	It will have Final Fantasies 1 through 9.
6581000	6586000	All of them will be on this collection and it will be released on PlayStation 4.
6586000	6588000	And PlayStation Vita.
6588000	6591000	That's where I start to go, this rumor's bullshit.
6591000	6593000	What's a Vita?
6593000	6601000	But that's, anyway, 1 through 9 and they say it will have two versions of Final Fantasy 1 through 6.
6601000	6604000	The originals and the modern ports.
6604000	6614000	This would mean that Final Fantasy 2 and 3's NES versions will get an official English translation for the very first time.
6615000	6618000	7 through 9 will only exist in their newer ports.
6618000	6622000	I'm assuming that means the PC Steam versions that are out there.
6622000	6628000	Not the 7 remake, obviously, but what you can already purchase on the PlayStation 4 as far as 7 is concerned.
6630000	6634000	This doesn't seem like too much of a stretch as far as translating Final Fantasy 2 and 3.
6634000	6637000	My understanding is 2 is already translated.
6637000	6642000	Like, 2 is ready to go and for whatever reason they pulled the plug on it at the last minute.
6642000	6646000	3, on the other hand, I mean, well both of those games have been translated.
6646000	6651000	You know, there was the Game Boy Advance, right, had it?
6651000	6654000	The PlayStation Portable, PSP?
6654000	6659000	I know they put those games out elsewhere and they had to translate the games for that.
6659000	6661000	Well, of course, the DS version of Final Fantasy 3, of course.
6661000	6666000	But to translate the original NES versions would be very, very, very interesting.
6666000	6670000	Because that would be the first time that a lot of people would get to play those original versions of 2 and 3.
6670000	6676000	But again, the fact that they say it's coming to the Vita as well, to me, that debunks the whole rumor.
6676000	6680000	I'm sorry to be so negative, but...
6680000	6682000	It could be a digital only release.
6682000	6683000	I guess.
6683000	6687000	I mean, if they're just, like, ROMs, if it's the ROM with the front end type thing.
6687000	6691000	You know what? ActDeft brings up a really good point. I gotta honor this.
6691000	6697000	ActDeft says, Japan loves the Vita, though. Remember that World of Final Fantasy got released on the Vita.
6697000	6700000	Weird, but that Sony doesn't love the Vita. That's kind of odd.
6700000	6707000	That's a good point. So if that collection exists for the Vita in Japan, it will never get released here.
6707000	6710000	Why aren't they trying to push the Vita? I mean, I don't understand this.
6710000	6714000	They're putting out so much content for it. Like, way more than the 3DS is getting.
6714000	6717000	But it's like, eh, fuck it. You know, whatever.
6717000	6718000	I don't know.
6718000	6719000	It's dead to us.
6719000	6725000	And then, Raginator in chat, of course, says, I would love to see the missing games show up on Steam.
6725000	6732000	Well, funny that you mention that, because, apparently, they are saying that the Final Fantasy VII Remake
6732000	6739000	and Final Fantasy XV will come to PC, but not until early to mid-2018.
6739000	6742000	So, sorry, you're gonna have to wait a little while.
6742000	6746000	But they're also saying with this, again, these rumors, like, don't stop.
6746000	6750000	And that's why I'm like, the more that you put out. Like, if it had just been the XIII trilogy,
6750000	6752000	I would have been like, alright, this is gonna happen.
6752000	6760000	But then they say Final Fantasy I, II, XII, Tactics, and Chrono Trigger, for some reason,
6760000	6765000	we're throwing that in the Final Fantasy anniversary, will be released on Steam before the end of 2017.
6765000	6771000	See, it's like, the more and more we add to this, the more I go, I don't know.
6771000	6777000	We'll see. It would be great if it was all true. I think there's, for all those things I named,
6777000	6780000	I know there's an audience for it out there, so it would be great if it was true.
6780000	6784000	Anyway, sorry, that's supposed to be rapid fire, that turned a little long, but there's just a lot to that.
6784000	6786000	Dark Sakura, what else do you have?
6786000	6792000	Tekken 7 is getting Kuma and Panda, which technically is the same character just for Pallet Swap.
6792000	6793000	Right.
6793000	6799000	But, we like Kuma and Panda, and they're there in all their fuzzy glory.
6799000	6806000	And then, last but not least, it looks like there's going to be a new addition to World of Final Fantasy.
6806000	6811000	Sora, from Kingdom Hearts, is showing up. Yay.
6811000	6816000	And I think it's more to promote the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8.
6816000	6819000	Ah, clever little bit of crossover, right?
6819000	6820000	Yup.
6820000	6828000	In chat, SJ100Matt wants to point out, Chrono Trigger was in the Final Fantasy Anthology disc with Final Fantasy IV for PlayStation 1.
6828000	6829000	True that.
6829000	6832000	Good point, I forgot about that. So, alright, well played.
6832000	6833000	Well played.
6833000	6840000	Alright, let's check out what's in stores this week as we travel around the world, starting with the US.
6840000	6844000	Not a whole lot of stuff being released this week, but we do have a few things.
6844000	6850000	So, starting off, looks like Bastion is going to be out on Xbox One.
6850000	6858000	Filthy Lucre, I guess? Lucre? I'm not sure how you pronounce that.
6858000	6860000	It's going to be out on PC.
6860000	6865000	Batman the Telltale series, episode 5, City of Light, out on pretty much all the platforms.
6865000	6874000	A game called Drive Drive Drive on PC and PlayStation 4, which is like a driving, racing game that you actually race down three tracks at the same time.
6874000	6875000	It's kind of fun.
6875000	6879000	Feist on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6879000	6882000	Stardew Valley on PlayStation 4 this week.
6882000	6887000	The Little Acre on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6887000	6893000	Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator on PC.
6893000	6895000	Space Hulk Deathwing on PC.
6895000	6900000	Stardew Valley also making its way out to Xbox One as well.
6900000	6904000	Akiba is Beat on PlayStation 4.
6904000	6907000	Botolo on PC and Mac.
6907000	6916000	And then on Vita we have Saga, Scarlet Grace, and of course Super Mario Runout on iOS.
6916000	6920000	And then that would be it.
6920000	6924000	Going to Japan, things slowing down there a little bit as well.
6924000	6929000	But on the PlayStation 4 this week you have Akiba's Beat comes out on December the 15th.
6929000	6935000	And there's also some new DualShock 4 controllers in Gold and Silver that will be out this week for the PlayStation 4.
6935000	6944000	As we talked about earlier, yes, we do have releases on the Vita such as Saga, Scarlet Grace comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
6944000	6949000	Adventure Time, Secrets of the Nameless Kingdom.
6949000	6953000	Yes, Adventure Time is making its way to Japan as well, so that's pretty cool.
6953000	6959000	And then lastly, looking at the 3DS this week in Japan, Yokai Watch 3.
6959000	6961000	Oh, that's why this is a slower week.
6961000	6965000	There's a Yokai Watch 3 coming out this week in Japan.
6965000	6968000	Sukiyaki is the game that's out this week.
6969000	6976000	Is that like a greatest... because there was already Sushi and Tempura which looks like it's getting some sort of box release.
6976000	6983000	So is this Sukiyaki kind of like what Pokemon Yellow would be?
6983000	6986000	Where it's kind of like the best parts of the first two?
6986000	6988000	Sukiyaki is delicious.
6988000	6993000	Yes, but that would also go in line with the fact that the other two games are called Sushi and Tempura.
6993000	6994000	Both of which are?
6994000	6996000	Delicious!
6997000	7001000	Let's see, that is it.
7001000	7005000	I'm looking at the Sega 3D archives, but sadly that's next week.
7005000	7007000	But that looks like it's going to be awesome as well.
7007000	7012000	Dude, those Sega 3D things on the DS are pretty awesome.
7012000	7015000	Anyhow, how about Europe, Dark Sakura?
7015000	7018000	On the 11th is Bastion for Xbox One.
7018000	7022000	On the 12th is Bridge Constructor for PlayStation 4.
7022000	7027000	The 13th has Feist for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7027000	7036000	And the 14th is Guilty Gear XRD 3rd Xrd Revelator for PC.
7036000	7039000	Alright, let's open up the mailbag.
7039000	7044000	Every week you guys email us, participate at orangelandradio.com if you want to participate with our mailbag segment.
7044000	7048000	Again, that's participate at orangelandradio.com.
7048000	7050000	Dark Sakura's back!
7050000	7055000	And that means I get to make her read emails once again on the show.
7055000	7059000	You've missed her, so she's going to cough her way through a few emails tonight, but just a couple, right?
7059000	7062000	Since the last show.
7062000	7066000	Since the last show discussed anime shows the hosted scene,
7066000	7075000	I recently began using Netflix's download feature to finally start using my commute to watch the over-the-top revenge fantasy Kill la Kill.
7075000	7076000	Kill la Kill is great.
7076000	7085000	Which I am definitely seeing the hype for that show, although who the hell do I think I am not watching Gurren Lagann first?
7085000	7091000	Previously, I watched the dub of Squid Girl slash Shinryaku Ikamusume.
7091000	7101000	Though, I'm sorry, through, which was cute enough, although I don't see nearly enough mention of that one in the anime circles.
7101000	7106000	I also, just for the heck of it, got the Cowboy Bebop box set, always a classic.
7106000	7109000	I've seen the first two episodes up to now.
7109000	7114000	Just to ask a rather unrelated animation series, by the way, am I imagining things,
7114000	7121000	or was the DuckTales-era Disney cartoon Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers supposed to be in some way a spiritual follow-up to The Rescuers?
7121000	7128000	Um, no. Not really. Not to my experience. It was more just a scenario for adventures.
7128000	7141000	But, um, the only anime that I've watched recently is I watched all of Danganronpa, Future in Despair, and then Hope.
7141000	7146000	Which, don't watch it unless you've played the other games. It won't make much sense.
7146000	7150000	I was going to say, you missed last, I don't remember if it was last week or the week before,
7150000	7153000	but somebody had emailed us, like, looking for anime recommendations.
7153000	7155000	You know me, I went blank, because I don't watch a lot of it.
7155000	7158000	Loki had some good ideas, and the chat helped out a lot, too.
7158000	7162000	But Dark Sakura, I know you used to watch a lot. I don't know if you do as much anymore.
7162000	7168000	Well, Attack on Titan season 2 is coming out. Or Shingeki no Kyojin is the Japanese name.
7168000	7173000	Um, I've really been out of those circles for a while.
7173000	7179000	Um, I tried, the last one I tried to watch with any seriousness was Gachomon Crowds,
7179000	7186000	which, it ended up just completely not being good at all, because it's not real Gachomon.
7186000	7191000	I know Tatsunoko produced it, but it's not fucking Gachomon. So, no.
7191000	7200000	Um, I've watched, um, Macross Frontier was pretty good. It's a little old now.
7200000	7206000	Um, and there was a Trigun OAV that came out not too long ago.
7206000	7212000	Um, and then of course I've seen some of the Ghibli movies that have come out, so.
7212000	7216000	Yeah, that was my best suggestion. I mean, everybody talks about them for a reason.
7216000	7222000	I always tell people to start with the classics, though. I mean, and actually, and this one was from Robert M.
7222000	7229000	Um, I've got the Cowboy Bebop box set that came out when the series was still relatively new,
7229000	7232000	and we marathoned all of it in one night.
7232000	7237000	Um, if you're looking for something around that era of anime, you could also look for Trigun.
7237000	7240000	That, you know, that one's really good.
7240000	7245000	If you like Cowboy Bebop and you want something a little bit more raunchy, there's also Space Dandy,
7245000	7252000	which is by the same, uh, artist. It's definitely out there. It's pretty fun.
7252000	7256000	Um, and, uh, goodness.
7256000	7259000	Let me get, while you brainstorm, let me get to a chat comment here.
7259000	7262000	Raginator in Chat says Netflix has a download feature.
7262000	7268000	Yeah, that was, uh, that was a pretty big deal in some of the news, uh, tech news like last week or the week before.
7268000	7269000	Yeah, certain titles.
7269000	7273000	Yeah, not all of them, but certain titles you can now download.
7273000	7279000	And he asked a follow-up question. What's to stop people from abusing that feature by pirating the shit out of videos?
7279000	7285000	My assumption is that they're encoded somehow, probably using some PC or personal information as the key.
7285000	7291000	So that way, if it ended up on a website, they'd know who did it and it wouldn't be viewable without your ID or something like that.
7291000	7298000	So that's my guess. I don't know that to be true, but I would assume that something with the technology of Netflix behind it
7298000	7304000	probably has the power to encrypt the file, uh, that your device only can view it.
7304000	7310000	And also, as far as, like, androids, I guess, are a little different, but as far as, like, the iOS devices,
7310000	7312000	it's not exactly the easiest thing in the world to go pull a file.
7312000	7316000	I mean, yes, I know there's third-party apps that do it, but it's not, like, something everybody uses.
7316000	7317000	No supported way.
7317000	7321000	Yeah, exactly. So, anyway, any other quick anime recommendations for the next month?
7321000	7326000	Off to the top of my head, I tell everyone, of course, to go back and watch the classics. Watch Gachamon. It is the best.
7326000	7327000	Fair enough.
7327000	7336000	Um, the last one actually has already been covered in a topic. It says, Greetings, Peoples, and there's a link to the Vivendi article.
7336000	7337000	Sure.
7337000	7340000	Um, this week I saw another development in Vivendi's bid to take over Ubisoft.
7341000	7346000	Um, I heard people decrying this action for months, but have yet to hear an answer to this question.
7346000	7348000	Why is this a bad thing?
7348000	7351000	Uh, staycare, entertainment, trainer.
7351000	7356000	The most simple answer I have for that is because some of Activision's worst years were under that.
7356000	7359000	That's right, Logie. That's pretty much the quickest answer for that.
7359000	7362000	Why people are afraid about the Vivendi thing.
7362000	7366000	Um, yeah, I mean, just I think how well they did with Activision, basically.
7366000	7368000	That's essentially what it was.
7368000	7371000	Kill off Sierra Games and like all of it.
7371000	7372000	Uh, yeah.
7372000	7373000	Westwood.
7373000	7376000	There was that, yep, there was that whole stuff with like King's Quest and then the whole like...
7376000	7379000	Or Westwood, that might have been EA.
7379000	7380000	I don't know.
7380000	7384000	But still, um, yeah. In a nutshell, that's part of it.
7384000	7388000	Um, I think at the end of the day, if the games are there, nobody's gonna care.
7388000	7394000	But, I think that it's, their track record is what concerns people.
7394000	7396000	Alright, that's it for emails.
7396000	7401000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
7401000	7404000	We are almost to calls, but we have a few more stories before that.
7404000	7406000	Starting with Logie.
7406000	7409000	Alright, um, so this is pretty cool that...
7409000	7410000	Thank you.
7410000	7415000	Um, Valve is doing a major update for, uh, Dota 2.
7415000	7418000	And so now this is a 7.0 update.
7418000	7422000	They're doing, I guess it's in a test client right now.
7422000	7426000	Um, and they're calling the patch the New Journey.
7426000	7431000	So, what they're gonna be changing on that, the user interface has been reworked.
7431000	7436000	They're, I guess, opening up more space on screen so you can see more of the action.
7436000	7444000	Uh, they're also, uh, big gameplay changes have been made, including reworks of old heroes, a branching talent system.
7444000	7452000	Um, they're saying, like, in Heroes of the Storm, a small fountain strewn around the map to allow characters to swap inventory while away from their base.
7452000	7454000	And the map has also been altered.
7454000	7458000	There are, um, also some other changes they made as well.
7458000	7467000	A new backpack system allows, uh, players to compete in multi-part items without having to return to base.
7467000	7472000	And also, three heroes have received model updates.
7472000	7477000	Looks like Slaughter, Viper, and Enigma.
7477000	7485000	And then also, users can now script computer-controlled characters when creating custom game modes.
7485000	7487000	So, quite a bit of stuff, it looks like.
7487000	7493000	I need to go back and revisit Dota 2, clearly, because that's, uh, that's a lot of changes, uh, in this game.
7493000	7497000	Especially, like, when they change the interface, uh, a lot to, you know, uh...
7497000	7499000	Yeah, it's very minimal now, so that's kinda nice.
7499000	7503000	That'll be, I'm sure that'll be good for people that stream this game, uh, quite a bit.
7503000	7509000	So, yeah, I gotta, I have to admit, guys, you know, I don't, there's a lot of those lane games out, right?
7509000	7513000	You know, you got League of Legends, you got Dota, you got Heroes of the Storm, Smite is a lane game.
7513000	7517000	You know, there's a lot of these out there, it's, it's hard for me to follow them all.
7517000	7521000	But I know this is, like, an insanely popular title, especially on Twitch.
7521000	7525000	And it seems like this is, like, a global, like, there's a huge global following for this game, right?
7525000	7527000	Yeah, definitely.
7527000	7533000	So, uh, but I'm very curious about the fact that they also put in the branching talent system, similar to what they have in Heroes of the Storm.
7533000	7539000	So, um, maybe they're trying to make it a little more accessible, or easier for people to understand, I don't know.
7539000	7544000	Anyhow, uh, lots and lots of news on Pokemon Go these past few weeks.
7544000	7549000	Uh, dataminers went to town on a new version of Pokemon Go that was pushed out to devices.
7549000	7554000	Uh, the Silph Road is the, uh, is it the Reddit or the website? I think it's both. It's a Reddit and a website.
7554000	7555000	Yeah, it's both.
7555000	7558000	Uh, that really goes to town on Pokemon and Pokemon Go.
7558000	7561000	And, uh, they did some datamining of the game.
7561000	7566000	And, uh, they found, within the game, the sound files for 100 new monsters.
7566000	7568000	That would be the Gen 2 monsters.
7568000	7572000	They're not able to find graphics, though, because apparently graphics went back server-side.
7572000	7576000	So, you can't see the graphics, uh, in these patches anymore.
7576000	7582000	There is also a new section for Shinies, which, uh, I'm sure if Shane was out there, he would perk up.
7582000	7585000	Actually, I did, I did message Shane as soon as I saw this.
7585000	7587000	I said, Shane, did you hear about Shinies and Pokemon Go?
7587000	7593000	And he's kinda, like, he was not, he did not go, like, oh, I gotta play it again.
7593000	7595000	He was kinda, like, eh.
7595000	7598000	So, I don't know. I think, I think it'll be all about implementation.
7598000	7600000	How are Shinies gonna be in there? Who knows?
7600000	7605000	But what's also interesting in the datamining, you're supposed to be able to add costumes to your companions.
7605000	7607000	Uh, a holiday section is one of the ones that's there.
7607000	7612000	Uh, there's also gonna be avatar customization, including sponsored content.
7612000	7618000	And, uh, Pokemon will now have genders outside of Nidoran male and female,
7618000	7623000	which would be in line with what happened in Gen 2 in the main games anyway.
7623000	7626000	What about my non-binary Pokemon?
7626000	7632000	Uh, in the Pokemon games, as of Gen 7, that doesn't exist.
7632000	7633000	Damn them.
7633000	7641000	So, um, but anyway, um, so, that pretty much confirms that Gen 2 is happening.
7641000	7643000	It's just a matter of when.
7643000	7646000	Well, that when could be as soon as Monday, uh, tomorrow.
7646000	7648000	By the time you hear this, perhaps.
7648000	7655000	Uh, apparently, Niantic is gonna be doing a huge, uh, release of information on Monday.
7655000	7660000	They have actually said so much as information on new Pokemon coming out Monday.
7660000	7665000	However, a lot of folks jumping to conclusions that that means Gen 2.
7665000	7672000	But before you get your hopes up, I wanna remind you, there are three legendary birds that you still cannot get in Gen 1.
7672000	7675000	They could do a holiday event that will involve those birds.
7675000	7680000	And that would be new Pokemon. So, lowered expectations, people.
7680000	7686000	But the fact that the sound files exist, I mean, it's very clear that they will implement Gen 2 at some point.
7686000	7687000	Yeah.
7687000	7689000	It may not be Monday.
7689000	7697000	Meanwhile, though, uh, sponsorships galore for Pokemon Go, including a Starbucks just went live, uh, on Friday at 11 AM.
7697000	7701000	7,800 stores turned into PokeStops and gyms.
7701000	7703000	Most across the street from each other.
7703000	7713000	Right? Or, like, at least one year my work, um, it's right next door to what's a grocery store called The Nugget that I don't think probably exists anywhere but Northern California.
7713000	7720000	Um, but The Nugget is a PokeStop. So, literally, you have two PokeStops, like, right next to each other that you can hit from Starbucks.
7720000	7726000	Because they're both, uh, the one was a portal in Ingress. Which, by the way, none of these are portals in Ingress.
7726000	7727000	Thanks, Niantic.
7727000	7728000	Thanks, Niantic.
7728000	7734000	Now we have, uh, diversion. Well, did the Union Banks go into Pokemon Go? I didn't check for that.
7734000	7735000	They did go into Ingress?
7735000	7740000	Yeah, Union Bank went into Ingress. When SoftBank, uh, acquired Union Bank, those all became, uh, Ingress portals.
7740000	7745000	Like, in Roseville on Douglas Boulevard. Sorry to get local, guys, but I have to for Loki.
7745000	7749000	Uh, on Douglas Boulevard by the Mongolian BBQ, we really like. You know what I'm talking about?
7749000	7750000	Uh-huh.
7750000	7753000	Not, okay, there's a Union Bank there, and that's now an Ingress portal.
7753000	7754000	Eh.
7754000	7756000	But I don't know if it's a PokeStop. I didn't check.
7756000	7760000	I'm still not interested in the fact that the Circle Ks became Ingress, uh, portals.
7760000	7765000	Because they don't have the cool, like, where you buy stuff from there and you get the, you know, receipt with code that you can turn into items.
7765000	7768000	Yeah, yeah, no, and the hint water thing went away, too.
7768000	7778000	Um, but anyway, so, yeah, all the Starbucks, and there's a Frappuccino that they advertise in the game, but they don't advertise it in stores.
7778000	7785000	And so you can actually order this at the, and they know how to make it, because this whole thing got leaked through an internal memo anyway.
7785000	7792000	But the, um, the frappe, which I actually ordered one yesterday, because I was just like, fuck it, I'll try it, and, you know, see what it is.
7792000	7801000	It's a vanilla frappe. There's no coffee in it, so it's a non-coffee frappe. It's vanilla, and they put blackberries in it and blend it, and then I think some raspberry sauce?
7801000	7806000	Get it? It's berries. Because Pokemon Go, the berries, get it? Anyway.
7806000	7819000	Um, but, I have to admit, I don't know if I walked in on something else going on, but I feel like the employees at Starbucks laughed at me when I ordered the Pokemon Go thing, and that really wasn't cool.
7819000	7824000	Like, don't fucking have this promotion where people are giving you money and then laugh at people who are buying them.
7824000	7828000	But I don't know, what are you uh-oh-ing there? Oh, did you get your ditto here?
7828000	7829000	Yep.
7829000	7830000	There's a ditto out?
7830000	7831000	I just got a ditto.
7831000	7832000	Hey, Alan! Alan!
7832000	7833000	It's a Pidgey!
7833000	7834000	Ditto!
7834000	7835000	It's a Pidgey.
7836000	7838000	Have you caught a ditto yet, Alan?
7838000	7839000	I have not.
7839000	7842000	He's got his phone out. Loki's got his phone out.
7842000	7844000	I sort of want to do it.
7844000	7847000	Yeah, apparently dittos hang out at the house.
7847000	7860000	Alright, um, where was I going with that? Oh yes, so that is not the only sponsorship that's happening at Starbucks, but Sprint also announced that Sprint stores will be turning into Pokestops.
7860000	7865000	It's weird, though, because the Sprint announcement came first, but the Sprint stores are still not Pokestops.
7865000	7869000	But I believe that happens on Monday, is when that whole thing starts.
7869000	7876000	So, gonna be lots of new Pokestops popping up between Starbucks and what used to be Radio Shack.
7876000	7877000	So, there you go.
7877000	7879000	And he ran away, that asshole.
7879000	7885000	Everybody in chat is going, this is not a drill, ditto alert, stop the show, ditto alert.
7885000	7886000	Another Rhyhorn, though.
7886000	7889000	I just think it's great that right after you catch it, it goes, oh?
7889000	7900000	Alright, anyway, let's move on, whoever's next, because I'm not looking at show roll, because I gotta catch this Pidgey wink.
7900000	7901000	I guess that's me, isn't it?
7901000	7903000	Yes, well you already caught the Pokemon anyway.
7903000	7906000	Whatever, I have to post it all over the internet.
7906000	7914000	Nintendo is, looks like the Nintendo Switch is going to have GameCube titles on it via virtual console.
7915000	7921000	Eurogamer heard from three separate sources about this, and that they've already confirmed three titles.
7921000	7926000	Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, and Super Smash Brothers Melee.
7926000	7934000	There's also a possibility that Animal Crossing might be included, so everyone can go back and play the old schoolness of the old Animal Crossing.
7934000	7943000	They're also saying that there should be an update program where you can upgrade previous virtual console purchases to use on the Switch, instead of having to buy them again.
7944000	7946000	So, let's hope so.
7949000	7950000	Uh oh.
7950000	7954000	Oh, oh, because we all heard Loki take a breath, isn't that why we're O-ing?
7954000	7959000	No, I was just thinking, yeah, I'm sure that's going to work, just like the stupid virtual console shit that we're in the fuck.
7959000	7962000	Hey, you know what? I gotta say, I gotta say this.
7962000	7968000	The classic NES is the best interface I've seen yet for the virtual console.
7968000	7977000	So if those guys are doing the Switch's virtual console, then I am cautiously optimistic, I think is the best way to put it.
7977000	7979000	I'm cautiously optimistic.
7979000	7985000	But I guess this is all really rumor anyway, and we won't really know until the 12th of January.
7987000	7992000	Aw, Alan, come here. Alan has to tell this story on air.
7992000	7999000	Alan, he's probably, he might be in the middle of playing Morrowind, however, though, because I know he's been playing that recently.
7999000	8003000	Or, come here, Alan, you have to tell this story to the listeners.
8003000	8007000	Because the listeners are commenting, it's been a while since Pokemon go, derailed the show.
8007000	8017000	So Alan, who I woke up out of slumber one day to say, there's a ditto outside, get it, and then the Pokemon was already gone by the time he reached over and got his phone.
8017000	8019000	What happened with this ditto just now?
8019000	8027000	I threw two Ultra Balls, I went straight for the big leagues, I got a great throw and a nice throw, and it broke out both times and then ran away.
8027000	8029000	So I didn't get shit.
8029000	8030000	You know what?
8030000	8031000	What?
8031000	8033000	I used a regular Poke Ball and it was red.
8033000	8036000	Yeah, because we didn't know it was a ditto until you caught it.
8036000	8037000	Yeah.
8037000	8044000	I'm sorry, Alan. Alan, I have two, so when they finally release trading, I'll give you a ditto. How's that sound?
8044000	8045000	That's fine.
8045000	8049000	If I find another one, I will alert you to its existence.
8049000	8053000	We are on ditto alert here at Studio N7.
8053000	8057000	Who cares about baby watch? This is ditto watch.
8057000	8059000	Yeah.
8059000	8060000	Ditto!
8060000	8061000	Who cares about babies?
8061000	8063000	Ditto!
8063000	8066000	Alright, moving on. Loki.
8066000	8073000	In a move that I'm sure is going to make for incredibly great movies, or not.
8073000	8080000	We have Will Ferrell starring in a movie based off an esports player.
8080000	8082000	Nope.
8082000	8083000	Yes, so...
8083000	8084000	Nope.
8084000	8085000	Nope.
8085000	8086000	Nope.
8086000	8087000	I don't even need to know anymore about this movie.
8087000	8088000	Nope.
8088000	8089000	But hold on.
8089000	8090000	Nope.
8090000	8094000	It's written by the guy that did the script for the SpongeBob SquarePants 3 movie.
8094000	8095000	Nope 2.
8095000	8100000	And apparently he's going to be a similar character as the one he played in Talladega Nights.
8100000	8101000	Nope.
8102000	8104000	Will this be insulting to video game players?
8104000	8105000	Yep.
8105000	8106000	Yeah.
8108000	8112000	Yeah, SSG100Matt in chat says, surprise, this wasn't an Adam Sandler movie.
8112000	8115000	No, Adam Sandler now has that deal with Netflix.
8115000	8117000	So that, because fucking everybody's on Netflix now.
8117000	8121000	But Adam Sandler has that deal with Netflix where now his movies just go directly to Netflix.
8121000	8124000	So you don't have to tell or admit to anybody that you're watching them.
8126000	8127000	So.
8128000	8131000	I just, I mean, I like Will Ferrell.
8131000	8133000	I mean, I think he's funny.
8133000	8138000	But there's no way this movie's not going to be completely insulting to everybody.
8139000	8140000	I know.
8140000	8141000	I'm very worried about it.
8141000	8142000	I don't know.
8142000	8146000	I mean, I guess, like, Talladega Nights was insulting to NASCAR fans.
8147000	8150000	So I don't really care about that, but I mean, you know.
8150000	8155000	And I'm not really huge into esports, but like, can we get past the stigma like,
8155000	8160000	oh my god, there's people who play games for, for like, you know, professionally.
8160000	8161000	Oh, the what nerds.
8161000	8163000	I mean, like, what year is this?
8163000	8164000	I mean, seriously.
8165000	8168000	That we're devolving this as, like, funny.
8168000	8174000	But yet, you know, we are all impressed when there's football players in their late 30s and all this stuff.
8174000	8177000	It's like, I don't know, it's a bit of a double standard, but anyway.
8177000	8178000	Whatever.
8178000	8179000	Yeah.
8179000	8180000	Anyhow.
8181000	8184000	Moving on to other news.
8184000	8186000	Darksacra, where did you find that Psyduck?
8186000	8187000	Right here?
8187000	8188000	I just hatched it.
8188000	8189000	Sorry.
8189000	8190000	Oh, you hatched it?
8190000	8191000	Yeah.
8191000	8192000	I keep finding Rhyhorns in your front yard.
8192000	8193000	Yeah, I know.
8193000	8195000	There's tons of Rhyhorns and tons of Pikachus.
8195000	8196000	Here.
8196000	8197000	Anyway.
8197000	8199000	How have I not caught any more Pikachus?
8199000	8200000	I need a Raichu.
8200000	8203000	And the rest of y'all stopped playing Pokemon Go.
8203000	8205000	Yeah, I did, because it's fucking boring.
8205000	8206000	At least I didn't go back to Ingress.
8206000	8207000	Hey, watch it.
8207000	8208000	All right.
8208000	8209000	We could use your help, you know.
8209000	8213000	I did find someone, by the way, working on the portal by my house.
8213000	8214000	Did you really?
8214000	8215000	Yeah.
8215000	8216000	Did you pull over where you're like, green or blue?
8216000	8218000	And if they said blue, I'm calling the cops.
8218000	8219000	No, I can't.
8219000	8221000	I always see people stopped at places.
8221000	8222000	I could see.
8222000	8223000	It was, they were blue.
8223000	8226000	It was one of our neighborhood people, but I didn't see anything.
8226000	8229000	Because I was like, I didn't want them to know I was a Defector.
8229000	8230000	Oh.
8230000	8231000	We need Defector.
8231000	8232000	I didn't go green.
8232000	8233000	I went to Pokemon Go.
8233000	8234000	Oh.
8234000	8235000	Which is better.
8235000	8236000	Whatever.
8236000	8237000	Anyway.
8237000	8238000	Ingress was giving me stress.
8238000	8239000	On Pokemon Go.
8239000	8241000	It was making me throw up because I'd get mad at the red team.
8242000	8243000	There's no fucking red team.
8243000	8244000	Not red.
8244000	8245000	I meant green.
8245000	8246000	Did you know what game you were playing?
8246000	8247000	Where were you with the green team?
8247000	8248000	Did you?
8248000	8249000	Who are you?
8249000	8251000	You know what I mean?
8251000	8253000	She was the fucking mole the whole time.
8253000	8254000	No, I wasn't.
8254000	8255000	I mean.
8255000	8256000	That's why our farms get smashed.
8256000	8257000	It was you.
8257000	8258000	No.
8258000	8259000	You know what I mean?
8259000	8260000	I know what you mean.
8260000	8263000	It was that same person who had pissed me off, so I finally just stopped playing.
8263000	8265000	All right.
8265000	8266000	Look.
8266000	8267000	Anyway.
8267000	8269000	Moving on to our final news story tonight.
8269000	8272000	Speaking of tragedy.
8272000	8273000	The show?
8273000	8274000	No.
8274000	8275000	Konami, actually.
8275000	8276000	That's a big tragedy.
8276000	8277000	Okay.
8277000	8278000	That counts.
8278000	8279000	It's a story about Konami.
8279000	8284000	Do you remember a few weeks ago on the show, we talked about the Castlevania remade game,
8284000	8287000	which was being made in Unreal Engine.
8287000	8288000	It was a fan game.
8288000	8293000	It was going to remake all of the NES Castlevania, but within the Unreal Engine, and it looked
8293000	8295000	really good.
8295000	8297000	Y'all know the rest of the story.
8297000	8298000	Where am I going with it?
8298000	8300000	This is why we can't have nice things.
8300000	8301000	What's the punchline, everybody?
8301000	8303000	What happened to the Castlevania remake?
8303000	8304000	Konami will sue.
8304000	8306000	Cease and desist.
8306000	8307000	That's right, y'all.
8307000	8311000	Castlevania dark-sided C and D. That's it.
8311000	8318000	Cease and desist sent from Konami to the developers, and Deja Wolves, which was the developer,
8318000	8322000	announced that all updates and production of the game was ordered to stop.
8322000	8328000	However, also said that they have been allowed to keep the files for now, and still hopeful
8328000	8330000	the development can continue in the future.
8330000	8334000	He's talking to someone from Konami UK about acquiring an official license.
8334000	8336000	Here comes the Kickstarter.
8336000	8339000	That way, he can continue to work on the game.
8339000	8342000	So, interesting that the files are still out there.
8342000	8346000	At least perhaps this presents an awareness that once it's on the internet, it's always
8346000	8348000	on the internet, and it wasn't going to go anywhere.
8348000	8351000	So, maybe there's that, if nothing else.
8351000	8355000	But for now, no more work to come on that game.
8355000	8362000	For what it's worth, as much as we envision that Konami is nothing but a pachinko company now,
8362000	8366000	perhaps they are going to put their foot in gaming once again.
8366000	8376000	There's a recent, what is this, a trademark that was filed by Konami for Turbo Graphics.
8376000	8379000	What the fuck is Konami doing involved with Turbo Graphics?
8379000	8383000	Well, remember, the Turbo Graphics was from NEC and Hudson Soft.
8383000	8386000	And who bought Hudson several years ago?
8386000	8387000	Many years ago at this point.
8387000	8389000	That was Konami. Yep.
8389000	8394000	So, Konami technically owns basically those IPs in that license now.
8394000	8397000	So, Konami filed a trademark for Turbo Graphics.
8397000	8399000	It was filed on December 1st.
8399000	8404000	A lot of different classifications, including video games and game consoles.
8404000	8406000	Kanye West album not mentioned.
8406000	8407000	I don't know if you all know that.
8407000	8410000	Did you know Kanye West working on an album called Turbo Graphics 16?
8410000	8414000	I mean, he's had some personal difficulties that are going to delay that album a bit.
8414000	8415000	I don't fucking care.
8415000	8416000	I know, I know.
8416000	8419000	But anyway, so what does this mean?
8419000	8423000	Will they be bringing, I think this is very clear exactly what it means.
8423000	8426000	I see NES minis on the shelf.
8426000	8430000	I see classic Genesis stuff on the shelf.
8430000	8432000	You mean Phil Collins?
8432000	8433000	Right.
8434000	8441000	So, I'm sure this just means a mini Turbo Graphics 16 will be on its way before too long.
8441000	8443000	I want it to play HuCards.
8443000	8449000	If it had, oh my god, what if it actually had like duo hookups and had a built-in arcade card?
8449000	8457000	I would weep happy tears because then I could finally play the Super CD version of Strider.
8457000	8459000	I wouldn't expect it.
8459000	8462000	But maybe that version of Strider will be built into the device.
8462000	8464000	I doubt that seriously.
8464000	8465000	I doubt it.
8465000	8468000	I think it'll be, ooh, it's Bonk and Keith Courage all over again.
8468000	8469000	Yippee yay.
8469000	8471000	It'll be all the same stuff they released on Virtual Console.
8471000	8474000	Which would at least include Aliens Crush and Devil's Crush.
8474000	8476000	So maybe this isn't the end of the world.
8476000	8478000	What? Those games are awesome.
8478000	8481000	They are, but I'm just thinking of the other ones.
8481000	8489000	I mean, at least, I mean, can't we get like Legendary Wings or one of the...
8489000	8492000	Crap, what was one of the other?
8492000	8494000	Crap, I forgot.
8494000	8497000	I think it was one of the Thunder Force games.
8497000	8498000	I don't know.
8498000	8501000	Alright, maybe you know and you want to call us to tell us.
8501000	8505000	We're going to do, I know, we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lawns Radio on Skype,
8505000	8508000	but before we get there, one more story, right, Jamie?
8508000	8511000	Yes, and this is just a little bit of interest.
8511000	8518000	There have been very bad Akira games that came out, and we all know what Akira is from the movie, right?
8518000	8527000	And manga that involved Kaneda and his awesome bike and Tetsuo who got really screwed over in the end.
8527000	8543000	But a guy named Patrick Scott Peterson got his hand on four copies of an unfinished prototype for a Game Boy version of an Akira game.
8543000	8551000	And they were all at different build stages as well, so he was able to go through and see how much of the game had been done.
8551000	8560000	It kind of, the first levels play like Excitebike to be honest, you know, complete with, you know, obstacles and jumping ramps and things.
8560000	8564000	But then it had platforming levels as well.
8564000	8568000	It didn't really have much in the way of all the graphics done.
8568000	8580000	There were plenty of placeholders left, and it had like the same stage over, but it had the final boss in it, which was the kind of messed up Tetsuo from the end of the movie.
8580000	8586000	But the placeholder music also was really terrible.
8586000	8591000	I don't think it had anything really to do with the series, but it was interesting seeing it.
8591000	8599000	And I like when people find just those little prototypes after, you know, when you're finding these unlabeled copies.
8599000	8604000	And lo and behold, it's something that was never released, so that was pretty good.
8604000	8609000	Little unearthed treasures, even if it was probably not that great of a game.
8609000	8614000	It's like the type of, you know, treasure, like when you find dog poo.
8615000	8617000	It didn't look very fun.
8617000	8621000	Skypline's open, y'all. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8621000	8627000	If you want to give us a call, we will take your calls about something we have talked about, or perhaps something we haven't.
8627000	8630000	We'll find out. Let's get to it, though.
8630000	8632000	We got the Skype line lighting up, but we'll start off with this call.
8632000	8634000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8634000	8636000	Hi, this is Bobby from Atlanta.
8636000	8638000	Hi, Bobby. It's nice to have you.
8638000	8641000	You know, you are kind enough to have us on your show every week.
8641000	8645000	It's nice to have this show graced with your presence once in a while. Thanks for calling in.
8645000	8649000	Yeah, so I'm asking for some receipts.
8649000	8650000	All right.
8650000	8660000	Because there was an assertion, or an accusation, really, made on this fine program of yours several hours ago, way back in Part A.
8660000	8667000	And I'm trying to figure out, like, I want to see the receipts, because it doesn't seem plausible to me that a company named Nintendo,
8667000	8673000	four months before they are supposed to release a new console thingy to the world,
8673000	8680000	has not actually figured out the core gimmick technology of that console.
8680000	8687000	And I'm trying to figure out why it seems, because I watched the video on The Tonight Show again,
8687000	8693000	and I noticed that, you know, when they were on the screen, they moved the character and moved the camera,
8693000	8697000	and then when the tablet had the game on, it was in the exact same place.
8697000	8702000	And I'm hearing on this show that it was faked with two feeds.
8702000	8707000	And I'm wondering what clued you into that, because I am not seeing this.
8707000	8714000	Well, because the vast delay between switching from their overhead screen to the other screen. There you go.
8714000	8715000	That's it?
8715000	8721000	So how did they get the camera position in the exact right space on the tablet?
8721000	8723000	I don't know if it was in the exact space.
8723000	8734000	I mean, if that's really good of them to watch and have a second person move the, or put the main feed on the same, at the same place before they shut it off.
8734000	8739000	And I had theorized in chat, I didn't say this on air, but I theorized in chat when this topic was coming up,
8739000	8747000	was that, well, I could see that they perhaps do some pre-recorded things to prevent a technical foul,
8747000	8753000	especially because the environment of a television studio live TV broadcast is not somebody's living room.
8753000	8755000	And Tonight Show is not live. It is live to tape.
8755000	8760000	Well, I guess, okay, that's true. That's fair. Well, they still wouldn't want to screw. It is in front of a live audience, however, still.
8760000	8761000	Yes.
8761000	8766000	So they probably want to minimize those types of screw-ups. So that I could see.
8766000	8772000	But when Reggie did whatever he did, like he was talking to buy time or whatever,
8772000	8779000	I figured that what he's hiding is that, yes, there is a transition time between moving it from the dock to the handheld.
8779000	8784000	And that's, but that's okay. Like if there's, I mean, it wasn't more than 15 seconds.
8784000	8789000	And so I think that's reasonable. But, Loki, do you still think it was faked?
8789000	8792000	I just don't, I don't think that necessarily technology is not working.
8792000	8799000	I just think maybe what their, whatever dev unit they're using out there isn't ready to do that.
8800000	8803000	But they're four months away from mass production.
8803000	8805000	Right. And I'm not saying that...
8805000	8807000	Do you really think, like, do you think it's not coming out in March?
8807000	8812000	Because if it's not working on their dev units now, they're not going to have a production ready in four months.
8812000	8817000	I don't know what's working on their dev units, to be honest with me, but honestly, I don't care.
8817000	8820000	So it just doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel true to you.
8820000	8822000	Yes, it doesn't feel like, okay, let's put it this way.
8822000	8828000	It doesn't feel like the initial thing that they showed off on their trailer, if you will,
8828000	8831000	which was totally faked. The trailer was totally faked.
8831000	8832000	Well, right.
8832000	8836000	Because they even said the actors were playing with a blank screen.
8836000	8841000	All the screens were put in post-production in the three-minute teaser trailer.
8841000	8846000	Okay, so now we're starting to find some common ground here, at least, in trying to mediate this whole thing.
8846000	8850000	I feel like now I'm starting to see where the thing is.
8850000	8855000	So, Loki, you're seeing, like, this does not function the way that it functioned in the trailer.
8855000	8860000	Well, it just doesn't seem like that, like, it was odd that he was buying time.
8860000	8863000	Like, and I'm always curious when someone's buying time for something.
8863000	8864000	Okay.
8864000	8866000	It's like, well, what are you not showing me?
8866000	8873000	Okay, okay, so then that, so it's the buying time that leads you to suspect something's fishy.
8873000	8878000	Yeah, I just figured that they're showing kind of an example of what it looked like on this, you know,
8878000	8881000	version of the device that they had, that maybe they had two devices.
8881000	8885000	One was hooked up, you know, via HDMI to their display or whatever it was,
8885000	8889000	and they had a second one that was, you know, running the game on the tablet,
8889000	8891000	and just to kind of give you an idea of what it looked like.
8891000	8895000	And they were just amazingly able to get the camera angle and the character in the exact same position
8895000	8898000	on both of those on live national television.
8898000	8900000	Yes, sure, why not?
8900000	8904000	Because Occam's Razor says it was all the same device.
8904000	8910000	True, but Nintendo's Razor says that I don't believe they're bullshit, so, you know.
8910000	8917000	So it just doesn't fit your worldview, so you're going to make the truthiness of it couldn't have been real
8917000	8922000	instead of the more likely scenario of it was actually real, and there is something in the dev unit
8922000	8925000	that caused him to have to buy time for 15 seconds.
8925000	8929000	I really don't care. Like, I literally didn't care at all because the footage they were showing me
8929000	8934000	of Zelda Breath of the Wild was unimpressive, because I've already seen that bullshit.
8934000	8938000	But you see, it's still a huge accusation to say they haven't figured out the tech for months before the show's coming.
8938000	8941000	Did I say that? Because I sure as hell did not fucking say that.
8941000	8944000	You did say that you don't think they figured it out yet, which is why they had to fake it.
8944000	8947000	They're online they haven't figured out yet.
8947000	8952000	I was talking about the fact that they have always online for the stupid Super Mario run.
8952000	8956000	I said that's where they're behind. I never said they didn't figure out the tech switching between a screen,
8956000	8960000	and obviously this is the only gimmick that's on that machine.
8960000	8965000	I would hope that they have that figured out. Never did I quote that they didn't have that part figured out yet.
8965000	8969000	Because I would have probably asserted that that system would be delayed if that was the case.
8971000	8973000	Alright. I love you, Loki.
8975000	8976000	Good talk.
8976000	8978000	Alright, it was a good idea. I feel like we worked it out.
8980000	8981000	Hug it out, hug it out.
8981000	8985000	I saw some receipts. I maybe didn't agree with the receipts, but I saw them.
8985000	8991000	Alright, fair enough. And I also feel like, okay, I feel like when we kind of hit on the differences between the trailer
8991000	8995000	and what we saw on the Tonight Show, now we're starting to, I'm starting to see what the difference is.
8995000	9001000	I just wish there was some new footage for like, like we've seen the same damn area of that map for like ever now.
9001000	9003000	January 12th. 31 days.
9003000	9005000	January 12th. 31 days.
9007000	9012000	Like even what they showed off at the Game Awards where it's like, it's like we've already seen this shit.
9012000	9019000	Like, come on. Just like, show us something new. Different. That's like, wow, that's really got me interested.
9019000	9023000	Let me, let me ask this, and I think Bobby, you'd want to stay on the line for this one.
9023000	9031000	Let me ask this. What, what would it take on January 12th for you to be like, okay, I was wrong. I'm pre-ordering a Switch.
9031000	9034000	Well, I already want a pre-order one, but like, how about, how about this?
9034000	9036000	Hi, Bobby. Thanks for the call. No, I'm just kidding.
9036000	9041000	No, how about this? That we're not going to fuck up our stupid supply and demand shit and they're going to be available in stores.
9041000	9043000	So you want, you want Reggie to say we're not going to fuck up our supply and demand?
9043000	9048000	Well, I want them to actually not fuck it up because I don't care what he says, you know, what will happen in stores.
9048000	9053000	Yeah, we just didn't anticipate the demand on this system. Bull fucking shit.
9053000	9058000	You know what, Loki? I, I honestly, I think you, that is a completely fair criticism.
9058000	9062000	It's a completely fair criticism of Nintendo based on their track record of the Wii.
9062000	9064000	Yeah, don't get me wrong. I like Nintendo's system.
9064000	9070000	The Amiibos, the, probably would have been the Wii U if more people had been into it, and the classic NES Mini.
9070000	9071000	I mean, we do have a pattern.
9071000	9076000	It was still the Wii U. Even when that first came out, even though that many people weren't into it, it was still the Wii U.
9076000	9079000	All right. That, that, Bobby, I would say that's a fair criticism, right?
9079000	9080000	Yes, absolutely.
9080000	9081000	Absolutely.
9081000	9083000	All right. I hope they don't fuck it up either.
9083000	9084000	Like, like, come on.
9084000	9087000	It's so refreshing to hear you swear on this program.
9087000	9093000	Well, it's just like, I mean, you don't have your, you don't have any idea how to do supply chain at this point.
9093000	9096000	I mean, come on. I mean, who's, who's actually going to believe that at this point?
9096000	9100000	It's just the fucking drive up the hype because, oh, people must have it.
9100000	9104000	Put it out there so people can actually buy it.
9104000	9108000	The fact that units were available for the Wii U wasn't what killed the Wii U.
9108000	9111000	It was because there wasn't software to support it.
9111000	9114000	And again, I, I stressed this last week, I'm stressing it again.
9114000	9121000	You better be ready to do your pre-order on January 12th if you want this thing in the first six months next year.
9121000	9125000	Because I don't trust Nintendo's track record either, and I don't think anybody here does at this point.
9125000	9128000	Especially, especially which has me very suspect right now.
9128000	9133000	We're talking, like, pre-orders are going to start less than three months before that system comes out.
9133000	9135000	That is going to be a fucking mess.
9135000	9140000	Just coming from a distribution standpoint, that is going to be a huge fucking mess.
9140000	9141000	Because you know why?
9141000	9147000	Because Nintendo fucking demands that retail has their orders in 60 days in advance at least.
9147000	9151000	So what, you're saying you're going to just take those orders day one?
9151000	9153000	I mean, how many days are you going to open this pre-order for?
9153000	9158000	Nintendo already knows, because Nintendo already knows exactly how many each store is getting, and it's up to the stores to figure it out.
9158000	9162000	Exactly, because it's going to be a fucking mess all over again because they don't have their shit together.
9162000	9167000	Yep, alright. Bobby, anything else you want to comment on or talk about before we let you go?
9167000	9169000	No, no, that was it.
9169000	9172000	Alright, good discussion. Check out the Bobby Blackwell Show, of course.
9172000	9176000	Every Sunday night, well, most Sunday nights, right? Here at the Voice Against Network.
9176000	9179000	Not next week, but I will be here Christmas night, just like you guys.
9179000	9183000	Well, it's not like you don't have an archive of hundreds of shows to go check out.
9183000	9184000	Exactly.
9184000	9185000	There you go. Alright, thank you Bobby.
9185000	9186000	Thank you.
9186000	9187000	Take care.
9187000	9191000	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9191000	9194000	Or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9194000	9197000	ActDeftInChat says Nintendo Switch is going to be a bitch to get.
9197000	9198000	Yeah, I agree.
9198000	9200000	Yes, incredibly, and it's unfortunate.
9200000	9208000	I'm worried because I'm going to be in class that day, I'm almost positive, so I'm not going to be able to be there at noon or 10 AM or whenever this goes live.
9208000	9213000	Like, I'm going to have to enlist, like, I'm seriously going to be probably asking Alan to help with that.
9213000	9220000	I'm going to be asking Shane to help with that because that boy has stupid dumb luck with those types of things and will probably get one when nobody else does.
9220000	9226000	I'm going to be enlisting the help of as many people as possible to make sure that I get that stinking Nintendo Switch when it comes out.
9226000	9229000	Like, is there anybody at Nintendo that listens to this show?
9229000	9232000	Also the price point too, because if that price point's not right, then who cares?
9232000	9239000	Actually, if anybody from Nintendo did listen to this show, they probably stopped because of a certain individual.
9239000	9241000	But I'm so lovable.
9242000	9243000	He really is.
9243000	9253000	If you're still out there, because you want to hear the ugly truths and the ugly truthiness on both sides of whatever.
9253000	9258000	If you're still out there, I just want to know, how can I make sure I get one of these things?
9258000	9263000	I'm not even asking for a free one. Look, I'm not even going to ask for that.
9263000	9267000	How do I ensure that I get one?
9267000	9271000	Well, you see, you've got to play Super Mario Run. You've got to go pick that up.
9271000	9272000	Which I'll do.
9272000	9278000	You've got to get all the black coins in the different levels, and then you've got to make a blood sacrifice in Nintendo.
9278000	9285000	How old does the animal need to be? No, I'm kidding. I would never PETA don't call a show.
9285000	9288000	Alright, can I sacrifice food?
9288000	9291000	That's okay, Rob. PETA kills more animals than it saves.
9291000	9293000	It's true.
9293000	9295000	Here comes the slice hammer.
9295000	9297000	PETA isn't very good bread either, so.
9297000	9300000	No, PETA's amazing bread. What are you talking about?
9300000	9304000	PETA Kitchen is even better.
9304000	9307000	Alright, let's go to the phones. We've got another call coming in. Let's get to it.
9307000	9309000	Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?
9309000	9311000	Hi, this is Ray Treneter.
9311000	9312000	Hey, buddy. What's on your mind?
9313000	9323000	No, a whole lot. I was going to say that I recently discovered a game. I don't know if it's new per se.
9323000	9331000	It's new to me, but I was wondering if the three of you have heard of it. It's called Planescape Torment.
9331000	9332000	Yes.
9332000	9335000	Yeah, I've heard of it, but I've not played it.
9335000	9339000	I played D&D for a long time, and that game completely didn't interest me.
9339000	9340000	Why not, Darcyra?
9340000	9344000	Because I'd rather actually play a Planescape scenario instead of a game based on it.
9344000	9348000	Now that you mention it, Planescape's been around for a while, huh?
9348000	9354000	Planescape's been D&D at least since the mid to early 90s.
9354000	9358000	Okay, we played Planescape, my high school group. When I was a senior in high school, we played Planescape.
9358000	9359000	Yeah.
9359000	9360000	Now that this is all coming up, I'm like-
9360000	9363000	Because it was the one where the elves were super tall.
9363000	9364000	Yeah.
9364000	9372000	No, that was the other one. Planescape was the one that had the tieflings and the-
9372000	9373000	That was my first D&D.
9373000	9374000	Yeah.
9374000	9376000	Was this. Yes. Okay.
9376000	9377000	But I know the game. I just didn't play it.
9377000	9386000	So yeah, but I have to admit, D&D has a ton of games that are available on PC and stuff, and I really haven't played a lot of them.
9386000	9393000	Again, it's just a matter of there's so many games. I could play one game a day, and I still wouldn't be able to play them all.
9393000	9396000	But have you checked out the game?
9396000	9398000	Sorry, go ahead. I didn't mean to cut you off.
9398000	9400000	I was just saying, have you checked out the game, and what are your thoughts?
9400000	9411000	Yeah, actually, I discovered the game because, well, you know how I've been mentioning the GOG is having their winner.
9412000	9429000	And one thing they've been doing is on their Twitch channel, they've been having their people show off some of the games that are on Seattle, one of which was Planescape Torment.
9429000	9454000	And that game really caught my eye. It had like isometric dungeon crawling, almost like a cross between old school Diablo meets, I'm trying to think here.
9454000	9456000	Like Baldur's Gate, because they say it was on that engine.
9456000	9457000	Yeah, Baldur's Gate.
9457000	9472000	Yep. So here's the thing. I didn't realize just how old this game was, believe it or not, Raginator. And that makes sense. You discovered it through Good Old Games, which does a lot of the old games. Get this, it's older than the show. December 12, 1999 was when this game came out.
9472000	9482000	And now that I'm looking at the box art, I'm like, I do remember this, because this came out not long after we were playing this D&D thing. So I remember it did catch my eye at first.
9483000	9499000	Yeah, the game definitely looks interesting. In fact, it looked interesting to the point where I decided to fork over the money to get it, especially since it was on sale at the time.
9499000	9512000	The only downside is, it'll probably be a while before I can install it, because my hard drives are filled to the brim with games right now. So I have to invest in another hard drive so I can install it.
9512000	9520000	Well, this should be a way smaller game than probably some of the other stuff you're rocking on your hard drive. So you may have to sacrifice something to at least free up the space for this.
9520000	9538000	Yeah, in fact, I had to uninstall quite a few of my larger games, just to make room for the smaller ones already. Like I had to uninstall Final Fantasy XIII-2, for example.
9538000	9546000	Okay, well that's a whopper of an install. That's like a 60GB install. You should be able to install the entire library of Good Old Games with that type of space.
9547000	9563000	Yeah, in fact, right now I'm trying to save up my nickels and dimes so I can get another hard drive. But I just wanted to point that game out to you, just in case the three of you haven't heard of it.
9563000	9583000	It definitely looks interesting, at least to me anyway. Plus, as long as I'm on the subject of GOG, it's a little bit too late to do it right now for the recent Bachelor games that they had.
9583000	9591000	But they got a feature on there called GOG Connect. The three of you familiar with that?
9591000	9598000	I feel like yes, but I keep thinking of GOG Galaxy, the client. What's GOG Connect?
9598000	9606000	Basically, the short version is, it's so many that you have a Steam account.
9606000	9610000	Oh, right, right. Yes, you can get the Steam stuff on GOG. Yes, I do know that.
9611000	9636000	Sometimes it's not worth it, in my opinion. Sometimes it is. It's weird. A lot of times Steam has better deals in terms of prices, but they don't have all the nice little extras like the soundtrack or behind the scenes stuff or whatever.
9636000	9654000	Whereas the GOG version does. On the rare occasion, you happen to have, let's say, Dragon Age Origin on Steam.
9654000	9673000	All of a sudden, you connect your two accounts together, you might get Dragon Age Origin for free on GOG, and they'll give you the soundtrack and avatars and stuff like that.
9673000	9682000	Yes, but the companies have to agree to it, right? So it's a very limited selection of games. It's not going to be like your entire Steam library or anything crazy.
9682000	9698000	Exactly, and even then, you have to check it on a fairly regular basis, because there's a limited window for you to grab the free games.
9698000	9721000	On average, maybe four or five days, a window period where you can grab the games for free. Occasionally, they do repeat certain titles every so often, but you never know when those titles are going to show up and if it's going to show up again.
9721000	9723000	It's to encourage you to check often, for sure.
9723000	9724000	Exactly.
9724000	9727000	Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.
9727000	9728000	Sure, have a nice night.
9728000	9730000	You too, take care, bye.
9730000	9738000	Let's see, I'm going to try and sneak one more call in if anybody's trying to get an orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. Last minute stories, anyone?
9738000	9752000	Yeah, as I mentioned, Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered is getting some updates for their multiplayer maps, which is nice. They're getting some new free maps to go along with that.
9753000	9769000	Some, actually, they were pretty awesome. They're going to be redoing, what was it? They've got Crash, the holiday version of Crash, which is pretty awesome, Wetworks, I'm trying to write the rest of the names, it's been so long since I played.
9769000	9779000	But it was basically a lot of the maps, because the multiplayer maps that came with HD Remastered were all of them, and now these are like the rest of them. And it's free, so that's awesome.
9779000	9780000	Free is always good.
9780000	9782000	And all the more reason to purchase it.
9782000	9792000	Alright. Well, since the phone lines aren't lighting up, I assume that is it for calls tonight, thanks to those that called in. If you change your mind, you do want to interact with the show later on, you can always send us an email.
9792000	9804000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. We will be back in seven days to do it all over again on December 18th, and I can't believe we are actually two weeks away from Christmas as of today.
9804000	9806000	Uh-uh, the start of Hanukkah.
9806000	9816000	Whatever it is you celebrate, just the fact that that's so close to the end of the year is more what I'm talking about. It's like, wow, we're already there at the end of dumpster fire of the year.
9816000	9819000	Just remember latkes on Christmas.
9819000	9824000	Yay, or Asian food if we can find anything open.
9824000	9830000	You know what? We could do latkes on the weekend after, because it's still during Hanukkah.
9830000	9831000	Okay, that works.
9831000	9832000	And then we can do...
9832000	9834000	I'll take food anytime.
9834000	9835000	Asian food of choice.
9835000	9836000	Awesome.
9836000	9837000	Or whatever's open.
9837000	9838000	Asian food of availability.
9838000	9839000	Of availability.
9839000	9840000	Yeah.
9840000	9842000	Alright, um, yes, because this isn't New York City.
9842000	9843000	Because it's Gay Jumis.
9843000	9849000	This is not New York City. This is Sacramento, California, and a lot of stuff's still closed, so.
9849000	9854000	Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back in seven days.
9854000	9860000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or seven about the show.
9860000	9865000	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if your voices aren't here, we can't air them.
9865000	9870000	You can also leave us a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, Google Play.
9870000	9874000	Wherever it is that you found this show, that goes a very long way, let me tell you.
9874000	9877000	I really appreciate folks that take 30 seconds out of their day to do that.
9877000	9883000	Anyhow, Dark Sakura, welcome back. Great to have you here. We'll see you in seven days.
9883000	9886000	And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9887000	9893000	Uh... I missed you guys. But my aim is improving.
9893000	9895000	I knew there was a punchline coming to that.
9895000	9897000	Whoa.
9897000	9908000	My final thought tonight is I'm ready to finish up chapter 13 of Final Fantasy XV and see just if it's as bad as some of my Twitter friends made it out to be.
9908000	9913000	I'm really, I'm like, I'm excited to see how bad is this going to get at the end of the game.
9913000	9919000	And to come back next week on the show and let you know, hopefully, my final thoughts on Final Fantasy XV.
9919000	9922000	Loki, your final thought, last but not least.
9922000	9925000	I have to shop for tablets for my kids now.
9925000	9927000	Really? Is that what they want for Christmas?
9927000	9931000	That's what my wife wants to get them.
9931000	9937000	And I have to fix her laptop because her hard drive corrupted, so it doesn't work anymore.
9937000	9941000	Alright. Well, we'll be back in seven more days to do this all again.
9941000	9946000	In the meantime, happy gaming, happy holidays, season, for whatever it is you're celebrating.
9946000	9950000	And we'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Bye.
