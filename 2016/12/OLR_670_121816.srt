00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This week, Capcom says quitters never win and winners never quit by turning to player identification to shame rage quitters into changing their habits. Fighters beware of the scarlet letter Q.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And that's just one story we have on the last pre-holiday episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight. Episode 670 for this, December the 18th of 2016.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and she is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sup?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How you doing?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Uh, I'm okay.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, it's alright.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's okay.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now wait a minute. You've been in a pretty good mood all night. We've been eating and talking and gossiping.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm out of food.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm out of coffee.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, you're out of food. Do you want more coffee?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We can do more coffee. I've got plenty of K-Cups for the machine.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I couldn't make words happen, that's all.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Also say hello over there to Techmaster Loki.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Fine.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good. And so, we had a little scare before the show. Your burger may have had the wrong toppings, but it's all is well? We're okay now?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, I was just thinking their cheese was oddly colored.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, it's-

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cheese, quotey fingers.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, it's Burger King. I don't know.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Normally it's pretty good.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's okay. It's alright. Anyway.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hi, guys. You guys are in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And you guys can participate live with our show, where Fifth Dream in chat says,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's been a while since she was here live.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Actually, Dark Soccer's return was last week, Fifth Dream. Where were you? You might have just not been here.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But Dark Soccer will be here for the foreseeable future.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Future, future.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Including next week, if you guys didn't know, we will be doing a live Orange Lawns Radio-

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
On the first day of Hanukkah.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Holiday Spectacular.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And Daddy's gonna drink.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, just like-

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mama might be drinking too.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, yes. Look forward to that. Please look forward to it.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Unfortunately, Uncle Loki will not be able to make it. But, I mean, it is kind of a major holiday.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So, but, you guys hopefully will be here too. If you guys are bored on the night of the 25th, you can come join us.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bobby Black Wolf will be here too with his show.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Or, you can always use the podcast feed.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We're on iTunes. What? Google Play Store.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Pretty much all the big places you can find podcasts except for one.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can find us almost anywhere else.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, TuneIn is the one that I certainly recommend.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So, all the great places you can find podcasts.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They're available and you can find our Christmas episode if you can't be here live.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
ActDeftInChat says, I'll be here.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, good. I'm glad. I'm glad at least one person can be here next week.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Before we get into the kickoff topic tonight, I need to address something right at the top of the show.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay? And I'm gonna admit, this has absolutely nothing to do with video games.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But, in the past like four hours, I've been called a witch.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've been called a prophet. I've been called the Oracle.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to play a clip from our last show. This was seven days ago, okay?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is a minute long clip from the last episode, 669.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A little bit of throwback music, please.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just want people to get the fuck over it.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And, Betty White to stay alive.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No celebrity deaths in 2017. None. Well, maybe a couple. Maybe a couple.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't know. Who do you think will die first?

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Betty White or Kirk Douglas?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, well, let's...

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He's a hundred now.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I know. And I hate to say this. I hate to say this, but can I say Zsa Zsa Gabor?

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, Zsa Zsa.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She's one of those people where you go, how?

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Right?

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How?

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Preservatives.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm fine with her being one of the three and, you know, the potential.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If there's certain sacrificial lambs we have to offer 2017, then it's like, okay.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If she has to die so Betty White can live, then I'm by all means.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Kirk Douglas. I mean, this is horrible. We're horrible people. We should, no, just, you know, but...

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Betty White seems to be in the best health of them all.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, because she's probably still having sex.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Who wouldn't want to sleep with Betty White? I'm serious.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The blood sacrifice has been made.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So, I want to apologize to the Gabor family. I didn't mean it like that.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But yes, in case you hadn't heard...

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I did.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Zsa Zsa Gabor died today. And look, look, look, I don't mean to make light of this. It sucks when people die and so forth.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
However, the whole reason why I went there in the first place on the show was the fact that the poor lady has had how many surgeries in the past five years.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Does she have any limbs left? I don't even know. And, you know, it's one of those things where her husband's been keeping her alive for I don't know how long.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So, that's why I was kind of joking earlier in the year. How are all these celebrities dying but Zsa Zsa Gabor is still alive?

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, thank you God for, you know, that little joke. But there you go.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Ironically, they're going to turn her into Robocop.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Stop it right now.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, one of my friends, though, being the person he is, posted the clip from one of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies where she was on an interview show and it turns out she's being interviewed by Freddy Krueger and he slashes her across the face.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, that's back when the 80s movies were, like, super cheese tat. That's when we had, like, Sleepaway Camp and all those amazing 80s movies.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Toxic Avenger.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Stoppy says, what was she even famous for outside for being married, like, six times?

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Green Acres?

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wasn't that her sister?

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't think that was Ava. I think that was Zsa Zsa.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm pretty sure it was. Well, then, she also slapped the siren on the, because she slapped a cop. So, she was in those Naked Gun movies, right?

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
She was the original Kardashian. That's what it is. That's what it boils down to is, like, why is Kim Kardashian famous? Anybody? Anybody? Yeah, exactly.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So, like, Zsa Zsa Gabor was kind of like the original Kardashian.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is it because her parents own a line of hotels? Oh, wait.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, you're thinking of the wrong, wrong, spoiled kid.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That was the previous line of people that were famous for no reason.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Alan Alchemy points out she was in 60s Batman. Oh, that's right. That is right.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's see. So, anyway, so, I'm getting yelled at by chatters, but you know what? I said what I said.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But, again, you know, apologies to the Gabor family.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It was Ava.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I thought it was Ava and the Greenagers. Apologies to the Gabor family. However, Betty White should now be okay for this year.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So, let's just all breathe a sigh of relief.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't jinx it, Rob. I can't utter celebrity names. Apparently, I have the death whisper. What?

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
She's the Highlander.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There can be only one.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's hope. All right. We need to move on. Thank you, Tiger Claw, a very important movie credit. I should do this.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The 1952 version of Moulin Rouge. So, the one you probably didn't see because it's from 1952, but if you haven't, you should.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This was the pre-Nicole Kidman, you know, that one.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Baz Luhrmann.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, that whole thing. So, anyway, let's move on. We got to get into video game stuff.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I love that the chatters want to keep talking about Jacques Gabor's career. However, we do.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For what is traditionally like the part of the year where the video game news just like dries up significantly and we're left to stretch for time.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I feel like there's still a lot going on this week. So, we're going to start with this.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Some big news that came out earlier this week about the partnership between Nintendo and Universal.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, we talked about this on prior episodes that the two were teaming up, but now we have some more information about what exactly is planned.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Super Nintendo World is coming to Universal Studios Japan. It is going to be coming in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's what they're timing it for. So, Japan, I guess, foresees that 2020 will be a huge tourist year, probably thanks in large part to the Olympics.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, they're trying to get Super Nintendo World open before then. However, Nintendo themed areas are also going to come to Orlando and Hollywood.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know where they're going to put them because they had to bulldoze the Gibson Amphitheater to put the Harry Potter thing in Hollywood.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I would assume they're going to cut something on the tour. Something on the tour is going to go.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are they going to take out the mall?

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, they would never take out the mall. The mall makes too much money, I'm sure. Something on the tour will probably give that's on the Universal tour and that'll probably be it.

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The last time I was there, they still had the whole set for Desperate Housewives back there. I mean, there's stuff that can go.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, that's used for a bunch of stuff.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, I know. That's true. But they'll think of something.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They can make more money from that stuff than they do the backlot stuff anyway.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, we'll see. Because they can always move that set somewhere else, like an actual studio. But we'll see. Who knows?

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Orlando, I'm sure, has plenty of space. So that probably won't be an issue there.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Anyway, what is Super Nintendo World going to be? Expansive, multi-level environments, unprecedented state-of-the-art rides, interactive areas, shops, and restaurants.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All featuring Nintendo's popular characters and games. Does this mean they will continue to ignore Samus?

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's my question, like they did Metroid's 30th anniversary.

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I demand something Samus in this park area, theme area. Needs to happen, right, Logie?

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We need something Samus. Look, we know there's going to be Link, Zelda, Mario, Luigi, and that.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And probably like the characters from Animal Crossing, whatever else is mobile at the time.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Which is weird because there was not an Animal Crossing game on the Super Nintendo.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I know, I know. But I don't think this is supposed to literally be Super Nintendo. It's just that's what they're calling the world.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I would go to Super Nintendo Land.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Keep in mind, in Japan it would have been Super Famicom World. So, it's a little different.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking, is there a booth where I can romance Waluigi? One can hope.

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Why?

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why not? Let's see, anyway, they're saying economic benefits following the opening. 6.2 trillion yen for the Kansai region.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
11.7 trillion yen for Japan as a whole. Creating 1.1 million jobs in Japan within a decade after opening.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's what they're forecasting anyway. So yeah, we don't have any specifics on what the rides will be.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But there is like a mock-up art that you can take a look at. It looks really cute. I want to go, that's for sure.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, you better get those pre-orders in because they're probably not going to sell enough tickets for all the people that want to go.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Fuck off. The accuracy of that read is way too good. Thank you.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, I mean, it's funny enough, although you can make the parallels about Nintendo's supply and demand issues,

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that actually probably will be the case because Japan is going to be getting all these people visiting it for the Olympics and other stuff that's going on in 2020.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, it's going to be a big year for Japan. So, in a way, you kid, but there's some truth to that.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I wonder how long it will be, though, before it opens up in Hollywood and Orlando.

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Because what the Harry Potter thing was about a one or two year difference between Orlando and Hollywood, right?

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was about a two year difference, I think. So, I haven't even been to the one in Hollywood yet. I really want to go.

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I haven't either.

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I really want to go. I just haven't. I've been to Universal there. Xtifer and I, my pal from Guys Will Show, Xtifer and I went to Universal Studios and we had a great time.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We rode the Mummy ride, which I really hope doesn't go away, seeing as I hear that they're doing a Mummy reboot, which that franchise is not even.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's terrible.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Tom Cruise? What?

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm fine. Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise can really be in anything because I love watching Tom Cruise's movies run away from things.

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I mean, honestly, I love Tom Cruise as an actor. I don't care about his personal stuff.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He was really good at Magnolia.

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
He's fantastic. Put him in any action movie, it's fine. I mean, they're all great.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Things I did not expect Loki to say on there.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I just don't think that that movie franchise needs to be rebooted because they drove it into the ground.

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you know why they're doing it? Universal wants its own Avengers. That's what it boils down to.

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Universal is rebooting all these classic horror franchises because they want to do their own version of the Avengers with classic movie characters.

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is completely serious. I read about it on Wikipedia. It is true.

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I fully expect then after they reboot everything to culminate in the reboot of the monster squad because that's really where it's all going to is the monster squad at the end.

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So anyway, X4 and I rode the Mummy ride and we had no idea what the ride was.

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We just knew it was like a roller coaster and it used to be the E.T. ride years ago.

187
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So we're like, whatever, let's do the Mummy ride.

188
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So we went on it and it's like, it starts off and it's very casual, like going through these different rooms.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's like, oh, spooky. It's like a black light ride to Disneyland.

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then all of a sudden, like 70 miles an hour, like all through this thing.

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And then it like stops at some point and they make it seem like bugs are attacking your feet.

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then the whole thing goes backward and X4 and I were screaming our heads off.

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I really wish we had video of it because we would be a viral sensation on YouTube with how big we were screaming on that ride because we had no idea what it was going to be or what to expect.

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So like, you know, getting thrown backwards at 70 miles an hour, not exactly a sensation you are, you know, expecting.

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So yes, that was our adventure at Universal Studios.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So I'm hoping, my point with this is, I'm hoping even though Nintendo is seen by a lot of people as a kid thing, I do hope there's a really good thrill ride in it.

197
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I really hope Universal does a good thrill ride out of this.

198
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So, that being said, chatters, hosts, what Nintendo property do you want to see them make a thrill ride out of?

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Dark Sakura.

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Super Metroid.

201
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Super Metroid. So you say Samus-

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It could totally happen.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, it could. It could be so, it could be, they could do it with like the escape sequence at the end of the game or something.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like Samus has to escape from Zeb's or something. That would be really cool.

205
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Loki?

206
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Uh oh.

207
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If you want a thrill ride, there's only one property that could possibly-

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're gonna take my answer, I know it.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's gonna be Pokemon Snap.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh my god though, they really could-

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But it could be a ride.

213
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It could be like a Toy Story at Disneyland type thing.

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They could do, like, but instead of shooting the Pokemon, you're throwing berries at it or something.

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But they could totally do like a Pokemon Snap type thing. Oh my god, I would actually love that.

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
However, the tricky thing with Pokemon, Pokemon Company is a separate company from Nintendo.

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So I'm not sure you can bank on- I mean, it's a technicality, but still, I'm not sure you can bank on Pokemon showing up at this thing.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I would think it would be ridiculous for them to not partner up to sell oodles and oodles of stuffed Pokemon exclusive to the parks and this shit, but it's not a given.

219
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay, my answer for that, I thought you were gonna say this when you said there's only one thrill ride that could possibly do.

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
F-Zero. Thank you.

221
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That could do it.

222
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Thank you. F-Zero. I wanna see an F-Zero ride. So bad, but I just, I know it's not gonna happen.

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's gotta have, though, I would imagine something like that being in a series of projection tubes, where you've got the scenery projected through 60 around you.

224
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like, they used to do the people mover in the 70s at Disneyland, for serious.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But until someone fell off of it in a drunken super.

226
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, but that was their fault, they were drunk.

227
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah. Well, they had that Tron section.

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, yeah, that's what-

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Imagine a whole thing like that, you know, and it would look more seamless in, like, a tube.

230
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm here for this, yes. But I just, I know it's not gonna happen, and you know why?

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Because how frickin' obvious would it be to have bumper cars and be Super Mario Kart, and they'll have big inflatable shells you can throw at other people or something ridiculous.

232
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm telling you, it's happening.

233
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I think I-

234
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's like, if anything is a given at this, a Super Mario Kart bumper car has to be.

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I think I just hurt my entire series of ocular muscles with how hard I just rolled my eyes.

236
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Alright, let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, Legend of Zelda.

237
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
JD says, Pokemon Snap already feels like it's a small world.

238
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's see, oh, VidPower in chat suggests, Kirby Air Ride for people moving.

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So, there you go, some suggestions for thrill rides at the park.

240
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So, what do you guys think? Let's see, how many years of OLR will we be doing at this point?

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That would be our 18th year. We'll be 18 and legal, so I think we should celebrate in Japan. What do you say? Let's go.

242
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Who wants to pay for it?

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't know. We'll do a GoFundMe. No, I would never ask the listeners to pay for something so silly.

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Actually?

245
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I would not want the listeners to pay for something so silly. We'll save up the money and do it.

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If we sell shirts and put the money from the shirt sales into a Japan fund, I'm okay with that.

247
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I was just thinking if we did a GoFundMe and had enough, we'd say like, and if we reach a certain amount, one lucky listener gets to come with us.

248
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then you get into weird lottery laws, legal, you know, but I'm fine. Maybe if we want to, okay, Jamie, you've been talking about doing a book for how long, like an OLR keepsake.

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I plan on doing the book.

250
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, we'll sell the book and then that's okay.

251
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But people haven't fucking sent me pictures.

252
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's different. Like if with the product and you're selling it and we put the money away, that's different.

253
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I want OLR listeners to send me pictures of hanging out with other listeners if you have them.

254
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And even maybe a little, a little blurb about yourself, you know, so we can have like the yearbook in the back.

255
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Maybe we'll look into one of those things where like we get an app or something and we do like bonus episodes, but only if you pay the money to do the app.

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Patreon, here we come.

257
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't know. I don't know. I'm more of the type of, I'm just old school like that.

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Like I've got to give some type of tangible product that you're paying money for and that's, that's it.

259
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know, and then we put the profits away, right?

260
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Put them away into donuts. Yum.

261
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And okay, if we don't, you know what, if we don't raise enough money to go to Japan, Malasada is on every episode.

262
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There you go.

263
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Wait, what are those?

264
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You haven't had a Malasada?

265
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What are those?

266
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Number one, play Pokemon Sun and Moon. Number two, there are the like Portuguese donuts, but they're really big in Hawaii.

267
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And they're, they're hard to find here.

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The only place I know of that sells them is L&L's Hawaiian barbecue.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And they're not, I mean, it's, it's kind of basic.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's just,

271
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Forget that. Let's just go to,

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Let's just go to Hawaii.

273
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh, you can go to Hawaii. Let's go to Vancouver.

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
All right, the OLR.

275
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's go to somewhere that isn't America.

276
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The OLR travel fund.

277
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Kuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com suggests OLR listener porn collection.

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Hey, look, if you,

279
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
if you guys are willing to help us raise money at our bake sale by baking something else, then,

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If someone says me $500, I'll moon loudly into the, into the mic.

281
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You want to go up on fiverr.com or whatever that site is? Or do you pay?

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No, I just want someone to send me money.

283
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Really?

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
All right.

285
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Anyway, we'll think about what we can do over the next two years.

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'd do it for a copy of Radiant Silver Gun for Saturn.

287
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
All right, we definitely need to get into our gaming weeks so we can get into the news as well.

288
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Because this is, this has gone way off the rails with this Universal Studios thing.

289
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The show's gone off the rails.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah, I know. It's, it's, it's not the last show of the year, but it kind of feels like it.

291
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Because seriously, I don't know what news there's going to be next week.

292
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So if you think this show is random, just come back next week for the holiday spectacular.

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because I don't know what's going to happen.

294
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The holiday drunk-tacular.

295
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
All right. Anyway, but we do have some gaming news to get into. We'll get there in a minute.

296
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But we do have to talk about our gaming weeks.

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know about you guys, but I've actually played a lot this week.

298
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, Dark Sakura, starting with you. How was your gaming week?

299
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're going to laugh.

300
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Because I got Arkanoid for iOS.

301
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And I've been playing a lot of bink, bink, bink, bink, bink.

302
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, but as far as breakout clones go, like that's the one to play.

303
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I've been going on like this Taito kick, so I also have like Darius Burst.

304
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And I haven't actually played it on my phone yet, but I found out that I can airplay it on my Apple TV.

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So that's fun. I also got Pac-Man Championship DX for Apple TV.

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And with my SteelSeries controller, it's pretty cool.

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So I've actually found that controller to be super responsive with my Apple TV.

308
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So it's sort of like become another gaming console.

309
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So I also have been playing World of Warcraft.

310
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Because now that we've got new content from the last patch, I mean, it's gated, which is really annoying.

311
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But I've enjoyed the whole Suramar storyline a whole lot.

312
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And I've got one more achievement left, and then I think I get flying.

313
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So you have no idea how much gold I've saved up just thinking I was going to pay for my account that way.

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm like at $275,000.

315
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I may, I don't want to tease you too much, I may re-up for another month in WoW.

316
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Just because as far as 14 goes, I've kind of hit a wall in 14.

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've done everything there is to do.

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I'm still doing Deep Dungeon, which is kind of like I got into that when I should have done it last patch.

319
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But a lot of my guildies aren't on a lot, and there's not a lot of content that we really do as a group.

320
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I kind of miss that whole getting together to do stuff.

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So like if you're actually on and playing, and our pals from Game Buoy are still, do they still play?

322
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I've been trying to get Slidekick to come back sometimes.

323
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Maybe if I offer Slidekick Malasadas, he'll come back and play. So we'll do something.

324
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But Grandpa's been on a few times.

325
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, that's good. I never see his ass anymore. That'd be great to play with him.

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So I think I may re-up just for a month to hold me over, because I'm really excited.

327
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
14 is finally getting that cross-server shit in 3.5, and that's going to help a lot.

328
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But anyway, I don't need to take away from the week.

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But you should come do classic runs with me in VRT.

330
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah, sure, I'd be down for that.

331
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Because that's pretty fun.

332
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Which was what I've been doing when I couldn't sleep, is I was doing 25-man Black Temple by myself.

333
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
There's a lot of achievements in old mounts and things.

334
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
For people especially that are just getting into WoW, there's a lot of back content to just Zen out and go through.

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So I've been going back and getting mounts that I was missing.

336
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There's a snow globe in Dalaran that turns you into a gnome.

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And Final Fantasy XIV, as much as I love it, it doesn't have that same backlog of content yet.

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So maybe when Stormblood comes out and I'm level 70, maybe I can do Bahamut's Coil by myself and things like that.

339
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It'll be a little more like that, but you can't really do that in XIV right now.

340
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I've just been having a good time looking at all the content that I missed.

341
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And it's sort of neat, though. The only things that I can't go back and do is old Karazhan.

342
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Because that's now a new raid.

343
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, they closed off old Karazhan completely?

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I think they closed off the old Karazhan. I have to double check.

345
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's shitty if they did. Sorry.

346
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But I'll have to go back and double check, but I know that they were completely revamping Karazhan and now there's a new raid out.

347
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
One of our people in chat has got to be a WoW player, right?

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah. But I'm still playing Pokemon Go. I just hit 21. Yeah, 21. I got my Santa Pikachu.

349
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And I have been... I actually didn't play any more Animal Crossing, I hate to say.

350
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Because I was going to go back and get my island tan.

351
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I was playing something else and I can't remember what I was playing.

352
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Sonic CD with a Japanese soundtrack. Because it's better.

353
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I think that's it.

354
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Alright, we'll move on to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

355
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I didn't play anything. I mean, honestly, I played just cell phone games.

356
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Ingress and Pokemon Go. I tried a little bit of Pokemon Go.

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Mainly what I've been trying to do is on my drive home from picking up the kids, there's a long section where there's not any Ingress play there.

358
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So I just flip it over to Pokemon Go during that time.

359
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And then my kids want me to drive them around the neighborhood to look at lights.

360
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So I usually play Pokemon Go while that's going on.

361
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
With my neighborhood, apparently there's such frequent spawns that it makes it really easy to just keep catching Pokemon.

362
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But with that, it seems like they've tweaked what you get from those Poke Stops.

363
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Because I'm hardly getting any gear from that stuff anymore, which is annoying.

364
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Well, when a lot of people went back in November or October, I think it was the event right after the Halloween thing, they did double output on Poke Stops.

365
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So people kind of got used to that as the norm. And that's actually not the norm.

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I found something that you hit the same one and it's like every certain number of hits are double.

367
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I used to get at least five, four items per spin, and now it's like three.

368
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And two of those, or maybe one of those will be a Poke Ball.

369
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's just ridiculous. They're really trying to get you to buy Poke Balls and I'm like, no.

370
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Alan and I have taken to driving through downtown slowly.

371
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Obviously I don't want to use my phone and drive, but I can use the little Pogo app.

372
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Plus, that's what it's called, Pogo Plus. You can set that to Poke Stops only.

373
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So I'll just kind of have that as I drive slowly through downtown and just hit every Poke Stop.

374
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You're cruising for stops.

375
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, we're cruising. That's the funny thing about Ingress and Pokemon Go is that they kind of brought cruising back.

376
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's nerd cruising.

377
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But I did get a Ditto, so I've got that now.

378
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't know. It's alright. I do like that there's different things spawning.

379
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It seems like they're spawning all over the place, but it's just not anything new for me.

380
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But I mean, it's alright I guess.

381
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And then it did a little bit of Ingress as well.

382
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't know. That's pretty much it.

383
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I haven't really been playing any console games. I've been trying to work on programming stuff and doing all that.

384
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I've kind of taken a break from coding because I needed to build for what I was working on.

385
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because it was an Excite truck type game.

386
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So I need to build a test track-ish area that I can actually...

387
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I need something with enough room where I can build in the rest of the stuff for driving.

388
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Because you can't really do it without a track.

389
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So that's what I'm working on right now.

390
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Alright. My gaming week. My turn.

391
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Okay, so unpopular opinion time.

392
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I know Loki really gets all the hate mail on this show, but it's going to be me this week.

393
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because I think I have an unpopular opinion on something that a lot of people are playing this week.

394
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So here we go.

395
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I downloaded Super Mario Run, and I think it sucks.

396
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't...

397
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Woohoo!

398
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Why are you cheering?

399
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because it's just a runner game and everyone is super hyped.

400
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

401
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That's how I can tell you haven't played.

402
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Dan likes it.

403
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Anybody who's calling Super Mario Run an endless runner, it's not endless.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yes, it's not an endless runner. Okay, I'm sorry.

405
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's not an endless runner. It's a Mario game that they've simplified the controls down to nothing.

406
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's just not fun.

407
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm sorry. I don't know what it is.

408
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, actually, I think I do know what it is.

409
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The way they did the pay thing is weird.

410
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And I am not being one of those people that doesn't think you should pay $10 for a game.

411
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I get that. I understand that.

412
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But it is a little weird how once you pay the $10, then it says,

413
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
oh, but you get these 20 Toad Rally tickets.

414
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You get these 3,000 coins.

415
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You get this special item.

416
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
To me, it felt like they were giving you all these things that you would expect to see in a free-to-play game,

417
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
like the Toad tickets, which I understand you don't buy them for money.

418
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You earn them through the little bonus houses and all this stuff.

419
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But that whole thing is a really weird mechanic.

420
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And I do not like those Toad rallies.

421
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't like it. I mean, sorry.

422
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But I just, and yes, I did drop the $10 on the whole thing,

423
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
so I've seen more than just one map on the Toad rally.

424
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I just don't, like, it's weird because you're not actually competing against somebody live,

425
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and you're kind of unsure what it is you can do to do better than the other person.

426
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's very, very vague in a lot of the descriptions.

427
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And it's just, it's kind of same-sy boring to me.

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Even if you were to say, well, Rob, you want to do this.

429
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'll be, I'm sorry, it's still very same-sy boring to me

430
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and not as exciting as it would be to maybe actually compete against somebody live in the same room

431
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
or something might be a little more fun.

432
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But at the end of the day, I just don't like the whole non-stop running thing.

433
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I just don't like that direction for the Mario franchise.

434
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And I understand they can't do a traditional control thing, you know,

435
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
because that would suck on the phone as well.

436
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So I understand they came up with this creative solution,

437
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but I don't like it, and that's my opinion. Sorry.

438
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You tried there.

439
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I tried. I paid the money. I tried. I don't like it.

440
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So that's it for Super Mario Run.

441
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And that's unfortunately, that's just the limitation of that platform.

442
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That just doesn't, it doesn't work. I'm sorry.

443
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Like, platform games don't work on that platform.

444
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm really curious to see now something like Animal Crossing.

445
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And dare I, okay, now I'm really going to get the hate mail.

446
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Y'all ready? Get your email clients open.

447
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Participate at orangehontrader.com.

448
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I had more fun with Miitomo because I felt Miitomo was an experience

449
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
that's better built for the phone than probably Super Mario Run is

450
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
at the end of the day.

451
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I think Super Mario Run is the game the investors forced Nintendo to make.

452
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Okay, they made it.

453
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Now don't ever listen to the investors again

454
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
because they don't know what the fuck to do to make a game.

455
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's very obvious.

456
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But that's me. That's my perspective.

457
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay, now I'm going to look at chat.

458
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

459
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Sky, you're not alone.

460
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I've heard from others that felt the same way,

461
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
especially over the pricing.

462
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Let's see.

463
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Stoppy says, why has Sonic not had an endless runner?

464
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That would seem to work really well with that franchise.

465
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Let's see, also in chat.

466
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, no way, dude.

467
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Mario is the next Pokemon Go, Kappa.

468
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Alan Alchemy says, does Shane love it?

469
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Because if you feel this strongly about it,

470
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
it really increases the odds he'll feel the opposite.

471
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't know. Maybe Shane will text me.

472
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Which, by the way, Shane texted about Karazhan, Dark Sakura.

473
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Shane said, old Karazhan is accessible.

474
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
New Karazhan is not a raid. It's a mythic something.

475
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Gotcha.

476
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Whatever that whole thing is.

477
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
By the way, there was another game I forgot to say I've been playing.

478
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh, yes?

479
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
In my Taito kick, I have Raystorm.

480
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay.

481
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
As in, you know, Rayforce, Raycrisis, Raystorm.

482
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Because a lot of those classics are on iOS now.

483
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's actually really fun to play just in iPhone mode.

484
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So it's one of my favorite shooters.

485
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But you haven't been playing Super Mario Run?

486
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
No, I haven't. I've been watching Dan play it.

487
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And when I saw him play it, I was like, I'm not interested.

488
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay. So, okay.

489
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
See, I was worried it was just going to be a me thing.

490
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, I haven't played it, so I can't make a judgment on it.

491
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay.

492
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I mean, especially when I found out that the actual purchase of the game

493
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
is an in-game purchase, which is how they're going past family sharing.

494
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That's kind of janky.

495
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

496
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yep. You download the game for free.

497
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But to unlock it, you pay $10.

498
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And so, and since family sharing does not encompass in-app purchases,

499
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
then that's how they're bypassing family sharing.

500
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay, Allen, you ready for a twist?

501
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Y'all wanted a twist, eh?

502
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Shane just texted me, I do not care for Mario Run.

503
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's just not my type of game.

504
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I've not liked Mario games in forever, though.

505
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
See, that's where I disagree with him.

506
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Because I think, like, Mario 3D World on Wii U is fantastic.

507
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I think there have been a lot of great Mario games lately.

508
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Just not this one.

509
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And that's just an opinion.

510
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But you know what?

511
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm not going to poo-poo on those that are playing it and having fun.

512
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
No, not at all.

513
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Props to you. Have a great time.

514
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

515
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And there's lots of games out there that people like that I don't get.

516
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Like, half the games that they advertise on TV.

517
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like Mass Effect?

518
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yes, Mass Effect being one of them.

519
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But, like, my thing was that, like, when they're hyping this shit up.

520
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
When they're putting it on fucking talk shows and shit.

521
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Hyping it up like it's going to be the next Pokemon GO.

522
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It was never going to be the next Pokemon GO.

523
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
See, here's the thing, though.

524
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Well, first off, Nintendo wins in both situations.

525
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So don't pit the games against each other.

526
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But second off, like, I actually kind of like the whole video games on mainstream TV thing.

527
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Like, it brings a lot more legitimacy to our hobby.

528
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Not that we need it.

529
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You know what I mean? But it's still, come on.

530
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Even if you're very, like, anti-mainstream and all that stuff.

531
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's still something a little bit rewarding about seeing that on TV.

532
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I think especially, like, if you kind of grew up where video game was always, like, a counterculture nerd thing.

533
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's fine.

534
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But that little bit that they did on TV, though.

535
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Jimmy Fallon?

536
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah, when Jimmy Fallon was not doing that game any favors.

537
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I got it. I was excited to play it.

538
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I just, I realized it was one of those things that just sounded better than it played.

539
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But anyway, all right, I'm going to stop taking a dump on Super Mario Run and let all of you that are enjoying it enjoy it.

540
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Have fun.

541
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Let's talk about good news.

542
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I want to talk about a game I'm really enjoying and I think is really, really good.

543
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And it took me way too long to get around to this game.

544
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I think this is one of the best games that's come out all year.

545
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
KC Munchkin.

546
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This is not 1982, girl.

547
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
All right.

548
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But here's the thing.

549
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If you like racing at all in the slightest, you need to play Forza Horizon 3.

550
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It is fantastic.

551
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It is a step up from Forza Horizon 2 even.

552
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I remember some of my complaints about Forza Horizon 2 is that it was, like, really trying to, like, shove the DLC down your throat.

553
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I think they kind of took a step back with 3 because I know they just released the Blizzard Mountain.

554
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's nice.

555
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And I just think the way they put the game together where now you kind of, you move the horizon spot.

556
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You move the festival to, like, these different locations.

557
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And I think the scenery is fantastic.

558
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like, does Australia really look like that?

559
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Because it's gorgeous.

560
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Where's our Australian list or is that?

561
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It says the part that has animals that will kill you in your sleep.

562
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Well, but you're in a car because you can take them on.

563
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But, like, there's just really fucking fun stuff in Forza Horizon 3.

564
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like, one of the first things it has you do is you're going to go off this fucking jump and see how much feet you can get in midair.

565
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Like, it just seems like a Loki thing.

566
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Like, this just seems like something you would really get a kick out of.

567
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm really surprised you're not into Forza.

568
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But then again, you're not an Xbox One.

569
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't have an Xbox One.

570
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So, I see. But at some point, and whenever those come down in price, you really need to check out Forza.

571
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Really fantastic job.

572
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, yeah, that'd be like one of the games I'd pick up for sure, but I just don't have an Xbox One.

573
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So, I'm loving Forza and I think if you like racing games in the slightest, you should try it.

574
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Remember, Forza is more of an arcade style racer.

575
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So, even if you don't like things like Gran Turismo and the mainline Forza series, which are more simulation,

576
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
if you like Mario Kart, you will like Forza, I think.

577
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So, I mean, and the other cool thing about Forza is that if it's too complicated for you, if you're not taking your turns right,

578
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
if you're not, you can do so much stuff that's like auto, you can practically do it so that all you do is control the gas pedal.

579
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't think it's as much fun that way, but that might be a great way for a kid to play the game.

580
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So, you know, there's a lot of customization you can do with the difficulty in Forza and I think they did a great job with it.

581
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So.

582
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh my God.

583
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That's my thought. What's that?

584
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The what lady?

585
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Does she die too?

586
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yeah.

587
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Fuck this year. Fuck it.

588
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
She died yesterday.

589
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What? How did they know? Did they find her? How did they know it was her?

590
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm trying to make sure that it's true.

591
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Fake news. It's fake news.

592
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm trying to make sure that it's true.

593
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Not fake news. Fake news.

594
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That's what it is. Facebook, put a little red stamp on that.

595
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
She can't be dead. I love her.

596
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
All right.

597
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't know her.

598
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I feel like.

599
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, she did die.

600
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
How do you know this? Proof. I want to see the receipts.

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Someone put, I think, the obituary on Reddit.

602
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh, Reddit. Come on. Reddit's a source now.

603
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
No, no disrespect to the Redditors out there. I lurk among you, but I want to see the receipts.

604
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
All right.

605
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetware.com.

606
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Stoppy says, wait, so auto mode is kind of like those old remote controlled cars that move on a track.

607
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
A slot car racing, I think you're thinking of.

608
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It can be, but you can turn that on or off.

609
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You can turn the braking, assisted braking on or off.

610
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You can turn the guide on or off.

611
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You can really tune the difficulty down to a very fine level in the game.

612
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I think that's part of what makes the game so powerful in a way.

613
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So, yes, I'm loving Forza Horizon 3.

614
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I give that a very strong recommendation.

615
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Other than that, as far as games this week, I beat Final Fantasy 15.

616
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So we talked about that and we've talked about Final Fantasy 15 ad nauseam the past couple of weeks.

617
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I finally played and beat 15.

618
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
At the end of the day, I really enjoyed the game.

619
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There are some big flaws with the game.

620
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Chapter 13, again, I'm keeping it spoiler free.

621
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I know, I see all the hate for Chapter 13.

622
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If Chapter 13 was 25% as long and still told the same story, I would be fine with it.

623
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And again, I'm going to keep this really vague because I won't spoil anything.

624
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But those of you that have played through the whole game know there is very obviously more game that was cut.

625
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Very obviously the potential for there to be this whole...

626
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh, there's an analogy I want to make so badly, but I feel like it's a spoiler.

627
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But have you ever had that moment in a game when it was like, what?

628
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
There's definitely, for me, one of those moments in Final Fantasy 15.

629
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And I feel like that's not explored as well as it could have been.

630
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Maybe that's the DLC. Womp womp. I don't know.

631
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But you know, I've read some interesting theories on Reddit and NeoGaf.

632
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So I brought my jug of Morton Salt with me.

633
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But some very interesting theories about the fact that, yeah, dev time was cut really short.

634
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And that this game was kind of rushed.

635
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Which I know, wink wink, laugh, ha ha, because this game took 10 years to develop.

636
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But kids, look at the trailer when they announced that Final Fantasy 13 versus was becoming 15.

637
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Go back and look at that trailer.

638
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Does that game even look like the game that we got?

639
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
No.

640
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So it's very obvious, and that's part of these rumors, and I very much believe that that is the case.

641
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Because it feels like it when I look at these old trailers and actually play the game.

642
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The game has actually been in development closer to two to three years in its current form.

643
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Which would make sense with some of the, you know, they changed the director and all this other stuff.

644
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But anyway, we've talked about 15 and Ozzy in the past couple weeks. I don't want to revisit that too much.

645
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I will just say, overall, I liked it, but the game did show some weakness in the story towards the end.

646
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But I was satisfied with the ending. I was satisfied with a lot about it.

647
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'll be interested to see where the DLC goes.

648
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But for me, I still also don't really think it's a Final Fantasy game, which I talked about in previous weeks.

649
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But if I had to judge all 15 games, this one would be like in the middle for me.

650
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
This one would end up in the middle. For me, it's better than probably like 8, 1, 3, which I put towards the bottom of the pack.

651
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I know 3 has its fans, I'm really sorry guys.

652
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But it's not as strong as 6, 4, 14, 2.0. Probably not even as strong as 10 or 12, really.

653
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But that's around where I'd put it.

654
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So anyway, that was it, Final Fantasy XV.

655
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And then randomly, I played Geometry Wars 3, which I know came out like two years ago.

656
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But I was in the mood to do a twin-stick shooter.

657
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I almost bought Enter the Gungeon.

658
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But then I was like, oh, you have all this stuff on Geometry Wars 3 you haven't done yet. All these trophies you can go get.

659
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So I kind of got sucked back into that.

660
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I really should have gotten Enter the Gungeon.

661
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I really should have gotten Enter the Gungeon.

662
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But it's on sale on PlayStation right now, so I still have a few hours to figure out if I want to get it.

663
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Or do I wait for the Steam winner sale and get it on PC?

664
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Get it on both like I did.

665
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That good, huh? That good.

666
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Alright, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

667
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Let's see, Fifth Dream kind of agrees with something I was saying there in chat.

668
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Final Fantasy XV was really only developed for like two years.

669
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
AkumaJP says, the whole story was changed.

670
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com for more comments.

671
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Stoppy in chat says, I'll check it out when the price goes down enough.

672
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I think it's the right direction for Final Fantasy.

673
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So those are comments from our chat.

674
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Okay, some housekeeping, then we'll get into some gaming news.

675
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So we will be here next week, live on the 25th.

676
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Otherwise we'll see you on the podcast feed.

677
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
There will be no show January 8th.

678
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Because I will be at MAGFest.

679
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And I hope to see you guys at MAGFest.

680
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't know, I'm not scheduled to speak on any panels or anything.

681
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So I don't have like a place I can guarantee I will be.

682
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But if there's enough interest in meeting up at MAGFest, tweet me at Skye, S-K-I-E.

683
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And we'll try to do like a dinner or something.

684
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Or I don't know, because the food options out there are pretty limited.

685
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But we'll try to figure something out.

686
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So we can do like a little meet up at MAGFest for those of you that are going.

687
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That would be a lot of fun.

688
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Someone want to offer up their room for a room party?

689
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That would be fun.

690
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That's really it. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

691
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And also on Facebook and Google Plus at username Orange Lounge Radio.

692
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's get into gaming news. Loki.

693
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So Nintendo has filed multiple Nintendo Switch patents.

694
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Which have a lot of nice little drawings of stuff.

695
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And kind of reveals a few things, features of the Nintendo Switch based on it.

696
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So one of the things we know is it does have a touch screen.

697
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I mean if that wasn't obvious.

698
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Some of the cool things that they were showing off.

699
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The actual Joy-Cons or whatever they're calling those.

700
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
They have some alternate ones for the left Joy-Con.

701
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
They actually have one that has a D-Pad on it instead of an analog stick.

702
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
They have one that also replaces the sort of four button D-Pad that they have on the normal one with an actual D-Pad.

703
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So there's a few alternate designs that may be made available or something if you want to do that.

704
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What was the other stuff?

705
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I think there was something regarding an IR admitter or sensor in the Joy-Cons as well.

706
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Perhaps for the rumored Wii Virtual Console support.

707
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yeah, so I mean it looks neat and definitely worth checking out all the drawings and stuff to kind of get an idea of how everything will kind of work together.

708
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And then finally there was some more news.

709
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Not necessarily a patent but it was a trademark filed.

710
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So Nintendo has filed a new trademark for Excite Truck.

711
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So they're letting I guess their old trademark kind of just expire and they're filing a new trademark instead.

712
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So what could that mean? New Excite Truck game? I hope so.

713
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Is it just for the Virtual Console release? Who knows.

714
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Did I hear correctly that the sequel to Excite Truck, which you were not a big fan of, but what was it called?

715
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Excite Robot Excite?

716
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Excite Bots.

717
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Excite Bots. That hit Wii U Virtual Console.

718
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't know if you know that but that came out on Wii U Virtual Console this week.

719
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So it could be a lead-in?

720
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It's not a good lead-in because Excite Bots was pretty terrible.

721
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But I mean it was the only sequel who got to Excite Truck.

722
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's something.

723
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It was fucking terrible. They just, you know, I don't know why.

724
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The Switch is supposedly reimagining all these Wii U games. What about a reimagining of Excite Truck for the Switch?

725
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Maybe they're not going to go back and do a whole new one but maybe they're going to take the old one and buff it up to HD and maybe try to revisit that game.

726
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I find they add new tracks to the old game. That's really all they should have done for the sequel in the first place.

727
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
They didn't need to add all these weird transforming robots and nonsensical...

728
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Playing poker while you race?

729
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah, playing poker, throwing darts, throwing a pie at a clown. It made no fucking sense. I mean, no sense whatsoever.

730
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, that's my theory. As bad as Excite Bots was, at least Nintendo is remembering that was a thing.

731
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So I'd be down for Excite Truck Remastered.

732
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It was a great game. It was poorly advertised. It just poorly...

733
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I think it just kind of got lost amongst a lot of the Wii launch titles. I mean, it kind of went up against Zelda and a lot of powerhouse games in the Wii launch.

734
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So I think it just kind of got lost.

735
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That's too bad.

736
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But that would be cool if they at least, if nothing else, do a remaster revisited type of thing.

737
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Anyway, we know that the Nintendo Switch will be given more information and a big reveal on January 12th.

738
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That has now been timed. It will not be in the morning. It's going to be an evening presentation.

739
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So it will be taking place at 8 o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern on January 12th.

740
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Is that because of Japan, I'm guessing?

741
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It probably is because of Japan because that will be more like morning time in Japan.

742
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Because I think Akuma JP listens to this show around lunch hour in Japan. I don't know exactly how far behind they are.

743
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So yeah, it's going to be like morning, afternoon in Japan.

744
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So the only people that are going to get screwed in that is going to be Europe, I guess.

745
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
No, because Europe is 8 hours ahead. Well, ahead of us.

746
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
London is 8 hours ahead.

747
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That's true. I'm talking one time.

748
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Right now in Japan it's 11.46 am.

749
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Okay, yeah. So that makes sense. So if this whole thing goes down at what, 8 o'clock?

750
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
In Tokyo anyway.

751
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So at 8 o'clock Pacific, it will be like 1 or 2 o'clock their time.

752
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So, but then 8 o'clock Pacific is going to translate to 4 in the morning in London.

753
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So yeah, that's unfortunate. They will probably not get to really watch that live, but it makes sense.

754
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So also, the Switch's price, the release date, games currently in development, all confirmed, will be announced at this event.

755
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I would imagine this means pre-orders are happening this day too.

756
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I said this last week and probably the week before and I can't stress this enough.

757
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
If you want to switch, you need to be prepared to do the pre-order on January 12th.

758
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
This is why I'm really excited it's in the evening now because now I don't have to worry about is it going to be too busy at work or what's that deal going to be.

759
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I would also imagine there may be retailers who will announce when they start taking pre-orders.

760
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:03,000
For example, I think GameStop, correct me if I'm wrong, for these big, big releases they will do like, okay, this Friday when the stores open we will start taking pre-orders.

761
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Like, they did that for Amiibo and stuff, didn't they?

762
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I don't know.

763
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I think they did.

764
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I know they did that with PlayStation VR, that they're okay, our first batch of pre-orders will go out now.

765
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm just honestly, if they're actually launching in March, I'm just surprised that window is so short. That is a very short pre-order window.

766
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says PAX South is going to have the Switch playable at the end of January. Oh, I hadn't heard that.

767
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It makes sense though. I mean, if you thought, you know, Miyamoto ending up on Jimmy Fallon was a thing, just wait for how big Nintendo is going to push this thing fast.

768
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And exactly because of what Loki said is, I think this is Nintendo's strategy to try and not have this huge hype-up window, but to just have a very short, concentrated, huge build-up leading into a March launch.

769
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's going to be very interesting. This is a very not-typical strategy, and I'm kind of excited to see how it plays out for Nintendo, except for the whole fact that hardware is a challenge.

770
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Nintendo, they don't understand, like, there isn't a lack of hype for their stuff. It's just, they don't sell enough of their stuff.

771
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I mean, like, there's, like, no one is, like, un-hyped about the NES Classic. Everybody wants to pick it up, but it's not fucking available. That's the problem.

772
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You don't need to generate more hype. You've got the hype.

773
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:35,000
My hope is, with it not being the holidays, you're not going to have all this talk of, oh, the must-have holiday toy is the NES Classic Mini, and all this stuff that's causing those things to be in shortages as well.

774
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:45,000
At least we don't have to compete with the freaking holidays in March. So, that is a good sign, but, I don't know, it didn't really stop any of the other systems, so, I don't know.

775
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The 3DS has the same problem in it, launched in March, so...

776
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah. So, anyway, that is something to look forward to on January 12th. Also, kind of interesting, some of my Nintendo members are getting Switch invites.

777
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:11,000
There's some emails going out that say Eventbrite will send out more details, and they have to register right away. So, yeah, some fans are apparently getting emails, random users, to actually go to the event.

778
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's supposed to be, I think, in the New York area.

779
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah, so, that's why we haven't... Our invites were clearly lost in the mail, but maybe some of our New York City area people, if they're my Nintendo members...

780
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I would laugh if I got an invite.

781
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Maybe I would laugh, too. That would be great.

782
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So, alright.

783
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
SSG100matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

784
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
SkyBreakingNews, the PAX South Switch line is already capped.

785
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Sad, but true. Sad, but absolutely true.

786
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Alright, moving on. DarkSaga.

787
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Well, it's kind of surprising, but not really surprising, because Konami don't fucked up.

788
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I mean, we all know what they've all fucked up on. We don't have to go into detail.

789
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's more like, what haven't they fucked up in the past couple years?

790
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
We don't have to go into detail on the level of having fucked up-ness.

791
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So, in light of all that, as we all know, Kojima Productions is now a thing.

792
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And the new president of Kojima Productions is a former Konami president.

793
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Hirano Shinji, who once was the head of Konami Europe, is now the main top executive head honcho of Kojima Productions.

794
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And I think that this is also a really, really fun little middle finger to Konami.

795
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Well, this sort of thing happens, though, no matter what the industry is.

796
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I mean, we kind of are looking at this because it's a big video game, high profile stuff going on.

797
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But sometimes, if a particular company is a sinking ship, so to speak, and somebody finds an opportunity somewhere else,

798
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
they're going to try to take the best people they know from that sinking ship and take them to that other place.

799
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Like, that happens in other places, too.

800
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I mean, in y'all's professional lives, you've probably seen something like that. I know I have.

801
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So, yeah, I'm not terribly surprised to hear about this.

802
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I mean, Kojima, even though he probably strongly dislikes Konami, to put it lightly,

803
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm sure that applies only to very specific people very high up in management.

804
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So there's probably other people that he really enjoyed that he's probably been wooing to come work with him.

805
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I like what Stoppy says. At this point, Konami is like that in-law that keeps getting busted for meth.

806
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Happy holidays, everybody.

807
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah. But the other talk, too, is that they had done some, of course, plenty of work together when both were still with Konami.

808
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And so it is official that Hirano is going to be working on, or at least assisting Kojima Pro with Death Stranding.

809
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yay.

810
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Cool.

811
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
All right. Maybe somebody will be hired to help us all understand the plot. That would be wonderful.

812
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Of course, they don't want to give it away this early.

813
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Well, I will know the plot soon enough when the game's out, so.

814
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I don't know if I'd use the word soon in discussing Death Stranding's release.

815
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, you know what I mean.

816
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I know what you mean. I know what you mean. Of course I do.

817
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Soon is relative.

818
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah.

819
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
This is Blizzard soon type of scale.

820
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This is eventually.

821
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
All right. Moving on. Loki.

822
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So apparently Capcom is going to be tweaking their rules for rage-quitting on Street Fighter V.

823
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:52,000
If you are a person that rage-quits quite a bit in Street Fighter V, you're going to actually get branded with a profile icon and also something in your profile that says,

824
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Hey, this guy, you know, rage-quits a lot or something to that effect, you know.

825
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You're going to get a Scarlet Letter.

826
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah, it's basically like a Scarlet Letter.

827
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That's Scarlet R for rage-quitting.

828
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Uh, yeah.

829
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So that's good because rage-quitters suck.

830
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah. I'm curious what you all think about this, especially in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

831
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Is this deserved or is there maybe fear that this could get misapplied to somebody with like a bad internet connection or something like that?

832
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:32,000
No. You know what? I think this is fine as long as they do it like the same way as like they do like Grand Theft Auto 5 through Grand Theft Auto Online.

833
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Like if you're cheating or exploiting stuff, you'll get put into this like special, you know, place where you only play with cheaters.

834
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Quitter Island.

835
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, Quitter Island or whatever. So, but then after some time you get put back into the normal pool of players.

836
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So I'm hoping that that's kind of the same thing here that after, you know, in case if there's an issue where maybe you had some internet connection problems and you accidentally got put into that, that's not permanent.

837
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Uh, Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says people are still playing Street Fighter 5.

838
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I get the feeling it's probably not quite the machine that Star Trek Street Fighter 4 was.

839
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But, you know, there was that whole Capcom Cup that happened at the PlayStation experience and, you know, I even caught the tail end of it and I was like, okay, this is, you know, I'm feeling this. This is fun.

840
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:29,000
But then again, I haven't exactly ran out and bought the game either. I think they screwed the launch of that game so hard. It just kind of, it's fallen off my radar. What can I say?

841
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Kaijito in chat says don't troll the rage quitters. Take down their rank.

842
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Stoppy in chat says I have terrible internet so yes, I would be worried about this.

843
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Let's see. YYR says Street Fighter 5 was just on deeply discounted sale for the holidays. So I figure a bunch of people just grabbed it for $20.

844
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah, I saw that. It was on whatever that sale was on PlayStation recently or the ongoing holiday sale. I think it was a part of that sale.

845
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And yeah, I guess Capcom's thinking they'll make the money with all the, you know, seasoned characters and the additional stuff they're going to throw out there that maybe they only get $20 off you now.

846
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But maybe you'll be enticed to buy the season 2 pack which will be another $20 or whatever it is.

847
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah, you might be enticed or you can just wait for the goddamn game of the year edition or whatever, you know, collector's edition, alpha arcade, blah blah blah. Just wait. Just wait. It'll come out.

848
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Sj100matt in chat says Quitter Island where there is no tribal council because everyone gave up during the immunity challenge. Yes. It's just like everybody just gave up.

849
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Alright, moving on to a game that I'm very excited about that is coming out next year, hopefully, if nothing gets delayed. Dragon Quest XI. Some of the first details were revealed about Dragon Quest XI.

850
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So part of the reason I'm excited about this is, you know, Dragon Quest X was an MMO which never even came out here so it may as well not exist as far as I'm concerned.

851
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Dragon Quest IX was handheld which is cool but, hmm, so I feel like we haven't had like a console game since Dragon Quest VIII.

852
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So this is fun. I'm excited for Dragon Quest XI which, as a reminder, is coming out for PlayStation 4 and 3DS. So interesting that it's both.

853
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Also in development for the Nintendo Switch. But the Jump Festa event happened in Japan. I believe that is some type of like big, like it's like a Comic Con in Japan for like manga and anime and that type of stuff.

854
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So Jump Festa just happened this week in Japan and there was a new Dragon Quest XI trailer that showed up. There's some more characters that you can see in there and there is a new character called Camus which is a blue haired thief.

855
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:44,000
That sounds like that, like, wasn't that actually, I'm gonna get a text, wasn't that one of the characters in Suikoden, Shane?

856
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And now this guy has blue hair? I would think Shane's very excited about the release of Dragon Quest XI. We'll see.

857
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Anyway, you can check out the trailer. It's out there. It has some of the sweet music in the game that you've grown to expect and all that good stuff. So I'm excited.

858
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And Shane says it's Camus is how you say it. Oh, bummer. That's not how it's written like, though. C-A-M-U-S. But all those funky pronunciations.

859
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Fifth Dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm excited for Dragon Quest Heroes 2. So, alright. Excited for Dragon Quest XI. More details soon, I hope.

860
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:34,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Stuff. Well, you all saw that during the whole winter event in Overwatch everyone got these legendary skins, right?

861
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Not everyone got them. They're available, yes.

862
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Okay. Well, but a lot of people were bitching about Mei. Because a lot of, pretty much almost everyone else had completely different skins. They were different.

863
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Hers, though, really looked like a reskinning of her normal outfit. I mean, down to everything. Just kind of Santa trimmed.

864
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Just a palette swap like they do for some of the non-legendary colors.

865
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:14,000
A few different textures, but yeah. And apparently people were so pissed over it that Blizzard actually apologized.

866
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:26,000
The game director, Jeff Kaplan, said on the forums, sorry you were disappointed with Mei's winter skin. We just sort of make a gut call based on what we think is cool.

867
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:42,000
We thought it was pretty special and we had done it specifically based on community suggestions from months ago when people were speculating that we might have a winter event. Apologies that our cool meter was off from yours on this one.

868
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Doesn't she? Oh, actually Shane just texted. Mei has a snowman. Why didn't he just come to the show tonight?

869
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
She turns into a snowman.

870
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Yeah, she turns into a snowman.

871
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
With her ice block.

872
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah, which is what people think is cute.

873
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But her outfit is just a reskin.

874
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:13,000
There's a part of me that's like, this is a gamershateeverything.com situation. But at the same time, the problem is that Overwatch's system of the loot boxes and charging money for them.

875
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yes, you can unlock them in game, but we all know there's people that are dropping a lot of money on loot boxes.

876
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So there's also a part of me that says, well, some of the feedback and irritation is kind of justified now that money is involved that people are paying on top of the game fee of $60, $50, whatever it is you bought it on sale at that price.

877
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So I don't know. I don't know. I kind of think the snowman thing is sort of like, okay, well, that's really cool and different. And I think people will use the skin for that, if nothing else.

878
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,000
But at the same time, if Blizzard's going to charge for this, then eh. If you don't like it, go give them the feedback. Why not?

879
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's more the fact that the other characters were so wildly different and hers pretty much just looked the same. Just a different color.

880
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.

881
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Alright, just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

882
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So this is pretty awesome. Right now, until the 31st of December, you can go download Lost Odyssey for free. That's right. On Xbox 360 or Xbox One with backwards compatibility, there is no reason whatsoever that you shouldn't go just mark this for download.

883
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I did it today. You don't even need Xbox Live Gold to do it. Go do it right now.

884
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Oh, you don't even need gold?

885
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You don't even need gold.

886
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Wow.

887
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Because my gold's expired.

888
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Seriously? Open a new browser window, go sign into your Microsoft account and get this game because you'll kick yourself if you don't. It's a fantastic JRPG. Worth your time.

889
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Seriously, and it's free. I mean, it's hours worth of entertainment.

890
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I can't believe that they're just giving it away for free.

891
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yeah, because they added Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey and they're giving it away for free until the end of the year.

892
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I guess they just figure there's no money left to be made off it. Man, I really wish there'd be a Lost Odyssey 2, though.

893
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm hoping. Maybe with this offering for free we can get an announcement next year.

894
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I don't know. I kind of think... I don't know what Mistwalker's doing these days. Didn't they move into the mobile space finally? I don't know, but I just feel like that's probably not going to happen.

895
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Honestly, though, a mobile version of Lost Odyssey wouldn't be all that bad. It's a turn-based RPG, so it's not like you need a lot of precision in the controls and everything. I think mobile would be fine, especially just navigating the map and stuff.

896
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
YYR points out, even if you own the disc, do it. You will then own a digital copy. Yeah, who knows how long the disc will last.

897
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:53,000
YYR continues on to saying they didn't just add them to backwards compatibility. They are now digital copies available. Yeah, that was one of the things. When Lost Odyssey first went backwards compatible, people couldn't buy it on the store.

898
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah, and I think I must have sold my discs at one time because I can't find them anymore, so yes, absolutely, we'll have to play this at some point, either on my 360 or on an Xbox One whenever I get one.

899
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Alright, go get it. You'll kick yourself if you don't. And I need to install Blue Dragon now, too. I keep forgetting they added that one, and I have the disc for that. That one's not free, but...

900
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I think it's like 20 bucks if you want to pick it up.

901
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Alright, moving on to stories about Pokemon Go, which a lot of our hosts are still playing. I left it out of my gaming week, but I hit level 23 this week in Pokemon Go, so yes, even I'm still playing this a little bit.

902
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Yeah, I'm not playing it that hardcore, but I'm playing it a little bit. What's nice though is now, I think they mixed up where stuff spawns, so usually if I boot up the app, there's at least one or two Pokemon sitting there, so it's kind of nice.

903
01:02:47,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah, same thing here. It was a Pikachu nest, but now the things have rotated. I think we're like a Nidoran male nest or something, not very exciting. Even though I've caught two Jigglypuffs, so it could be a Jigglypuff nest, and I'm just... I don't know.

904
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But anyway, here's the thing, is that there was a lot of changes to Pokemon Go this week, including the addition of Generation 2 Pokemon, sort of. Sort of.

905
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The babies.

906
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Just, what, six or seven babymon are available now, and they only hatch in eggs.

907
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And they're kind of useless, because if you evolve them, they just go back to...

908
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yeah, they're really just for Dex people, people that really want Gen 2 Pokemon. Like, I'm not gonna lie, I've been trying to hatch a crazy ton of eggs, because I want an Igglybuff. Like, crazy. A Smoochum would be fucking rad, too.

909
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But there really isn't like... I don't think you're gonna get a lot of value off putting these in a gym. I don't see people evolving these into the forums that are more easily catchable other places.

910
01:03:48,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Except for maybe Togepi. Togepi would be the one difference, which apparently somebody on Reddit, because it's always somebody on Reddit, did collect enough Togepi where they were able to evolve it into Togek, or Togekic, sorry, I can never remember the pronunciation.

911
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But they evolved it into the next forum. So that is something you can do, but, you know, very hard to do.

912
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So, yeah, a lot of people are saying this is a really cheap fucking way for Niantic to sell incubators on all this hype.

913
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Uh-huh.

914
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Yeah, I think it would be nice if maybe Niantic would think about giving away some incubators or incentivizing that, or, like, if you visit 10 PokeStops in a day during the holiday event, you'll get an incubator, so you can try to get the Gen 2 Pokemon. Like, I just think...

915
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Or, here's an idea, because you just, you know, you, you know, sealed out those, you know, wonderful retail deals and brand deals and stuff like that. How about if you visit, like, a Starbucks or something like that, you get an incubator, you know.

916
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Yeah, it ties into something like that.

917
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
You know, first two times, or one time.

918
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah. So, also, if you haven't been keeping track, the Starbucks thing went live, the Sprint thing went live. So, there's a lot more PokeStops out there now if you have Starbucks in your neighborhood, which doesn't everybody... In the U.S. Sorry, this is limited to the U.S. Doesn't everybody in the U.S. have a Starbucks nearby?

919
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Four or five.

920
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I guess, I guess, you know, I take that back there, and before chat, chatters jump down my throat. There are some parts of the country that I guess don't, don't have them. Like, I remember when I was taking all those trips for work out to Pennsylvania. I spent a lot of time out in Allentown.

921
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:38,000
There was, like, no Starbucks anywhere there except for, like, one at a Barnes and Noble, I think. I don't know if that's changed. I haven't been there for, like, eight years, so I don't know if that's changed since then.

922
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:47,000
But I guess there are still some parts of the country that don't have a lot of Starbucks, but maybe they have Sprint stores. I don't know. So, anyway.

923
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Wow, Fifth Dream in chat says, no idea where the nearest one is. I don't have one here. Wow. I guess I just take it for granted being in California that they're, like, everywhere.

924
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Maya in chat points out Dunkin Donuts has the Northeast on lockdown. See, maybe, but when I was in New York City, I still felt like I saw Starbucks everywhere. So, I don't know. Anyway.

925
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:21,000
There you go. That's some of the changes to Pokemon Go. There's also a holiday event, if you haven't already heard. You can now catch Pikachu wearing a Santa hat. The Santa hat will stay with Pikachu after the event is over.

926
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
If you evolve a Pikachu with a Santa hat, it will become a Raichu with a Santa hat.

927
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I've seen wild Raichus as well with Santa hats.

928
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Oh, really? No, I haven't seen those yet.

929
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Catch, yeah.

930
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Oh, cool. So, yeah. Both of those will stay in your inventory permanently, so if you want to celebrate Christmas all the time with your Pokemon, you can do that. So, check that out.

931
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:54,000
All right. Let's move on. We're going to get to our classic game of the week. Before we do our classic game of the week, though, Dark Sakura, I suppose we should tell the listeners what we were talking about before the show.

932
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
So, we're going to do some twists to the show in 2017, right? What a twist.

933
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
We'll be twisting things.

934
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
After 15 years, we need to shake some things up, right?

935
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:14,000
That's going to be 52 games, practically. Maybe less if we skip a week. And I'm running out of good ones.

936
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Now, now. There is a major franchise that's unrepresented.

937
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No.

938
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Be quiet. All of you. So, what? No, we're not getting rid of the segment.

939
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:36,000
No, we're not getting rid of it, but we're going to change things up. So, next year, on the last, or, you know, I'll probably just do it the second Sunday of the month.

940
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
At some point during the month, once a month.

941
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Because there's not always, the last Sunday's going to change depending, so I'll just always do the second Sunday.

942
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Okay.

943
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I am going to be doing a classic game system of the month.

944
01:07:51,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And I'm going for semi-obscurity, because there are other systems out there that, at least in America, that we haven't heard of.

945
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You know, I've mentioned some, you know, like, I mean, I'm sure people know that there were a series of Atari computers,

946
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
but didn't know that there were games specific to them, or what their capabilities were.

947
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
You know, I've mentioned the ZX Spectrum, I've mentioned the Amstrad CPC, I've mentioned.

948
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The Xbox. I'm just kidding. The Xbox will not be in the list.

949
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But, I mean, like, you know, there was, Sega had the Pico back in the day for kids.

950
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You know, there's all kinds of, you know, CDI, you know, you name it.

951
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You know, and then regional specific ones. Especially in the handheld market, oh my god.

952
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But I figured that we would introduce y'all to a few of the kind of obscure, maybe some not so obscure that you might not be familiar with.

953
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
But some of them are like, oh yeah, I've heard of this, but, like, my rich friend owned one.

954
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Or, like.

955
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Or my friend overseas owned one.

956
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I've seen this in a YouTube video once.

957
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

958
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:21,000
You know. So, I've, you know, I've just decided that it would be something that would, you know, throw a little bit of difference in there and introduce y'all to what some of the features of the systems were.

959
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And if you think, oh, that's neat. I think I'll try to find one. Good luck.

960
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So.

961
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Thank you very much, good luck.

962
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Classic console of the month, coming to you in 2017.

963
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Yep.

964
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Except I'm just realizing, do you realize the second Sunday in January? We have no show. So.

965
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, I'll do it whenever I feel like it.

966
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Thank you. Dark Soccer, don't set a date. Just, it'll be a surprise show once a month. The classic console of the month.

967
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Like, let's see. Oh, it's that time of the month again.

968
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Alright.

969
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I like that. That should be, that should be the intro. And guess what? It's that time of the month. Alright.

970
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
That means I'd have to, like, watch the month cycle and everything, and that just gets annoying.

971
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Alright. For now, though, it's that time of the week. We still have lots of games to cover.

972
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Despite what Dark Soccer says, if she can't think of 52 games, I'll help.

973
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Because there's still lots of Commodore 64 shit she haven't touched. So.

974
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Hey, now.

975
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I'll help. And.

976
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I've touched some of it.

977
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
And there's lots of Xbox games you haven't touched.

978
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And then I needed a shot after I touched it.

979
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Alright. Here it is, the classic game of the week.

980
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:34,000
The classic game of the week is Viewpoint, which is an isometric shooter that came out, of course, in arcades.

981
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:44,000
It was developed by ICOM, but it was released by Sammy and SNK together for the Neo Geo MVS.

982
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It came out in 1992, and it is fairly unique that it is Sammy's only game for the Neo Geo MVS.

983
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It had one player and two player modes that you play one after each other, although there was simultaneous play and service mode.

984
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And you also had, basically it is a shooter, kind of zaxxon-like. On a diagonal plane, though, the way that it did.

985
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And the ship had its primary weapons, but it also had bombs, ones that make like a wave of fire.

986
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And then another one that's like a circular nova blast, and another one that does mini missiles.

987
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And the game itself has six stages.

988
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:44,000
The game itself, I mean, it had a home release that came out on the Genesis or Master System.

989
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:51,000
But the Master System version wasn't even really all that great. It had a lot of slowdown.

990
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:00,000
The company that did the release for it, now For the Life of Me, I can't remember what the company that did the conversion was.

991
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But they are notorious for having done bad conversions, and so it didn't have any other kind of release.

992
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Now, stop distracting me, stop being in chat. At any rate-

993
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Stop reading chat, Darzagra.

994
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Anyway, there's really not a lot to say about it. Basically, with its isometric viewpoint, it makes it interesting because you have on-screen obstacles to dodge as well as the shooting factors.

995
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
There's places where spiked walls will come out and you have to dodge them.

996
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And you get different shields as the game progresses and other options with it as you go through.

997
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It is a pretty, though, standard shooter. However, it's got really excellent music.

998
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And the graphics are really sharp, especially for the Neo Geo version.

999
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
But there were other versions that actually looked better. And it's not necessarily a super easy game on top of that.

1000
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:16,000
As far as those other versions that came out, and this is sort of actually what inspired me to do the Classic Console of the Week.

1001
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Is it-

1002
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Month.

1003
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Month, whatever. It's the Classic Console of whenever the fuck that I want to do it.

1004
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Whenever I feel like it.

1005
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Right? So, anyway, there was, like I said, the Genesis slash Mega Drive version.

1006
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:38,000
There was a Sharp X68000 version. They planned a Saturn version, but it was cancelled.

1007
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:50,000
The PlayStation version. It pretty much is just like the Neo Geo version, but it was redeveloped by visual concepts.

1008
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And so all of the visuals were redone.

1009
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You know, the layouts and everything are the same. It is the same game.

1010
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But they did that re-skinning where everything was re-textured.

1011
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
But it's pre-rendered graphics. It wasn't live 3D.

1012
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So it was one of those weird, you know, PlayStation era remake works.

1013
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Like Sonic 3D kind of looked?

1014
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yeah, kind of.

1015
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Sonic 3D, as cool of a game as it was, it kind of looked junky. Like, in retrospect, it looks kind of junky.

1016
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Well, Sonic 3D Blast was, in my opinion, I think a precursor to what was being developed as Sonic Adventure, if I recall correctly, for its development cycle.

1017
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:45,000
But anyway, the best version of this was on a system that I had only heard of in passing.

1018
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And it's called the FM Towns, and it was a Hijitsu computer system.

1019
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
In fact, the Towns itself had a console version called the Marty.

1020
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And trust me, you guys, you'll be hearing about this, because I was digging deep into this when it was in school.

1021
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Spoiler alert.

1022
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Well, I'm not going to go any further than that, because I'm going to be talking about it soon.

1023
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Anyway, it's the truest arcade version, and that system actually had graphic upscaling, so it was a higher resolution game, and the music was better quality.

1024
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So it actually was one of the few console ports of that era that improved on the arcade version, so that's pretty notable.

1025
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Now, the Genesis version, it was pretty similar to the Neo Geo arcade one, but had fewer enemies, a lower color palette, and had a lot of slowdown.

1026
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And the X68000 version was fairly like the Genesis one, although as I recall, I think it had even worse slowdown. It was pretty bad.

1027
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:57,000
But, I mean, it all stayed faithful to the graphic style. The only one that's really different graphically is the PlayStation one.

1028
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:11,000
So, the game itself got really, really good reviews. In fact, it was awarded Best Graphics and Best Music in a Video Game for EGM's 1992 Video Game Awards.

1029
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:23,000
For Famicom 2 Shin, it got a 30 out of 40. The Neo Geo arcade version had really good reviews from computer and video games. It had a 95%.

1030
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:33,000
It just really was well received, and of course there were plenty of comparisons to Zaxxon.

1031
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Yeah, that's the vibe I totally get from this. It's like a Zaxxon type of game. I like it. I like that a lot.

1032
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I've never heard of this before, by the way.

1033
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:49,000
The big thing about it is just that the music itself was really interesting. It was one of the big things that stood out. Can we play a little bit?

1034
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah, let me turn it up a little bit. Looks like our YouTuber has made it to the second stage of the game.

1035
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:06,000
The first level had a little bit more of a hip-hop vibe to it, but this one's a bit dancier.

1036
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:14,000
But it was one of the big things that stuck out. That and it's just very striking visuals and animated backgrounds.

1037
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:25,000
But the thing that really does stick out for me is just sort of how this did fall into obscurity.

1038
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:32,000
We remember Zaxxon, but I'll be perfectly honest, this game to me seems a little bit more fun than Zaxxon.

1039
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's definitely one that actually is not in our Genesis collection that I would like to add.

1040
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Although, to be perfectly honest, I would rather find an MVS cart conversion for it and play it on my Neo Geo.

1041
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:57,000
There was a sequel played for it for Nintendo 64 called Viewpoint 2064, but Sammy was having problems, so it got cancelled.

1042
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:05,000
However, a prototype for it surfaced on October 2015 on an online auction. And that's the last that we've heard of Viewpoint.

1043
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Sad.

1044
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Sad.

1045
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Alright.

1046
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Neat game.

1047
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Well, if that's all you've got, then there it is.

1048
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
That's all I've got.

1049
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Our classic game of the week, Viewpoint, spotlighted on the Neo Geo. Although, as StarSucker said, it was on a lot of different systems.

1050
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So, check it out.

1051
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yep.

1052
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Alright, we're going to take a break, but when we come back, we've got plenty more show to come.

1053
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Rapid Fire News, Mailbag, what's in stores this week, some stuff on Twitch, some stuff on Mega Man, some stuff on Shenmue 3.

1054
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:42,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your calls as well at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, right after this break.

1055
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 670 in progress for this December the 18th of 2016.

1056
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Part B is beginning right now with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com or those of you that are listening on our magic podcast feed.

1057
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And I hope you're subscribed to us on iTunes or Google Play podcast or wherever it is that you found our little show.

1058
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Please consider leaving us a nice review while you're there.

1059
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That word of mouth goes an awful long way.

1060
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Before we get into Rapid Fire News, I thought I'd ask this question.

1061
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Before the theme park thing came up, I thought this would be kind of an appropriate time to talk about this for a kickoff topic.

1062
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
But, you know, I was thinking about this since I beat Final Fantasy XV this past week.

1063
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That was kind of like, you know, like the big game that I had to finish this year that I wanted to finish.

1064
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
But now that I have a couple weeks left and, you know, there's going to be a few days off of work because of the holidays.

1065
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Are there any video games that you feel like you need, like in your backlog, like you really need to finish them this year?

1066
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Like there's games you really got to get around to this year.

1067
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And I open this up to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

1068
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
What do you need to play right now before the year's over?

1069
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
There's a lot of games that I've just bought that I have to play that I feel that I'm obligated to play because I purchased them.

1070
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Like Watch Dogs 2, I started that and I never really did anything.

1071
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I mean, I kind of stopped playing it for a while.

1072
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
But I have this bad habit, like I keep buying games because they're great deals on PlayStation Network.

1073
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And then I'm like, but I really should work on my game and making that stuff.

1074
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Like I've been purchasing a ton of VR stuff.

1075
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Like I've got a ton of VR games now that I haven't touched at all.

1076
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Because I just haven't gotten around to doing that.

1077
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And I even looked at my stuff and I'm like, dude, I can't really leave this VR stuff just sitting here.

1078
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Because that's what I did at the Rift.

1079
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
You know, I bought a bunch of stuff and I did stuff and then I kind of like let it sit in the box.

1080
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So I need to go back in and play some of that some more.

1081
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And I do want to.

1082
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I've been kind of just picking up stuff as it's cheap.

1083
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
But is there any games I really need to finish this year?

1084
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Probably not.

1085
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I would like to finish Final Fantasy 15.

1086
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
But then I'd have to actually start playing Final Fantasy 15.

1087
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Hell, even Just Cause 3, which I picked up last year.

1088
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I played a little bit and it was buggy shit.

1089
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And I really wanted to go finish it.

1090
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
But I don't know. Some of those games are just very tedious.

1091
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Well, Watch Dogs 2 had kind of an interesting story.

1092
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So I may have to go back to that.

1093
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
This seems like a lot of people are really enjoying Watch Dogs 2 more than the first one too.

1094
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Yeah, absolutely. I think so.

1095
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And it had like a pretty interesting story.

1096
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
It was kind of fun to grind to get all your abilities and stuff.

1097
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It's just kind of grindy.

1098
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
But even the multiplayer stuff is pretty fun.

1099
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So it would be kind of fun to go back to that.

1100
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
But then again, it's like if I want to have a dumb, just fun experience.

1101
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Like Fallout 4, I need to go back to play.

1102
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Because I have all the DLC for it and I haven't touched any of it.

1103
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
That's on my list too.

1104
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And I haven't touched any of the mods yet.

1105
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I haven't been able to touch it on PlayStation 4 yet.

1106
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
That's something that I want to go back to Grand Theft Auto 5 online at some point.

1107
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
There's just so many features that they've added since I played last.

1108
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
It's just ridiculous.

1109
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
We should have some story DLC.

1110
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I guess it's never going to happen.

1111
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And in Skyrim.

1112
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I'm still playing Skyrim even though I've played the same section of Skyrim like 80 times probably.

1113
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And it's still fun.

1114
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
That's why when they were saying that game's coming out on the Switch, I was like, well it's so old.

1115
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That's a game you can play over and over because it's so extensive that you forget half the stuff that happens.

1116
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And it's like new again.

1117
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You know what Alan's been playing a lot lately is Morrowind.

1118
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Yes, I see him playing Morrowind all the time.

1119
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
He's playing it all the time.

1120
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
That's a game I've never played.

1121
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I bet I have it in my Steam library if I check.

1122
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Oh, I'm sure everybody does.

1123
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I think the one Elder Scrolls game I haven't seen him play.

1124
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Well, I don't think a lot of people play Arena or the really old ones anymore.

1125
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But I don't think I've seen him play Oblivion.

1126
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
That's the only one I haven't seen him play.

1127
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
He'll probably play that eventually.

1128
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I would love a remaster of Oblivion.

1129
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Or even Morrowind. Let's do Morrowind too.

1130
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Because I've never really touched Morrowind.

1131
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
So games you want to finish before the year is over.

1132
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I'll get to Dark Soccer in a minute and I'll tell my own.

1133
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
But I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1134
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Fifth Dream says Telltale Batman.

1135
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And that's one that I definitely want to get to as well.

1136
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Fifth Dream says Pokemon Moon.

1137
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
That's on my list for sure.

1138
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I have the team to do it.

1139
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Let's sit down and grind that out.

1140
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Let's see. Stoppy says Killzone Shadow Fall.

1141
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I have too many first person shooter games in the backlog.

1142
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Maya says I'm on a race to finish.

1143
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
In parentheses, start.

1144
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
The Mass Effect series before Andromeda releases.

1145
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Get on that.

1146
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Let's see. Alan Alchemy says they're rebuilding Morrowind and Oblivion in Skyrim.

1147
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Akin to Black Mesa and Half-Life.

1148
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1149
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
They being officially Bethesda?

1150
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Okay, that makes sense.

1151
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
That makes a lot of sense.

1152
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
For me, one game that everybody's talking about

1153
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
that I think I can finish pretty quickly

1154
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
because I hear it's only three or four hours long.

1155
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I want to play Inside.

1156
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Because a lot of people are telling me, seriously, do you need to play that?

1157
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I may have that.

1158
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I don't remember if I have that or not.

1159
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Was it one of those free games?

1160
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
There's a lot of games that I have on my PlayStation account

1161
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
that I have no idea what they are.

1162
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
If they did do it, I neglected to get it.

1163
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Which, you know, my bad on that.

1164
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
But that's something I definitely want to get to as well.

1165
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So that's pretty high on my list.

1166
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Otherwise, like Fallout 4, I think, as well,

1167
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
and Pokemon Sun and Moon, I really want to finish.

1168
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Because a lot of people that have played through it say the story gets pretty good

1169
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
in the third and fourth islands.

1170
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So I'm wanting to get there.

1171
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And now, Shane just gave me all the Pokemon I wanted.

1172
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
So I don't even have to worry about the collection part of it.

1173
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It's just vroom, just get through the game.

1174
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Or if you know Earth Defense Force 4.1, it would be nice to go through as well.

1175
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Dark Soccer, anything on your list?

1176
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Like, games you have to do before the year's over?

1177
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I'm going to finish Dankenronpa 2, maybe.

1178
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Nothing really on my half-two list.

1179
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I've just been, you know, I'm kind of digging the not being married to a game.

1180
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Or my games in general.

1181
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I've just been enjoying playing what I want to, when I want to, the way I want to.

1182
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I do what I want.

1183
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
That's right.

1184
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
But I mean, the only one that I would feel like a major obligation to when to get done

1185
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
is Dankenronpa 2, even though I already know how the whole game goes.

1186
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Because V3 will be out before too long.

1187
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Right. And even though sometimes you might know the ending to a game,

1188
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
you still need to play it.

1189
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I think a lot of people know how Final Fantasy IV and VI probably end up.

1190
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
But if you've never played them, you need to play them.

1191
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They're such good games.

1192
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
But not the mobile phone versions.

1193
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I think maybe the whole thing is that I know how, what happens to one of the characters I like a whole lot.

1194
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And I don't want to get to that point, but at the same time, I'll get there.

1195
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And I think SSJ100Matt in our chat really sums up a lot of this nicely in our chat room, saying,

1196
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
My backlog will be worse in the next week because of the sale on Steam.

1197
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Uh-huh. Yep.

1198
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Thankfully though, we're getting to a point, I mean, not much of a point,

1199
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
but we're getting to a point where a lot of the games that are on sale, I probably already own.

1200
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And so that list every year just keeps getting more and more in your library, in your library.

1201
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I'm like, oh, well, I don't remember purchasing that, but there it is.

1202
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
This might, I don't mean to keep pushing our rapid news back,

1203
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
but this is just something that occurs to me as we're talking about Steam.

1204
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And I think this is something I want to discuss and get the listeners' input on this as well.

1205
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Does it feel like the bubble might be starting to burst with Steam?

1206
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Like, I feel like this year especially, there's been a lot more negative stuff on Steam than there has been in any other year.

1207
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And a lot of it's the fact that their store is filled with shovelware at this point.

1208
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Like, wasn't there some article this week or last week about how like 40% of the games on Steam were released in this past year?

1209
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah.

1210
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And I think a lot of people are starting to get, like, Valve was the company that could do no wrong.

1211
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Like, good guy Gabe Newell, right? Like, there's all this, the Steam sale and the Hallelujah Choir and all that stuff.

1212
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But I feel like there's starting to be a lot more pushback towards Steam.

1213
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And some of that, I honestly feel like some of that is resentment because Valve hasn't made a fucking game in a long time.

1214
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Note, yes, I completely understand the HTC Vive and they've done all that stuff, but there hasn't been a Portal, there hasn't been a Half-Life, there hasn't been Left 4 Dead.

1215
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
What game has Valve done recently?

1216
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Dota.

1217
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Okay, so Dota. But again, Dota, that's a few years old now.

1218
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,000
People will, yeah, A, it's a few years old and people are going to strongly disagree with me, but that's kind of a niche game.

1219
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
It's a very popular niche game.

1220
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Are we still waiting for the new source engine? Because I thought that that's being worked on and once that gets out, then I'm sure there's going to be a game or two with that.

1221
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I just, I don't know.

1222
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:43,000
The only attention that Steam's had for me lately, I'm looking at the sale now, I just haven't looked at it, is that Hive Swap, the Homestuck game, is now in Greenlight.

1223
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So I would appreciate it if friends would also just say yes on it so that it gets more trust.

1224
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I'm sure that it's going to get through, I mean, come on.

1225
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
But I would still appreciate it.

1226
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And there's a lot of garbage that gets through.

1227
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
But here's the thing, it's like, not all that stuff is being voted on Greenlight.

1228
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Somehow some of that stuff is getting just published and, I don't know.

1229
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I think though, with the sales, I'm not that hyped on their sales anymore because there's so many deals throughout the year, it's like, you know, big deal.

1230
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And I think that now that everything's on sale once, you kind of hit the store and you're like, okay, I've seen everything, now I don't have to come back.

1231
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
They're not as events as they used to be.

1232
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yeah, because before it was an event and there'd be different things each day and that keeps having you go back to the store, which I think is a good thing.

1233
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:39,000
But now it's like, you see what's on there, you see the list and you're like, well, not anything I really want.

1234
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I'm going to go check the other sites that have them be doing the sales at the same time.

1235
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Or like, you know, the PlayStation Network.

1236
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And I'm sure the same with Live because I haven't really been purchasing on Live because I don't count on there anymore that I use.

1237
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
But, you know, they do Flash sales all the time.

1238
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
There's always a sale going on, like PlayStation Network stuff.

1239
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And that's why I'm touching more than I am my Steam library.

1240
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:08,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase TOY.

1241
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Stoppy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, if by bubble you mean it's not as special as it used to be, then yes, you no longer get good discounts and the quality control is non-existent now.

1242
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Kaijuto following up saying Early Access is hurting Steam too.

1243
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Lots of unfinished games in Early Access, like the dev just gives up on the game and leaves.

1244
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
They rage quit.

1245
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And then, let's see, s2100matt saying, where's Ragenator for this conversation?

1246
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah, lol, I'm doing it when he's not here.

1247
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:44,000
No, but I mean, the whole fact that, you know, maybe Steam isn't as special as it used to be either because of things like good old games, itch.io, you know, these other storefronts.

1248
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Origin, shit.

1249
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
You know, Origin's come a long way.

1250
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I remember when Origin was the thing we all pointed and laughed at.

1251
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
But, you know, it's come a long way.

1252
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It has its perks.

1253
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I still think there's not enough variety on Origin for me.

1254
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
It's very much the EA and Friends store.

1255
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
But, you know, it's come a long way.

1256
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
So, maybe, maybe that's why I kind of feel like Valve needs to, like, make a game.

1257
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I don't know.

1258
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I don't know what it is.

1259
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Anyway, Fifth Dream says Valve can't 3.

1260
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
YYR says Valve can't release a game with 3 in its title.

1261
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
The world might end.

1262
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And Act Def says, if Leo won an Oscar, Valve can release a game with a 3 on it.

1263
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And YYR concludes with this.

1264
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Don't worry, super multitasking is coming out next year.

1265
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Things are going to turn around.

1266
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Woo!

1267
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
That's true.

1268
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
At least we have something to look forward to on Steam and possibly other stores.

1269
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I really wish, though, like, I don't know how hard it is to publish, like, on the PlayStation platforms anymore.

1270
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:43,000
But I really wish there was something like, you know, XNA or even, like, the PlayStation Mobile stuff that they had before.

1271
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Because that was, like, really cool to see all that on there.

1272
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And I know that there's a lot of garbage on Steam.

1273
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But I think if they just had some way to better review everything, like, a lot of that would be kind of pointed out.

1274
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And a lot of the stuff that comes out nowadays you assume is working, and it's just, like, it's straight up broken.

1275
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Like, if there's some sort of moderation to get that shit off the storefront, if it's literally not working, then that should be taken down.

1276
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, I haven't gotten a booster pack in over a year.

1277
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I know it's RNG, but that seems ridiculous to me.

1278
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I maybe get one every two or three months.

1279
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah, I rarely see them pop up either.

1280
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Remember, though, if you're not logging into Steam once a week, you're not eligible.

1281
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:30,000
But with all the, you know, Elder Scrolls games that Alan's been playing, I'm sure he's refreshing his eligibility.

1282
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So that's interesting.

1283
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Let's see, YYR says, supposedly anyone can publish on PlayStation Network, but you have to have a dev kit.

1284
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Same thing on Nintendo platforms. Xbox One requires approval.

1285
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Anyway, thank you for the side discussion. Unscripted. Unlisted.

1286
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Let's get into some rapid-fire news. Loki.

1287
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Alright. So, remember when the last Assassin's Creed game, or, I'm sorry, the kind of update to Assassin's Creed?

1288
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
They did, like, the remaster during the Ezio collection.

1289
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And one of the, there's a video out there with some of the strange NPCs, because they kind of randomly generate.

1290
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And there's, it just like, you know, like, they had a whole problem with rendering faces, you know.

1291
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So one of the things they did this week is they actually patched out the weird NPC face.

1292
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So that's patch 1.02.

1293
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Good, I guess. It's a start.

1294
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:40,000
The other thing that's kind of interesting, the new Call of Duty remaster, Modern Warfare remaster, they're going to be getting more maps into the game.

1295
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
So that's kind of cool, because when it released, the multiplayer maps weren't all there.

1296
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:51,000
So now they're adding some new stuff, including the variety map packs, so you're going to get all the DLC there.

1297
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Also some new game modes, hardpoint, capture point, and gun game.

1298
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
This is going to be pretty awesome.

1299
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And then they're adding the holiday-themed crash, and some more, yeah, six throwback multiplayer maps, they said.

1300
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
So now it should have all of them.

1301
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:21,000
The other thing, though, that they're adding, which probably isn't exactly welcome, is customization items.

1302
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,000
So that means, you know, weapons, reticles, uniforms, camos, and all that stuff.

1303
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:33,000
But they're also adding, basically, DLC loot crates with that stuff.

1304
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So a game that didn't have that before, now they're adding it to it.

1305
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,000
In fact, one of the things that they're adding to the game as well is also female skins, player skins.

1306
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
But you can only unlock them in a loot crate.

1307
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Ooh. That's not a good idea.

1308
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Well, they weren't in the original game, but yeah, I think that's stupid.

1309
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Alright, well, moving on.

1310
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,000
The NES Classic Edition has apparently become the must-have Christmas thing this year.

1311
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Not just for gamers, but for a lot of casual people who grew up in that era.

1312
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
So it's making these NES Classic Editions impossible to find.

1313
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Doesn't help that Nintendo can't do hardware inventories.

1314
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But anyhow, apparently there's going to be one more chance to get an NES Classic Edition.

1315
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It will be in stock at various Best Buys on December 20th.

1316
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
At over 1,000 stores across the United States.

1317
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
But we don't know how many per store or anything like that.

1318
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
But they are saying that the NES Classic Edition will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.

1319
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And the Best Buy stores will have a ticketing process for customers waiting in line.

1320
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
This is coming from, by the way, Best Buy's corporate site.

1321
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
So this is coming from them.

1322
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
This is not a rumor or anything like that.

1323
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Best Buy is saying, yes, we will have them on December 20th, limited to one per customer.

1324
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So good luck if you're going to go do that.

1325
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
You know, Alan asked me, he's like, do you want me to go wait for an NES Classic thing?

1326
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
And I thought it was really sweet that he offered to do that, but I'm just, I have to be honest.

1327
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I was kind of like, I just don't, I mean, if we get one, cool.

1328
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I'll play it. I'll stream with it. It'll be fun, neat.

1329
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
They're cool little devices, I guess.

1330
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
But I'm not feeling the hype that a lot of people are.

1331
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I'm just not.

1332
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:15,000
And actually, this whole limited inventory thing kind of makes me resent it a little bit.

1333
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You know what I mean?

1334
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Like, I just, it makes me want one less.

1335
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Because I'm like, I don't want to buy into all this fucking craziness type of thing.

1336
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:30,000
But anyway, Yooka-Laylee has a release date.

1337
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
You know, Yooka-Laylee that was crowdfunded, right?

1338
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Banjo Kazooie is basically spiritual successor from X Rare Devs, now with a company called Playtonic.

1339
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Apparently a release date has been announced. It's April 11th for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1340
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But guess what? Not happening on the Wii U.

1341
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
That's right.

1342
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I'm not surprised.

1343
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Unforeseen technical issues preventing the release on the Wii U.

1344
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
So if you back the game for the Wii U version, you can change your pledge to any of the other versions for free.

1345
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Also, you can wait for the Switch port.

1346
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
So they are looking into doing a Switch port instead.

1347
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
You could switch your Wii U over to a Switch version in 2017.

1348
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Wii U backers for the game will be messaged on how to change the pledges.

1349
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You can also get a straight up refund if you're that mad about the cancellation on Wii U.

1350
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:25,000
But it seems logical that, you know, getting cancelled in favor of the Switch, not too surprising.

1351
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:31,000
By the way, rumors going around that same thing is about to happen to Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night.

1352
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:39,000
So that game on track, excuse me, sneezes are horrible when you're doing radio. Sorry about that.

1353
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:46,000
The game is still supposed to be coming out in 2018, but will the Wii U still be connected to your TV in 2018?

1354
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
No, that will not be coming out on the Wii U, I guarantee it.

1355
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,000
So yeah, rumor is that that is going to be the next one that's going to jump ship over to the Switch.

1356
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
But again, if you're a Nintendo loyalist, I'm sure you're going to be getting a Switch anyway.

1357
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:07,000
So it's probably not too hard to get upset, because hey, at least that means you'll get the desktop, the console, and the portable version on the Switch.

1358
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So there is that.

1359
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
A couple more from Dark Sakura.

1360
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Well, for our people who are still playing Minecraft, there's going to be a Fallout themed area with costumes and everything coming.

1361
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:30,000
That will come soon on PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U for $5.99.

1362
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Oh, they're actually charging for this. It's kind of weird, because a lot of those paid DLCs that they had on other platforms, like on the Wii U, they were like free.

1363
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Yeah, but like the Mass Effect one wasn't free.

1364
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Yeah, it was.

1365
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
What?

1366
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
On the Wii U. Yeah, that's weird.

1367
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Oh, on the Wii U.

1368
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Yeah, because on the Wii U one, my son was playing that, and I was like, wait, I didn't buy any of those.

1369
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Your son did it when you weren't like that.

1370
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
No, he didn't buy any of those either, but it was just offered.

1371
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:01,000
But it'll also have a different sandbox area with different objectives to complete, like a mini-campaign.

1372
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And also, there is a Kickstarter that is, it looks like they've got 26 days to go, called In the Line of Fire, which is a 3D first person shooter for the Dreamcast, yes, for the Dreamcast.

1373
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:28,000
And it looks like their goal is to raise $45,000. They are at $6,191 as of this moment.

1374
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
And it's being developed by Militia Studios.

1375
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:40,000
So, if you want a new Dreamcast game, well, if you do 20 bucks, you get your name in the credits.

1376
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
If you pay 50, you get the game.

1377
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:48,000
So, yay. It looks like a Dreamcast game.

1378
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:54,000
But that's not necessary. I get a kick out of these whole, like, we're going to develop for an old system type of thing.

1379
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
It seems like the Dreamcast still has a lot of love, you know?

1380
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
It does, but at the same time, you know, sometimes you just gotta let it go.

1381
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Let it go, let it go.

1382
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I should go, I should go.

1383
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Things I can't wait to leave behind in 2016. I actually should have been left behind in 2015.

1384
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Anyhow, how about what's in stores this week, Loki?

1385
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
As if probably not a lot, right?

1386
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Not a whole ton. There is actually some stuff.

1387
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So, this will be pretty much the last releases you get for this year.

1388
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So, starting off, HTC Vive is getting their version of Eagle Flight.

1389
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Halo Wars Definitive Edition coming to PC and Xbox One.

1390
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Shantae Half-G Hero on PC, PlayStation 4, Vita, Wii U, and Xbox One.

1391
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:45,000
The Walking Dead Season 3 Episode 1 and 2, The Ties That Bind.

1392
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:52,000
That's going to be coming out on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and mobile.

1393
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Wild Guns Reloaded on PlayStation 4.

1394
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Don Bradman Cricket 17 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1395
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And finally, Roller Coaster Dreams on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR.

1396
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Over in Japan, things don't seem to be slowing down this week.

1397
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
There's still quite a few releases on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1398
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Steep gets its Japanese release. That's the extreme skiing game.

1399
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Skiing, snowboarding.

1400
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Yeah, extreme winter weather type sports.

1401
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Extreme jumping off a mountain.

1402
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Steep Mountains, get it? So, Steep is coming out in Japan.

1403
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
It's not about making tea.

1404
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
No, it is not about making tea.

1405
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Steep is coming out in Japan this week.

1406
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Also a game called Fushigi no Gensokuyo T.O.D Reloaded.

1407
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
It comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.

1408
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
A Sherlock Holmes game on the PlayStation 4.

1409
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
The Devil's Daughter comes out this week in Japan as well.

1410
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And I think an accessory here, this is a real arcade pro 5, like an arcade fighting stick,

1411
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
which looks like it's pretty heavy duty quality.

1412
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
That is out on the PlayStation 4 this week as well.

1413
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
The Vita isn't slowing down.

1414
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
That same Fushigi no Gensokuyo game is out there as well.

1415
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Also, Hatsuru Kotonaki Miriyori comes out this week.

1416
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Kenkakimi Momoyo Tsuzuri comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.

1417
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And Haru Kannaru Toki no Naka Day 6 Gensou Rondo comes out this week on the Vita as well.

1418
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Because the Vita in Japan ain't dead.

1419
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
In fact, there's still lots of releases every week.

1420
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
And in Japan this week, I'm excited for this, the Sega 3D Collection.

1421
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
There's a 3D Collection Part 3 coming out this week in Japan.

1422
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
That looks like, I'm trying to see what it has.

1423
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
It looks like it has Outrun, or at least one of the Outrun games.

1424
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I can't tell which one, I thought Outrun was in a previous one.

1425
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
One of the After Burner games, Sonic the Hedgehog.

1426
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,000
So there's quite a few of these more, oh actually there they are, it's on the box.

1427
01:41:50,000 --> 01:42:00,000
After Burner 2, Alien Syndrome, Sonic 2, Super Hang-On, Gunstar Heroes, Bare Knuckle 2, Thunder Force 3, Columns, and Turbo Outrun.

1428
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
All getting the 3D treatment in this latest collection.

1429
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And if you need to catch up, there's a triple pack coming out in Japan.

1430
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
So check that out.

1431
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Also on the 3DS this week, Osomatsu-san Matsumatsuri comes out in a regular and limited edition.

1432
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And last but not least, Momotaru Densetsu 2017 Tachigare Nippon.

1433
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It's a train game from Nintendo on the 3DS.

1434
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
But we don't ever get those train games over here for whatever reason.

1435
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

1436
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
From the UK we have only a handful of things.

1437
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
We have Halo Wars Definitive Edition for Xbox One and PC.

1438
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
And perfect for Playstation 4.

1439
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That's it.

1440
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Alright, how about the mailbag?

1441
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Oh shit, I didn't open the mailbag, hold on.

1442
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Way to go Dark Sakura.

1443
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Alright, well every week Dark Sakura prepares well in advance to open up our mailbag.

1444
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Which you can participate with by sending an email.

1445
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com

1446
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag, dive in head first and read some emails that she deems worthy of her presence.

1447
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
One of them is in Farsi, I'm deleting it.

1448
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
It's probably spam if it's in India.

1449
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
It is.

1450
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Okay, that's- Farsi is not India.

1451
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
What?

1452
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Farsi is in India.

1453
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I said it's spam.

1454
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
But you said if it's from India.

1455
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Oh, I don't- whatever.

1456
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Did I say that?

1457
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I said if it's spam.

1458
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Okay.

1459
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Dear OrangeloungeRadio, thanks for the anime recommendations.

1460
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I have seen a good amount of anime like Trigun, Sonic X, does that count?

1461
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:50,000
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Detective Conan Bleach, Rurouni Kenshin and Naruto.

1462
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I like anime that don't have too much fan service or too much violence.

1463
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Anyway, I would like to ask this.

1464
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Do you have any characters you want to see in the new Marvel vs. Capcom game?

1465
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Also, which two companies do you think should do a crossover fighting game?

1466
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Thanks for the anime recommendations and I hope Dark Sakura gets well.

1467
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Oh, thank you.

1468
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Sincerely, Jose.

1469
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I want Sakura in all the games and Morse Tritor hear you.

1470
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I mean, that always makes me happy.

1471
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Oh, so characters you want in Marvel vs. Capcom.

1472
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I want Devalot.

1473
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm still hung up on the new cross game.

1474
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Which I just want another Capcom vs. N2K.

1475
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Is that too much to ask?

1476
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
I mean, that's what I really want.

1477
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I mean, yes, I know we've already had it, but I want another one.

1478
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:39,000
How about a straight up- and I guess this would really be just Smash Brothers,

1479
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
but how about a straight up Nintendo vs. Sega?

1480
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Come on, make all our dreams come true.

1481
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Fighting, well, we kind of had that with Smash.

1482
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Or put some of the TurboGrafx characters in there too,

1483
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
like Keith Courage and Bonk and a pinball table.

1484
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
How about Hudson vs. Sammy?

1485
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Well, here's the thing.

1486
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Who owns all that shit now?

1487
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Konami.

1488
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:03,000
So the fighting game could be everybody kills Konami.

1489
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Whatevs.

1490
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
How about that?

1491
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Come on, everybody kills Konami.

1492
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Alright.

1493
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Including Konami.

1494
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Everybody vs. Konami.

1495
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Come on, tell me you wouldn't play that.

1496
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I would play it.

1497
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Everybody vs. Konami.

1498
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:24,000
But, I think though, there's plenty of Marvel characters that I would love to see.

1499
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I just want Jessica Jones to show up in the fighting game.

1500
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
She probably will, to be honest.

1501
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I could see them doing that.

1502
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Well, especially since the Netflix series was so successful,

1503
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I think that people need to actually go in and read the comics.

1504
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Because I want a comic version of her.

1505
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
You know, with husband Luke Cage and everything.

1506
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I think they still might.

1507
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Especially since they're going to have the hole because of the X-Men.

1508
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And then Defenders coming up.

1509
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
It would make a lot of sense to have Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, X-Men.

1510
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Punisher.

1511
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Let's get Punisher in there.

1512
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
How about we just have a Defenders beat him up.

1513
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
And like, sarcasm can be one of her side powers.

1514
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Ant-Man would be pretty awesome.

1515
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
What?

1516
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Ant-Man.

1517
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
What about from the Capcom side?

1518
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I feel like a lot of that's already been represented.

1519
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Because my brain kind of goes, Frank West.

1520
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Oh wait, he was in the last one.

1521
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Well, clearly my first pick is going to be Bad Box Mega Man.

1522
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Because that was totally what I was looking forward to in the last game.

1523
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
That was like, hey, you know what?

1524
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
When I said I want Mega Man, that's exactly what I meant.

1525
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Exactly. Thank you, Capcom. You're awesome.

1526
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I want Devilot.

1527
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
How about the dude from Bionic Commando?

1528
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
He was already in there.

1529
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Was he in there?

1530
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
He was in the last one.

1531
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I am playing FMVC3.

1532
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
But you know who Devilot is?

1533
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Yeah.

1534
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I want her in there with Super 8.

1535
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
And, uh, fuck, there was, uh...

1536
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Tabasa from Red Earth.

1537
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Fifth Dream in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com suggests Dead or Alive vs Soul Calibur.

1538
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
It's been a while since we've had a...

1539
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
That would be fun.

1540
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
It's been a while since we've had a Soul Calibur game, hasn't it?

1541
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
That would be fun.

1542
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Well, we've had Soul Calibur characters show up in...

1543
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Well, I mean, there's just Yoshimitsu showed up in Tekken.

1544
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
No, Yoshimitsu showed up in the Soul Calibur series.

1545
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
He was from Tekken.

1546
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
But we've had that level of crossover.

1547
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
But I would want to see...

1548
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I mean, I would just like to see Mugen released public with DLC packs.

1549
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Oh, my God.

1550
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I mean, it would be, though, fun, don't you think?

1551
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
And have it be, you know, have it be balanced?

1552
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Yeah, you know what?

1553
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Soul Calibur 5 in 2012 was the last Soul Calibur game.

1554
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
That's what I thought.

1555
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I was like, I don't think they ever did a Soul Calibur 6.

1556
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:54,000
And that was the one with Ezio from Assassin's Creed was the little character that was a bonus in that game.

1557
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But here's the thing.

1558
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
They did do the Soul Calibur Lost Swords, that PlayStation Network free-to-play game.

1559
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
There was that in 2014.

1560
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
That was fucking terrible.

1561
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Yeah.

1562
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
That was a fucking terrible game.

1563
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I want to see a new Soul Calibur game with Travis Touchdown as the guest character.

1564
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Because that would be awesome.

1565
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
So, yeah, I'm all for a new Soul Calibur game.

1566
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
How about that?

1567
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Soul Calibur versus Soul Calibur.

1568
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
My brain just had like a weird image that popped up into it.

1569
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
What was that?

1570
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And it has nothing to do with fighting games, but it does have to do with Konami.

1571
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
The 2DX DJ dating sim.

1572
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Didn't they have a dating sim like Brooktown or something like that was called on PSP?

1573
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
They tried to put it out here.

1574
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
It just didn't really...

1575
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I remember when we were hyping that and I was like, I don't give a shit.

1576
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I was just thinking like maybe have like some of the DJs from 2DX's fighting characters.

1577
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
And I was like, no, that'd be more a dating sim.

1578
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
But they can be in Everybody Kills Konami.

1579
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Yeah.

1580
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
They could show up as an assist or something.

1581
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Yeah.

1582
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Or they're just playing the sweet beats in the background.

1583
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Could be.

1584
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Could be.

1585
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
But they would have to get killed because everybody kills Konami.

1586
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
So.

1587
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Alright.

1588
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Anyway.

1589
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Maybe just be everyone rolls over the Konami headquarters in a tank.

1590
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Alright.

1591
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
That's it for our emails.

1592
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
But you can email us as well.

1593
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Sorry.

1594
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
5th Dream in chat.

1595
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Winner with this comment.

1596
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Beat Mani.

1597
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Beat Mania.

1598
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
It is.

1599
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Alright.

1600
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
A whole new version.

1601
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Anyway.

1602
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
That's it for the emails this week.

1603
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1604
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Remember.

1605
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Next week is the holiday spectacular.

1606
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
So I would like to get some season's greetings from y'all.

1607
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Especially if you have never emailed the show before.

1608
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
It's time.

1609
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
This is time.

1610
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Just send an email that says I exist.

1611
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Or something.

1612
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Just so we hear from some people that I know are out there listening.

1613
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I want a letter in Esperanto so I can read it.

1614
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Allowed.

1615
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
In Esperanto.

1616
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Oh you want people to email you in Esperanto.

1617
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Don't make it too complicated or nobody's going to email.

1618
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Because Esperanto sounds interesting but I don't really know how to pronounce much of anything.

1619
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
You can email.

1620
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
That doesn't stop me from doing Japanese release dates.

1621
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
You can email us in whatever language you like.

1622
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
But it has to be romanized because I can't necessarily read it.

1623
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Alright.

1624
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Let's get back into some news.

1625
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Loki.

1626
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Alright.

1627
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
So they're doing some enhancements to Twitch live streaming.

1628
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
One of the things that they're doing is automating moderation in chat rooms.

1629
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
So it's this automod thing.

1630
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:20,000
It's supposed to allow for I guess nicer chat rooms if you will.

1631
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Or more positive chat rooms is the way they're going about it.

1632
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:33,000
So it's a new tool for Twitch streamers that employs machine learning and natural language processing to identify and block inappropriate content from appearing in chat.

1633
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Which really needs to be in all of...

1634
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
What if I like inappropriate content?

1635
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
And I'm sure you can turn it off.

1636
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Because it is an option that you can set on your page.

1637
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
You don't have to.

1638
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
You can opt into it.

1639
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
So if you don't want to opt into it then by all means you don't have to opt into it.

1640
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I would like the opposite.

1641
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
It just filters out all positive comment.

1642
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I want it just to be nasty.

1643
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Nasty stuff.

1644
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Yeah it seems like Twitch has been doing a lot of changes.

1645
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
There isn't just that.

1646
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I suppose we should mention they launched the whole IRL category this week.

1647
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Did you hear about that?

1648
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
There's a new category they call IRL.

1649
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Which made me think, oh this Justin TV thing has gone full circle, hasn't it?

1650
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:22,000
But apparently they don't want it to be like cameras while you're sleeping and just like live casting.

1651
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
But they want it to be like if you want to interact with your audience.

1652
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Like you're just like, hi I want to do a question and answer with my audience.

1653
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Basically playroom streams is what it sounds like to me.

1654
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Which I thought that they had banned.

1655
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,000
But I'm assuming then they want to do playroom streams without the nudity and the truth or dare and all that stuff that was happening.

1656
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Without all the interesting stuff.

1657
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Exactly.

1658
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Just you know, people answering questions and stuff like that.

1659
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I don't know.

1660
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Have you guys checked that out?

1661
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Tigerclaw is even talking about that in our chat room.

1662
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I was going to ask if you guys have checked that out.

1663
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Tigerclaw says non-gamers can broadcast on it.

1664
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Basically what they used to do when they were Justin TV.

1665
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
What's funny though is that they actually have an FAQ and one of the FAQs is.

1666
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:07,000
So is Twitch just going back to being Justin TV and they said no because you know.

1667
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Or they didn't really say like no but they said that's not the intent.

1668
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Like it was a different intent and that this is really about interactive.

1669
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Interactive is the key thing.

1670
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
And I remember in the early days of Justin TV.

1671
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Because we used to stream this show on Justin TV before there was a Twitch.

1672
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
And I remember at the time we were with All Games Radio and Scott from All Games got really into this.

1673
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I think he did a live cast at E3 and all this stuff I remember.

1674
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
But it was very much like watch me walk around.

1675
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
And Scott was always very good about doing the interaction.

1676
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
He totally got that.

1677
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
The way we really like it here and the way Bobby's done it with his show for years.

1678
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
So I think if you wanted him to go to a certain booth at E3 or something you'd do it.

1679
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
And that was kind of like the interaction.

1680
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
But there was a lot of people on Justin TV that would just point the camera at themselves.

1681
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
They're sleeping and like very mundane stuff.

1682
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
But I guess like Big Brother and that type of stuff is popular so there's people that watch it.

1683
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Who knows.

1684
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:12,000
And at Tigerclaw also pointing out Twitch will let people broadcast live from their phones too.

1685
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
And that's going to be a big part of the IRL thing.

1686
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
So I think it's kind of like taking on Periscope is what it sounds like to me.

1687
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
It really sounds like it's trying to take on Periscope in that regard.

1688
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
But we'll see.

1689
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Anyhow moving on.

1690
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Let's talk about Mega Man.

1691
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Oh my god a new Mega Man came? I am so excited.

1692
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Well no temper those expectations significantly.

1693
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Apparently a recent article in Famitsu Magazine states that all six NES original games are being re-released on January 6th.

1694
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Woo that's awesome.

1695
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
For iOS and Android.

1696
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
That's not awesome.

1697
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:54,000
It's not a bundle. They're going to be sold one at a time.

1698
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Cheat codes though, auto fire, auto charge and all that stuff are in.

1699
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And there will be some type of Rockman Unity app where you can get rewards like wallpaper and like silly things.

1700
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,000
And so yeah that is all coming out in Japan on mobile phones.

1701
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,000
And I really can't see how this is going to be any fun at all because there's no controllers on phones.

1702
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:18,000
But I feel like didn't they already have Mega Man games here in the states?

1703
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Like I thought they released some already and they weren't very good.

1704
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I don't know but yeah I could totally see a game that requires such precision to be released on mobile and have totally nothing wrong with it.

1705
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Now what is this all leading up to? Apparently a new Mega Man mobile game to tie into the new TV show being released next year.

1706
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Wow those are two things I really don't care about.

1707
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
That's right I keep forgetting that that new TV show is coming out.

1708
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
And god it looks terrible just from the screenshots.

1709
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:53,000
And god a game based on that on mobile. Man they totally understand the Mega Man franchise and all the key components that make a great Mega Man game.

1710
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Not the way to do it.

1711
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Not the way to do it.

1712
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Crappy design, crappy interface, crappy gameplay. I'm on board.

1713
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And by the way.

1714
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
You know what? I think it's going to be greater than Pokemon Go. You watch.

1715
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Sure. By the way there was a Mega Man 2 mobile in 2009 and it was pretty bad.

1716
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
And they patched it a bunch and it's still pretty bad.

1717
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
So there you go. Take it or leave it. Apparently I've left it all these years.

1718
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Dark Sakura maybe you have a game we can get more excited about?

1719
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Maybe. It's been a while. Shenmue 3 is actually in its end of development cycle.

1720
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Pre-orders actually already went into effect on the 15th.

1721
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:49,000
But Sezuk-san said that they're at the final stages of development and they're going to have new videos and such after New Year.

1722
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And it should be, well, pretty spectacular. So goes the theory.

1723
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I mean, I would think with today's graphics, it's going to definitely take a lot more realism into the story.

1724
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:11,000
So maybe we'll get more gachapon machines and, you know, space area.

1725
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:19,000
YYR in a chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says Shenmue 3 hype with like 17 Y's in it.

1726
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Yeah.

1727
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Yeah. I guess I'm kind of surprised that this game is already, they're talking about it's being close to done.

1728
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:31,000
That's a pleasant surprise because a lot of these things that Sony announces at E3, we get to wait years and years and years to play.

1729
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Such as, you know, Final Fantasy 15, Last Guardian, although granted we finally got those games this year.

1730
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,000
But I don't think anyone's holding their breath too much about, you know, Final Fantasy 7 Remake or Kingdom Hearts 3.

1731
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Although again, rumors say that the 7 Remake Part 1 is happening next year.

1732
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
And if it's in 15's engine, I guess it's possible. We'll see.

1733
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
There's an iOS game coming out that I'm interested in.

1734
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
What's that?

1735
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
It's the Bible Girl 666 New York Adventure.

1736
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Oh Lord.

1737
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I'm sure it'll be as awesome as Dragopolis.

1738
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
All right. Just a few more stories for you guys.

1739
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

1740
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
But, oh boy, we have some good stories for our last two stories tonight, don't we, Loki?

1741
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Well, everyone's got to get in on the last place, you know, action.

1742
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:25,000
And so, who best to do that than Brazzers, the purveyors of such fine porn parodies.

1743
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Like, they had a new Final Fantasy 15 when they had literally nothing to do with Final Fantasy 15.

1744
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Yeah, it's called something like getting the car repaired.

1745
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
They don't even call it, like, Final Fuck 15 or something that ties into it.

1746
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
It's something about, like, stopping for repairs.

1747
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
It has, like, yeah, like, a Sydney...

1748
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Of course, Rama knows. Gas station special.

1749
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Thank you, Rama, who is the first chatterer to chime in with that.

1750
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Guess what that makes you, Rama?

1751
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Just kidding.

1752
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
The winner.

1753
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
That's right, the winner.

1754
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Yeah, so they have, like, that with a Sydney knockoff and she fights some random, like, monster looking thing, which is stupid.

1755
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
But, yeah, so they're purveyors of such wonderful things.

1756
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
But they're also going to be doing a Let's Play channel.

1757
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
So they've got, I guess, their C4 channel.

1758
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Sorry, Dark Tetsuya says it's full service station.

1759
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Full service station.

1760
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
That sounds... Oh, I think Rama got it wrong.

1761
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
So, Dark Tetsuya, you know what that makes you?

1762
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
The winner.

1763
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Who wants some full service?

1764
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,000
So they have a YouTube channel called Trends with two Zs.

1765
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:37,000
And they have adult film stars also doing Let's Plays on games.

1766
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So one of the first games that they played on there was Mafia III.

1767
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:45,000
And, yeah, you can go check it out and watch them play a game.

1768
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Apparently, one of the porn stars, Nikki Benz, is actually quite...

1769
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Or, I'm sorry, actually not...

1770
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Missy Martinez is actually quite a gamer.

1771
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
She even has, was it her gamer name?

1772
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Bones and Silicone is her gamer tag.

1773
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So, I don't know.

1774
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Do you think we could get somebody on the show?

1775
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
No, probably not.

1776
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Do you think we could get one of the girls on the show?

1777
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Why not? It's to promote their channel.

1778
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
I doubt it.

1779
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
What do you guys think? Should I send an email?

1780
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Like, that's like saying, like, you can.

1781
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
But, I mean, I don't think that they need much promotion.

1782
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
People know who they are.

1783
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
So, I'm sorry, I've never seen your work before.

1784
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Who are you?

1785
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
To be fair, I have no idea who they are.

1786
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
If that's, you know, and we all know why.

1787
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I have no idea who they are.

1788
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Maybe I'd like to, you know, talk about being a gamer with her.

1789
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Why not?

1790
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
It's just like any other occupation.

1791
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
So, they play games.

1792
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Thank you. Thank you, chatters.

1793
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Make it happen. Why the hell not?

1794
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Do it. Take a chance.

1795
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Fifth Dream says, I don't know who they are and I watch tons of porn.

1796
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I've heard of Nikki Benz.

1797
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I just couldn't say, like, you couldn't show me a video, like,

1798
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
random video of a bunch of different actresses and then be like,

1799
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
oh, yeah, that's Nikki Benz.

1800
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I don't know who she is.

1801
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
You wouldn't be able to identify her in a lineup.

1802
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I just recognize the name.

1803
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
DarkSakura, would you be down for interviewing a streamer,

1804
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
a let's player here on the show?

1805
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Sure.

1806
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Why not?

1807
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Why not?

1808
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
All right, I'm going to send an email.

1809
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
We'll see what happens.

1810
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:23,000
We have one more story to talk about tonight and I thought we could end on a local note.

1811
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:28,000
And I thought to end on a local note, we could talk about the Florida of Sacramento.

1812
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I'm talking about Rocklin.

1813
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
You all know Rocklin.

1814
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
You locals know Rocklin.

1815
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
It's somewhere between here and Tahoe.

1816
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
We're going to talk about Rocklin, which, by the way, in 2013,

1817
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
why do we call Rocklin the Florida of Sacramento?

1818
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,000
This is the same place where – what was this in 2013?

1819
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:51,000
The teenager, her parents wouldn't let her access the Internet after 10 p.m.

1820
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So, she drugged them with sleeping medicine so that she could get on the Internet.

1821
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
That was all over social media.

1822
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
That came out of Rocklin.

1823
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Well, guess what happened this week, y'all, in Rocklin?

1824
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Kevin Lee Coe went on a spending spree after stealing $4.8 million from his employers.

1825
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,000
So, I guess he was busted this week.

1826
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
And here's the thing that makes this gaming related.

1827
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:27,000
$1 million of that $4.8 million he spent on Game of War.

1828
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
That's right, the smartphone game, Game of War.

1829
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Federal prosecutors are saying that Kevin Lee Coe, the alleged perpetrator in this incident,

1830
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:42,000
spent $1 million back on that mobile phone game, Game of War.

1831
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:49,000
On Thursday this week, the 45-year-old Rocklin resident pleaded guilty to money laundering

1832
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:57,000
and wire fraud after being accused of embezzling the funds from his employer, Holt of California.

1833
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,000
So, you got to think, Game of War made a million dollars off this one individual.

1834
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And that was –

1835
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
That's quite a whale.

1836
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
That was dirty money.

1837
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
That was dirty money.

1838
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:13,000
My pal Alan is walking into the studio who brought this news to my attention this week

1839
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,000
and actually suggested the name that Rocklin is the Florida of Sacramento, right?

1840
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Yes.

1841
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
So, what did you want to say on this?

1842
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I'm just wondering what skin was he going for where he was opening up the random box.

1843
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
He's like, fucking give me the legendary skin for the character.

1844
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
And he just spent – he did that to the tune of a million dollars.

1845
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I'm surprised.

1846
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I think I know people that did that with Overwatch this past week who may or may not have embezzled the money.

1847
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
No, I'm kidding.

1848
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Shush.

1849
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Yeah, but anyway.

1850
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Did you spend money on Overwatch?

1851
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I may have given it $10.

1852
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Oh, my God.

1853
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Alan 2?

1854
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
And you think you know people.

1855
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
You think you know people.

1856
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Did you get the skin you wanted at least?

1857
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
One of them.

1858
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
One of them.

1859
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Which one?

1860
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Alan, which one?

1861
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
He's thinking.

1862
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
The Pharah one.

1863
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
The Pharah one.

1864
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Congratulate.

1865
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I don't even know what the Pharah skin is.

1866
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
She's one of my favorite people.

1867
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
All right.

1868
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
There you go.

1869
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
So, we'll see what happens in a future week coming out of Rocklin.

1870
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
But isn't it always fun to end on a local story?

1871
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
These things are happening right in our backyard.

1872
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Anyway, I need to open up the Skype line.

1873
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I still don't have Skype even up here in studio, but I'm opening it up right now.

1874
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
And once it's up, you can give us a call at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1875
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:34,000
In the meantime, let me check with my co-hosts and see if anyone has a last minute story they want to go over.

1876
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
No.

1877
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
No.

1878
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
No?

1879
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
No.

1880
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I have donuts that I want to go over.

1881
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Donuts?

1882
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
You brought donuts?

1883
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
No, but I want one.

1884
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Oh, well that helps me right now.

1885
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Or Pinkberry.

1886
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I haven't had Pinkberry in a while.

1887
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Somebody needs to fill time because I haven't logged into the Skype account yet.

1888
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Well, whose fault is that, Rob?

1889
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Then again, I guess it's fair since I didn't have the mailbag open, so whatevs.

1890
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Yeah, this is the night where nothing's open.

1891
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Well, it's because of the holiday season you're not supposed to open things until Christmas.

1892
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
You've been hitting the eggnog already.

1893
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
No, I haven't.

1894
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
That's the problem.

1895
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Okay, now the Skype line is open.

1896
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I'm logged in.

1897
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
So, there it is.

1898
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1899
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Alright, well if you guys don't have last minute stories, then I actually think I have a couple here I can go over.

1900
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:24,000
One of them has to do with Final Fantasy XV and some information about some of the DLC that's coming out for Final Fantasy XV.

1901
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
You can, of course, get the season pass that's available now to get all of this DLC.

1902
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
This is not about the holiday update.

1903
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
They did release some information about that and I was kind of like, eh.

1904
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
But this is something different, actually.

1905
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Apparently, they're bringing back Gilgamesh, which is a classic Final Fantasy villain.

1906
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I think it goes back to V.

1907
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Yay, Gilgamesh.

1908
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I don't know if it goes back.

1909
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,000
It has a hilarious cameo in Final Fantasy XIV, one of the better stories in XIV.

1910
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
But anyway, Gilgamesh is going to be in the Final Fantasy XV DLC.

1911
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
He will be in specifically episode Gladiolus, which is, of course, going to be about Gladio.

1912
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:06,000
And I'm assuming, again, it's spoilery, but how do I word this without being a spoiler?

1913
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I'm going to choose my words carefully.

1914
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,000
There's a segment of the game where this DLC would make sense.

1915
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I'll say that. That's it.

1916
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:24,000
So that's apparently what's going to fill in here where there is a conflict with the popular Final Fantasy antagonist, Gilgamesh.

1917
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And Gilgamesh will only be seen in this episode.

1918
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
There will be areas that you otherwise can't get to.

1919
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And this is going to be the first season pass episode, so check that out.

1920
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Let's see, Gilgamesh not just in Final Fantasy V, but also in VIII, IX, XI, XII, and XIV, and also a lot of the side games.

1921
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I did not realize Gilgamesh was in Final Fantasy VI Advance.

1922
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Huh. Go figure.

1923
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,000
So anyway, we'll see what he looks like in Final Fantasy XV.

1924
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Let's put out another call for calls.

1925
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Oh, did Skype lock up?

1926
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Skype may have locked up on me, and that way explains why no calls are coming in right now.

1927
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Okay.

1928
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Thank you, Skype.

1929
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Awkward.

1930
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Yeah, Skype is not responding. I'm going to hope that this doesn't kill the show when I do this.

1931
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Let's not kill the show, because we like being alive.

1932
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Yeah, I know. I'm a little worried.

1933
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
That's the joy of live radio.

1934
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Okay, shows were still streaming, and I was more worried about the recording getting stopped midway.

1935
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Okay, I'm going to try Skype one more time.

1936
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Okay, YYR says he's trying to call in and it's coming up as busy.

1937
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Sorry, I launched Skype and it decided to promptly freeze, so I'm going to try this one more time.

1938
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Well, I'll leave everyone with some wisdom.

1939
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Do you know what society needs more of?

1940
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Bathing in the blood of your enemies.

1941
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
It's good protein.

1942
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
What is wrong with you?

1943
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
And it's good exfoliating.

1944
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
What is actually wrong with you?

1945
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
You're just now asking this?

1946
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Skype is showing up again, so give it another try. We'll see what happens.

1947
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Okay, it just lit up and then it went away, but I know people are trying to call in at least.

1948
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Alright, let's get to a call.

1949
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Hi, you're on Orange Town Radio. Who's this?

1950
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Hi, it's Aaron, YYR.

1951
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Hi, Aaron. You got through. We fixed Skype. What's up, buddy?

1952
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Yes, I did.

1953
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Well, speaking of bathing in the blood of your enemies and the last story, it's just like I was saying, I mean, it's just like Satan was saying a few weeks ago.

1954
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,000
It's really easy to go through a million dollars in Game of War. It really is.

1955
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I have never played Game of War, and I'm very happy to say that, although perhaps I should not judge, because I have probably spent $40 on Pokemon Go.

1956
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Yeah, but here's the thing. The buy button in Game of War can spend $100 at one time.

1957
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Oh my god, that's just too much.

1958
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
And Pikachu's not even in it!

1959
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Yeah, right? You can't get that skin. What's the point, right?

1960
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Have you played it?

1961
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Actually, the main reason I called, honestly, I think this Super Mario Run business is one of the most interesting gaming stories of the year.

1962
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
How so?

1963
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Well, you look at how Nintendo launched this game and how they were really trying to be all, well, we're not gonna stoop to their level.

1964
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:35,000
We're not gonna take the predatory stance and look for whales and, you know, suck as much money out of people as possible.

1965
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:42,000
We're gonna do it with this one $10 purchase, and you have the whole game, and you're good.

1966
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:49,000
But, you know what, it's like, sometimes it doesn't matter what you're saying as much as how you're saying it.

1967
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Because we've all seen those things where they show you two different ways to ask a survey question and how the results differed.

1968
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:05,000
And so, here's the thing. The language of the App Store is, if you see a price, that's what the app costs.

1969
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:11,000
If you see free, it costs nothing. If you see get, it's probably free to play, right?

1970
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Right, because I was gonna say that Apple changed that language, God, probably like four years ago just because of that stuff.

1971
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,000
So that if it doesn't say free on Super Mario Run, it says get.

1972
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Exactly. And over the last couple of years especially, we've pretty much been trained to understand that get means it's free to play with optional in-app purchases.

1973
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:41,000
So, now here's the thing. They did explain in the description what the deal was, but nobody reads.

1974
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
No.

1975
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:51,000
So, everyone goes and downloads this thing, and they play the first three courses, and then they hit the paywall.

1976
02:09:51,000 --> 02:10:00,000
And they're like, what is this? This is a bait and switch. This is anti-consumer. One star, uninstall, I'm out.

1977
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:12,000
And that has led to the two and a half average star rating on iTunes with more people voting one star than any other rating because...

1978
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:17,000
That happens to a lot of apps, though, to be fair. Pokemon Go probably had the same thing when they turned off the tracker.

1979
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I don't think so.

1980
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:27,000
It's crazy. I do kind of think Nintendo should have just put a $10 charge on the game. Done. I would have supported if they just didn't have a free demo.

1981
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
And a free demo in addition. A separate app.

1982
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Yeah. I mean, it used to be done. You would see so-and-so and so-and-so Lite.

1983
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Maybe a so-and-so Lite 30 days later or something. I think they could have just made a ton of money if they just sold a $10 app day one.

1984
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Exactly. But the other thing I think is wrong with Super Mario Run as far as execution is the fact that they made a score attack game.

1985
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:06,000
And not like a game where you go and complete courses, which is by and large in 2016, I don't think there are as many people playing games for score as they are for completion.

1986
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Right. Oh, so you're talking about the Toad Run, which is my biggest issue with Super Mario Run is the Toad mode is ridiculous.

1987
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Well, even just the normal mode because the courses are like, what, one, two minutes long?

1988
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
True.

1989
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:29,000
But that's not the point of the game. The point of the game is to get the coins, to improve your score, to get all the secret coins. But so many people don't care about that.

1990
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Yeah.

1991
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I really feel like they just completely missed the mark on what mobile gamers, not even mobile gamers, but I mean every Mario game ever released is like, hey, here's some obstacle courses. Can you get through them? Why such a difference now?

1992
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Kind of following up and piggybacking a little bit on what you said about, you know, the way that the game is being received and all that. Sometimes it's not about, you know, what you say or what you do. It's how it's perceived.

1993
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:10,000
That is, that is so much of what happens just, God, anywhere on the internet. I mean, how does fake news spread the way it does is becomes such a buzzword in our society because people perceive it one way and want it to be true or don't want it to be true.

1994
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:16,000
So it suddenly becomes fact and perception becomes fact. The reason why we all know the internet is terrible.

1995
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:35,000
The reason why I say all that is because, and I know people are not going to agree with me and that's fine, but when you pay the $10 for a game and then it says, and you're going to get these 20 extra tickets for the toad run mode and you're going to get these coins and you're going to get this special question mark block for your village and stuff.

1996
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,000
That's all the type of shit I would expect to see in a free to play game.

1997
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Yeah, it does look a little weird.

1998
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Now I'm left to wonder, am I going to get nickeled and dimed after this $10 thing? And I bet that's what a lot of people are, where a lot of people are really getting mad because they feel like they're going to get nickeled and dimed, even though they're not.

1999
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:07,000
They're not, they're not selling those toad tickets or whatever, but just the way they did. And even the way like you have the mine Nintendo coins and you can trade in what, 300 mine Nintendo coins for what? A fucking gold statue.

2000
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:14,000
And like these really silly things, right? It's like, it's like the worst parts of the free to play stuff are still there. Does that make sense?

2001
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I know what's also a problem. Nowhere on that purchase screen does it actually explain that that's the whole game. It says it's six worlds, but I mean, yeah, Candy Crush's map, it shows you like the next 50 levels, but it doesn't show you that there's a thousand more behind it.

2002
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:39,000
So you could have people thinking, oh, well, I hit the paywall before the end of world one. Who's to say there won't be another paywall next world?

2003
02:13:39,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Right, right. So the perception is, is pretty huge with this. And I think, yeah, I think, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head, even where I kind of get an issue with it. And you know, obviously, I understand what the rules are. And I, you know, but I just something feels just off in the whole design of that currency and everything. And it kind of just, it kind of just snowballs into why I don't like the game. But at the end of the day, I also I just find I don't like the constant run mechanic. I just don't like it as a Mario game.

2004
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I mean, it's it's it's different. I did manage to play a couple of levels. And then I went back and got like the special the second set of coins in the first course. It's cute. It's interesting. I can see where it would be strategic, but it's just the game is just so fundamentally flawed.

2005
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:42,640
Yeah, I just, I like it, but I don't understand what what the developer was going for here. I don't think it was actually who is a DNA that did it. I just I'm not quite sure what their target audience was and how they felt that they would sell it to the target.

2006
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:53,080
I think there was too much outside influence on this game, I think is what it boils down to. I think too many non gamers had had a say in how this game was going to play out. And I think it shot this game in the foot. I really did.

2007
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:56,240
It almost makes me wonder if this was designed at Nintendo in a boardroom.

2008
02:14:56,640 --> 02:15:08,080
Um, possibly. And it kind of sucks for Miyamoto having to be the face of that. You know what I mean? Because I would bet he probably isn't really to blame for hardly any of this.

2009
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:21,320
You know what, though, as long as he's still eating, I mean, I think that's pretty sweet. You know, like the there were those pictures where he was eating while playing right? Yeah. As long as he's eating something delicious, I think it'll all turn out okay for him.

2010
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:51,280
He'll be fine. Miyamoto is still a gaming legend, and nothing's ever going to take that away. You know what, there's going to be people out there that say, Rob, yyr, you guys are wrong. I'm loving Super Mario Run. And I play well, I'm not saying it's a bad, you know, unpolished, not a quality game. I think it's definitely quality and polished. I just think it's, you know, one of those things where, you know, we don't know who it's for. And, you know, the target, maybe it wasn't quite marketed the right way to the right people kind of thing.

2011
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:54,560
Like this would have gone over better as a 3DS game, I think.

2012
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:58,000
I'm not sure I would have still enjoyed it as 3DS game.

2013
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:02,360
We also probably would have been able to run, you know, not automatically.

2014
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:15,480
Then it's just a Mario game, which isn't a bad thing necessarily. But I think I think I would just rather play Mario Maker at the end of the day. Still a million levels to explore there. Alright, yyr, I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in more calls. But thank you for the call, buddy.

2015
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,560
Hope you guys have a great week. Take care.

2016
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:19,520
Thank you. Have a great holiday if we don't hear from you again.

2017
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:21,920
Enjoy. Yes. Happy holidays.

2018
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:22,440
Take care.

2019
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:23,080
Yep.

2020
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:37,600
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you'd like to call into the show and have your say, you could also try the phone line if you want to try that. 1-877-GAME-OLR is another way to get in on the show as well.

2021
02:16:39,240 --> 02:16:40,600
Wait for those calls to come in.

2022
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:44,720
Which Skype, I know Skype's still working.

2023
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:50,000
Any other last minute stories? Anyone dig something up?

2024
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:58,800
Um, I, no, I don't really, I can't really think of anything. News is just kind of slow and not very interesting right now.

2025
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:06,000
Alright, they're doing a thing on the Humble Bundle with YODcast where they're doing 30 games for 30 bucks. It's all going to charity.

2026
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:10,000
Alright, we got it. We got a call coming in. It came in. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2027
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:17,360
How dare you, like, make fun of people for buying loot boxes on Overwatch. Like, that's so rude.

2028
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:23,840
You know, did you hear the part where I followed it up with, but I'm not one to judge because I spent 40 bucks on Pokemon Go?

2029
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:27,440
No, because it didn't matter. Your damage was already done.

2030
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:31,520
Whatever, Shane. Whatever. Is that all you called in to tell me what a rude ass I am?

2031
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:38,000
Well, I do that regularly anyway, so it's not, like, an important topic to cover on your show.

2032
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:42,560
But I did want to say... When's the next episode of Pokestop Podcast, Shane?

2033
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:45,600
When I feel like it. I'm shiny hunting right now. Don't bother me.

2034
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:50,480
Now who's ringing? I got shinies today, so I was happy. I got, like, two so far.

2035
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:59,040
No, I was calling in to say that I don't have the internet right now, so I've been

2036
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:06,000
playing games that aren't online. Like, I can't play Overwatch, which kills me right now since

2037
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:11,520
it's the holiday event. But it's okay because I opened 82 loot boxes this weekend, so it's fine.

2038
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:15,920
82? How much money for 82 loot boxes?

2039
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,080
Well, some of it. I won myself.

2040
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,000
Okay, so the two. So what was the 80?

2041
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:26,560
Me? No, no, no. There was more than that that I got myself. Thank you. Me and Jim had, like,

2042
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:31,760
an Overwatch Wi-Fi party at his house, so we just played, like, in the same room on different

2043
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:38,560
screens. How come when Jim plays with you, you win loot boxes? Every time I play, we don't win.

2044
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:41,040
Because we're better.

2045
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:44,000
My feelings are hurt. I'm gonna go cry.

2046
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:54,000
No, I was talking to my dad and complaining about how I can't do this Overwatch event. So

2047
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,200
he is sending me $50 for Christmas that I could spend on Overwatch. So I was like,

2048
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:05,280
okay, we'll just do that now. So I bought, I technically bought $60 worth of boxes.

2049
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,440
I knew it. I knew it. So you did dip into your own funds a little bit.

2050
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:16,240
Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Because it was better to do a $20 one versus a $10 one.

2051
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:20,240
What's the paper noise in the background? Are you eating Taco Bell while you're on the call?

2052
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:23,600
No, I'm laying in bed. I don't know what paper noise you're talking about.

2053
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:27,840
Do you guys hear it? It sounds like a paper crinkling noise. Maybe it's just your phone.

2054
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:30,880
Maybe it's your horrible lack of internet phone connection or something like that.

2055
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:31,520
Probably.

2056
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:31,920
I don't know.

2057
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:36,320
Anyway, that's not why I called. And I am excited about those loot boxes, though,

2058
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:38,800
because I only need two more skins. And I've got all the holiday ones.

2059
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:45,120
No, I was calling in because, like I said, I've been playing other games that aren't

2060
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:51,760
internet connected. And so I went back through finally and beat Res Infinite and unlocked Area X,

2061
02:19:51,760 --> 02:20:00,400
which I've had this game since it launched. And I played in VR. And Area X is the most amazing

2062
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:06,080
thing ever. It actually bumped to Res Infinite, which I did not want on a top five list for the

2063
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:11,520
year for me because it's the 700th time it's been re-released with a couple new features.

2064
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:17,360
But I did bump it up to my top five somewhere in there. But I was trying to show it off to

2065
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:23,040
Annie and Jim. And I didn't have my VR hooked up. So I was like, I'll just play with the normal

2066
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:29,840
controller. Had I not played it in VR, I think I hate this game. I do not think it's nearly as good.

2067
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:33,760
But didn't you play non-VR, Loki? Didn't you do that?

2068
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:34,320
I did VR.

2069
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:36,960
Oh, you did? Oh, I haven't done Area X yet.

2070
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:43,360
Area X is amazing in VR. I hate the way it controls outside of VR, though. Because in VR,

2071
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:50,000
you use the stick and your head, you know, in tandem to move around and target things.

2072
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:57,120
You just have the analog stick when you don't have VR. And it's just not as good in any sense.

2073
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:03,040
It feels like it was specifically made for VR. And they tried to find a way to work it

2074
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:06,160
outside of VR. I don't think it works.

2075
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:11,120
I can kind of cut him some slack for that because it is, I mean, Res is really,

2076
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,920
this version of Res, anyway, is really designed to be a VR game.

2077
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:18,960
Especially the fourth boss in the regular game. Oh, my God.

2078
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:23,280
You would think that the rest of it would still translate as well as like the original version

2079
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:25,920
or the remastered 360 version or whatever.

2080
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:30,960
And it may, but it's been so long since I've played a regular Res game without having the VR

2081
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:37,760
that maybe this is the definitive way to play Res now. And it's like, I can't go back because

2082
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:43,440
it feels like I don't have all the control I should have. I don't know.

2083
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,840
But that Area X is amazing. In fact, because I'm just playing Pokemon and listening to your

2084
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:57,120
dumb show, I put Res on traveling and it's just playing on my TV, just like in the one area that

2085
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:01,760
I really like the music for. Just sitting there doing nothing like a screensaver.

2086
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:07,120
Well, how are you going to survive? For how much longer do you have to survive without internet?

2087
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:12,080
Two weeks. I don't know, because I just also...

2088
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:16,800
Target had an error on the Legend of Korra Blu-ray set. It was 15 instead of 50.

2089
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:20,720
And I just already went through that. Like, I've gone through all four seasons already,

2090
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:25,840
and I guess I can go through all four again. That's only eight discs, so it's not that much.

2091
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:30,560
Well, I would try to give you ideas, but you called this show dumb, so I don't want to help you.

2092
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:35,920
Whatever. I do that to everything. And I'm usually right, so it's fine.

2093
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:40,800
Uh, ActDeft in chat says, uh, Darcicar, you're not on.

2094
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,520
Now I am. There you go. And it's awesome because I'm here.

2095
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:49,200
Oh, that's true. Welcome back to the show. Thank you. And I'll still buy your game.

2096
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:52,640
Um, I forgot that. It's like sitting over there near the...

2097
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:56,640
Just let me borrow it first. ActDeft says in chat,

2098
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:59,600
Shane, you lucky bastard. I wanted to take advantage of that. Talking about the, uh,

2099
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:04,080
Korra, I guess, target error thing. Yeah, they're really good at errors. Oh,

2100
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:08,560
here's a good story video game too, because you've got like an hour to kill basically still.

2101
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:15,920
Um, so my friend Danny, like he works out of school and his student was like, I guess,

2102
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:20,240
on his phone or something during class and they were on Amazon and there was this like,

2103
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:25,680
you know how Amazon has, you know, different sellers have storefronts. So it's like you buy

2104
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:31,280
from them, but Amazon fulfills or whatever. I don't know how Amazon works really. But anyway,

2105
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:37,840
so this one storefront had all these different things up for sale, but they were all a penny.

2106
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:44,400
Like probably a price error. Probably shouldn't have been live. His student bought like five

2107
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:50,480
Chromebooks for a penny each. And then Danny was like, let me jump on this. And they were selling

2108
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:57,120
regular 3DS too. 3DS XL is not the new version, but the old one for a penny. So he ordered five.

2109
02:23:57,120 --> 02:24:02,880
So he paid a nickel there. Apparently he has a tracking number. They debited his account,

2110
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:09,680
you know, a nickel. So that's ridiculous if this really happened. Where it's gone now. Yeah. It's

2111
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:14,880
gone now. Yeah. There's a storefront. Better hope those weren't stolen off the back of a truck or

2112
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:18,880
something. That's what it sounds like. They were actually, they seem to be like a reputable place.

2113
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:23,200
I think made, well, what he thinks, I think, I don't know. Again, I don't know how Amazon works,

2114
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:29,040
but he thinks maybe they were putting inventory in the system, but accidentally set it to live

2115
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:33,040
and just had those placeholder prices before they were actually going through and doing everything.

2116
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:39,840
But there was like Chromebooks. There were like a kitchen appliances, 3DSs. I don't know if there

2117
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:44,880
are any other systems, but I hope he gets his five 3DSs because he's going to give me one.

2118
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:51,680
What a nice Christmas present. I need a new rice cooker. I'm sad that show or that stores down.

2119
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:56,800
What's up with that? I need kitchenware. Well, maybe you should work at a school with

2120
02:24:56,800 --> 02:25:00,400
terrible students that are on their phones during your class and then you would get it.

2121
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:04,800
I'll get right on that. Yep, you should. All right. Anything else you want to share with us

2122
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:09,280
tonight, Shane? No, everybody should also go play Let It Die if you have a PS4 because that game is

2123
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:12,800
awesome. I didn't like that game. Well, you're wrong. So it doesn't matter.

2124
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:15,360
Shane tried to make me play it. I didn't think it was that good.

2125
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:19,200
It's pretty freaking fun. You didn't even do anything in the game. That's why.

2126
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:22,720
That was ridiculous. I didn't like it. And it sounds like Silent Hill because

2127
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:26,320
the Kiriyamaoka does the music. The music was okay. The music was okay.

2128
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I'll give it that. Okay, bye. Bye.

2129
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:38,160
All right. 1877 Game OLR or of course on Skype, we are Orange Lounge Radio. I'm sure we can

2130
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:44,080
squeeze in another call if you want to give us a call. Let's see. Looking at chat over

2131
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:50,160
at live.fognetwork.com. Kossen says new egg has sales on rice cooker sometimes. I just named a

2132
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:55,040
random kitchen appliance. We don't really need one. I legit need a new one. Although, I was

2133
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:00,880
gonna say that Alan's had that one like forever. We've been dating for seven years. So I would,

2134
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:06,400
maybe it is time to get a new one. I don't know. Let's see. Dark Tetsuya in chat talking about

2135
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:11,200
Let It Die says I watched some streams of it. It definitely looks like a Suda 51 joint.

2136
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:19,280
So. All right. Well, Skype is going crazy on me and having these weird errors. So unfortunately,

2137
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:23,040
I think I'm gonna go ahead and close it down for tonight. I'm sorry for those of you that couldn't

2138
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:27,680
get through, but please consider emailing us or tweeting us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2139
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:32,800
I will make sure Skype gets upgraded before the next show. Although, this computer is still

2140
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:39,040
running on Windows XP. So I don't know how much longer that's gonna work. However, I am looking

2141
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:47,040
into the big upgrade for 2017. So while we're gone during MAGFest, very possibly giving the

2142
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:51,520
studio some renovations. I just have to see how much it's gonna cost me and all that other stuff.

2143
02:26:51,520 --> 02:27:02,160
So hopefully, we'll get that all fixed. And new and improved Skype line. And maybe if we can,

2144
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:06,640
maybe we can set up some type of video thing. Although, I know not everybody wants to be on

2145
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:10,320
cam. But maybe some type of limited video or something we could figure out as well.

2146
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:16,720
Yeah. Actf says, Studio N 7.1. Rama says, I sent you a Windows 10 key. You're golden. Yeah,

2147
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:21,520
I know. I know. I will be golden. Just probably not on this computer. This computer's, you know,

2148
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:28,480
this is the computer that the listeners graciously bought for us after I had my diva meltdown. But

2149
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:33,200
you guys might remember, that was like eight years ago. So this computer kind of needs a little bit

2150
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,440
of a kick in the pants as well. So that's all stuff that I'm looking into doing. A little

2151
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:43,680
studio upgrade here. So yeah. Actf, the diva computer. Anyway, that is about gonna do it for

2152
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:47,440
another episode of Orange Lawn Radio. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking

2153
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:52,160
us out. You know, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.

2154
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:56,000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.

2155
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:02,800
That's all we want for the holidays. If you're feeling so generous, a nice five-star review would

2156
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:07,920
go a long way on whatever website you found this show on, be it iTunes or Google Play,

2157
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:12,400
wherever. Before we wrap things up tonight, we're gonna go around and get everybody's

2158
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:22,000
final thought for the night. My final thought tonight is, I think I'm going to probably re-up

2159
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,000
wow tonight and I'll play some wow, as I mentioned earlier in the show. I think that would be fun.

2160
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,600
Nicky Minaj If I'm on tonight, I'll play with you.

2161
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:33,360
Yeah. It is Sunday night. Got to work tomorrow. But, you know, that's all right. Short week.

2162
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:35,840
Thank you, holidays. Nicky Minaj Short week. Oh, for you.

2163
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:38,480
Nicky Minaj Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

2164
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:42,880
Loki, your final thought. Loki Maybe I guess I'll have to join

2165
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:47,440
up. Wow. Said me never. Nicky Minaj

2166
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:52,000
And last but not least, somebody who's not quite a hater. Sometimes, Dark Sakura.

2167
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:55,920
I'm not full of hatred. I am full of disappointment,

2168
02:28:56,480 --> 02:29:00,880
but I am not full of hatred. Well, yet. Wait until next year.

2169
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:04,160
Nicky Minaj All right. Hey, everybody. Have a great holiday

2170
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:08,480
because I'm sure many of you will be doing holiday things next week and will not be here live.

2171
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:13,840
But if you are going to be around, come join our holiday special in seven days with Dark Sakura

2172
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:19,200
and myself. Unfortunately, Uncle Loki's got real world stuff to tend to, but we'll be here.

2173
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:23,120
Who knows? You always know during a holiday special, some special guests show up. So who

2174
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:28,960
knows who will join us here in studio on Christmas or first day of Hanukkah or whatever it is you're

2175
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:33,840
celebrating in seven days. We'll see you then. Have a great week, everybody. Happy gaming. Bye.
