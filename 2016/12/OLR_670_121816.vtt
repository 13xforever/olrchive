00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
This week, Capcom says quitters never win and winners never quit by turning to player identification to shame rage quitters into changing their habits. Fighters beware of the scarlet letter Q.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And that's just one story we have on the last pre-holiday episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight. Episode 670 for this, December the 18th of 2016.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and she is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Sup?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
How you doing?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Uh, I'm okay.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, it's alright.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
It's okay.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Now wait a minute. You've been in a pretty good mood all night. We've been eating and talking and gossiping.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm out of food.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm out of coffee.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, you're out of food. Do you want more coffee?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
No.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
We can do more coffee. I've got plenty of K-Cups for the machine.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I couldn't make words happen, that's all.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Alright.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Also say hello over there to Techmaster Loki.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Hello.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Fine.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Good. And so, we had a little scare before the show. Your burger may have had the wrong toppings, but it's all is well? We're okay now?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, I was just thinking their cheese was oddly colored.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Well, it's-

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Cheese, quotey fingers.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, it's Burger King. I don't know.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Normally it's pretty good.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
It's okay. It's alright. Anyway.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
Hi, guys. You guys are in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
And you guys can participate live with our show, where Fifth Dream in chat says,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
It's been a while since she was here live.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Actually, Dark Soccer's return was last week, Fifth Dream. Where were you? You might have just not been here.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
But Dark Soccer will be here for the foreseeable future.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Future, future.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Including next week, if you guys didn't know, we will be doing a live Orange Lawns Radio-

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
On the first day of Hanukkah.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Holiday Spectacular.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
And Daddy's gonna drink.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
So, just like-

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Mama might be drinking too.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So, yes. Look forward to that. Please look forward to it.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Unfortunately, Uncle Loki will not be able to make it. But, I mean, it is kind of a major holiday.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
So, but, you guys hopefully will be here too. If you guys are bored on the night of the 25th, you can come join us.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Bobby Black Wolf will be here too with his show.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Or, you can always use the podcast feed.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
We're on iTunes. What? Google Play Store.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Pretty much all the big places you can find podcasts except for one.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You can find us almost anywhere else.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So, TuneIn is the one that I certainly recommend.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So, all the great places you can find podcasts.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
They're available and you can find our Christmas episode if you can't be here live.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
ActDeftInChat says, I'll be here.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, good. I'm glad. I'm glad at least one person can be here next week.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Before we get into the kickoff topic tonight, I need to address something right at the top of the show.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Okay? And I'm gonna admit, this has absolutely nothing to do with video games.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
But, in the past like four hours, I've been called a witch.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I've been called a prophet. I've been called the Oracle.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
I want to play a clip from our last show. This was seven days ago, okay?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
This is a minute long clip from the last episode, 669.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
A little bit of throwback music, please.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I just want people to get the fuck over it.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And, Betty White to stay alive.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh, yeah.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
No celebrity deaths in 2017. None. Well, maybe a couple. Maybe a couple.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I don't know. Who do you think will die first?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Betty White or Kirk Douglas?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, well, let's...

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
He's a hundred now.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I know. And I hate to say this. I hate to say this, but can I say Zsa Zsa Gabor?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Okay, Zsa Zsa.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
She's one of those people where you go, how?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Right?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
How?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Preservatives.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm fine with her being one of the three and, you know, the potential.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
If there's certain sacrificial lambs we have to offer 2017, then it's like, okay.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
If she has to die so Betty White can live, then I'm by all means.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
Kirk Douglas. I mean, this is horrible. We're horrible people. We should, no, just, you know, but...

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Betty White seems to be in the best health of them all.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah, because she's probably still having sex.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Who wouldn't want to sleep with Betty White? I'm serious.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
The blood sacrifice has been made.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
So, I want to apologize to the Gabor family. I didn't mean it like that.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
But yes, in case you hadn't heard...

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
I did.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
Zsa Zsa Gabor died today. And look, look, look, I don't mean to make light of this. It sucks when people die and so forth.

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
However, the whole reason why I went there in the first place on the show was the fact that the poor lady has had how many surgeries in the past five years.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
Does she have any limbs left? I don't even know. And, you know, it's one of those things where her husband's been keeping her alive for I don't know how long.

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
So, that's why I was kind of joking earlier in the year. How are all these celebrities dying but Zsa Zsa Gabor is still alive?

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, thank you God for, you know, that little joke. But there you go.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Ironically, they're going to turn her into Robocop.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Stop it right now.

05:16.000 --> 05:29.000
Well, one of my friends, though, being the person he is, posted the clip from one of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies where she was on an interview show and it turns out she's being interviewed by Freddy Krueger and he slashes her across the face.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Well, that's back when the 80s movies were, like, super cheese tat. That's when we had, like, Sleepaway Camp and all those amazing 80s movies.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Toxic Avenger.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Stoppy says, what was she even famous for outside for being married, like, six times?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Green Acres?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Wasn't that her sister?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't think that was Ava. I think that was Zsa Zsa.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
I'm pretty sure it was. Well, then, she also slapped the siren on the, because she slapped a cop. So, she was in those Naked Gun movies, right?

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
She was the original Kardashian. That's what it is. That's what it boils down to is, like, why is Kim Kardashian famous? Anybody? Anybody? Yeah, exactly.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So, like, Zsa Zsa Gabor was kind of like the original Kardashian.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Is it because her parents own a line of hotels? Oh, wait.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
No, you're thinking of the wrong, wrong, spoiled kid.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
That was the previous line of people that were famous for no reason.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yes.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Alan Alchemy points out she was in 60s Batman. Oh, that's right. That is right.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
Let's see. So, anyway, so, I'm getting yelled at by chatters, but you know what? I said what I said.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
But, again, you know, apologies to the Gabor family.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
It was Ava.

06:34.000 --> 06:43.000
I thought it was Ava and the Greenagers. Apologies to the Gabor family. However, Betty White should now be okay for this year.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
So, let's just all breathe a sigh of relief.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Don't jinx it, Rob. I can't utter celebrity names. Apparently, I have the death whisper. What?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
She's the Highlander.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
There can be only one.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
Let's hope. All right. We need to move on. Thank you, Tiger Claw, a very important movie credit. I should do this.

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
The 1952 version of Moulin Rouge. So, the one you probably didn't see because it's from 1952, but if you haven't, you should.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
This was the pre-Nicole Kidman, you know, that one.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Baz Luhrmann.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Yes, that whole thing. So, anyway, let's move on. We got to get into video game stuff.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
I love that the chatters want to keep talking about Jacques Gabor's career. However, we do.

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
For what is traditionally like the part of the year where the video game news just like dries up significantly and we're left to stretch for time.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I feel like there's still a lot going on this week. So, we're going to start with this.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Some big news that came out earlier this week about the partnership between Nintendo and Universal.

07:39.000 --> 07:47.000
So, we talked about this on prior episodes that the two were teaming up, but now we have some more information about what exactly is planned.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
Super Nintendo World is coming to Universal Studios Japan. It is going to be coming in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
That's what they're timing it for. So, Japan, I guess, foresees that 2020 will be a huge tourist year, probably thanks in large part to the Olympics.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
So, they're trying to get Super Nintendo World open before then. However, Nintendo themed areas are also going to come to Orlando and Hollywood.

08:12.000 --> 08:22.000
I don't know where they're going to put them because they had to bulldoze the Gibson Amphitheater to put the Harry Potter thing in Hollywood.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
I would assume they're going to cut something on the tour. Something on the tour is going to go.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Are they going to take out the mall?

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
No, they would never take out the mall. The mall makes too much money, I'm sure. Something on the tour will probably give that's on the Universal tour and that'll probably be it.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
The last time I was there, they still had the whole set for Desperate Housewives back there. I mean, there's stuff that can go.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Well, that's used for a bunch of stuff.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, I know. That's true. But they'll think of something.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
They can make more money from that stuff than they do the backlot stuff anyway.

08:52.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah, we'll see. Because they can always move that set somewhere else, like an actual studio. But we'll see. Who knows?

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Orlando, I'm sure, has plenty of space. So that probably won't be an issue there.

09:05.000 --> 09:15.000
Anyway, what is Super Nintendo World going to be? Expansive, multi-level environments, unprecedented state-of-the-art rides, interactive areas, shops, and restaurants.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
All featuring Nintendo's popular characters and games. Does this mean they will continue to ignore Samus?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
That's my question, like they did Metroid's 30th anniversary.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
I demand something Samus in this park area, theme area. Needs to happen, right, Logie?

09:33.000 --> 09:41.000
We need something Samus. Look, we know there's going to be Link, Zelda, Mario, Luigi, and that.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
And probably like the characters from Animal Crossing, whatever else is mobile at the time.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Which is weird because there was not an Animal Crossing game on the Super Nintendo.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
I know, I know. But I don't think this is supposed to literally be Super Nintendo. It's just that's what they're calling the world.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I would go to Super Nintendo Land.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
Keep in mind, in Japan it would have been Super Famicom World. So, it's a little different.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking, is there a booth where I can romance Waluigi? One can hope.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Why?

10:11.000 --> 10:20.000
Why not? Let's see, anyway, they're saying economic benefits following the opening. 6.2 trillion yen for the Kansai region.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
11.7 trillion yen for Japan as a whole. Creating 1.1 million jobs in Japan within a decade after opening.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
That's what they're forecasting anyway. So yeah, we don't have any specifics on what the rides will be.

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
But there is like a mock-up art that you can take a look at. It looks really cute. I want to go, that's for sure.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, you better get those pre-orders in because they're probably not going to sell enough tickets for all the people that want to go.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
Fuck off. The accuracy of that read is way too good. Thank you.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, I mean, it's funny enough, although you can make the parallels about Nintendo's supply and demand issues,

11:01.000 --> 11:13.000
that actually probably will be the case because Japan is going to be getting all these people visiting it for the Olympics and other stuff that's going on in 2020.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
So, it's going to be a big year for Japan. So, in a way, you kid, but there's some truth to that.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
I wonder how long it will be, though, before it opens up in Hollywood and Orlando.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Because what the Harry Potter thing was about a one or two year difference between Orlando and Hollywood, right?

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
It was about a two year difference, I think. So, I haven't even been to the one in Hollywood yet. I really want to go.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I haven't either.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
I really want to go. I just haven't. I've been to Universal there. Xtifer and I, my pal from Guys Will Show, Xtifer and I went to Universal Studios and we had a great time.

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
We rode the Mummy ride, which I really hope doesn't go away, seeing as I hear that they're doing a Mummy reboot, which that franchise is not even.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
It's terrible.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Tom Cruise? What?

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm fine. Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise can really be in anything because I love watching Tom Cruise's movies run away from things.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
I mean, honestly, I love Tom Cruise as an actor. I don't care about his personal stuff.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
He was really good at Magnolia.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
He's fantastic. Put him in any action movie, it's fine. I mean, they're all great.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Things I did not expect Loki to say on there.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I just don't think that that movie franchise needs to be rebooted because they drove it into the ground.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Do you know why they're doing it? Universal wants its own Avengers. That's what it boils down to.

12:24.000 --> 12:33.000
Universal is rebooting all these classic horror franchises because they want to do their own version of the Avengers with classic movie characters.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
This is completely serious. I read about it on Wikipedia. It is true.

12:36.000 --> 12:46.000
I fully expect then after they reboot everything to culminate in the reboot of the monster squad because that's really where it's all going to is the monster squad at the end.

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
So anyway, X4 and I rode the Mummy ride and we had no idea what the ride was.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
We just knew it was like a roller coaster and it used to be the E.T. ride years ago.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
So we're like, whatever, let's do the Mummy ride.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
So we went on it and it's like, it starts off and it's very casual, like going through these different rooms.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's like, oh, spooky. It's like a black light ride to Disneyland.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
And then all of a sudden, like 70 miles an hour, like all through this thing.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
And then it like stops at some point and they make it seem like bugs are attacking your feet.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
And then the whole thing goes backward and X4 and I were screaming our heads off.

13:20.000 --> 13:28.000
I really wish we had video of it because we would be a viral sensation on YouTube with how big we were screaming on that ride because we had no idea what it was going to be or what to expect.

13:28.000 --> 13:35.000
So like, you know, getting thrown backwards at 70 miles an hour, not exactly a sensation you are, you know, expecting.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
So yes, that was our adventure at Universal Studios.

13:40.000 --> 13:49.000
So I'm hoping, my point with this is, I'm hoping even though Nintendo is seen by a lot of people as a kid thing, I do hope there's a really good thrill ride in it.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
I really hope Universal does a good thrill ride out of this.

13:53.000 --> 14:02.000
So, that being said, chatters, hosts, what Nintendo property do you want to see them make a thrill ride out of?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Dark Sakura.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Super Metroid.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Super Metroid. So you say Samus-

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
It could totally happen.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah, it could. It could be so, it could be, they could do it with like the escape sequence at the end of the game or something.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Like Samus has to escape from Zeb's or something. That would be really cool.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Loki?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Uh oh.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
If you want a thrill ride, there's only one property that could possibly-

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
You're gonna take my answer, I know it.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It's gonna be Pokemon Snap.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
What?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Oh my god though, they really could-

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
But it could be a ride.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
It could be like a Toy Story at Disneyland type thing.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
They could do, like, but instead of shooting the Pokemon, you're throwing berries at it or something.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
But they could totally do like a Pokemon Snap type thing. Oh my god, I would actually love that.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
However, the tricky thing with Pokemon, Pokemon Company is a separate company from Nintendo.

14:52.000 --> 15:00.000
So I'm not sure you can bank on- I mean, it's a technicality, but still, I'm not sure you can bank on Pokemon showing up at this thing.

15:00.000 --> 15:10.000
I would think it would be ridiculous for them to not partner up to sell oodles and oodles of stuffed Pokemon exclusive to the parks and this shit, but it's not a given.

15:11.000 --> 15:18.000
Okay, my answer for that, I thought you were gonna say this when you said there's only one thrill ride that could possibly do.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
F-Zero. Thank you.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
That could do it.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Thank you. F-Zero. I wanna see an F-Zero ride. So bad, but I just, I know it's not gonna happen.

15:27.000 --> 15:36.000
It's gotta have, though, I would imagine something like that being in a series of projection tubes, where you've got the scenery projected through 60 around you.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
Like, they used to do the people mover in the 70s at Disneyland, for serious.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
But until someone fell off of it in a drunken super.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah, but that was their fault, they were drunk.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah. Well, they had that Tron section.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, yeah, that's what-

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
Imagine a whole thing like that, you know, and it would look more seamless in, like, a tube.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
I'm here for this, yes. But I just, I know it's not gonna happen, and you know why?

15:58.000 --> 16:09.000
Because how frickin' obvious would it be to have bumper cars and be Super Mario Kart, and they'll have big inflatable shells you can throw at other people or something ridiculous.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm telling you, it's happening.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I think I-

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
That's like, if anything is a given at this, a Super Mario Kart bumper car has to be.

16:16.000 --> 16:23.000
I think I just hurt my entire series of ocular muscles with how hard I just rolled my eyes.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
Alright, let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, Legend of Zelda.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
JD says, Pokemon Snap already feels like it's a small world.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Let's see, oh, VidPower in chat suggests, Kirby Air Ride for people moving.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
So, there you go, some suggestions for thrill rides at the park.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
So, what do you guys think? Let's see, how many years of OLR will we be doing at this point?

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
That would be our 18th year. We'll be 18 and legal, so I think we should celebrate in Japan. What do you say? Let's go.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Who wants to pay for it?

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I don't know. We'll do a GoFundMe. No, I would never ask the listeners to pay for something so silly.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Actually?

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
I would not want the listeners to pay for something so silly. We'll save up the money and do it.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
If we sell shirts and put the money from the shirt sales into a Japan fund, I'm okay with that.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
I was just thinking if we did a GoFundMe and had enough, we'd say like, and if we reach a certain amount, one lucky listener gets to come with us.

17:22.000 --> 17:31.000
Then you get into weird lottery laws, legal, you know, but I'm fine. Maybe if we want to, okay, Jamie, you've been talking about doing a book for how long, like an OLR keepsake.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
I plan on doing the book.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
So, we'll sell the book and then that's okay.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But people haven't fucking sent me pictures.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
That's different. Like if with the product and you're selling it and we put the money away, that's different.

17:41.000 --> 17:49.000
I want OLR listeners to send me pictures of hanging out with other listeners if you have them.

17:49.000 --> 17:58.000
And even maybe a little, a little blurb about yourself, you know, so we can have like the yearbook in the back.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
Maybe we'll look into one of those things where like we get an app or something and we do like bonus episodes, but only if you pay the money to do the app.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Patreon, here we come.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't know. I don't know. I'm more of the type of, I'm just old school like that.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Like I've got to give some type of tangible product that you're paying money for and that's, that's it.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
You know, and then we put the profits away, right?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Put them away into donuts. Yum.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
And okay, if we don't, you know what, if we don't raise enough money to go to Japan, Malasada is on every episode.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
There you go.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Wait, what are those?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
You haven't had a Malasada?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
What are those?

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
Number one, play Pokemon Sun and Moon. Number two, there are the like Portuguese donuts, but they're really big in Hawaii.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
And they're, they're hard to find here.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
The only place I know of that sells them is L&L's Hawaiian barbecue.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
And they're not, I mean, it's, it's kind of basic.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
It's just,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Forget that. Let's just go to,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Let's just go to Hawaii.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Oh, you can go to Hawaii. Let's go to Vancouver.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
All right, the OLR.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Let's go to somewhere that isn't America.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
The OLR travel fund.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
Kuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com suggests OLR listener porn collection.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Hey, look, if you,

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
if you guys are willing to help us raise money at our bake sale by baking something else, then,

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
If someone says me $500, I'll moon loudly into the, into the mic.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
You want to go up on fiverr.com or whatever that site is? Or do you pay?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
No, I just want someone to send me money.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Really?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
All right.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Anyway, we'll think about what we can do over the next two years.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
I'd do it for a copy of Radiant Silver Gun for Saturn.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
All right, we definitely need to get into our gaming weeks so we can get into the news as well.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
Because this is, this has gone way off the rails with this Universal Studios thing.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
The show's gone off the rails.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah, I know. It's, it's, it's not the last show of the year, but it kind of feels like it.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Because seriously, I don't know what news there's going to be next week.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
So if you think this show is random, just come back next week for the holiday spectacular.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Because I don't know what's going to happen.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
The holiday drunk-tacular.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
All right. Anyway, but we do have some gaming news to get into. We'll get there in a minute.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
But we do have to talk about our gaming weeks.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I don't know about you guys, but I've actually played a lot this week.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
So, Dark Sakura, starting with you. How was your gaming week?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
You're going to laugh.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Because I got Arkanoid for iOS.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
And I've been playing a lot of bink, bink, bink, bink, bink.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah, but as far as breakout clones go, like that's the one to play.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
I've been going on like this Taito kick, so I also have like Darius Burst.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
And I haven't actually played it on my phone yet, but I found out that I can airplay it on my Apple TV.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
So that's fun. I also got Pac-Man Championship DX for Apple TV.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
And with my SteelSeries controller, it's pretty cool.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
So I've actually found that controller to be super responsive with my Apple TV.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
So it's sort of like become another gaming console.

20:44.000 --> 20:51.000
So I also have been playing World of Warcraft.

20:51.000 --> 20:59.000
Because now that we've got new content from the last patch, I mean, it's gated, which is really annoying.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
But I've enjoyed the whole Suramar storyline a whole lot.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
And I've got one more achievement left, and then I think I get flying.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
So you have no idea how much gold I've saved up just thinking I was going to pay for my account that way.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm like at $275,000.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
I may, I don't want to tease you too much, I may re-up for another month in WoW.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Just because as far as 14 goes, I've kind of hit a wall in 14.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I've done everything there is to do.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
And I'm still doing Deep Dungeon, which is kind of like I got into that when I should have done it last patch.

21:33.000 --> 21:40.000
But a lot of my guildies aren't on a lot, and there's not a lot of content that we really do as a group.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
So I kind of miss that whole getting together to do stuff.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
So like if you're actually on and playing, and our pals from Game Buoy are still, do they still play?

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
I've been trying to get Slidekick to come back sometimes.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
Maybe if I offer Slidekick Malasadas, he'll come back and play. So we'll do something.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But Grandpa's been on a few times.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Oh, that's good. I never see his ass anymore. That'd be great to play with him.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
So I think I may re-up just for a month to hold me over, because I'm really excited.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
14 is finally getting that cross-server shit in 3.5, and that's going to help a lot.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
But anyway, I don't need to take away from the week.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
But you should come do classic runs with me in VRT.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah, sure, I'd be down for that.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Because that's pretty fun.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
Which was what I've been doing when I couldn't sleep, is I was doing 25-man Black Temple by myself.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
There's a lot of achievements in old mounts and things.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
For people especially that are just getting into WoW, there's a lot of back content to just Zen out and go through.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
So I've been going back and getting mounts that I was missing.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
There's a snow globe in Dalaran that turns you into a gnome.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
And Final Fantasy XIV, as much as I love it, it doesn't have that same backlog of content yet.

22:48.000 --> 22:55.000
So maybe when Stormblood comes out and I'm level 70, maybe I can do Bahamut's Coil by myself and things like that.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
It'll be a little more like that, but you can't really do that in XIV right now.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
I've just been having a good time looking at all the content that I missed.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
And it's sort of neat, though. The only things that I can't go back and do is old Karazhan.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Because that's now a new raid.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Oh, they closed off old Karazhan completely?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I think they closed off the old Karazhan. I have to double check.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
That's shitty if they did. Sorry.

23:16.000 --> 23:22.000
But I'll have to go back and double check, but I know that they were completely revamping Karazhan and now there's a new raid out.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
One of our people in chat has got to be a WoW player, right?

23:24.000 --> 23:36.000
Yeah. But I'm still playing Pokemon Go. I just hit 21. Yeah, 21. I got my Santa Pikachu.

23:36.000 --> 23:44.000
And I have been... I actually didn't play any more Animal Crossing, I hate to say.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Because I was going to go back and get my island tan.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
I was playing something else and I can't remember what I was playing.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
Sonic CD with a Japanese soundtrack. Because it's better.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
I think that's it.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Alright, we'll move on to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:02.000 --> 24:10.000
I didn't play anything. I mean, honestly, I played just cell phone games.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Ingress and Pokemon Go. I tried a little bit of Pokemon Go.

24:14.000 --> 24:22.000
Mainly what I've been trying to do is on my drive home from picking up the kids, there's a long section where there's not any Ingress play there.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
So I just flip it over to Pokemon Go during that time.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
And then my kids want me to drive them around the neighborhood to look at lights.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
So I usually play Pokemon Go while that's going on.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.000
With my neighborhood, apparently there's such frequent spawns that it makes it really easy to just keep catching Pokemon.

24:38.000 --> 24:45.000
But with that, it seems like they've tweaked what you get from those Poke Stops.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Because I'm hardly getting any gear from that stuff anymore, which is annoying.

24:49.000 --> 24:59.000
Well, when a lot of people went back in November or October, I think it was the event right after the Halloween thing, they did double output on Poke Stops.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
So people kind of got used to that as the norm. And that's actually not the norm.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
I found something that you hit the same one and it's like every certain number of hits are double.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
I used to get at least five, four items per spin, and now it's like three.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
And two of those, or maybe one of those will be a Poke Ball.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
It's just ridiculous. They're really trying to get you to buy Poke Balls and I'm like, no.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Alan and I have taken to driving through downtown slowly.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
Obviously I don't want to use my phone and drive, but I can use the little Pogo app.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
Plus, that's what it's called, Pogo Plus. You can set that to Poke Stops only.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
So I'll just kind of have that as I drive slowly through downtown and just hit every Poke Stop.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
You're cruising for stops.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, we're cruising. That's the funny thing about Ingress and Pokemon Go is that they kind of brought cruising back.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It's nerd cruising.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
But I did get a Ditto, so I've got that now.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
I don't know. It's alright. I do like that there's different things spawning.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
It seems like they're spawning all over the place, but it's just not anything new for me.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
But I mean, it's alright I guess.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
And then it did a little bit of Ingress as well.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I don't know. That's pretty much it.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
I haven't really been playing any console games. I've been trying to work on programming stuff and doing all that.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
I've kind of taken a break from coding because I needed to build for what I was working on.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Because it was an Excite truck type game.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
So I need to build a test track-ish area that I can actually...

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
I need something with enough room where I can build in the rest of the stuff for driving.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Because you can't really do it without a track.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
So that's what I'm working on right now.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Alright. My gaming week. My turn.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Okay, so unpopular opinion time.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
I know Loki really gets all the hate mail on this show, but it's going to be me this week.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
Because I think I have an unpopular opinion on something that a lot of people are playing this week.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
So here we go.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
I downloaded Super Mario Run, and I think it sucks.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
I don't...

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Woohoo!

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Why are you cheering?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Because it's just a runner game and everyone is super hyped.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
That's how I can tell you haven't played.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Dan likes it.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
Anybody who's calling Super Mario Run an endless runner, it's not endless.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Yes, it's not an endless runner. Okay, I'm sorry.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
It's not an endless runner. It's a Mario game that they've simplified the controls down to nothing.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's just not fun.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm sorry. I don't know what it is.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Well, actually, I think I do know what it is.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
The way they did the pay thing is weird.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
And I am not being one of those people that doesn't think you should pay $10 for a game.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I get that. I understand that.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
But it is a little weird how once you pay the $10, then it says,

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
oh, but you get these 20 Toad Rally tickets.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
You get these 3,000 coins.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
You get this special item.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
To me, it felt like they were giving you all these things that you would expect to see in a free-to-play game,

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
like the Toad tickets, which I understand you don't buy them for money.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
You earn them through the little bonus houses and all this stuff.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
But that whole thing is a really weird mechanic.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
And I do not like those Toad rallies.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I don't like it. I mean, sorry.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
But I just, and yes, I did drop the $10 on the whole thing,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
so I've seen more than just one map on the Toad rally.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
I just don't, like, it's weird because you're not actually competing against somebody live,

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
and you're kind of unsure what it is you can do to do better than the other person.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
It's very, very vague in a lot of the descriptions.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
And it's just, it's kind of same-sy boring to me.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Even if you were to say, well, Rob, you want to do this.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I'll be, I'm sorry, it's still very same-sy boring to me

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
and not as exciting as it would be to maybe actually compete against somebody live in the same room

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
or something might be a little more fun.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
But at the end of the day, I just don't like the whole non-stop running thing.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I just don't like that direction for the Mario franchise.

28:55.000 --> 29:01.000
And I understand they can't do a traditional control thing, you know,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
because that would suck on the phone as well.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
So I understand they came up with this creative solution,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
but I don't like it, and that's my opinion. Sorry.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
You tried there.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
I tried. I paid the money. I tried. I don't like it.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
So that's it for Super Mario Run.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
And that's unfortunately, that's just the limitation of that platform.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
That just doesn't, it doesn't work. I'm sorry.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Like, platform games don't work on that platform.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm really curious to see now something like Animal Crossing.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
And dare I, okay, now I'm really going to get the hate mail.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Y'all ready? Get your email clients open.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Participate at orangehontrader.com.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
I had more fun with Miitomo because I felt Miitomo was an experience

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
that's better built for the phone than probably Super Mario Run is

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
at the end of the day.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
I think Super Mario Run is the game the investors forced Nintendo to make.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Okay, they made it.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Now don't ever listen to the investors again

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
because they don't know what the fuck to do to make a game.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
That's very obvious.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
But that's me. That's my perspective.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Okay, now I'm going to look at chat.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Sky, you're not alone.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I've heard from others that felt the same way,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
especially over the pricing.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Let's see.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Stoppy says, why has Sonic not had an endless runner?

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
That would seem to work really well with that franchise.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Let's see, also in chat.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, no way, dude.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Mario is the next Pokemon Go, Kappa.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Alan Alchemy says, does Shane love it?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Because if you feel this strongly about it,

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
it really increases the odds he'll feel the opposite.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I don't know. Maybe Shane will text me.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
Which, by the way, Shane texted about Karazhan, Dark Sakura.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Shane said, old Karazhan is accessible.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
New Karazhan is not a raid. It's a mythic something.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Gotcha.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Whatever that whole thing is.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
By the way, there was another game I forgot to say I've been playing.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Oh, yes?

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
In my Taito kick, I have Raystorm.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Okay.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
As in, you know, Rayforce, Raycrisis, Raystorm.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Because a lot of those classics are on iOS now.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
It's actually really fun to play just in iPhone mode.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
So it's one of my favorite shooters.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
But you haven't been playing Super Mario Run?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
No, I haven't. I've been watching Dan play it.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And when I saw him play it, I was like, I'm not interested.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Okay. So, okay.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
See, I was worried it was just going to be a me thing.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Well, I haven't played it, so I can't make a judgment on it.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Okay.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
I mean, especially when I found out that the actual purchase of the game

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
is an in-game purchase, which is how they're going past family sharing.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
That's kind of janky.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Oh, I didn't know that.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Yep. You download the game for free.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
But to unlock it, you pay $10.

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
And so, and since family sharing does not encompass in-app purchases,

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
then that's how they're bypassing family sharing.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Okay, Allen, you ready for a twist?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Y'all wanted a twist, eh?

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Shane just texted me, I do not care for Mario Run.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
It's just not my type of game.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I've not liked Mario games in forever, though.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
See, that's where I disagree with him.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Because I think, like, Mario 3D World on Wii U is fantastic.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I think there have been a lot of great Mario games lately.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Just not this one.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
And that's just an opinion.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
But you know what?

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
I'm not going to poo-poo on those that are playing it and having fun.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
No, not at all.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Props to you. Have a great time.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Yeah, exactly.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And there's lots of games out there that people like that I don't get.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Like, half the games that they advertise on TV.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Like Mass Effect?

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Yes, Mass Effect being one of them.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
But, like, my thing was that, like, when they're hyping this shit up.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
When they're putting it on fucking talk shows and shit.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Hyping it up like it's going to be the next Pokemon GO.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
It was never going to be the next Pokemon GO.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
See, here's the thing, though.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Well, first off, Nintendo wins in both situations.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
So don't pit the games against each other.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
But second off, like, I actually kind of like the whole video games on mainstream TV thing.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Like, it brings a lot more legitimacy to our hobby.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Not that we need it.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
You know what I mean? But it's still, come on.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
Even if you're very, like, anti-mainstream and all that stuff.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
There's still something a little bit rewarding about seeing that on TV.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
I think especially, like, if you kind of grew up where video game was always, like, a counterculture nerd thing.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
That's fine.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
But that little bit that they did on TV, though.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Jimmy Fallon?

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah, when Jimmy Fallon was not doing that game any favors.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I got it. I was excited to play it.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
And I just, I realized it was one of those things that just sounded better than it played.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
But anyway, all right, I'm going to stop taking a dump on Super Mario Run and let all of you that are enjoying it enjoy it.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Have fun.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Let's talk about good news.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
I want to talk about a game I'm really enjoying and I think is really, really good.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
And it took me way too long to get around to this game.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
And I think this is one of the best games that's come out all year.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
KC Munchkin.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
This is not 1982, girl.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
All right.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
But here's the thing.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
If you like racing at all in the slightest, you need to play Forza Horizon 3.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
It is fantastic.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
It is a step up from Forza Horizon 2 even.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
I remember some of my complaints about Forza Horizon 2 is that it was, like, really trying to, like, shove the DLC down your throat.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
I think they kind of took a step back with 3 because I know they just released the Blizzard Mountain.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
That's nice.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
And I just think the way they put the game together where now you kind of, you move the horizon spot.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
You move the festival to, like, these different locations.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
And I think the scenery is fantastic.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Like, does Australia really look like that?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Because it's gorgeous.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Where's our Australian list or is that?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It says the part that has animals that will kill you in your sleep.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Well, but you're in a car because you can take them on.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
But, like, there's just really fucking fun stuff in Forza Horizon 3.

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
Like, one of the first things it has you do is you're going to go off this fucking jump and see how much feet you can get in midair.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Like, it just seems like a Loki thing.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Like, this just seems like something you would really get a kick out of.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I'm really surprised you're not into Forza.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
But then again, you're not an Xbox One.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I don't have an Xbox One.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
So, I see. But at some point, and whenever those come down in price, you really need to check out Forza.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Really fantastic job.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
Well, yeah, that'd be like one of the games I'd pick up for sure, but I just don't have an Xbox One.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
So, I'm loving Forza and I think if you like racing games in the slightest, you should try it.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Remember, Forza is more of an arcade style racer.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
So, even if you don't like things like Gran Turismo and the mainline Forza series, which are more simulation,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
if you like Mario Kart, you will like Forza, I think.

35:14.000 --> 35:21.000
So, I mean, and the other cool thing about Forza is that if it's too complicated for you, if you're not taking your turns right,

35:21.000 --> 35:28.000
if you're not, you can do so much stuff that's like auto, you can practically do it so that all you do is control the gas pedal.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
I don't think it's as much fun that way, but that might be a great way for a kid to play the game.

35:33.000 --> 35:40.000
So, you know, there's a lot of customization you can do with the difficulty in Forza and I think they did a great job with it.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
So.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh my God.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
That's my thought. What's that?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
The what lady?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Does she die too?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Yeah.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Fuck this year. Fuck it.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
She died yesterday.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
What? How did they know? Did they find her? How did they know it was her?

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
I'm trying to make sure that it's true.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Fake news. It's fake news.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
I'm trying to make sure that it's true.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Not fake news. Fake news.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
That's what it is. Facebook, put a little red stamp on that.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
She can't be dead. I love her.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
All right.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
I don't know her.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
I feel like.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah, she did die.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
How do you know this? Proof. I want to see the receipts.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
Someone put, I think, the obituary on Reddit.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Oh, Reddit. Come on. Reddit's a source now.

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
No, no disrespect to the Redditors out there. I lurk among you, but I want to see the receipts.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
All right.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetware.com.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
Stoppy says, wait, so auto mode is kind of like those old remote controlled cars that move on a track.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
A slot car racing, I think you're thinking of.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
It can be, but you can turn that on or off.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
You can turn the braking, assisted braking on or off.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
You can turn the guide on or off.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
You can really tune the difficulty down to a very fine level in the game.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
And I think that's part of what makes the game so powerful in a way.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
So, yes, I'm loving Forza Horizon 3.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I give that a very strong recommendation.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
Other than that, as far as games this week, I beat Final Fantasy 15.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
So we talked about that and we've talked about Final Fantasy 15 ad nauseam the past couple of weeks.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I finally played and beat 15.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
At the end of the day, I really enjoyed the game.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
There are some big flaws with the game.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Chapter 13, again, I'm keeping it spoiler free.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I know, I see all the hate for Chapter 13.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
If Chapter 13 was 25% as long and still told the same story, I would be fine with it.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And again, I'm going to keep this really vague because I won't spoil anything.

37:29.000 --> 37:37.000
But those of you that have played through the whole game know there is very obviously more game that was cut.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
Very obviously the potential for there to be this whole...

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Oh, there's an analogy I want to make so badly, but I feel like it's a spoiler.

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
But have you ever had that moment in a game when it was like, what?

37:52.000 --> 37:57.000
There's definitely, for me, one of those moments in Final Fantasy 15.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
And I feel like that's not explored as well as it could have been.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Maybe that's the DLC. Womp womp. I don't know.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
But you know, I've read some interesting theories on Reddit and NeoGaf.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
So I brought my jug of Morton Salt with me.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
But some very interesting theories about the fact that, yeah, dev time was cut really short.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
And that this game was kind of rushed.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
Which I know, wink wink, laugh, ha ha, because this game took 10 years to develop.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
But kids, look at the trailer when they announced that Final Fantasy 13 versus was becoming 15.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Go back and look at that trailer.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Does that game even look like the game that we got?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
No.

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
So it's very obvious, and that's part of these rumors, and I very much believe that that is the case.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
Because it feels like it when I look at these old trailers and actually play the game.

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
The game has actually been in development closer to two to three years in its current form.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
Which would make sense with some of the, you know, they changed the director and all this other stuff.

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
But anyway, we've talked about 15 and Ozzy in the past couple weeks. I don't want to revisit that too much.

38:58.000 --> 39:05.000
I will just say, overall, I liked it, but the game did show some weakness in the story towards the end.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
But I was satisfied with the ending. I was satisfied with a lot about it.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
I'll be interested to see where the DLC goes.

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
But for me, I still also don't really think it's a Final Fantasy game, which I talked about in previous weeks.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
But if I had to judge all 15 games, this one would be like in the middle for me.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
This one would end up in the middle. For me, it's better than probably like 8, 1, 3, which I put towards the bottom of the pack.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
I know 3 has its fans, I'm really sorry guys.

39:35.000 --> 39:46.000
But it's not as strong as 6, 4, 14, 2.0. Probably not even as strong as 10 or 12, really.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
But that's around where I'd put it.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
So anyway, that was it, Final Fantasy XV.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
And then randomly, I played Geometry Wars 3, which I know came out like two years ago.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
But I was in the mood to do a twin-stick shooter.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And I almost bought Enter the Gungeon.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
But then I was like, oh, you have all this stuff on Geometry Wars 3 you haven't done yet. All these trophies you can go get.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
So I kind of got sucked back into that.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
I really should have gotten Enter the Gungeon.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
I really should have gotten Enter the Gungeon.

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
But it's on sale on PlayStation right now, so I still have a few hours to figure out if I want to get it.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
Or do I wait for the Steam winner sale and get it on PC?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Get it on both like I did.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
That good, huh? That good.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Alright, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
Let's see, Fifth Dream kind of agrees with something I was saying there in chat.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Final Fantasy XV was really only developed for like two years.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
AkumaJP says, the whole story was changed.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com for more comments.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
Stoppy in chat says, I'll check it out when the price goes down enough.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
I think it's the right direction for Final Fantasy.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
So those are comments from our chat.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
Okay, some housekeeping, then we'll get into some gaming news.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
So we will be here next week, live on the 25th.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Otherwise we'll see you on the podcast feed.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
There will be no show January 8th.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
Because I will be at MAGFest.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And I hope to see you guys at MAGFest.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
I don't know, I'm not scheduled to speak on any panels or anything.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
So I don't have like a place I can guarantee I will be.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
But if there's enough interest in meeting up at MAGFest, tweet me at Skye, S-K-I-E.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
And we'll try to do like a dinner or something.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Or I don't know, because the food options out there are pretty limited.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
But we'll try to figure something out.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
So we can do like a little meet up at MAGFest for those of you that are going.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
That would be a lot of fun.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Someone want to offer up their room for a room party?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
That would be fun.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
That's really it. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
And also on Facebook and Google Plus at username Orange Lounge Radio.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
Let's get into gaming news. Loki.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
So Nintendo has filed multiple Nintendo Switch patents.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Which have a lot of nice little drawings of stuff.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
And kind of reveals a few things, features of the Nintendo Switch based on it.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
So one of the things we know is it does have a touch screen.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
I mean if that wasn't obvious.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Some of the cool things that they were showing off.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
The actual Joy-Cons or whatever they're calling those.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
They have some alternate ones for the left Joy-Con.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
They actually have one that has a D-Pad on it instead of an analog stick.

42:19.000 --> 42:26.000
They have one that also replaces the sort of four button D-Pad that they have on the normal one with an actual D-Pad.

42:26.000 --> 42:32.000
So there's a few alternate designs that may be made available or something if you want to do that.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
What was the other stuff?

42:35.000 --> 42:43.000
I think there was something regarding an IR admitter or sensor in the Joy-Cons as well.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Perhaps for the rumored Wii Virtual Console support.

42:46.000 --> 42:57.000
Yeah, so I mean it looks neat and definitely worth checking out all the drawings and stuff to kind of get an idea of how everything will kind of work together.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
And then finally there was some more news.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
Not necessarily a patent but it was a trademark filed.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
So Nintendo has filed a new trademark for Excite Truck.

43:09.000 --> 43:19.000
So they're letting I guess their old trademark kind of just expire and they're filing a new trademark instead.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
So what could that mean? New Excite Truck game? I hope so.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
Is it just for the Virtual Console release? Who knows.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
Did I hear correctly that the sequel to Excite Truck, which you were not a big fan of, but what was it called?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Excite Robot Excite?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Excite Bots.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Excite Bots. That hit Wii U Virtual Console.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
I don't know if you know that but that came out on Wii U Virtual Console this week.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
So it could be a lead-in?

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
It's not a good lead-in because Excite Bots was pretty terrible.

43:48.000 --> 43:55.000
But I mean it was the only sequel who got to Excite Truck.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
It's something.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
It was fucking terrible. They just, you know, I don't know why.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
The Switch is supposedly reimagining all these Wii U games. What about a reimagining of Excite Truck for the Switch?

44:08.000 --> 44:17.000
Maybe they're not going to go back and do a whole new one but maybe they're going to take the old one and buff it up to HD and maybe try to revisit that game.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
I find they add new tracks to the old game. That's really all they should have done for the sequel in the first place.

44:22.000 --> 44:29.000
They didn't need to add all these weird transforming robots and nonsensical...

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Playing poker while you race?

44:30.000 --> 44:37.000
Yeah, playing poker, throwing darts, throwing a pie at a clown. It made no fucking sense. I mean, no sense whatsoever.

44:37.000 --> 44:43.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, that's my theory. As bad as Excite Bots was, at least Nintendo is remembering that was a thing.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
So I'd be down for Excite Truck Remastered.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
It was a great game. It was poorly advertised. It just poorly...

44:50.000 --> 44:58.000
I think it just kind of got lost amongst a lot of the Wii launch titles. I mean, it kind of went up against Zelda and a lot of powerhouse games in the Wii launch.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
So I think it just kind of got lost.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
That's too bad.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
But that would be cool if they at least, if nothing else, do a remaster revisited type of thing.

45:05.000 --> 45:12.000
Anyway, we know that the Nintendo Switch will be given more information and a big reveal on January 12th.

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
That has now been timed. It will not be in the morning. It's going to be an evening presentation.

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
So it will be taking place at 8 o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern on January 12th.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Is that because of Japan, I'm guessing?

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
It probably is because of Japan because that will be more like morning time in Japan.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
Because I think Akuma JP listens to this show around lunch hour in Japan. I don't know exactly how far behind they are.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
So yeah, it's going to be like morning, afternoon in Japan.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
So the only people that are going to get screwed in that is going to be Europe, I guess.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
No, because Europe is 8 hours ahead. Well, ahead of us.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
London is 8 hours ahead.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
That's true. I'm talking one time.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Right now in Japan it's 11.46 am.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
Okay, yeah. So that makes sense. So if this whole thing goes down at what, 8 o'clock?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
In Tokyo anyway.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
So at 8 o'clock Pacific, it will be like 1 or 2 o'clock their time.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
So, but then 8 o'clock Pacific is going to translate to 4 in the morning in London.

46:08.000 --> 46:16.000
So yeah, that's unfortunate. They will probably not get to really watch that live, but it makes sense.

46:16.000 --> 46:26.000
So also, the Switch's price, the release date, games currently in development, all confirmed, will be announced at this event.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
I would imagine this means pre-orders are happening this day too.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
I said this last week and probably the week before and I can't stress this enough.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
If you want to switch, you need to be prepared to do the pre-order on January 12th.

46:38.000 --> 46:45.000
This is why I'm really excited it's in the evening now because now I don't have to worry about is it going to be too busy at work or what's that deal going to be.

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
I would also imagine there may be retailers who will announce when they start taking pre-orders.

46:51.000 --> 47:03.000
For example, I think GameStop, correct me if I'm wrong, for these big, big releases they will do like, okay, this Friday when the stores open we will start taking pre-orders.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Like, they did that for Amiibo and stuff, didn't they?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
I don't know.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
I think they did.

47:07.000 --> 47:14.000
I know they did that with PlayStation VR, that they're okay, our first batch of pre-orders will go out now.

47:14.000 --> 47:24.000
I'm just honestly, if they're actually launching in March, I'm just surprised that window is so short. That is a very short pre-order window.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says PAX South is going to have the Switch playable at the end of January. Oh, I hadn't heard that.

47:30.000 --> 47:41.000
It makes sense though. I mean, if you thought, you know, Miyamoto ending up on Jimmy Fallon was a thing, just wait for how big Nintendo is going to push this thing fast.

47:41.000 --> 47:54.000
And exactly because of what Loki said is, I think this is Nintendo's strategy to try and not have this huge hype-up window, but to just have a very short, concentrated, huge build-up leading into a March launch.

47:54.000 --> 48:03.000
It's going to be very interesting. This is a very not-typical strategy, and I'm kind of excited to see how it plays out for Nintendo, except for the whole fact that hardware is a challenge.

48:03.000 --> 48:09.000
Nintendo, they don't understand, like, there isn't a lack of hype for their stuff. It's just, they don't sell enough of their stuff.

48:09.000 --> 48:21.000
I mean, like, there's, like, no one is, like, un-hyped about the NES Classic. Everybody wants to pick it up, but it's not fucking available. That's the problem.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
You don't need to generate more hype. You've got the hype.

48:24.000 --> 48:35.000
My hope is, with it not being the holidays, you're not going to have all this talk of, oh, the must-have holiday toy is the NES Classic Mini, and all this stuff that's causing those things to be in shortages as well.

48:35.000 --> 48:45.000
At least we don't have to compete with the freaking holidays in March. So, that is a good sign, but, I don't know, it didn't really stop any of the other systems, so, I don't know.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
The 3DS has the same problem in it, launched in March, so...

48:48.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah. So, anyway, that is something to look forward to on January 12th. Also, kind of interesting, some of my Nintendo members are getting Switch invites.

49:00.000 --> 49:11.000
There's some emails going out that say Eventbrite will send out more details, and they have to register right away. So, yeah, some fans are apparently getting emails, random users, to actually go to the event.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
It's supposed to be, I think, in the New York area.

49:13.000 --> 49:21.000
Yeah, so, that's why we haven't... Our invites were clearly lost in the mail, but maybe some of our New York City area people, if they're my Nintendo members...

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I would laugh if I got an invite.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Maybe I would laugh, too. That would be great.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
So, alright.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
SSG100matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
SkyBreakingNews, the PAX South Switch line is already capped.

49:36.000 --> 49:42.000
Sad, but true. Sad, but absolutely true.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
Alright, moving on. DarkSaga.

49:45.000 --> 49:51.000
Well, it's kind of surprising, but not really surprising, because Konami don't fucked up.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
I mean, we all know what they've all fucked up on. We don't have to go into detail.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
It's more like, what haven't they fucked up in the past couple years?

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
We don't have to go into detail on the level of having fucked up-ness.

50:01.000 --> 50:07.000
So, in light of all that, as we all know, Kojima Productions is now a thing.

50:07.000 --> 50:14.000
And the new president of Kojima Productions is a former Konami president.

50:15.000 --> 50:28.000
Hirano Shinji, who once was the head of Konami Europe, is now the main top executive head honcho of Kojima Productions.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
And I think that this is also a really, really fun little middle finger to Konami.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
Well, this sort of thing happens, though, no matter what the industry is.

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
I mean, we kind of are looking at this because it's a big video game, high profile stuff going on.

50:44.000 --> 50:52.000
But sometimes, if a particular company is a sinking ship, so to speak, and somebody finds an opportunity somewhere else,

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
they're going to try to take the best people they know from that sinking ship and take them to that other place.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Like, that happens in other places, too.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
I mean, in y'all's professional lives, you've probably seen something like that. I know I have.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
So, yeah, I'm not terribly surprised to hear about this.

51:09.000 --> 51:17.000
I mean, Kojima, even though he probably strongly dislikes Konami, to put it lightly,

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
I'm sure that applies only to very specific people very high up in management.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
So there's probably other people that he really enjoyed that he's probably been wooing to come work with him.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
I like what Stoppy says. At this point, Konami is like that in-law that keeps getting busted for meth.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
Happy holidays, everybody.

51:34.000 --> 51:45.000
Yeah. But the other talk, too, is that they had done some, of course, plenty of work together when both were still with Konami.

51:45.000 --> 51:57.000
And so it is official that Hirano is going to be working on, or at least assisting Kojima Pro with Death Stranding.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Yay.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Cool.

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
All right. Maybe somebody will be hired to help us all understand the plot. That would be wonderful.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Of course, they don't want to give it away this early.

52:11.000 --> 52:18.000
Well, I will know the plot soon enough when the game's out, so.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
I don't know if I'd use the word soon in discussing Death Stranding's release.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Well, you know what I mean.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I know what you mean. I know what you mean. Of course I do.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Soon is relative.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Yeah.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
This is Blizzard soon type of scale.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
This is eventually.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
All right. Moving on. Loki.

52:33.000 --> 52:40.000
So apparently Capcom is going to be tweaking their rules for rage-quitting on Street Fighter V.

52:40.000 --> 52:52.000
If you are a person that rage-quits quite a bit in Street Fighter V, you're going to actually get branded with a profile icon and also something in your profile that says,

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
Hey, this guy, you know, rage-quits a lot or something to that effect, you know.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
You're going to get a Scarlet Letter.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Yeah, it's basically like a Scarlet Letter.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
That's Scarlet R for rage-quitting.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Uh, yeah.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
So that's good because rage-quitters suck.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
Yeah. I'm curious what you all think about this, especially in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
Is this deserved or is there maybe fear that this could get misapplied to somebody with like a bad internet connection or something like that?

53:23.000 --> 53:32.000
No. You know what? I think this is fine as long as they do it like the same way as like they do like Grand Theft Auto 5 through Grand Theft Auto Online.

53:32.000 --> 53:40.000
Like if you're cheating or exploiting stuff, you'll get put into this like special, you know, place where you only play with cheaters.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
Quitter Island.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
Yeah, Quitter Island or whatever. So, but then after some time you get put back into the normal pool of players.

53:46.000 --> 53:57.000
So I'm hoping that that's kind of the same thing here that after, you know, in case if there's an issue where maybe you had some internet connection problems and you accidentally got put into that, that's not permanent.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
Uh, Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says people are still playing Street Fighter 5.

54:02.000 --> 54:09.000
I get the feeling it's probably not quite the machine that Star Trek Street Fighter 4 was.

54:09.000 --> 54:21.000
But, you know, there was that whole Capcom Cup that happened at the PlayStation experience and, you know, I even caught the tail end of it and I was like, okay, this is, you know, I'm feeling this. This is fun.

54:21.000 --> 54:29.000
But then again, I haven't exactly ran out and bought the game either. I think they screwed the launch of that game so hard. It just kind of, it's fallen off my radar. What can I say?

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
Kaijito in chat says don't troll the rage quitters. Take down their rank.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
Stoppy in chat says I have terrible internet so yes, I would be worried about this.

54:39.000 --> 54:48.000
Let's see. YYR says Street Fighter 5 was just on deeply discounted sale for the holidays. So I figure a bunch of people just grabbed it for $20.

54:48.000 --> 54:56.000
Yeah, I saw that. It was on whatever that sale was on PlayStation recently or the ongoing holiday sale. I think it was a part of that sale.

54:57.000 --> 55:07.000
And yeah, I guess Capcom's thinking they'll make the money with all the, you know, seasoned characters and the additional stuff they're going to throw out there that maybe they only get $20 off you now.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
But maybe you'll be enticed to buy the season 2 pack which will be another $20 or whatever it is.

55:12.000 --> 55:23.000
Yeah, you might be enticed or you can just wait for the goddamn game of the year edition or whatever, you know, collector's edition, alpha arcade, blah blah blah. Just wait. Just wait. It'll come out.

55:24.000 --> 55:33.000
Sj100matt in chat says Quitter Island where there is no tribal council because everyone gave up during the immunity challenge. Yes. It's just like everybody just gave up.

55:33.000 --> 55:46.000
Alright, moving on to a game that I'm very excited about that is coming out next year, hopefully, if nothing gets delayed. Dragon Quest XI. Some of the first details were revealed about Dragon Quest XI.

55:46.000 --> 55:54.000
So part of the reason I'm excited about this is, you know, Dragon Quest X was an MMO which never even came out here so it may as well not exist as far as I'm concerned.

55:54.000 --> 56:02.000
Dragon Quest IX was handheld which is cool but, hmm, so I feel like we haven't had like a console game since Dragon Quest VIII.

56:02.000 --> 56:11.000
So this is fun. I'm excited for Dragon Quest XI which, as a reminder, is coming out for PlayStation 4 and 3DS. So interesting that it's both.

56:11.000 --> 56:24.000
Also in development for the Nintendo Switch. But the Jump Festa event happened in Japan. I believe that is some type of like big, like it's like a Comic Con in Japan for like manga and anime and that type of stuff.

56:24.000 --> 56:36.000
So Jump Festa just happened this week in Japan and there was a new Dragon Quest XI trailer that showed up. There's some more characters that you can see in there and there is a new character called Camus which is a blue haired thief.

56:36.000 --> 56:44.000
That sounds like that, like, wasn't that actually, I'm gonna get a text, wasn't that one of the characters in Suikoden, Shane?

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
And now this guy has blue hair? I would think Shane's very excited about the release of Dragon Quest XI. We'll see.

56:50.000 --> 56:59.000
Anyway, you can check out the trailer. It's out there. It has some of the sweet music in the game that you've grown to expect and all that good stuff. So I'm excited.

56:59.000 --> 57:09.000
And Shane says it's Camus is how you say it. Oh, bummer. That's not how it's written like, though. C-A-M-U-S. But all those funky pronunciations.

57:09.000 --> 57:21.000
Fifth Dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm excited for Dragon Quest Heroes 2. So, alright. Excited for Dragon Quest XI. More details soon, I hope.

57:22.000 --> 57:34.000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Stuff. Well, you all saw that during the whole winter event in Overwatch everyone got these legendary skins, right?

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
Not everyone got them. They're available, yes.

57:39.000 --> 57:50.000
Okay. Well, but a lot of people were bitching about Mei. Because a lot of, pretty much almost everyone else had completely different skins. They were different.

57:50.000 --> 57:58.000
Hers, though, really looked like a reskinning of her normal outfit. I mean, down to everything. Just kind of Santa trimmed.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
Just a palette swap like they do for some of the non-legendary colors.

58:03.000 --> 58:14.000
A few different textures, but yeah. And apparently people were so pissed over it that Blizzard actually apologized.

58:14.000 --> 58:26.000
The game director, Jeff Kaplan, said on the forums, sorry you were disappointed with Mei's winter skin. We just sort of make a gut call based on what we think is cool.

58:27.000 --> 58:42.000
We thought it was pretty special and we had done it specifically based on community suggestions from months ago when people were speculating that we might have a winter event. Apologies that our cool meter was off from yours on this one.

58:42.000 --> 58:49.000
Doesn't she? Oh, actually Shane just texted. Mei has a snowman. Why didn't he just come to the show tonight?

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
She turns into a snowman.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Yeah, she turns into a snowman.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
With her ice block.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
Yeah, which is what people think is cute.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
But her outfit is just a reskin.

58:57.000 --> 59:13.000
There's a part of me that's like, this is a gamershateeverything.com situation. But at the same time, the problem is that Overwatch's system of the loot boxes and charging money for them.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
Yes, you can unlock them in game, but we all know there's people that are dropping a lot of money on loot boxes.

59:18.000 --> 59:33.000
So there's also a part of me that says, well, some of the feedback and irritation is kind of justified now that money is involved that people are paying on top of the game fee of $60, $50, whatever it is you bought it on sale at that price.

59:33.000 --> 59:42.000
So I don't know. I don't know. I kind of think the snowman thing is sort of like, okay, well, that's really cool and different. And I think people will use the skin for that, if nothing else.

59:42.000 --> 59:49.000
But at the same time, if Blizzard's going to charge for this, then eh. If you don't like it, go give them the feedback. Why not?

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
It's more the fact that the other characters were so wildly different and hers pretty much just looked the same. Just a different color.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Alright, just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So this is pretty awesome. Right now, until the 31st of December, you can go download Lost Odyssey for free. That's right. On Xbox 360 or Xbox One with backwards compatibility, there is no reason whatsoever that you shouldn't go just mark this for download.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I did it today. You don't even need Xbox Live Gold to do it. Go do it right now.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Oh, you don't even need gold?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
You don't even need gold.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Wow.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Because my gold's expired.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Seriously? Open a new browser window, go sign into your Microsoft account and get this game because you'll kick yourself if you don't. It's a fantastic JRPG. Worth your time.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Seriously, and it's free. I mean, it's hours worth of entertainment.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I can't believe that they're just giving it away for free.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Yeah, because they added Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey and they're giving it away for free until the end of the year.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I guess they just figure there's no money left to be made off it. Man, I really wish there'd be a Lost Odyssey 2, though.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I'm hoping. Maybe with this offering for free we can get an announcement next year.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I don't know. I kind of think... I don't know what Mistwalker's doing these days. Didn't they move into the mobile space finally? I don't know, but I just feel like that's probably not going to happen.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Honestly, though, a mobile version of Lost Odyssey wouldn't be all that bad. It's a turn-based RPG, so it's not like you need a lot of precision in the controls and everything. I think mobile would be fine, especially just navigating the map and stuff.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000
YYR points out, even if you own the disc, do it. You will then own a digital copy. Yeah, who knows how long the disc will last.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:53.000
YYR continues on to saying they didn't just add them to backwards compatibility. They are now digital copies available. Yeah, that was one of the things. When Lost Odyssey first went backwards compatible, people couldn't buy it on the store.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Yeah, and I think I must have sold my discs at one time because I can't find them anymore, so yes, absolutely, we'll have to play this at some point, either on my 360 or on an Xbox One whenever I get one.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Alright, go get it. You'll kick yourself if you don't. And I need to install Blue Dragon now, too. I keep forgetting they added that one, and I have the disc for that. That one's not free, but...

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I think it's like 20 bucks if you want to pick it up.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Alright, moving on to stories about Pokemon Go, which a lot of our hosts are still playing. I left it out of my gaming week, but I hit level 23 this week in Pokemon Go, so yes, even I'm still playing this a little bit.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Yeah, I'm not playing it that hardcore, but I'm playing it a little bit. What's nice though is now, I think they mixed up where stuff spawns, so usually if I boot up the app, there's at least one or two Pokemon sitting there, so it's kind of nice.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah, same thing here. It was a Pikachu nest, but now the things have rotated. I think we're like a Nidoran male nest or something, not very exciting. Even though I've caught two Jigglypuffs, so it could be a Jigglypuff nest, and I'm just... I don't know.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But anyway, here's the thing, is that there was a lot of changes to Pokemon Go this week, including the addition of Generation 2 Pokemon, sort of. Sort of.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The babies.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Just, what, six or seven babymon are available now, and they only hatch in eggs.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And they're kind of useless, because if you evolve them, they just go back to...

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Yeah, they're really just for Dex people, people that really want Gen 2 Pokemon. Like, I'm not gonna lie, I've been trying to hatch a crazy ton of eggs, because I want an Igglybuff. Like, crazy. A Smoochum would be fucking rad, too.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:48.000
But there really isn't like... I don't think you're gonna get a lot of value off putting these in a gym. I don't see people evolving these into the forums that are more easily catchable other places.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Except for maybe Togepi. Togepi would be the one difference, which apparently somebody on Reddit, because it's always somebody on Reddit, did collect enough Togepi where they were able to evolve it into Togek, or Togekic, sorry, I can never remember the pronunciation.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But they evolved it into the next forum. So that is something you can do, but, you know, very hard to do.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So, yeah, a lot of people are saying this is a really cheap fucking way for Niantic to sell incubators on all this hype.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Uh-huh.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah, I think it would be nice if maybe Niantic would think about giving away some incubators or incentivizing that, or, like, if you visit 10 PokeStops in a day during the holiday event, you'll get an incubator, so you can try to get the Gen 2 Pokemon. Like, I just think...

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Or, here's an idea, because you just, you know, you, you know, sealed out those, you know, wonderful retail deals and brand deals and stuff like that. How about if you visit, like, a Starbucks or something like that, you get an incubator, you know.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Yeah, it ties into something like that.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
You know, first two times, or one time.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah. So, also, if you haven't been keeping track, the Starbucks thing went live, the Sprint thing went live. So, there's a lot more PokeStops out there now if you have Starbucks in your neighborhood, which doesn't everybody... In the U.S. Sorry, this is limited to the U.S. Doesn't everybody in the U.S. have a Starbucks nearby?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Four or five.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I guess, I guess, you know, I take that back there, and before chat, chatters jump down my throat. There are some parts of the country that I guess don't, don't have them. Like, I remember when I was taking all those trips for work out to Pennsylvania. I spent a lot of time out in Allentown.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:38.000
There was, like, no Starbucks anywhere there except for, like, one at a Barnes and Noble, I think. I don't know if that's changed. I haven't been there for, like, eight years, so I don't know if that's changed since then.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:47.000
But I guess there are still some parts of the country that don't have a lot of Starbucks, but maybe they have Sprint stores. I don't know. So, anyway.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Wow, Fifth Dream in chat says, no idea where the nearest one is. I don't have one here. Wow. I guess I just take it for granted being in California that they're, like, everywhere.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Maya in chat points out Dunkin Donuts has the Northeast on lockdown. See, maybe, but when I was in New York City, I still felt like I saw Starbucks everywhere. So, I don't know. Anyway.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:21.000
There you go. That's some of the changes to Pokemon Go. There's also a holiday event, if you haven't already heard. You can now catch Pikachu wearing a Santa hat. The Santa hat will stay with Pikachu after the event is over.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
If you evolve a Pikachu with a Santa hat, it will become a Raichu with a Santa hat.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I've seen wild Raichus as well with Santa hats.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Oh, really? No, I haven't seen those yet.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Catch, yeah.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Oh, cool. So, yeah. Both of those will stay in your inventory permanently, so if you want to celebrate Christmas all the time with your Pokemon, you can do that. So, check that out.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:54.000
All right. Let's move on. We're going to get to our classic game of the week. Before we do our classic game of the week, though, Dark Sakura, I suppose we should tell the listeners what we were talking about before the show.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
So, we're going to do some twists to the show in 2017, right? What a twist.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
We'll be twisting things.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
After 15 years, we need to shake some things up, right?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:14.000
That's going to be 52 games, practically. Maybe less if we skip a week. And I'm running out of good ones.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Now, now. There is a major franchise that's unrepresented.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
No.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Be quiet. All of you. So, what? No, we're not getting rid of the segment.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:36.000
No, we're not getting rid of it, but we're going to change things up. So, next year, on the last, or, you know, I'll probably just do it the second Sunday of the month.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
At some point during the month, once a month.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Because there's not always, the last Sunday's going to change depending, so I'll just always do the second Sunday.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Okay.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I am going to be doing a classic game system of the month.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And I'm going for semi-obscurity, because there are other systems out there that, at least in America, that we haven't heard of.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You know, I've mentioned some, you know, like, I mean, I'm sure people know that there were a series of Atari computers,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
but didn't know that there were games specific to them, or what their capabilities were.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
You know, I've mentioned the ZX Spectrum, I've mentioned the Amstrad CPC, I've mentioned.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The Xbox. I'm just kidding. The Xbox will not be in the list.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000
But, I mean, like, you know, there was, Sega had the Pico back in the day for kids.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
You know, there's all kinds of, you know, CDI, you know, you name it.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
You know, and then regional specific ones. Especially in the handheld market, oh my god.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:56.000
But I figured that we would introduce y'all to a few of the kind of obscure, maybe some not so obscure that you might not be familiar with.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
But some of them are like, oh yeah, I've heard of this, but, like, my rich friend owned one.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Or, like.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Or my friend overseas owned one.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I've seen this in a YouTube video once.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:21.000
You know. So, I've, you know, I've just decided that it would be something that would, you know, throw a little bit of difference in there and introduce y'all to what some of the features of the systems were.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And if you think, oh, that's neat. I think I'll try to find one. Good luck.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Thank you very much, good luck.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Classic console of the month, coming to you in 2017.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Yep.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Except I'm just realizing, do you realize the second Sunday in January? We have no show. So.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well, I'll do it whenever I feel like it.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Thank you. Dark Soccer, don't set a date. Just, it'll be a surprise show once a month. The classic console of the month.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Like, let's see. Oh, it's that time of the month again.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Alright.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I like that. That should be, that should be the intro. And guess what? It's that time of the month. Alright.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
That means I'd have to, like, watch the month cycle and everything, and that just gets annoying.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Alright. For now, though, it's that time of the week. We still have lots of games to cover.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Despite what Dark Soccer says, if she can't think of 52 games, I'll help.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Because there's still lots of Commodore 64 shit she haven't touched. So.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Hey, now.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I'll help. And.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I've touched some of it.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And there's lots of Xbox games you haven't touched.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
And then I needed a shot after I touched it.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Alright. Here it is, the classic game of the week.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:34.000
The classic game of the week is Viewpoint, which is an isometric shooter that came out, of course, in arcades.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:44.000
It was developed by ICOM, but it was released by Sammy and SNK together for the Neo Geo MVS.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:55.000
It came out in 1992, and it is fairly unique that it is Sammy's only game for the Neo Geo MVS.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:05.000
It had one player and two player modes that you play one after each other, although there was simultaneous play and service mode.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:15.000
And you also had, basically it is a shooter, kind of zaxxon-like. On a diagonal plane, though, the way that it did.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:23.000
And the ship had its primary weapons, but it also had bombs, ones that make like a wave of fire.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And then another one that's like a circular nova blast, and another one that does mini missiles.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And the game itself has six stages.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:44.000
The game itself, I mean, it had a home release that came out on the Genesis or Master System.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.000
But the Master System version wasn't even really all that great. It had a lot of slowdown.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:00.000
The company that did the release for it, now For the Life of Me, I can't remember what the company that did the conversion was.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But they are notorious for having done bad conversions, and so it didn't have any other kind of release.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Now, stop distracting me, stop being in chat. At any rate-

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Stop reading chat, Darzagra.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Anyway, there's really not a lot to say about it. Basically, with its isometric viewpoint, it makes it interesting because you have on-screen obstacles to dodge as well as the shooting factors.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
There's places where spiked walls will come out and you have to dodge them.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And you get different shields as the game progresses and other options with it as you go through.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It is a pretty, though, standard shooter. However, it's got really excellent music.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And the graphics are really sharp, especially for the Neo Geo version.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000
But there were other versions that actually looked better. And it's not necessarily a super easy game on top of that.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:16.000
As far as those other versions that came out, and this is sort of actually what inspired me to do the Classic Console of the Week.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Is it-

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Month.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Month, whatever. It's the Classic Console of whenever the fuck that I want to do it.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Whenever I feel like it.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Right? So, anyway, there was, like I said, the Genesis slash Mega Drive version.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.000
There was a Sharp X68000 version. They planned a Saturn version, but it was cancelled.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:50.000
The PlayStation version. It pretty much is just like the Neo Geo version, but it was redeveloped by visual concepts.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And so all of the visuals were redone.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
You know, the layouts and everything are the same. It is the same game.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:05.000
But they did that re-skinning where everything was re-textured.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
But it's pre-rendered graphics. It wasn't live 3D.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
So it was one of those weird, you know, PlayStation era remake works.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Like Sonic 3D kind of looked?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Yeah, kind of.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Sonic 3D, as cool of a game as it was, it kind of looked junky. Like, in retrospect, it looks kind of junky.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Well, Sonic 3D Blast was, in my opinion, I think a precursor to what was being developed as Sonic Adventure, if I recall correctly, for its development cycle.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:45.000
But anyway, the best version of this was on a system that I had only heard of in passing.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And it's called the FM Towns, and it was a Hijitsu computer system.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
In fact, the Towns itself had a console version called the Marty.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And trust me, you guys, you'll be hearing about this, because I was digging deep into this when it was in school.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Spoiler alert.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Well, I'm not going to go any further than that, because I'm going to be talking about it soon.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Anyway, it's the truest arcade version, and that system actually had graphic upscaling, so it was a higher resolution game, and the music was better quality.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:29.000
So it actually was one of the few console ports of that era that improved on the arcade version, so that's pretty notable.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Now, the Genesis version, it was pretty similar to the Neo Geo arcade one, but had fewer enemies, a lower color palette, and had a lot of slowdown.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And the X68000 version was fairly like the Genesis one, although as I recall, I think it had even worse slowdown. It was pretty bad.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:57.000
But, I mean, it all stayed faithful to the graphic style. The only one that's really different graphically is the PlayStation one.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:11.000
So, the game itself got really, really good reviews. In fact, it was awarded Best Graphics and Best Music in a Video Game for EGM's 1992 Video Game Awards.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:23.000
For Famicom 2 Shin, it got a 30 out of 40. The Neo Geo arcade version had really good reviews from computer and video games. It had a 95%.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:33.000
It just really was well received, and of course there were plenty of comparisons to Zaxxon.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Yeah, that's the vibe I totally get from this. It's like a Zaxxon type of game. I like it. I like that a lot.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I've never heard of this before, by the way.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:49.000
The big thing about it is just that the music itself was really interesting. It was one of the big things that stood out. Can we play a little bit?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Yeah, let me turn it up a little bit. Looks like our YouTuber has made it to the second stage of the game.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:06.000
The first level had a little bit more of a hip-hop vibe to it, but this one's a bit dancier.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:14.000
But it was one of the big things that stuck out. That and it's just very striking visuals and animated backgrounds.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:25.000
But the thing that really does stick out for me is just sort of how this did fall into obscurity.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:32.000
We remember Zaxxon, but I'll be perfectly honest, this game to me seems a little bit more fun than Zaxxon.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It's definitely one that actually is not in our Genesis collection that I would like to add.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Although, to be perfectly honest, I would rather find an MVS cart conversion for it and play it on my Neo Geo.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:57.000
There was a sequel played for it for Nintendo 64 called Viewpoint 2064, but Sammy was having problems, so it got cancelled.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:05.000
However, a prototype for it surfaced on October 2015 on an online auction. And that's the last that we've heard of Viewpoint.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Sad.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Sad.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Alright.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Neat game.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Well, if that's all you've got, then there it is.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
That's all I've got.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Our classic game of the week, Viewpoint, spotlighted on the Neo Geo. Although, as StarSucker said, it was on a lot of different systems.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So, check it out.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yep.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Alright, we're going to take a break, but when we come back, we've got plenty more show to come.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Rapid Fire News, Mailbag, what's in stores this week, some stuff on Twitch, some stuff on Mega Man, some stuff on Shenmue 3.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:42.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your calls as well at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, right after this break.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 670 in progress for this December the 18th of 2016.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Part B is beginning right now with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com or those of you that are listening on our magic podcast feed.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And I hope you're subscribed to us on iTunes or Google Play podcast or wherever it is that you found our little show.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Please consider leaving us a nice review while you're there.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
That word of mouth goes an awful long way.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Before we get into Rapid Fire News, I thought I'd ask this question.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Before the theme park thing came up, I thought this would be kind of an appropriate time to talk about this for a kickoff topic.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
But, you know, I was thinking about this since I beat Final Fantasy XV this past week.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
That was kind of like, you know, like the big game that I had to finish this year that I wanted to finish.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
But now that I have a couple weeks left and, you know, there's going to be a few days off of work because of the holidays.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Are there any video games that you feel like you need, like in your backlog, like you really need to finish them this year?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Like there's games you really got to get around to this year.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
And I open this up to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
What do you need to play right now before the year's over?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
There's a lot of games that I've just bought that I have to play that I feel that I'm obligated to play because I purchased them.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Like Watch Dogs 2, I started that and I never really did anything.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I mean, I kind of stopped playing it for a while.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.000
But I have this bad habit, like I keep buying games because they're great deals on PlayStation Network.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And then I'm like, but I really should work on my game and making that stuff.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Like I've been purchasing a ton of VR stuff.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Like I've got a ton of VR games now that I haven't touched at all.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Because I just haven't gotten around to doing that.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
And I even looked at my stuff and I'm like, dude, I can't really leave this VR stuff just sitting here.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Because that's what I did at the Rift.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
You know, I bought a bunch of stuff and I did stuff and then I kind of like let it sit in the box.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So I need to go back in and play some of that some more.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And I do want to.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I've been kind of just picking up stuff as it's cheap.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
But is there any games I really need to finish this year?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Probably not.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I would like to finish Final Fantasy 15.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
But then I'd have to actually start playing Final Fantasy 15.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Hell, even Just Cause 3, which I picked up last year.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I played a little bit and it was buggy shit.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And I really wanted to go finish it.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
But I don't know. Some of those games are just very tedious.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Well, Watch Dogs 2 had kind of an interesting story.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
So I may have to go back to that.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
This seems like a lot of people are really enjoying Watch Dogs 2 more than the first one too.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Yeah, absolutely. I think so.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
And it had like a pretty interesting story.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
It was kind of fun to grind to get all your abilities and stuff.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It's just kind of grindy.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
But even the multiplayer stuff is pretty fun.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
So it would be kind of fun to go back to that.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000
But then again, it's like if I want to have a dumb, just fun experience.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Like Fallout 4, I need to go back to play.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Because I have all the DLC for it and I haven't touched any of it.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That's on my list too.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And I haven't touched any of the mods yet.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I haven't been able to touch it on PlayStation 4 yet.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
That's something that I want to go back to Grand Theft Auto 5 online at some point.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
There's just so many features that they've added since I played last.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
It's just ridiculous.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
We should have some story DLC.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I guess it's never going to happen.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And in Skyrim.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I'm still playing Skyrim even though I've played the same section of Skyrim like 80 times probably.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And it's still fun.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
That's why when they were saying that game's coming out on the Switch, I was like, well it's so old.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000
That's a game you can play over and over because it's so extensive that you forget half the stuff that happens.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And it's like new again.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You know what Alan's been playing a lot lately is Morrowind.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Yes, I see him playing Morrowind all the time.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
He's playing it all the time.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
That's a game I've never played.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I bet I have it in my Steam library if I check.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Oh, I'm sure everybody does.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I think the one Elder Scrolls game I haven't seen him play.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Well, I don't think a lot of people play Arena or the really old ones anymore.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But I don't think I've seen him play Oblivion.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
That's the only one I haven't seen him play.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
He'll probably play that eventually.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I would love a remaster of Oblivion.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Or even Morrowind. Let's do Morrowind too.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Because I've never really touched Morrowind.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
So games you want to finish before the year is over.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I'll get to Dark Soccer in a minute and I'll tell my own.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
But I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Fifth Dream says Telltale Batman.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And that's one that I definitely want to get to as well.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Fifth Dream says Pokemon Moon.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
That's on my list for sure.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I have the team to do it.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Let's sit down and grind that out.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Let's see. Stoppy says Killzone Shadow Fall.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I have too many first person shooter games in the backlog.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Maya says I'm on a race to finish.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
In parentheses, start.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
The Mass Effect series before Andromeda releases.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Get on that.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Let's see. Alan Alchemy says they're rebuilding Morrowind and Oblivion in Skyrim.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Akin to Black Mesa and Half-Life.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
They being officially Bethesda?

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Okay, that makes sense.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
That makes a lot of sense.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
For me, one game that everybody's talking about

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
that I think I can finish pretty quickly

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
because I hear it's only three or four hours long.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I want to play Inside.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Because a lot of people are telling me, seriously, do you need to play that?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I may have that.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I don't remember if I have that or not.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Was it one of those free games?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
There's a lot of games that I have on my PlayStation account

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
that I have no idea what they are.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
If they did do it, I neglected to get it.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Which, you know, my bad on that.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
But that's something I definitely want to get to as well.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
So that's pretty high on my list.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Otherwise, like Fallout 4, I think, as well,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
and Pokemon Sun and Moon, I really want to finish.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Because a lot of people that have played through it say the story gets pretty good

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
in the third and fourth islands.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
So I'm wanting to get there.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And now, Shane just gave me all the Pokemon I wanted.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
So I don't even have to worry about the collection part of it.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
It's just vroom, just get through the game.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Or if you know Earth Defense Force 4.1, it would be nice to go through as well.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Dark Soccer, anything on your list?

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Like, games you have to do before the year's over?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I'm going to finish Dankenronpa 2, maybe.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Nothing really on my half-two list.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I've just been, you know, I'm kind of digging the not being married to a game.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Or my games in general.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I've just been enjoying playing what I want to, when I want to, the way I want to.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I do what I want.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
That's right.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
But I mean, the only one that I would feel like a major obligation to when to get done

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
is Dankenronpa 2, even though I already know how the whole game goes.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Because V3 will be out before too long.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Right. And even though sometimes you might know the ending to a game,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
you still need to play it.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I think a lot of people know how Final Fantasy IV and VI probably end up.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
But if you've never played them, you need to play them.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
They're such good games.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
But not the mobile phone versions.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I think maybe the whole thing is that I know how, what happens to one of the characters I like a whole lot.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And I don't want to get to that point, but at the same time, I'll get there.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And I think SSJ100Matt in our chat really sums up a lot of this nicely in our chat room, saying,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
My backlog will be worse in the next week because of the sale on Steam.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Uh-huh. Yep.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Thankfully though, we're getting to a point, I mean, not much of a point,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
but we're getting to a point where a lot of the games that are on sale, I probably already own.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And so that list every year just keeps getting more and more in your library, in your library.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I'm like, oh, well, I don't remember purchasing that, but there it is.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
This might, I don't mean to keep pushing our rapid news back,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
but this is just something that occurs to me as we're talking about Steam.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And I think this is something I want to discuss and get the listeners' input on this as well.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Does it feel like the bubble might be starting to burst with Steam?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Like, I feel like this year especially, there's been a lot more negative stuff on Steam than there has been in any other year.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And a lot of it's the fact that their store is filled with shovelware at this point.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Like, wasn't there some article this week or last week about how like 40% of the games on Steam were released in this past year?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yeah.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And I think a lot of people are starting to get, like, Valve was the company that could do no wrong.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Like, good guy Gabe Newell, right? Like, there's all this, the Steam sale and the Hallelujah Choir and all that stuff.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
But I feel like there's starting to be a lot more pushback towards Steam.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000
And some of that, I honestly feel like some of that is resentment because Valve hasn't made a fucking game in a long time.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Note, yes, I completely understand the HTC Vive and they've done all that stuff, but there hasn't been a Portal, there hasn't been a Half-Life, there hasn't been Left 4 Dead.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
What game has Valve done recently?

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Dota.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Okay, so Dota. But again, Dota, that's a few years old now.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000
People will, yeah, A, it's a few years old and people are going to strongly disagree with me, but that's kind of a niche game.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
It's a very popular niche game.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Are we still waiting for the new source engine? Because I thought that that's being worked on and once that gets out, then I'm sure there's going to be a game or two with that.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I just, I don't know.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:43.000
The only attention that Steam's had for me lately, I'm looking at the sale now, I just haven't looked at it, is that Hive Swap, the Homestuck game, is now in Greenlight.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:49.000
So I would appreciate it if friends would also just say yes on it so that it gets more trust.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I'm sure that it's going to get through, I mean, come on.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
But I would still appreciate it.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And there's a lot of garbage that gets through.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But here's the thing, it's like, not all that stuff is being voted on Greenlight.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Somehow some of that stuff is getting just published and, I don't know.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I think though, with the sales, I'm not that hyped on their sales anymore because there's so many deals throughout the year, it's like, you know, big deal.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And I think that now that everything's on sale once, you kind of hit the store and you're like, okay, I've seen everything, now I don't have to come back.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
They're not as events as they used to be.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Yeah, because before it was an event and there'd be different things each day and that keeps having you go back to the store, which I think is a good thing.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But now it's like, you see what's on there, you see the list and you're like, well, not anything I really want.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I'm going to go check the other sites that have them be doing the sales at the same time.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Or like, you know, the PlayStation Network.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And I'm sure the same with Live because I haven't really been purchasing on Live because I don't count on there anymore that I use.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
But, you know, they do Flash sales all the time.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
There's always a sale going on, like PlayStation Network stuff.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And that's why I'm touching more than I am my Steam library.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase TOY.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Stoppy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, if by bubble you mean it's not as special as it used to be, then yes, you no longer get good discounts and the quality control is non-existent now.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Kaijuto following up saying Early Access is hurting Steam too.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Lots of unfinished games in Early Access, like the dev just gives up on the game and leaves.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
They rage quit.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And then, let's see, s2100matt saying, where's Ragenator for this conversation?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Yeah, lol, I'm doing it when he's not here.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:44.000
No, but I mean, the whole fact that, you know, maybe Steam isn't as special as it used to be either because of things like good old games, itch.io, you know, these other storefronts.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Origin, shit.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
You know, Origin's come a long way.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I remember when Origin was the thing we all pointed and laughed at.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
But, you know, it's come a long way.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It has its perks.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
I still think there's not enough variety on Origin for me.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
It's very much the EA and Friends store.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
But, you know, it's come a long way.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So, maybe, maybe that's why I kind of feel like Valve needs to, like, make a game.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I don't know.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I don't know what it is.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Anyway, Fifth Dream says Valve can't 3.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
YYR says Valve can't release a game with 3 in its title.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
The world might end.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
And Act Def says, if Leo won an Oscar, Valve can release a game with a 3 on it.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And YYR concludes with this.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Don't worry, super multitasking is coming out next year.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Things are going to turn around.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Woo!

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
That's true.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
At least we have something to look forward to on Steam and possibly other stores.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I really wish, though, like, I don't know how hard it is to publish, like, on the PlayStation platforms anymore.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.000
But I really wish there was something like, you know, XNA or even, like, the PlayStation Mobile stuff that they had before.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Because that was, like, really cool to see all that on there.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
And I know that there's a lot of garbage on Steam.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000
But I think if they just had some way to better review everything, like, a lot of that would be kind of pointed out.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.000
And a lot of the stuff that comes out nowadays you assume is working, and it's just, like, it's straight up broken.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Like, if there's some sort of moderation to get that shit off the storefront, if it's literally not working, then that should be taken down.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, I haven't gotten a booster pack in over a year.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I know it's RNG, but that seems ridiculous to me.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I maybe get one every two or three months.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah, I rarely see them pop up either.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Remember, though, if you're not logging into Steam once a week, you're not eligible.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:30.000
But with all the, you know, Elder Scrolls games that Alan's been playing, I'm sure he's refreshing his eligibility.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
So that's interesting.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Let's see, YYR says, supposedly anyone can publish on PlayStation Network, but you have to have a dev kit.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Same thing on Nintendo platforms. Xbox One requires approval.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Anyway, thank you for the side discussion. Unscripted. Unlisted.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Let's get into some rapid-fire news. Loki.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Alright. So, remember when the last Assassin's Creed game, or, I'm sorry, the kind of update to Assassin's Creed?

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.000
They did, like, the remaster during the Ezio collection.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And one of the, there's a video out there with some of the strange NPCs, because they kind of randomly generate.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And there's, it just like, you know, like, they had a whole problem with rendering faces, you know.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000
So one of the things they did this week is they actually patched out the weird NPC face.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
So that's patch 1.02.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Good, I guess. It's a start.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:40.000
The other thing that's kind of interesting, the new Call of Duty remaster, Modern Warfare remaster, they're going to be getting more maps into the game.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
So that's kind of cool, because when it released, the multiplayer maps weren't all there.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.000
So now they're adding some new stuff, including the variety map packs, so you're going to get all the DLC there.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Also some new game modes, hardpoint, capture point, and gun game.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
This is going to be pretty awesome.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And then they're adding the holiday-themed crash, and some more, yeah, six throwback multiplayer maps, they said.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
So now it should have all of them.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:21.000
The other thing, though, that they're adding, which probably isn't exactly welcome, is customization items.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000
So that means, you know, weapons, reticles, uniforms, camos, and all that stuff.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:33.000
But they're also adding, basically, DLC loot crates with that stuff.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
So a game that didn't have that before, now they're adding it to it.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
In fact, one of the things that they're adding to the game as well is also female skins, player skins.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
But you can only unlock them in a loot crate.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Ooh. That's not a good idea.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Well, they weren't in the original game, but yeah, I think that's stupid.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Alright, well, moving on.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
The NES Classic Edition has apparently become the must-have Christmas thing this year.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Not just for gamers, but for a lot of casual people who grew up in that era.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So it's making these NES Classic Editions impossible to find.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Doesn't help that Nintendo can't do hardware inventories.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But anyhow, apparently there's going to be one more chance to get an NES Classic Edition.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
It will be in stock at various Best Buys on December 20th.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
At over 1,000 stores across the United States.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
But we don't know how many per store or anything like that.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
But they are saying that the NES Classic Edition will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And the Best Buy stores will have a ticketing process for customers waiting in line.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
This is coming from, by the way, Best Buy's corporate site.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
So this is coming from them.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
This is not a rumor or anything like that.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Best Buy is saying, yes, we will have them on December 20th, limited to one per customer.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
So good luck if you're going to go do that.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
You know, Alan asked me, he's like, do you want me to go wait for an NES Classic thing?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
And I thought it was really sweet that he offered to do that, but I'm just, I have to be honest.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I was kind of like, I just don't, I mean, if we get one, cool.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I'll play it. I'll stream with it. It'll be fun, neat.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
They're cool little devices, I guess.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
But I'm not feeling the hype that a lot of people are.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I'm just not.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And actually, this whole limited inventory thing kind of makes me resent it a little bit.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
You know what I mean?

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Like, I just, it makes me want one less.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Because I'm like, I don't want to buy into all this fucking craziness type of thing.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:30.000
But anyway, Yooka-Laylee has a release date.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
You know, Yooka-Laylee that was crowdfunded, right?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Banjo Kazooie is basically spiritual successor from X Rare Devs, now with a company called Playtonic.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Apparently a release date has been announced. It's April 11th for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But guess what? Not happening on the Wii U.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
That's right.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I'm not surprised.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Unforeseen technical issues preventing the release on the Wii U.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
So if you back the game for the Wii U version, you can change your pledge to any of the other versions for free.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Also, you can wait for the Switch port.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
So they are looking into doing a Switch port instead.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000
You could switch your Wii U over to a Switch version in 2017.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Wii U backers for the game will be messaged on how to change the pledges.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
You can also get a straight up refund if you're that mad about the cancellation on Wii U.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:25.000
But it seems logical that, you know, getting cancelled in favor of the Switch, not too surprising.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000
By the way, rumors going around that same thing is about to happen to Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:39.000
So that game on track, excuse me, sneezes are horrible when you're doing radio. Sorry about that.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000
The game is still supposed to be coming out in 2018, but will the Wii U still be connected to your TV in 2018?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
No, that will not be coming out on the Wii U, I guarantee it.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000
So yeah, rumor is that that is going to be the next one that's going to jump ship over to the Switch.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
But again, if you're a Nintendo loyalist, I'm sure you're going to be getting a Switch anyway.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.000
So it's probably not too hard to get upset, because hey, at least that means you'll get the desktop, the console, and the portable version on the Switch.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
So there is that.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
A couple more from Dark Sakura.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Well, for our people who are still playing Minecraft, there's going to be a Fallout themed area with costumes and everything coming.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:30.000
That will come soon on PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U for $5.99.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Oh, they're actually charging for this. It's kind of weird, because a lot of those paid DLCs that they had on other platforms, like on the Wii U, they were like free.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Yeah, but like the Mass Effect one wasn't free.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Yeah, it was.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
What?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
On the Wii U. Yeah, that's weird.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Oh, on the Wii U.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Yeah, because on the Wii U one, my son was playing that, and I was like, wait, I didn't buy any of those.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Your son did it when you weren't like that.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
No, he didn't buy any of those either, but it was just offered.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
But it'll also have a different sandbox area with different objectives to complete, like a mini-campaign.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And also, there is a Kickstarter that is, it looks like they've got 26 days to go, called In the Line of Fire, which is a 3D first person shooter for the Dreamcast, yes, for the Dreamcast.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And it looks like their goal is to raise $45,000. They are at $6,191 as of this moment.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
And it's being developed by Militia Studios.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:40.000
So, if you want a new Dreamcast game, well, if you do 20 bucks, you get your name in the credits.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
If you pay 50, you get the game.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000
So, yay. It looks like a Dreamcast game.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.000
But that's not necessary. I get a kick out of these whole, like, we're going to develop for an old system type of thing.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
It seems like the Dreamcast still has a lot of love, you know?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
It does, but at the same time, you know, sometimes you just gotta let it go.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Let it go, let it go.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I should go, I should go.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Things I can't wait to leave behind in 2016. I actually should have been left behind in 2015.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Anyhow, how about what's in stores this week, Loki?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
As if probably not a lot, right?

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Not a whole ton. There is actually some stuff.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So, this will be pretty much the last releases you get for this year.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
So, starting off, HTC Vive is getting their version of Eagle Flight.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Halo Wars Definitive Edition coming to PC and Xbox One.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Shantae Half-G Hero on PC, PlayStation 4, Vita, Wii U, and Xbox One.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000
The Walking Dead Season 3 Episode 1 and 2, The Ties That Bind.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:52.000
That's going to be coming out on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and mobile.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Wild Guns Reloaded on PlayStation 4.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Don Bradman Cricket 17 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And finally, Roller Coaster Dreams on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Over in Japan, things don't seem to be slowing down this week.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
There's still quite a few releases on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Steep gets its Japanese release. That's the extreme skiing game.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Skiing, snowboarding.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Yeah, extreme winter weather type sports.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Extreme jumping off a mountain.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Steep Mountains, get it? So, Steep is coming out in Japan.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
It's not about making tea.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
No, it is not about making tea.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Steep is coming out in Japan this week.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Also a game called Fushigi no Gensokuyo T.O.D Reloaded.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
It comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
A Sherlock Holmes game on the PlayStation 4.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
The Devil's Daughter comes out this week in Japan as well.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And I think an accessory here, this is a real arcade pro 5, like an arcade fighting stick,

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
which looks like it's pretty heavy duty quality.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
That is out on the PlayStation 4 this week as well.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
The Vita isn't slowing down.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.000
That same Fushigi no Gensokuyo game is out there as well.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Also, Hatsuru Kotonaki Miriyori comes out this week.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Kenkakimi Momoyo Tsuzuri comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And Haru Kannaru Toki no Naka Day 6 Gensou Rondo comes out this week on the Vita as well.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Because the Vita in Japan ain't dead.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
In fact, there's still lots of releases every week.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
And in Japan this week, I'm excited for this, the Sega 3D Collection.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
There's a 3D Collection Part 3 coming out this week in Japan.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
That looks like, I'm trying to see what it has.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
It looks like it has Outrun, or at least one of the Outrun games.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I can't tell which one, I thought Outrun was in a previous one.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
One of the After Burner games, Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000
So there's quite a few of these more, oh actually there they are, it's on the box.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:00.000
After Burner 2, Alien Syndrome, Sonic 2, Super Hang-On, Gunstar Heroes, Bare Knuckle 2, Thunder Force 3, Columns, and Turbo Outrun.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000
All getting the 3D treatment in this latest collection.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And if you need to catch up, there's a triple pack coming out in Japan.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
So check that out.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Also on the 3DS this week, Osomatsu-san Matsumatsuri comes out in a regular and limited edition.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And last but not least, Momotaru Densetsu 2017 Tachigare Nippon.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
It's a train game from Nintendo on the 3DS.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
But we don't ever get those train games over here for whatever reason.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
From the UK we have only a handful of things.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
We have Halo Wars Definitive Edition for Xbox One and PC.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
And perfect for Playstation 4.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
That's it.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Alright, how about the mailbag?

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Oh shit, I didn't open the mailbag, hold on.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Way to go Dark Sakura.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Alright, well every week Dark Sakura prepares well in advance to open up our mailbag.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Which you can participate with by sending an email.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000
And Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag, dive in head first and read some emails that she deems worthy of her presence.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
One of them is in Farsi, I'm deleting it.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
It's probably spam if it's in India.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
It is.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Okay, that's- Farsi is not India.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
What?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Farsi is in India.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
I said it's spam.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
But you said if it's from India.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Oh, I don't- whatever.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Did I say that?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I said if it's spam.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Okay.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Dear OrangeloungeRadio, thanks for the anime recommendations.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I have seen a good amount of anime like Trigun, Sonic X, does that count?

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:50.000
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Detective Conan Bleach, Rurouni Kenshin and Naruto.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I like anime that don't have too much fan service or too much violence.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Anyway, I would like to ask this.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Do you have any characters you want to see in the new Marvel vs. Capcom game?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Also, which two companies do you think should do a crossover fighting game?

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Thanks for the anime recommendations and I hope Dark Sakura gets well.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Oh, thank you.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Sincerely, Jose.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I want Sakura in all the games and Morse Tritor hear you.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I mean, that always makes me happy.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Oh, so characters you want in Marvel vs. Capcom.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I want Devalot.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I'm still hung up on the new cross game.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Which I just want another Capcom vs. N2K.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Is that too much to ask?

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I mean, that's what I really want.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I mean, yes, I know we've already had it, but I want another one.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:39.000
How about a straight up- and I guess this would really be just Smash Brothers,

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
but how about a straight up Nintendo vs. Sega?

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Come on, make all our dreams come true.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Fighting, well, we kind of had that with Smash.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Or put some of the TurboGrafx characters in there too,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
like Keith Courage and Bonk and a pinball table.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
How about Hudson vs. Sammy?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Well, here's the thing.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Who owns all that shit now?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Konami.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000
So the fighting game could be everybody kills Konami.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Whatevs.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
How about that?

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Come on, everybody kills Konami.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Alright.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Including Konami.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Everybody vs. Konami.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Come on, tell me you wouldn't play that.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I would play it.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Everybody vs. Konami.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:24.000
But, I think though, there's plenty of Marvel characters that I would love to see.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I just want Jessica Jones to show up in the fighting game.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
She probably will, to be honest.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I could see them doing that.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Well, especially since the Netflix series was so successful,

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I think that people need to actually go in and read the comics.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Because I want a comic version of her.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
You know, with husband Luke Cage and everything.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I think they still might.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Especially since they're going to have the hole because of the X-Men.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And then Defenders coming up.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
It would make a lot of sense to have Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, X-Men.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Punisher.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Let's get Punisher in there.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
How about we just have a Defenders beat him up.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And like, sarcasm can be one of her side powers.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Ant-Man would be pretty awesome.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
What?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Ant-Man.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
What about from the Capcom side?

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I feel like a lot of that's already been represented.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Because my brain kind of goes, Frank West.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Oh wait, he was in the last one.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Well, clearly my first pick is going to be Bad Box Mega Man.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Because that was totally what I was looking forward to in the last game.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
That was like, hey, you know what?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
When I said I want Mega Man, that's exactly what I meant.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Exactly. Thank you, Capcom. You're awesome.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I want Devilot.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
How about the dude from Bionic Commando?

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
He was already in there.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Was he in there?

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
He was in the last one.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I am playing FMVC3.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
But you know who Devilot is?

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Yeah.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I want her in there with Super 8.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
And, uh, fuck, there was, uh...

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Tabasa from Red Earth.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Fifth Dream in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com suggests Dead or Alive vs Soul Calibur.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
It's been a while since we've had a...

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
That would be fun.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
It's been a while since we've had a Soul Calibur game, hasn't it?

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
That would be fun.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Well, we've had Soul Calibur characters show up in...

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Well, I mean, there's just Yoshimitsu showed up in Tekken.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
No, Yoshimitsu showed up in the Soul Calibur series.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
He was from Tekken.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
But we've had that level of crossover.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
But I would want to see...

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I mean, I would just like to see Mugen released public with DLC packs.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Oh, my God.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I mean, it would be, though, fun, don't you think?

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And have it be, you know, have it be balanced?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Yeah, you know what?

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Soul Calibur 5 in 2012 was the last Soul Calibur game.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
That's what I thought.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I was like, I don't think they ever did a Soul Calibur 6.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:54.000
And that was the one with Ezio from Assassin's Creed was the little character that was a bonus in that game.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
But here's the thing.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
They did do the Soul Calibur Lost Swords, that PlayStation Network free-to-play game.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
There was that in 2014.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
That was fucking terrible.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Yeah.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
That was a fucking terrible game.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
I want to see a new Soul Calibur game with Travis Touchdown as the guest character.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Because that would be awesome.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
So, yeah, I'm all for a new Soul Calibur game.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
How about that?

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Soul Calibur versus Soul Calibur.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000
My brain just had like a weird image that popped up into it.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
What was that?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And it has nothing to do with fighting games, but it does have to do with Konami.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
The 2DX DJ dating sim.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Didn't they have a dating sim like Brooktown or something like that was called on PSP?

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
They tried to put it out here.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
It just didn't really...

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I remember when we were hyping that and I was like, I don't give a shit.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I was just thinking like maybe have like some of the DJs from 2DX's fighting characters.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And I was like, no, that'd be more a dating sim.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
But they can be in Everybody Kills Konami.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Yeah.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
They could show up as an assist or something.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Yeah.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Or they're just playing the sweet beats in the background.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Could be.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Could be.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
But they would have to get killed because everybody kills Konami.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
So.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Alright.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Anyway.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Maybe just be everyone rolls over the Konami headquarters in a tank.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Alright.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000
That's it for our emails.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
But you can email us as well.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Sorry.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
5th Dream in chat.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Winner with this comment.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Beat Mani.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Beat Mania.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
It is.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Alright.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
A whole new version.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Anyway.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
That's it for the emails this week.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Remember.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Next week is the holiday spectacular.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
So I would like to get some season's greetings from y'all.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Especially if you have never emailed the show before.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000
It's time.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
This is time.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Just send an email that says I exist.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Or something.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Just so we hear from some people that I know are out there listening.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I want a letter in Esperanto so I can read it.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Allowed.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
In Esperanto.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Oh you want people to email you in Esperanto.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Don't make it too complicated or nobody's going to email.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Because Esperanto sounds interesting but I don't really know how to pronounce much of anything.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
You can email.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
That doesn't stop me from doing Japanese release dates.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
You can email us in whatever language you like.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
But it has to be romanized because I can't necessarily read it.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Alright.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Let's get back into some news.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Loki.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Alright.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000
So they're doing some enhancements to Twitch live streaming.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000
One of the things that they're doing is automating moderation in chat rooms.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
So it's this automod thing.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.000
It's supposed to allow for I guess nicer chat rooms if you will.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Or more positive chat rooms is the way they're going about it.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:33.000
So it's a new tool for Twitch streamers that employs machine learning and natural language processing to identify and block inappropriate content from appearing in chat.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Which really needs to be in all of...

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
What if I like inappropriate content?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
And I'm sure you can turn it off.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Because it is an option that you can set on your page.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
You don't have to.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
You can opt into it.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
So if you don't want to opt into it then by all means you don't have to opt into it.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
I would like the opposite.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
It just filters out all positive comment.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I want it just to be nasty.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Nasty stuff.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Yeah it seems like Twitch has been doing a lot of changes.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
There isn't just that.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I suppose we should mention they launched the whole IRL category this week.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Did you hear about that?

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
There's a new category they call IRL.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Which made me think, oh this Justin TV thing has gone full circle, hasn't it?

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.000
But apparently they don't want it to be like cameras while you're sleeping and just like live casting.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
But they want it to be like if you want to interact with your audience.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Like you're just like, hi I want to do a question and answer with my audience.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Basically playroom streams is what it sounds like to me.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Which I thought that they had banned.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:41.000
But I'm assuming then they want to do playroom streams without the nudity and the truth or dare and all that stuff that was happening.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Without all the interesting stuff.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Exactly.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Just you know, people answering questions and stuff like that.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I don't know.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Have you guys checked that out?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Tigerclaw is even talking about that in our chat room.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I was going to ask if you guys have checked that out.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Tigerclaw says non-gamers can broadcast on it.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Basically what they used to do when they were Justin TV.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
What's funny though is that they actually have an FAQ and one of the FAQs is.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
So is Twitch just going back to being Justin TV and they said no because you know.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Or they didn't really say like no but they said that's not the intent.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Like it was a different intent and that this is really about interactive.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Interactive is the key thing.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
And I remember in the early days of Justin TV.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Because we used to stream this show on Justin TV before there was a Twitch.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
And I remember at the time we were with All Games Radio and Scott from All Games got really into this.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I think he did a live cast at E3 and all this stuff I remember.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
But it was very much like watch me walk around.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
And Scott was always very good about doing the interaction.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
He totally got that.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
The way we really like it here and the way Bobby's done it with his show for years.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
So I think if you wanted him to go to a certain booth at E3 or something you'd do it.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
And that was kind of like the interaction.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
But there was a lot of people on Justin TV that would just point the camera at themselves.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
They're sleeping and like very mundane stuff.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
But I guess like Big Brother and that type of stuff is popular so there's people that watch it.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Who knows.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:12.000
And at Tigerclaw also pointing out Twitch will let people broadcast live from their phones too.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
And that's going to be a big part of the IRL thing.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
So I think it's kind of like taking on Periscope is what it sounds like to me.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
It really sounds like it's trying to take on Periscope in that regard.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
But we'll see.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Anyhow moving on.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Let's talk about Mega Man.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Oh my god a new Mega Man came? I am so excited.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Well no temper those expectations significantly.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Apparently a recent article in Famitsu Magazine states that all six NES original games are being re-released on January 6th.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Woo that's awesome.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
For iOS and Android.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
That's not awesome.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000
It's not a bundle. They're going to be sold one at a time.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Cheat codes though, auto fire, auto charge and all that stuff are in.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.000
And there will be some type of Rockman Unity app where you can get rewards like wallpaper and like silly things.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And so yeah that is all coming out in Japan on mobile phones.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.000
And I really can't see how this is going to be any fun at all because there's no controllers on phones.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000
But I feel like didn't they already have Mega Man games here in the states?

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Like I thought they released some already and they weren't very good.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I don't know but yeah I could totally see a game that requires such precision to be released on mobile and have totally nothing wrong with it.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Now what is this all leading up to? Apparently a new Mega Man mobile game to tie into the new TV show being released next year.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Wow those are two things I really don't care about.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
That's right I keep forgetting that that new TV show is coming out.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And god it looks terrible just from the screenshots.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:53.000
And god a game based on that on mobile. Man they totally understand the Mega Man franchise and all the key components that make a great Mega Man game.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Not the way to do it.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Not the way to do it.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Crappy design, crappy interface, crappy gameplay. I'm on board.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
And by the way.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
You know what? I think it's going to be greater than Pokemon Go. You watch.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Sure. By the way there was a Mega Man 2 mobile in 2009 and it was pretty bad.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And they patched it a bunch and it's still pretty bad.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000
So there you go. Take it or leave it. Apparently I've left it all these years.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Dark Sakura maybe you have a game we can get more excited about?

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Maybe. It's been a while. Shenmue 3 is actually in its end of development cycle.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Pre-orders actually already went into effect on the 15th.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:49.000
But Sezuk-san said that they're at the final stages of development and they're going to have new videos and such after New Year.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:57.000
And it should be, well, pretty spectacular. So goes the theory.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I mean, I would think with today's graphics, it's going to definitely take a lot more realism into the story.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:11.000
So maybe we'll get more gachapon machines and, you know, space area.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:19.000
YYR in a chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says Shenmue 3 hype with like 17 Y's in it.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Yeah.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Yeah. I guess I'm kind of surprised that this game is already, they're talking about it's being close to done.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
That's a pleasant surprise because a lot of these things that Sony announces at E3, we get to wait years and years and years to play.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Such as, you know, Final Fantasy 15, Last Guardian, although granted we finally got those games this year.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.000
But I don't think anyone's holding their breath too much about, you know, Final Fantasy 7 Remake or Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Although again, rumors say that the 7 Remake Part 1 is happening next year.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
And if it's in 15's engine, I guess it's possible. We'll see.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
There's an iOS game coming out that I'm interested in.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
What's that?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
It's the Bible Girl 666 New York Adventure.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Oh Lord.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I'm sure it'll be as awesome as Dragopolis.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
All right. Just a few more stories for you guys.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
But, oh boy, we have some good stories for our last two stories tonight, don't we, Loki?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Well, everyone's got to get in on the last place, you know, action.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And so, who best to do that than Brazzers, the purveyors of such fine porn parodies.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Like, they had a new Final Fantasy 15 when they had literally nothing to do with Final Fantasy 15.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Yeah, it's called something like getting the car repaired.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000
They don't even call it, like, Final Fuck 15 or something that ties into it.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
It's something about, like, stopping for repairs.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
It has, like, yeah, like, a Sydney...

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Of course, Rama knows. Gas station special.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Thank you, Rama, who is the first chatterer to chime in with that.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Guess what that makes you, Rama?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Just kidding.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
The winner.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
That's right, the winner.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Yeah, so they have, like, that with a Sydney knockoff and she fights some random, like, monster looking thing, which is stupid.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
But, yeah, so they're purveyors of such wonderful things.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
But they're also going to be doing a Let's Play channel.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
So they've got, I guess, their C4 channel.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Sorry, Dark Tetsuya says it's full service station.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Full service station.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
That sounds... Oh, I think Rama got it wrong.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
So, Dark Tetsuya, you know what that makes you?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
The winner.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Who wants some full service?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000
So they have a YouTube channel called Trends with two Zs.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000
And they have adult film stars also doing Let's Plays on games.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So one of the first games that they played on there was Mafia III.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000
And, yeah, you can go check it out and watch them play a game.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Apparently, one of the porn stars, Nikki Benz, is actually quite...

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Or, I'm sorry, actually not...

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Missy Martinez is actually quite a gamer.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.000
She even has, was it her gamer name?

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Bones and Silicone is her gamer tag.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
So, I don't know.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Do you think we could get somebody on the show?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000
No, probably not.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Do you think we could get one of the girls on the show?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Why not? It's to promote their channel.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
I doubt it.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
What do you guys think? Should I send an email?

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Like, that's like saying, like, you can.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
But, I mean, I don't think that they need much promotion.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
People know who they are.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
So, I'm sorry, I've never seen your work before.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Who are you?

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
To be fair, I have no idea who they are.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
If that's, you know, and we all know why.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I have no idea who they are.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Maybe I'd like to, you know, talk about being a gamer with her.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Why not?

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
It's just like any other occupation.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
So, they play games.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Thank you. Thank you, chatters.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Make it happen. Why the hell not?

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Do it. Take a chance.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Fifth Dream says, I don't know who they are and I watch tons of porn.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I've heard of Nikki Benz.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
I just couldn't say, like, you couldn't show me a video, like,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
random video of a bunch of different actresses and then be like,

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
oh, yeah, that's Nikki Benz.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I don't know who she is.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
You wouldn't be able to identify her in a lineup.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I just recognize the name.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
DarkSakura, would you be down for interviewing a streamer,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
a let's player here on the show?

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Sure.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Why not?

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Why not?

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
All right, I'm going to send an email.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000
We'll see what happens.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.000
We have one more story to talk about tonight and I thought we could end on a local note.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.000
And I thought to end on a local note, we could talk about the Florida of Sacramento.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I'm talking about Rocklin.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
You all know Rocklin.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
You locals know Rocklin.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000
It's somewhere between here and Tahoe.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000
We're going to talk about Rocklin, which, by the way, in 2013,

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
why do we call Rocklin the Florida of Sacramento?

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000
This is the same place where – what was this in 2013?

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.000
The teenager, her parents wouldn't let her access the Internet after 10 p.m.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
So, she drugged them with sleeping medicine so that she could get on the Internet.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
That was all over social media.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
That came out of Rocklin.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Well, guess what happened this week, y'all, in Rocklin?

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Kevin Lee Coe went on a spending spree after stealing $4.8 million from his employers.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
So, I guess he was busted this week.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And here's the thing that makes this gaming related.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:27.000
$1 million of that $4.8 million he spent on Game of War.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
That's right, the smartphone game, Game of War.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Federal prosecutors are saying that Kevin Lee Coe, the alleged perpetrator in this incident,

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.000
spent $1 million back on that mobile phone game, Game of War.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.000
On Thursday this week, the 45-year-old Rocklin resident pleaded guilty to money laundering

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:57.000
and wire fraud after being accused of embezzling the funds from his employer, Holt of California.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.000
So, you got to think, Game of War made a million dollars off this one individual.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And that was –

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
That's quite a whale.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
That was dirty money.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
That was dirty money.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.000
My pal Alan is walking into the studio who brought this news to my attention this week

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
and actually suggested the name that Rocklin is the Florida of Sacramento, right?

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Yes.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000
So, what did you want to say on this?

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I'm just wondering what skin was he going for where he was opening up the random box.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
He's like, fucking give me the legendary skin for the character.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
And he just spent – he did that to the tune of a million dollars.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I'm surprised.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I think I know people that did that with Overwatch this past week who may or may not have embezzled the money.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000
No, I'm kidding.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Shush.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Yeah, but anyway.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Did you spend money on Overwatch?

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
I may have given it $10.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Oh, my God.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Alan 2?

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
And you think you know people.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
You think you know people.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Did you get the skin you wanted at least?

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
One of them.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
One of them.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Which one?

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Alan, which one?

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
He's thinking.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
The Pharah one.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
The Pharah one.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Congratulate.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
I don't even know what the Pharah skin is.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
She's one of my favorite people.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
All right.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
There you go.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
So, we'll see what happens in a future week coming out of Rocklin.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
But isn't it always fun to end on a local story?

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
These things are happening right in our backyard.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Anyway, I need to open up the Skype line.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I still don't have Skype even up here in studio, but I'm opening it up right now.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
And once it's up, you can give us a call at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
In the meantime, let me check with my co-hosts and see if anyone has a last minute story they want to go over.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
No.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
No.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
No?

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
No.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
I have donuts that I want to go over.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Donuts?

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
You brought donuts?

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
No, but I want one.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Oh, well that helps me right now.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Or Pinkberry.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
I haven't had Pinkberry in a while.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Somebody needs to fill time because I haven't logged into the Skype account yet.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Well, whose fault is that, Rob?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Then again, I guess it's fair since I didn't have the mailbag open, so whatevs.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Yeah, this is the night where nothing's open.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Well, it's because of the holiday season you're not supposed to open things until Christmas.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
You've been hitting the eggnog already.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
No, I haven't.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
That's the problem.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Okay, now the Skype line is open.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
I'm logged in.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000
So, there it is.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Alright, well if you guys don't have last minute stories, then I actually think I have a couple here I can go over.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:24.000
One of them has to do with Final Fantasy XV and some information about some of the DLC that's coming out for Final Fantasy XV.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000
You can, of course, get the season pass that's available now to get all of this DLC.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
This is not about the holiday update.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
They did release some information about that and I was kind of like, eh.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
But this is something different, actually.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Apparently, they're bringing back Gilgamesh, which is a classic Final Fantasy villain.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
I think it goes back to V.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Yay, Gilgamesh.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I don't know if it goes back.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.000
It has a hilarious cameo in Final Fantasy XIV, one of the better stories in XIV.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
But anyway, Gilgamesh is going to be in the Final Fantasy XV DLC.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.000
He will be in specifically episode Gladiolus, which is, of course, going to be about Gladio.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:06.000
And I'm assuming, again, it's spoilery, but how do I word this without being a spoiler?

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I'm going to choose my words carefully.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:13.000
There's a segment of the game where this DLC would make sense.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I'll say that. That's it.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:24.000
So that's apparently what's going to fill in here where there is a conflict with the popular Final Fantasy antagonist, Gilgamesh.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
And Gilgamesh will only be seen in this episode.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
There will be areas that you otherwise can't get to.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And this is going to be the first season pass episode, so check that out.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Let's see, Gilgamesh not just in Final Fantasy V, but also in VIII, IX, XI, XII, and XIV, and also a lot of the side games.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
I did not realize Gilgamesh was in Final Fantasy VI Advance.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Huh. Go figure.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000
So anyway, we'll see what he looks like in Final Fantasy XV.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Let's put out another call for calls.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Oh, did Skype lock up?

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Skype may have locked up on me, and that way explains why no calls are coming in right now.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Okay.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Thank you, Skype.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Awkward.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Yeah, Skype is not responding. I'm going to hope that this doesn't kill the show when I do this.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Let's not kill the show, because we like being alive.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Yeah, I know. I'm a little worried.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
That's the joy of live radio.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Okay, shows were still streaming, and I was more worried about the recording getting stopped midway.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Okay, I'm going to try Skype one more time.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Okay, YYR says he's trying to call in and it's coming up as busy.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Sorry, I launched Skype and it decided to promptly freeze, so I'm going to try this one more time.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Well, I'll leave everyone with some wisdom.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Do you know what society needs more of?

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Bathing in the blood of your enemies.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
It's good protein.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
What is wrong with you?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
And it's good exfoliating.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
What is actually wrong with you?

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
You're just now asking this?

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Skype is showing up again, so give it another try. We'll see what happens.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Okay, it just lit up and then it went away, but I know people are trying to call in at least.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Alright, let's get to a call.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Hi, you're on Orange Town Radio. Who's this?

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Hi, it's Aaron, YYR.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Hi, Aaron. You got through. We fixed Skype. What's up, buddy?

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Yes, I did.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Well, speaking of bathing in the blood of your enemies and the last story, it's just like I was saying, I mean, it's just like Satan was saying a few weeks ago.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000
It's really easy to go through a million dollars in Game of War. It really is.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:47.000
I have never played Game of War, and I'm very happy to say that, although perhaps I should not judge, because I have probably spent $40 on Pokemon Go.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Yeah, but here's the thing. The buy button in Game of War can spend $100 at one time.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Oh my god, that's just too much.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
And Pikachu's not even in it!

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Yeah, right? You can't get that skin. What's the point, right?

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Have you played it?

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Actually, the main reason I called, honestly, I think this Super Mario Run business is one of the most interesting gaming stories of the year.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
How so?

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Well, you look at how Nintendo launched this game and how they were really trying to be all, well, we're not gonna stoop to their level.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:35.000
We're not gonna take the predatory stance and look for whales and, you know, suck as much money out of people as possible.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:42.000
We're gonna do it with this one $10 purchase, and you have the whole game, and you're good.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:49.000
But, you know what, it's like, sometimes it doesn't matter what you're saying as much as how you're saying it.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Because we've all seen those things where they show you two different ways to ask a survey question and how the results differed.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:05.000
And so, here's the thing. The language of the App Store is, if you see a price, that's what the app costs.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:11.000
If you see free, it costs nothing. If you see get, it's probably free to play, right?

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Right, because I was gonna say that Apple changed that language, God, probably like four years ago just because of that stuff.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.000
So that if it doesn't say free on Super Mario Run, it says get.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Exactly. And over the last couple of years especially, we've pretty much been trained to understand that get means it's free to play with optional in-app purchases.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:41.000
So, now here's the thing. They did explain in the description what the deal was, but nobody reads.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
No.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:51.000
So, everyone goes and downloads this thing, and they play the first three courses, and then they hit the paywall.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:10:00.000
And they're like, what is this? This is a bait and switch. This is anti-consumer. One star, uninstall, I'm out.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And that has led to the two and a half average star rating on iTunes with more people voting one star than any other rating because...

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000
That happens to a lot of apps, though, to be fair. Pokemon Go probably had the same thing when they turned off the tracker.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
I don't think so.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:27.000
It's crazy. I do kind of think Nintendo should have just put a $10 charge on the game. Done. I would have supported if they just didn't have a free demo.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
And a free demo in addition. A separate app.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Yeah. I mean, it used to be done. You would see so-and-so and so-and-so Lite.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Maybe a so-and-so Lite 30 days later or something. I think they could have just made a ton of money if they just sold a $10 app day one.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Exactly. But the other thing I think is wrong with Super Mario Run as far as execution is the fact that they made a score attack game.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:06.000
And not like a game where you go and complete courses, which is by and large in 2016, I don't think there are as many people playing games for score as they are for completion.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Right. Oh, so you're talking about the Toad Run, which is my biggest issue with Super Mario Run is the Toad mode is ridiculous.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Well, even just the normal mode because the courses are like, what, one, two minutes long?

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
True.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:29.000
But that's not the point of the game. The point of the game is to get the coins, to improve your score, to get all the secret coins. But so many people don't care about that.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Yeah.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I really feel like they just completely missed the mark on what mobile gamers, not even mobile gamers, but I mean every Mario game ever released is like, hey, here's some obstacle courses. Can you get through them? Why such a difference now?

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Kind of following up and piggybacking a little bit on what you said about, you know, the way that the game is being received and all that. Sometimes it's not about, you know, what you say or what you do. It's how it's perceived.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:10.000
That is, that is so much of what happens just, God, anywhere on the internet. I mean, how does fake news spread the way it does is becomes such a buzzword in our society because people perceive it one way and want it to be true or don't want it to be true.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.000
So it suddenly becomes fact and perception becomes fact. The reason why we all know the internet is terrible.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:35.000
The reason why I say all that is because, and I know people are not going to agree with me and that's fine, but when you pay the $10 for a game and then it says, and you're going to get these 20 extra tickets for the toad run mode and you're going to get these coins and you're going to get this special question mark block for your village and stuff.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.000
That's all the type of shit I would expect to see in a free to play game.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Yeah, it does look a little weird.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Now I'm left to wonder, am I going to get nickeled and dimed after this $10 thing? And I bet that's what a lot of people are, where a lot of people are really getting mad because they feel like they're going to get nickeled and dimed, even though they're not.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:07.000
They're not, they're not selling those toad tickets or whatever, but just the way they did. And even the way like you have the mine Nintendo coins and you can trade in what, 300 mine Nintendo coins for what? A fucking gold statue.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:14.000
And like these really silly things, right? It's like, it's like the worst parts of the free to play stuff are still there. Does that make sense?

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I know what's also a problem. Nowhere on that purchase screen does it actually explain that that's the whole game. It says it's six worlds, but I mean, yeah, Candy Crush's map, it shows you like the next 50 levels, but it doesn't show you that there's a thousand more behind it.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:39.000
So you could have people thinking, oh, well, I hit the paywall before the end of world one. Who's to say there won't be another paywall next world?

02:13:39.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Right, right. So the perception is, is pretty huge with this. And I think, yeah, I think, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head, even where I kind of get an issue with it. And you know, obviously, I understand what the rules are. And I, you know, but I just something feels just off in the whole design of that currency and everything. And it kind of just, it kind of just snowballs into why I don't like the game. But at the end of the day, I also I just find I don't like the constant run mechanic. I just don't like it as a Mario game.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:25.000
I mean, it's it's it's different. I did manage to play a couple of levels. And then I went back and got like the special the second set of coins in the first course. It's cute. It's interesting. I can see where it would be strategic, but it's just the game is just so fundamentally flawed.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:42.640
Yeah, I just, I like it, but I don't understand what what the developer was going for here. I don't think it was actually who is a DNA that did it. I just I'm not quite sure what their target audience was and how they felt that they would sell it to the target.

02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:53.080
I think there was too much outside influence on this game, I think is what it boils down to. I think too many non gamers had had a say in how this game was going to play out. And I think it shot this game in the foot. I really did.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:56.240
It almost makes me wonder if this was designed at Nintendo in a boardroom.

02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:08.080
Um, possibly. And it kind of sucks for Miyamoto having to be the face of that. You know what I mean? Because I would bet he probably isn't really to blame for hardly any of this.

02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:21.320
You know what, though, as long as he's still eating, I mean, I think that's pretty sweet. You know, like the there were those pictures where he was eating while playing right? Yeah. As long as he's eating something delicious, I think it'll all turn out okay for him.

02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:51.280
He'll be fine. Miyamoto is still a gaming legend, and nothing's ever going to take that away. You know what, there's going to be people out there that say, Rob, yyr, you guys are wrong. I'm loving Super Mario Run. And I play well, I'm not saying it's a bad, you know, unpolished, not a quality game. I think it's definitely quality and polished. I just think it's, you know, one of those things where, you know, we don't know who it's for. And, you know, the target, maybe it wasn't quite marketed the right way to the right people kind of thing.

02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:54.560
Like this would have gone over better as a 3DS game, I think.

02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:58.000
I'm not sure I would have still enjoyed it as 3DS game.

02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:02.360
We also probably would have been able to run, you know, not automatically.

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:15.480
Then it's just a Mario game, which isn't a bad thing necessarily. But I think I think I would just rather play Mario Maker at the end of the day. Still a million levels to explore there. Alright, yyr, I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in more calls. But thank you for the call, buddy.

02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:17.560
Hope you guys have a great week. Take care.

02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.520
Thank you. Have a great holiday if we don't hear from you again.

02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:21.920
Enjoy. Yes. Happy holidays.

02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:22.440
Take care.

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:23.080
Yep.

02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:37.600
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you'd like to call into the show and have your say, you could also try the phone line if you want to try that. 1-877-GAME-OLR is another way to get in on the show as well.

02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:40.600
Wait for those calls to come in.

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:44.720
Which Skype, I know Skype's still working.

02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:50.000
Any other last minute stories? Anyone dig something up?

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:58.800
Um, I, no, I don't really, I can't really think of anything. News is just kind of slow and not very interesting right now.

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:06.000
Alright, they're doing a thing on the Humble Bundle with YODcast where they're doing 30 games for 30 bucks. It's all going to charity.

02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:10.000
Alright, we got it. We got a call coming in. It came in. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:17.360
How dare you, like, make fun of people for buying loot boxes on Overwatch. Like, that's so rude.

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:23.840
You know, did you hear the part where I followed it up with, but I'm not one to judge because I spent 40 bucks on Pokemon Go?

02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:27.440
No, because it didn't matter. Your damage was already done.

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:31.520
Whatever, Shane. Whatever. Is that all you called in to tell me what a rude ass I am?

02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:38.000
Well, I do that regularly anyway, so it's not, like, an important topic to cover on your show.

02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.560
But I did want to say... When's the next episode of Pokestop Podcast, Shane?

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:45.600
When I feel like it. I'm shiny hunting right now. Don't bother me.

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:50.480
Now who's ringing? I got shinies today, so I was happy. I got, like, two so far.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:59.040
No, I was calling in to say that I don't have the internet right now, so I've been

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.000
playing games that aren't online. Like, I can't play Overwatch, which kills me right now since

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.520
it's the holiday event. But it's okay because I opened 82 loot boxes this weekend, so it's fine.

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:15.920
82? How much money for 82 loot boxes?

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:18.080
Well, some of it. I won myself.

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:20.000
Okay, so the two. So what was the 80?

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:26.560
Me? No, no, no. There was more than that that I got myself. Thank you. Me and Jim had, like,

02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:31.760
an Overwatch Wi-Fi party at his house, so we just played, like, in the same room on different

02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:38.560
screens. How come when Jim plays with you, you win loot boxes? Every time I play, we don't win.

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.040
Because we're better.

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:44.000
My feelings are hurt. I'm gonna go cry.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:54.000
No, I was talking to my dad and complaining about how I can't do this Overwatch event. So

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:59.200
he is sending me $50 for Christmas that I could spend on Overwatch. So I was like,

02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:05.280
okay, we'll just do that now. So I bought, I technically bought $60 worth of boxes.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.440
I knew it. I knew it. So you did dip into your own funds a little bit.

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:16.240
Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Because it was better to do a $20 one versus a $10 one.

02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.240
What's the paper noise in the background? Are you eating Taco Bell while you're on the call?

02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:23.600
No, I'm laying in bed. I don't know what paper noise you're talking about.

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:27.840
Do you guys hear it? It sounds like a paper crinkling noise. Maybe it's just your phone.

02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:30.880
Maybe it's your horrible lack of internet phone connection or something like that.

02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:31.520
Probably.

02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:31.920
I don't know.

02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.320
Anyway, that's not why I called. And I am excited about those loot boxes, though,

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.800
because I only need two more skins. And I've got all the holiday ones.

02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:45.120
No, I was calling in because, like I said, I've been playing other games that aren't

02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:51.760
internet connected. And so I went back through finally and beat Res Infinite and unlocked Area X,

02:19:51.760 --> 02:20:00.400
which I've had this game since it launched. And I played in VR. And Area X is the most amazing

02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:06.080
thing ever. It actually bumped to Res Infinite, which I did not want on a top five list for the

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:11.520
year for me because it's the 700th time it's been re-released with a couple new features.

02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:17.360
But I did bump it up to my top five somewhere in there. But I was trying to show it off to

02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:23.040
Annie and Jim. And I didn't have my VR hooked up. So I was like, I'll just play with the normal

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:29.840
controller. Had I not played it in VR, I think I hate this game. I do not think it's nearly as good.

02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:33.760
But didn't you play non-VR, Loki? Didn't you do that?

02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:34.320
I did VR.

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.960
Oh, you did? Oh, I haven't done Area X yet.

02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:43.360
Area X is amazing in VR. I hate the way it controls outside of VR, though. Because in VR,

02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:50.000
you use the stick and your head, you know, in tandem to move around and target things.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:57.120
You just have the analog stick when you don't have VR. And it's just not as good in any sense.

02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.040
It feels like it was specifically made for VR. And they tried to find a way to work it

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:06.160
outside of VR. I don't think it works.

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:11.120
I can kind of cut him some slack for that because it is, I mean, Res is really,

02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.920
this version of Res, anyway, is really designed to be a VR game.

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:18.960
Especially the fourth boss in the regular game. Oh, my God.

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:23.280
You would think that the rest of it would still translate as well as like the original version

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:25.920
or the remastered 360 version or whatever.

02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:30.960
And it may, but it's been so long since I've played a regular Res game without having the VR

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:37.760
that maybe this is the definitive way to play Res now. And it's like, I can't go back because

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:43.440
it feels like I don't have all the control I should have. I don't know.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:49.840
But that Area X is amazing. In fact, because I'm just playing Pokemon and listening to your

02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:57.120
dumb show, I put Res on traveling and it's just playing on my TV, just like in the one area that

02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:01.760
I really like the music for. Just sitting there doing nothing like a screensaver.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.120
Well, how are you going to survive? For how much longer do you have to survive without internet?

02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:12.080
Two weeks. I don't know, because I just also...

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:16.800
Target had an error on the Legend of Korra Blu-ray set. It was 15 instead of 50.

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:20.720
And I just already went through that. Like, I've gone through all four seasons already,

02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:25.840
and I guess I can go through all four again. That's only eight discs, so it's not that much.

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:30.560
Well, I would try to give you ideas, but you called this show dumb, so I don't want to help you.

02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:35.920
Whatever. I do that to everything. And I'm usually right, so it's fine.

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.800
Uh, ActDeft in chat says, uh, Darcicar, you're not on.

02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.520
Now I am. There you go. And it's awesome because I'm here.

02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:49.200
Oh, that's true. Welcome back to the show. Thank you. And I'll still buy your game.

02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:52.640
Um, I forgot that. It's like sitting over there near the...

02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:56.640
Just let me borrow it first. ActDeft says in chat,

02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.600
Shane, you lucky bastard. I wanted to take advantage of that. Talking about the, uh,

02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:04.080
Korra, I guess, target error thing. Yeah, they're really good at errors. Oh,

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:08.560
here's a good story video game too, because you've got like an hour to kill basically still.

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:15.920
Um, so my friend Danny, like he works out of school and his student was like, I guess,

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:20.240
on his phone or something during class and they were on Amazon and there was this like,

02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:25.680
you know how Amazon has, you know, different sellers have storefronts. So it's like you buy

02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:31.280
from them, but Amazon fulfills or whatever. I don't know how Amazon works really. But anyway,

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:37.840
so this one storefront had all these different things up for sale, but they were all a penny.

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:44.400
Like probably a price error. Probably shouldn't have been live. His student bought like five

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:50.480
Chromebooks for a penny each. And then Danny was like, let me jump on this. And they were selling

02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:57.120
regular 3DS too. 3DS XL is not the new version, but the old one for a penny. So he ordered five.

02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:02.880
So he paid a nickel there. Apparently he has a tracking number. They debited his account,

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:09.680
you know, a nickel. So that's ridiculous if this really happened. Where it's gone now. Yeah. It's

02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:14.880
gone now. Yeah. There's a storefront. Better hope those weren't stolen off the back of a truck or

02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:18.880
something. That's what it sounds like. They were actually, they seem to be like a reputable place.

02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:23.200
I think made, well, what he thinks, I think, I don't know. Again, I don't know how Amazon works,

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:29.040
but he thinks maybe they were putting inventory in the system, but accidentally set it to live

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:33.040
and just had those placeholder prices before they were actually going through and doing everything.

02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:39.840
But there was like Chromebooks. There were like a kitchen appliances, 3DSs. I don't know if there

02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:44.880
are any other systems, but I hope he gets his five 3DSs because he's going to give me one.

02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:51.680
What a nice Christmas present. I need a new rice cooker. I'm sad that show or that stores down.

02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:56.800
What's up with that? I need kitchenware. Well, maybe you should work at a school with

02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:00.400
terrible students that are on their phones during your class and then you would get it.

02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:04.800
I'll get right on that. Yep, you should. All right. Anything else you want to share with us

02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:09.280
tonight, Shane? No, everybody should also go play Let It Die if you have a PS4 because that game is

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.800
awesome. I didn't like that game. Well, you're wrong. So it doesn't matter.

02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:15.360
Shane tried to make me play it. I didn't think it was that good.

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:19.200
It's pretty freaking fun. You didn't even do anything in the game. That's why.

02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:22.720
That was ridiculous. I didn't like it. And it sounds like Silent Hill because

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:26.320
the Kiriyamaoka does the music. The music was okay. The music was okay.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000
I'll give it that. Okay, bye. Bye.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:38.160
All right. 1877 Game OLR or of course on Skype, we are Orange Lounge Radio. I'm sure we can

02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:44.080
squeeze in another call if you want to give us a call. Let's see. Looking at chat over

02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:50.160
at live.fognetwork.com. Kossen says new egg has sales on rice cooker sometimes. I just named a

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:55.040
random kitchen appliance. We don't really need one. I legit need a new one. Although, I was

02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:00.880
gonna say that Alan's had that one like forever. We've been dating for seven years. So I would,

02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.400
maybe it is time to get a new one. I don't know. Let's see. Dark Tetsuya in chat talking about

02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.200
Let It Die says I watched some streams of it. It definitely looks like a Suda 51 joint.

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:19.280
So. All right. Well, Skype is going crazy on me and having these weird errors. So unfortunately,

02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:23.040
I think I'm gonna go ahead and close it down for tonight. I'm sorry for those of you that couldn't

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:27.680
get through, but please consider emailing us or tweeting us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:32.800
I will make sure Skype gets upgraded before the next show. Although, this computer is still

02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:39.040
running on Windows XP. So I don't know how much longer that's gonna work. However, I am looking

02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:47.040
into the big upgrade for 2017. So while we're gone during MAGFest, very possibly giving the

02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:51.520
studio some renovations. I just have to see how much it's gonna cost me and all that other stuff.

02:26:51.520 --> 02:27:02.160
So hopefully, we'll get that all fixed. And new and improved Skype line. And maybe if we can,

02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:06.640
maybe we can set up some type of video thing. Although, I know not everybody wants to be on

02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:10.320
cam. But maybe some type of limited video or something we could figure out as well.

02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:16.720
Yeah. Actf says, Studio N 7.1. Rama says, I sent you a Windows 10 key. You're golden. Yeah,

02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:21.520
I know. I know. I will be golden. Just probably not on this computer. This computer's, you know,

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:28.480
this is the computer that the listeners graciously bought for us after I had my diva meltdown. But

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:33.200
you guys might remember, that was like eight years ago. So this computer kind of needs a little bit

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:37.440
of a kick in the pants as well. So that's all stuff that I'm looking into doing. A little

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:43.680
studio upgrade here. So yeah. Actf, the diva computer. Anyway, that is about gonna do it for

02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:47.440
another episode of Orange Lawn Radio. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:52.160
us out. You know, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:56.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.

02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:02.800
That's all we want for the holidays. If you're feeling so generous, a nice five-star review would

02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:07.920
go a long way on whatever website you found this show on, be it iTunes or Google Play,

02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:12.400
wherever. Before we wrap things up tonight, we're gonna go around and get everybody's

02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:22.000
final thought for the night. My final thought tonight is, I think I'm going to probably re-up

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000
wow tonight and I'll play some wow, as I mentioned earlier in the show. I think that would be fun.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.600
Nicky Minaj If I'm on tonight, I'll play with you.

02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:33.360
Yeah. It is Sunday night. Got to work tomorrow. But, you know, that's all right. Short week.

02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:35.840
Thank you, holidays. Nicky Minaj Short week. Oh, for you.

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:38.480
Nicky Minaj Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:42.880
Loki, your final thought. Loki Maybe I guess I'll have to join

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:47.440
up. Wow. Said me never. Nicky Minaj

02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:52.000
And last but not least, somebody who's not quite a hater. Sometimes, Dark Sakura.

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:55.920
I'm not full of hatred. I am full of disappointment,

02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:00.880
but I am not full of hatred. Well, yet. Wait until next year.

02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.160
Nicky Minaj All right. Hey, everybody. Have a great holiday

02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:08.480
because I'm sure many of you will be doing holiday things next week and will not be here live.

02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:13.840
But if you are going to be around, come join our holiday special in seven days with Dark Sakura

02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:19.200
and myself. Unfortunately, Uncle Loki's got real world stuff to tend to, but we'll be here.

02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:23.120
Who knows? You always know during a holiday special, some special guests show up. So who

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:28.960
knows who will join us here in studio on Christmas or first day of Hanukkah or whatever it is you're

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:33.840
celebrating in seven days. We'll see you then. Have a great week, everybody. Happy gaming. Bye.
