Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight's least surprising headline, Pokemon Sun and Moon are the fastest selling Nintendo games in the Americas. Not bad for a still portable only franchise.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll also catch you up on the news and reveals from two gaming events, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 668 of our program for this December the 4th of 2016.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts, coming at you live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-host, Techmaster Loki over there, as he is every week.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hello.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
How's it going?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
My mic's hot.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, your mic is hot?

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
It's sitting next to the vent fan on my laptop. I didn't realize it was so warm.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
I hope the listeners weren't picking that up. That would be a little awkward if all things were started at the beginning of the show.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
It's all good. How was your week?

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Well...

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Okay, we'll leave it at that. I think just that one word response says all we need to know there. That's plenty for me.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Anyway, how's your gate? You said you were thinking about focusing on your game a little more this week. Did that actually happen?

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Sort of, but not. Let me put it this way. I did work in Unity quite a bit this week, not on my game.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
Because I was trying to get back into my game and I realized I was so rusty because I had taken such a long break from it that the basics were kind of lost on me.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
So I started working on another project just for the hell of it. I went through a tutorial for a multiplayer first person shooter game.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
And so I've got the basics of I can move around, I can aim, and I can play multiplayer across the network.

01:59.000 --> 02:09.000
So that was basically it. It was just to kind of get my feet wet again back in Unity. I'm enjoying it quite a bit being able to do that.

02:09.000 --> 02:19.000
And then I was going to work on something else. I've had several concepts I've been working on.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
Then my wife said that I should work on making a new excite truck. So I was looking at the feasibility of that and then actually it's not.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Your wife loves to tease you about video games and all that stuff, but even she likes excite truck.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, because she's playing excite truck right now again. So she wanted to play it again. So I set it up on the Wii U and been doing that.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
But yeah, I was looking at the feasibility of making a new excite truck and it's not that difficult actually. So let me look into that.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Alright, cool. Not joining us here, DarkSakra or Jamie Summers. She's on her continued hiatus from the show due to a work conflict.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
However, I can let you all know she'll be back next Sunday. That work conflict is going to be ending so she'll be back with us for the rest of the shows in December.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
We'll let you know also our holiday schedule with Christmas and New Year's falling on a Sunday. We have to kind of work all that out.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
So we're going to let you guys know next week once the three of us can kind of talk about it. When we will have shows and so forth.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Because not only are there the holidays, but then I will be at MAGFest the very next Sunday.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
So it's kind of like you have a lot of, which is a holiday of sorts for nerds, I think. Especially those of you on the East Coast.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't think a lot of people are that crazy like me that travel all the way through the West Coast.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
But I think a lot of you in the Northeast that are into gaming and stuff, probably a holiday for you guys as well.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
And I look forward to joining you again for my second year at MAGFest. That'll be exciting.

03:35.000 --> 03:44.000
Dark Soccer is out. However, we do have some awesome guests in the studio helping us to help fill her presence with her not being here.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
And some voices you've heard on the show before. Say hello. Welcome back to the show from a few weeks ago.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Say hello to JD is back with us tonight.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Hi.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Or is it JD?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, if you want to say it that way, that's fine.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
That's fine.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I usually don't bother.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
How are you doing? And JD's kind of like the guy that's still a music game enthusiast.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
I certainly don't dislike music games. I know y'all are thinking about the Parappa thing. We'll talk about that later for sure.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
But I don't follow it as closely.

04:12.000 --> 04:21.000
Or somebody will do one of those Bamani jokes that uses one of the newer songs from a 2DX style since they dropped the numbers and went with red and stuff.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And I just go, blink, blink, blink, blink. I don't get it.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
But you make those jokes still.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah. Well, so to be fair, my knowledge has kind of trailed off a bit too.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
Since they stopped making home versions, I haven't been keeping current because it's a lot more effort to go out to the arcade and find where the newest one is.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So I stop at about 16.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
But speaking of going to the arcade, so we went to Roseville Golf Land just out of...

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
We were in Roseville and you remember there was a golf land there and I was like, oh, it's kind of sad now, but we'll still go.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
It really was.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
We'll still go.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
You played Max 2. We did a round of that and that was fun.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And then that was it because that's all the Bamani they have there really.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, and we searched the place pretty good, but they didn't have anything.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I think they had Guitar Freaks that was off.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
They had a Guitar Hero, I think.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah, but that doesn't...

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Well, it doesn't count really because it's not Bamani, but I think it was still there.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
They got rid of a lot of stuff. They used to have a Disney rave there.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Disney did not have that anymore.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
They got rid of that a while ago.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
That surprised me. I thought that thing would be there until the end of time.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
But, okay, here's the thing, though, that I have to ask you about.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
So, I tweeted a picture saying, like, Throwback Saturday.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And it was a picture of you and Alan playing DDR on the Max 2 machine.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And you played DDR barefoot.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
And I was getting tweets back about you playing barefoot.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And, like, nobody was saying the ew cooties thing.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
That would have been the thing I would have tweeted.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
But people were concerned about the safety of your feet.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So you played DDR machines barefoot.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Well, so for some context, I grew up in Florida.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And, you know, like, people dress differently there.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
And so I'm used to wearing sandals all the time.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
And so I just started playing DDR barefoot.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And just that's kind of a thing for me.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Part of it is just I have a better sense of where I am on the pad because I can feel it more.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Like, in shoes you kind of lose some of that.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And it's easy to get off and not realize that you're not where you're needing to be.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
So it's a lot more responsive for me.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And I don't really find it uncomfortable.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Like, I know some people trip and fall or whatever.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
But I think it helps me keep my balance better.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I think it also goes with the whole classic debate.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Like, literally years-old debate about bar versus no bar.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Is things like balance and stuff.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And that's a years-old debate I'm not going to get into tonight.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I mean, I used to be, like, really care about that a lot.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And now I don't. I'm like, oh, you know what? I'm getting older.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
You literally grew up. You grew up, right?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
We all grew up and it's like, this is not worth arguing about.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I'm like, I'm not in the shape I used to be.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And I kind of fall over sometimes.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Like, oh, hey, this is what this is for.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, I can, like, you know. Anyway.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Awesome. I know you got to play a lot of newer music games, too.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Because you were at round one this week.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I'll save that for your gaming week because you probably want to talk a little bit about that there.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
But I want to make sure we introduce as well.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
We just name-checked him and here he is in studio gracing us with his presence again.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Alan's back.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Hello.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Hi, Alan. How are you doing?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm good. How are you?

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm great. So, I don't want to spoil your gaming week too much.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
But I do find it interesting that you were playing the crap out of Skyrim HD.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yes.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
And then all of a sudden, what happened? You regressed into an older, older skulls game.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I fell back to Morrowind, which I've played.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Morrowind was one of those games where I've played, like, the first two hours of it.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Like, five times over the ten years that it's been out or whatever.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I think it's been out, oh god, 2003? Longer.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
But I never got past that hurdle.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
And I finally got some mods and just like, I'm going to dive in and play this for real real.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And I'll talk more about it during my gaming week.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Sure.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, so I was actually going to revisit my new Skyrim hero tonight.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
But I've been playing Morrowind.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Nothing wrong with that.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I just got Elder Scrolls on the brain, I guess.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
We talk about classic games on this show for a reason. Morrowind is a classic at this point.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Well, I think it always was a classic, probably after the day it came out.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
But yeah, certainly a lot of love still for that game.

08:14.000 --> 08:24.000
I can definitely see really awesome things that you could do in Morrowind that honestly were pretty overpowered if you knew how to exploit the mechanic.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
It's not like a hack or anything. It's just like, oh, if you do this and this, this is a legit rule that will work.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
I can see stuff like that in Morrowind that they just got rid of entirely for Skyrim and possibly Oblivion.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Let me ask you real quick about one other game you've been really into, and then I'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Another game that's a couple years old, well at least a year old, but you seem to be really into this.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm trying to understand what your fandom is for this game, and that's Mortal Kombat X.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
I see you watching YouTubes and stuff, so you're into this right now?

08:57.000 --> 09:06.000
Yeah, the thing is that, I don't know if it was January of this year or last year, because I have no concept of time, because it's the end of the year.

09:06.000 --> 09:20.000
Mortal Kombat XL was announced for consoles, and Mortal Kombat X for PC was kind of like abandonware, because the netcode was terrible, versus mode simply did not work.

09:20.000 --> 09:30.000
Of course, people were rightly furious about it in the forums, and it just seemed like dealing with the PC client was more trouble than it's worth, or at least that's the impression that Netherrealm Studios gave.

09:30.000 --> 09:42.000
Well, all of a sudden I noticed, oh, Mortal Kombat XL, which, XL was like the game of the year edition, with all of the extra costumes and fatalities and stuff,

09:42.000 --> 09:56.000
but there were also four or five characters, like Leatherface, Borycho, Triborg, which is like four characters in one, Jason, Alien, all that stuff came to consoles in the XL package, and PC never got that, and I was kind of salty about it.

09:56.000 --> 10:09.000
But all of a sudden, they're like, oh, if you own the main game, which I got during the Steam sale, and pay like eight bucks, you can upgrade to XL, and oh, by the way, here's the performance patch that should have been in the first month,

10:09.000 --> 10:20.000
here's the upgraded netcode so that versus actually works, so it's like, oh, this game is suddenly viable again, because of the fact that they addressed a bunch of issues that they had sort of ignored.

10:20.000 --> 10:32.000
So, I mean, that kind of made you give the game a second look, what maintains your enthusiasm for it, because I imagine there's a lot of people that watch the fatalities one time, giggle, and then that's it, but you've kind of maintained this.

10:32.000 --> 10:49.000
Mortal Kombat X was really sort of infuriating, because the quality of the fighting system, even though I'm not good enough to really take advantage of it, the juggling, the air combos, the detail put into the graphics and the stages and the characters is really incredible,

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
and I really feel that X and also the reboot Mortal Kombat 9, where they just told basically the story of the first three and a half, four games over the course of the narrative of the first one,

10:58.000 --> 11:14.000
really are the best Mortal Kombat games that they've made, it doesn't mean that the previous ones, like I know Shaolin Monks on PS2, which is sort of an adventure fighting game, was really good, so it doesn't mean that the other previous games were bad, but my point being is that

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
There's a right way to reboot a game and there's a wrong way to reboot a game, and Mortal Kombat did a very good job of that, whereas there's been plenty of other franchises that have failed.

11:22.000 --> 11:32.000
If someone really loved Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, they may even say, I might play that for nostalgia, but I actually would rather just play the new Mortal Kombats because they're the same thing but better.

11:32.000 --> 11:46.000
The DLC model that Warner Brothers and other realm studios introduced for X back before XL and the Alien and Jason Pak was really extortionary and awful.

11:46.000 --> 12:09.000
Like it's one of the worst DLC models I've ever seen, where there was a collector's edition that cost like 70 bucks, but then Goro didn't come with it, and Goro was like $10 on his own, and then there was other characters that were like $20 on top of that, and it's like this, if you bought everything the first two months it came out, I almost felt like you could spend $100 or more on it.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Which is why you always wait for the Game of the Year edition.

12:12.000 --> 12:28.000
I also want Warner Brothers to know, not that they listen to the show, but just in case, I want them to know they lost a sale of the game because of that to me, because I knew in the back of my mind they're gonna repackage this in a year as the Game of the Year edition, and sure enough they did, but by that time I moved on.

12:28.000 --> 12:39.000
I never picked up Mortal Kombat, which is tragic because I still recognize, you know what, it's a pretty darn good game, but I think they really screwed up with the whole value thing. They really, really screwed up with it.

12:39.000 --> 12:59.000
They weren't the first and definitely won't be the last that does stuff like that, where there's a collector's edition, oh but you can also get the season pass, like shadiness, but it was just so flagrant that you're gonna pay out the notes for these characters, and if you're into tournaments and stuff you have to have them.

12:59.000 --> 13:08.000
And I know, I'm sure if I listened to go to the OLR archives from a year, a year and a half ago, there were several stories about how disgusting the DLC model was.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Which you can do at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yes.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Hey, by the way, Loki, what do you want to bet? Infinite means infinite DLC. Getting ahead of myself?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
They will have a lot of DLC, I guarantee that.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Infinite means infinite DLC.

13:23.000 --> 13:31.000
Because right now there's no X-Men going to be coming to the movie, because apparently for the Marvel Cinematic rights, which has, I don't understand.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
But the minute they sign that contract, DLC.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Of course, of course.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
It sounds plausible.

13:36.000 --> 13:46.000
But it doesn't make any sense, because we don't have the rights to the Marvel Cinematic universe. It's not a fucking movie, it's a goddamn video game, what the hell does that have to do with anything?

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
$5,000 space on the wheel of plausibility. The minute the X-Men thing gets signed, DLC.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
They stopped doing X-Men because they can't further license off of it. If they want to make a movie, they can't.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
So that's why they've started replacing X-Men with Inhumans. Which, don't even get me started, it's a whole thing.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
Alright, alright, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Sorry, it's totally my fault, but I felt it still was a little topical.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
So some companies still have some things to learn about DLC, clearly.

14:11.000 --> 14:23.000
Yes, so the fact that, oh, this isn't abandoned where they faked it, because it ran really crappy on my decent computer before the performance patch that came out with this.

14:23.000 --> 14:33.000
Depending on which stage I got, it really had lag to it. Now it's a smooth 60 frames per second, regardless of the stage, because they optimized the port.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Because obviously it was made for consoles first, PC second.

14:37.000 --> 14:46.000
And I was like, okay, so I paid whatever, eight, ten bucks. I got all these characters. It works now. I could play online mode versus if I wanted to, which I absolutely don't because I'm terrible.

14:46.000 --> 14:55.000
And I was like, okay, now I can experience this game and have it perform well and see really what an incredible product it is.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
It's a really solid fighting game, and of course the fatalities are as realistic and grosser than they've ever been in X.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
They're not really campy at all. So there's that whole aspect, which is a totally separate thing about violence or whatever in video games.

15:10.000 --> 15:18.000
But it was so well made, and I never got to appreciate it because of how their DLC character model was so extortionary.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
It left a really bad taste in everyone's mouth, and enough time had passed where I had forgiven that.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
Right, right. All right, well, we'll talk to you more about the games you've been playing lately a little bit later on in the show.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
But I want to get to our kickoff topic tonight, which ironically is a little bit about our gaming weeks.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
And I think for a lot of you out there, your gaming weeks, because we talked about this a little bit last week,

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
but a game that many people have been waiting ten years for was finally released this past week.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So one of the big things that happened in gaming news was the release of Final Fantasy XV.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
And I have to give Square Enix some kudos for thinking of this idea, whether you like it or not.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
They've been really good at pushing Final Fantasy XV all over social media,

15:59.000 --> 16:06.000
because this game is really designed to use the crap out of that share button on the PlayStation 4,

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
and even equivalent stuff on the Xbox One, because of this whole selfie thing that Prompto does.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
One of the characters takes pictures throughout the game, and the game is practically like just setting it up.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
It's not begging you to share. You don't get any incentive for sharing, but it's like,

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
it is so easy to share these photographs that look really, really good and serve as a little bit of a memory of your journey.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
So for that reason, I think even the people that aren't playing Final Fantasy XV kind of can't get away from it,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
because it's everywhere, right?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
That's me. I don't have a PS4, so I'm not playing Final Fantasy XV,

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
but I have several different friends who've been sharing photos, and the fanfic writes itself.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
The photos are really good.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Well, what do you think? Let's start with you.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
You've even mentioned to me, I'm more of a Final Fantasy outsider.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
I played VII and VIII, and you've said on the show before, you don't play a lot of modern console systems.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
You focus on music games and stuff from PS2.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
And Nintendo.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
But I know you've watched me play some Final Fantasy XV throughout the weekend,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
and plus what you see on the social media.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
What are your impressions of XV compared to these other games?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
It looks pretty fun. It seems pretty straightforward.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
I've played a bunch of side quests, and that's, to me, the kind of gamer I am.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I like doing side quests more than the regular game half the time.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
So it seems like it'd be pretty fun.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Okay, cool.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Loki, you bought the game, but you've barely touched it, right?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
What's your impressions on XV?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah, so I purchased the game.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I had pre-ordered it the week before, and the fucking PlayStation decided,

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
oh, preload that shit? Fuck that. I'm not doing that.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And so I had the manly go in there to figure out how to get it to start downloading,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
and it finally got the download.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
And it was just about the time to unlock, and it did, and it's all okay, ready to go.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm like, cool.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That was a pretty fast download.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Went in the plate, and oh, sorry, it's not fully fucking downloaded yet.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
But hey, you can play this endless battle mode or something like that.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
So that's what I did.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
It was basically that demo area, and you just run around and kill goblins.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And I did that for about five minutes.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
I got bored, and I'm like, I'm just going to play Skyrim while this downloads.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
And then, unfortunately, that was the last I checked of it.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
So I do like the new battle system a little bit better than what it was in the demo previously.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
I still don't understand if there's a better way to switch weapons between,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
because before it used to be really easy to switch weapons and combo that stuff.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
But it was cumbersome to fight, and then now it's easier to fight,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
but it's cumbersome to switch weapons.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
You mean just hitting the D-pad to switch weapons?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah, but it doesn't have the same flow to it.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Okay, you feel that break in the rhythm when you do it.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah, so it doesn't feel the same.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
But I like it, so we'll see.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm kind of with you.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I don't hate the combat as much as I thought I would based on the demo.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
They really did clean it up from that demo.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
And I'm actually surprised myself.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I thought I would only be able to play the wait mode,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
but I've been playing the normal battle.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah, I tried wait mode, but I wasn't really waiting a whole ton.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
Even the wait mode, you can't wait forever because there is a bar that ticks down.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
So, I don't know. But it was alright.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
I just haven't gotten to play it.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
And it's unfortunately because of an oversharing time.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
It's because of family drama.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Because this goes all the way back to Thanksgiving.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
But apparently my sister and her husband are going through a thing.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And I'm getting dragged.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I didn't realize you were going to air this on air.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm going to get dragged into it.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
And so last night, I was all ready because my wife had gone out with her friend.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I put the kids to bed, or I was about to put the kids to bed.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm like, cool. I mean, you finally get some time.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
You get a few hours to play Final Fantasy XV.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Are you sure you want to bring all the listeners into it too?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah, sure. Why not? Because I don't care.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
And so as soon as I'm about ready to have my wife come,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm like, man, you're home early. What are you doing home early?

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
And she's like, oh, you need to go over to your mom's house or something.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm like, why do I have to do that?

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
And it's like, oh, and apparently she up and took the kid and left and stuff like that.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
And it's just drama. And I'm like, why am I being dragged into this?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I just wanted to play a fucking game.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Just like on Thanksgiving, all I wanted was fucking turkey and mash potatoes and gravy.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Is that too much to ask?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I mean, I dragged into a mediation shit. Whatever.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
So long story short, and this is only going to continue on and it's hell.

20:21.000 --> 20:30.000
But long story short, I haven't been able to play it because my wife has been hogging the TV to play fucking Excite Truck.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
At least she has good taste.

20:32.000 --> 20:39.000
So I haven't had a chance to play more of it. I will get to it, though, because I do want to play it, but I just.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
I have and I could have streamed it to my my console last night to play, but I've actually been trying to do more programing unity.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
So, yeah. All right.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Well, I my thoughts are with you to get through this situation.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Someone who grew up with also a tumultuous family, if they're if they're going to be like, I'll put my business in the street.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
There's nothing wrong with being like, I'll put your business in the street, too, if you're going to drag me into it.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
So I'm totally not judging.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
All right. Fair enough. Hey, guys, I have yet to visit chat this episode. I apologize.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
We're so chatty here in studio, but I do want to remind you guys.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of Geeks Network of Vogue Network dot com.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
And we do have a live chat room. And I definitely want to get your thoughts on Final Fantasy 15 as well.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Or Loki's drama, if you want live dot vogue network dot com.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Rachel here says, I definitely want to get Final Fantasy 15 on Steam, plus the other Final Fantasy I've been missing there.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Well, buddy, you're going to be waiting a little while because they didn't release Final Fantasy 15 on Steam.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
They have not confirmed a PC release of this game at all.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
So did it come out on Xbox one? It did come out on Xbox.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
OK, so it wasn't there was that parody, but there is no PC release.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
That means you've been like by 2020. Yeah, I'm not saying it's never going to happen, but it's just not happening right now.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
Back on the social media and all that stuff I was talking about, Dungeon Buster in chat says, yeah, I'm surprised how good a lot of the pictures are.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah, because what's interesting to me is that a lot of the pictures, like there are things that didn't happen.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
There are things that, here's your favorite word again.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
There are things that plausibly could have happened on the day's journey.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
But the thing that gets me is that Prompto like takes these selfies, right?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
You take pictures of him and his buddies and all that stuff.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
And it's like, I never saw Prompto stop, gather everybody up, extend his arm and take a picture.

22:21.000 --> 22:30.000
So the game takes some kind of liberal decisions with the way it presents the photos because there are things that it's this very interesting hybrid.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
They're not necessarily things you actually watched happen or things like that, but some of it is.

22:35.000 --> 22:43.000
But then it kind of mixes it with things that, well, these are things that happened that day to remind you about the same day because you can save these pictures or tweet them or whatever you want.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, it reminds me like I've seen some online where he's like taking crotch shots and stuff like that.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
So if that's not intentional, then what the fuck, Square Enix?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, no, I think what happened, okay, I tweeted the crotch shot.

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
And what happened with that, I think, is that it probably was intending to take a face picture of the prince, Prince Noctis, while they're driving.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
But sometimes while you're driving, he just up and sits on the hood of the car for a little bit because he's a prince.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
He can do whatever the fuck he wants, right?

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
And so I think for some reason, Prompto, the code was like, take a face picture of Noctis.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
But the game didn't line that up with when Noctis is seated.

23:21.000 --> 23:29.000
So for some reason, it just took a picture of his crotch because that's where his head would have been had he stayed in his fucking seat like you're supposed to do in a moving vehicle.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
But this is Final Fantasy and I suppose magic protects them. I don't know.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
They're just giving us fan service.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
I guess.

23:36.000 --> 23:47.000
I can't wait until we have the news article where some teenager is mimicking how they're driving and riding in the car and getting in a car accident and die.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
Akuma in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Sky, it's a game. I don't want to see my character goofing too much.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
You know what's interesting though is that's what a lot of people seem to really like about this game.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
I don't want to get too far back into this debate about the whole, the cast is all men, really.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
Yes, there are women, but they're not part of the main four.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
You have a group of four that doesn't really change, at least in the opening chapters.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm really trying to not be spoilery here, but you guys know that debate that's been going on and all that stuff, right?

24:23.000 --> 24:34.000
But, to the game's credit, and a lot of people really like this about the game is that they're showing elements of friendship that a lot of games don't really show.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
You know what I mean?

24:35.000 --> 24:45.000
Even though a lot of people say, oh, it's the bro down, ho down, there's things that are on a much deeper level than just the bra, bra, and all that stuff.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
You know what I mean?

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
It's like men that can have empathy and really sensitive, sweet relationships with each other and have it not be gay at all.

24:53.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, I don't want to say feminine men because I don't want to do, but maybe the proper thing would be men expressing femininity.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
But maybe I'm also the wrong person to state this.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
So like Metro.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
I don't even know if that's the right word because that's a different thing.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
But it's just interesting.

25:15.000 --> 25:24.000
Ignis will say at one part, he'll say, oh, your button has been undone on your shirt and you need to sew that up when we get back to camp or I'm going to do it for you.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Is he mom?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
What is this?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
It's vulnerable masculinity.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yes.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Yes.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Vulnerable masculinity.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Yes.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
And we need more of that in gaming.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
It's really, especially in American culture, hard to find good portrayals of that.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
So I'm really glad that they're going there.

25:41.000 --> 25:57.000
So it's interesting because, yeah, even though there is definitely a lack of women in the main group, there's not a lack of emotion and things like that and that deeper level of friendship.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
So it's very, very interesting to me.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
And a lot of people, again, give the game a lot of credit for that.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Some people can do without it.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Some people just want to get in there and kill things, which is fine.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
Okay. Alan, quickly, you've also watched the game, observed the game a little bit. What are your quick thoughts? What's your quick take on this before I get into it?

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Because I've spent 12 hours with it this week. I want to get into it a little.

26:18.000 --> 26:27.000
I just love how you're in such an open world, like you're just running through these sprawling deserts.

26:27.000 --> 26:36.000
And of course, Final Fantasy 13 got all this hate for, oh, it gets better 35 hours in and it's Final Fantasy Corridor 13 and just run down the hallway, blah, blah, blah.

26:36.000 --> 26:44.000
Here is like, you know what? Here you go. We'll give you a waypoint, but just explore this vast BS because this is what you people want.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Interesting when you consider this game started as a 13 spinoff.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
The whole design in that regard is like the antithesis of 13 in a way. Just interesting.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
With the combat, it does look akin to Kingdom Hearts in that it's more action-based.

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
The problem, I know that Noctis can zoom around and warp to different enemies.

27:04.000 --> 27:14.000
But there's a certain point between him and the other three people in the party where it sort of looks like it's so frenetic that it kind of looks like just bodies falling around and being thrown around.

27:14.000 --> 27:22.000
There's kind of a chaos that's not appealing to the combat, just from what I've seen. I don't know how it plays.

27:23.000 --> 27:33.000
It's like more of a style decision than a mechanic. I don't know. But sometimes it looks really fast-paced and precise.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
And other times, I just see bodies being flung around. I can barely understand what's happening.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.000
Because you've been doing side quests most of the time that I've been watching it, so I don't really know how the story is or what's even going on.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
Well, what's interesting is that there's a movie that they put out on Blu-ray, and there's an anime.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Which, by the way, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at live.vognetwork.com is saying,

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Actually, if you watched a Brotherhood anime, yes, Ignis is kind of like the mom.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Well, I wouldn't know that because I didn't watch the anime and I didn't watch the movie.

28:02.000 --> 28:10.000
And I was going to watch it before the game, but then it's like I waited so long to get the game, install the game and all that stuff, because I didn't get it on Monday.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
I had to wait until Tuesday. By the time I was all set up and ready to go, I just wanted to get in and play the damn game.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
And I almost was kind of like, no, if I can't enjoy the game for what it is without all that other stuff, then that's a problem.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
Now, for me, I know a lot of people are saying, oh, you need to see it because it fills in all this stuff.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
I'm not lot. Like, I understand what's going on without it.

28:30.000 --> 28:37.000
I understand there might be like, here's from another perspective and this other stuff that I might be missing out on.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
But I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by not having seen that.

28:41.000 --> 28:48.000
I really don't. But maybe after I go back and watch it, I'll be like, yeah, you guys need to watch that before you play the game.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
But I'm still kind of like, I don't know how I feel about that.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
BioWare has taken on a really nasty habit. It was really bad with Dragon Age Inquisition, which I had a lot of problems with.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
And that technically, no, you didn't need to read the supplemental lore.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
But there was so much of it, especially with Empress Selene and that whole storyline where you go to her ball.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
A lot of the characters that you interact with that only have one or two lines of dialogue are major players in the novel.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
And you would know who the fuck they were if you had read the book.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Otherwise, you're like, why do I care who the snip shit is and why he's talking to me?

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
And then you read the book and it's like, oh, they were a major player.

29:23.000 --> 29:30.000
It's just all this stuff where there are parts of the game that really go over your head unless you've read the supplemental information.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
My point being, I hope this is not a trend.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Well, I will say this. The game does hit the ground running.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
You know what I mean? The plot hits the ground running.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
But I kind of was able to fill in the gaps, I think, maybe just based on what previews I've seen online and all this stuff.

29:46.000 --> 29:53.000
But maybe that's part of it, is that you're not going to be ready to hit the ground running with the game without maybe some of the setup.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I don't know. Just depending on how you play games, I suppose.

29:56.000 --> 30:05.000
But anyway, it's funny you brought up Dragon Age Inquisition because honestly, my gut thought on the game after spending 12 hours with it this week.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Which I know is nothing compared to some people.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
But for me, the guy that can't stick with one game for very long.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Alan, this is an anomaly, right? How much I've played this game this week, right?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Yeah.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
I feel like this...

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
I was going to say, it's not so much how much you play in a week, but whether or not you finish it.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
Because you played the hell out of No Man's Sky that first week.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
Which is funny because I played it again this week, but I'll talk a little more about that in-game movies.

30:32.000 --> 30:41.000
But as far as the Dragon Age Inquisition, I feel like this game is Square Enix's version of Dragon Age Inquisition.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
And that's the best way I can describe this game and what's weird about it.

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
And that's not a bad thing. I love Dragon Age Inquisition, but this game feels like Square's version of Dragon Age Inquisition.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
It's insert Final Fantasy into Dragon Age Inquisition.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
You know, the combat actually kind of reminded me a bit of Tales of Symphonia, except in 3D.

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah, and not the combat, literally, but the open world-ness definitely reminded me of that Hinterlands thing and all that.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And the side quests everywhere.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Yes.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Everywhere side quests.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
And even some of the... I don't know, there's just a lot about it that really reminds me of my time with Dragon Age Inquisition.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
So I know people are not going to agree with me on that, but that's my thought.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
So it's like this game feels like Kingdom Hearts mixed with Dragon Age Inquisition.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
But do you know what game I left out of my comparison there?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
What?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Any other Final Fantasy game.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah. Yeah.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
And that's the weird thing about this Final Fantasy game, is that I can sit here and say, it's a good game.

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
Actually, it's a great game. It's a wonderful game. Does it have flaws? Of course it has flaws. A lot of great games do.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
It's a great game. It's really not Final Fantasy.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It's so outrageously a side story game.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
This is not a Final Fantasy game.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
It's a Gaiden or whatever. That was made a blue chip property.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
I am telling you, this is so funny to me that people will not play 11 or 14 because they're MMOs.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
And I get that. I understand that. A monthly fee on top of the regular fee, that's a lot to ask for.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
But I'm telling you, having played the plots in the game, 14 is way more a Final Fantasy game.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
11 is way more a Final Fantasy game than 15.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I can see that.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
14 does feel like Final Fantasy. Absolutely.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Where's the White Mage?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
There's a lot of weird stuff about this game.

32:25.000 --> 32:35.000
Again, I think the game's great, but it's very, very apparent this was a spinoff game that got injected into the mainline game to recoup the costs.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
And so, I don't think that's going to hurt anything in the long run.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
In the meantime, I haven't looked at chat yet, but I'm sure people will say,

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
Rob, things are going to evolve, things are going to change, and so forth.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
But there's also a lot of people that have really pushed back on some of these changes.

32:51.000 --> 32:58.000
I think a lot of people haven't been big fans of 13 or 12 because combat has slowly shifted away from the active time.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Well, they haven't had ATB since 10.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah. And so, we ride off 11 and 14 because they're MMOs. ATB's not going to work.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
But 12 and 13 had very different types of battle systems.

33:08.000 --> 33:15.000
And then 12 had that disadvantage of it came out at a really bad time right before the new consoles came out.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Or PS3 was already out.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah, a lot of people really skipped it.

33:17.000 --> 33:26.000
And then 13 had all that, the story is BS, which I feel isn't true if you stick with it long enough, but I understand why people hate it.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
And the whole hallway stuff, so I think a lot of people were apprehensive looking at 13.

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
So, it's weird to me that you play this game and the very first thing you see is a Final Fantasy for long-time fans and first-timers.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
And I'm like, really? Because this is nothing like the other games. Nothing.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Yeah, it had very little to do with the classic style.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
I understand. Yes, they put the classic soundtracks in it. It's cute as hell.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
They have the little sprites. They have throwbacks.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Their car has a chocobog decal on it.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Right? There's a guy named Sid.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
Okay, I understand all that, but again, it's more a spin-off game.

34:01.000 --> 34:09.000
It's more Final Fantasy X-2. It's more Final Fantasy Type-0. It's more that than it is a mainline game to me.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
I feel more Final Fantasy in XIV, which many of you have written off because of the monthly fee, I understand, than I feel in XV.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Now, all that aside, again, I think the game is great.

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
Because if I can just take that hat off and go, okay, this isn't really the Final Fantasy I thought it was going to be,

34:25.000 --> 34:31.000
but just as a game, there's a lot to explore. It's gorgeous.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
The battle system, although at first, again, because I'm putting my Final Fantasy hat on,

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
I'm like, this battle system is such a huge departure. It sucks. It's Kingdom Hearts.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
But once I kind of let that go and I take that hat off, I'm like, actually, this is kind of a lot of fun.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
It's kind of fun to go from the warp points to there, and I am playing it live.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
I'm playing on the non-weight mode. I'm playing on normal mode.

34:54.000 --> 35:02.000
It's kind of fun to bounce around and kind of using your heels a different way by using Ignis' ability to regroup everybody.

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
And the death system is interesting, where you don't actually die, but you lose HP until somebody revives you.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
And then only if all that goes to zero do you actually die.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
There's actually nuances about the combat system, and they're like, actually, this is kind of fun to play.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
So I'm enjoying it in that regard.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.000
Side quests, they lack a little bit of character to me, but so do side quests and MMOs and stuff.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
And so do side quests in Dragon Age Inquisition or any other game.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
There's always going to be fetch quests that's like, I need this. Why? I just need it. Go get it.

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah, there's only really certain ways you can do a side quest.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
Whenever an MMO comes out and people say, oh, this is just WoW with a different coat of paint on it.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
It's like, well, yes, because WoW found the methods that you can do this in an online game and have it work.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
So you can't really escape that formula.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
So side quests are always going to be, kill 10 deer, bring me five frogs.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And bring me five frogs of a different color.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Which is literally, you go to that because it's literally a quest I was doing the other day.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah, go to the lake and find me frogs and they could be anywhere.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Let's see, ActDeft is asking, is Final Fantasy XV on the PlayStation 4 Pro worth it?

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
Not yet, because the patch that does the frame rate updates I think is out this next week.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
It's not out right now. But the game looks gorgeous as it is.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
And I understand there's two different graphics modes.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
And I'm on the light mode because they say light will give you better performance.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
And I'm more for better frame rate than I am for the picture.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
But I think even on light it looks gorgeous.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
This is a gorgeous, gorgeous game with varying sceneries.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Yes, you start in the desert and you're in the desert for a little while.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
But you leave that and you go to other areas that look really, really pretty.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
And Final Fantasy games, that has always been a strength of theirs.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
Square Enix knows how to push the graphic limitations of the systems they're developing for.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
They've done this ever since the original Final Fantasy, really.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
So it's no different in Final Fantasy XV. I'm loving that.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Soundtrack is gorgeous.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
Yes, you can listen to soundtracks from other games.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
But I kind of do that in the car.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
But the battle theme I just had happen, which was a new battle theme.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Because I think I was in a newer area. It was awesome.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I'm liking discovering things like that.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
So anyway, I could go on and on.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
But at the end of the day, I do think the game is interesting.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I want to wait to talk about the story.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
Because I'm only on Chapter 3, yet my characters are level 28.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Because I can't stop doing side quests.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
But is that a bad thing?

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
I don't think so. I think that just shows I'm kind of into what's going on.

37:47.000 --> 37:54.000
And I think, again, part of the relationship unfolding and seeing all of that and how the characters interact with each other.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
While there are some stock lines where I kind of go, stop saying that.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
You say that every time we do something, stop saying that.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
There's other things that you kind of discover as you move on that are really cool.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Like those car rides.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
If you want to go from one area to another, you can get in the car and you can have Ignis drive the car.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
I don't like to do the driving because I'll flip the car over a cliff.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
So I usually let Ignis do the driving.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
So he drives and so literally you are just sitting there waiting.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
It's like flight points in an MMO.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
You're sitting there waiting for your car to go from one point to the other.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
Now, they sweeten the pot a little bit because you can listen to classic soundtracks.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
You can use the shop while you're in the car going.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
There's like a base shop, like the internet or something you can do.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
But sometimes you want to pay attention because Prompto might speak up and say,

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Hey, I want to go down there and get a picture. Let's go do that.

38:42.000 --> 38:49.000
And there's something about that that makes the game, like it kind of elevates the immersion for me that I really enjoy.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
About that.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Where you go, yeah, go ahead. Go on down there. We'll meet you.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
And then keep driving.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Hit the gas. Ha ha ha. Dumbass.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
No, you can't do that.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
But that's what bros do.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
That's true. But these guys are more sensitive bros. They're not going to do that to each other.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
So, anyway.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I almost said that to my son the other day.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
What did you say?

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
I'm like, because I was parked too far in my driveway, too far to the right and I wanted to straighten the car out.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
And so I'm all, just go by the front door so that you're not on the way to the car and I'm just going to straighten the car.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
And I backed out and I told my other son, I'm like, okay, let's leave him here.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
He comes looking out and he's like, are you leaving me?

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Alright.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Yes, I am.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Chatters, if you've played 15, what are your thoughts?

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Live.vognetwork.com. Try to keep them tweet sized.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
I want to read your thoughts real quick here on those of you that have spent some time with the game.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Dungeon Buster says, too many side quests is never a bad thing, Sky.

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
Whenever an open world game allows me to cut free from the main story, it's off I go to become a walking god before coming back to it and steamroll the next few boxes.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Yes, me too.

39:54.000 --> 40:04.000
And to be fair, it is a very Final Fantasy way for me to play games is to power level the crap out of my characters and then you go back and you can kill the boss easy peasy.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Like, and I've always done that in Final Fantasy games.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
So this game kind of lets you still do that but in a different way.

40:09.000 --> 40:17.000
I mean, how come in Final Fantasy games you will do all the side quests for the XP and gil but in a Pokemon game you have to keep the story moving.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
You can't linger or else it will drive you insane and you'll put the game down.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
How is that different?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
I'm sorry, say that one more time.

40:24.000 --> 40:32.000
In Final Fantasy you'll do all the side quests and not necessarily go to a new location or major plot point in the main story because you're doing side quests.

40:32.000 --> 40:43.000
But when you're playing a game like Pokemon, you catch what you can and keep it moving because if you like, oh I want to catch this, this, and this and grind my Pokemon to this, this, and this, like you can't play the game that way.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Well easy, there must not be that enjoyable.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Like, I just see it's a different style. I know it's a different style of game but...

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
It is. I can't, I don't know if I can put my finger on what it is.

40:54.000 --> 41:02.000
Like, I think maybe with Pokemon they don't track as easily. That's one big thing.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That's what the Pokedex is for.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
No, I'm not talking about necessarily that. I'm talking about the actual side quests and things like that.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
You kind of have to remember what you're doing and that can sometimes be a bear.

41:11.000 --> 41:17.000
Whereas when you're tracking in a game like Dragon Age or Final Fantasy, you see everything, you see your agenda and your list.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
You have a journal. You have a quest journal.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Exactly. And you know my memory is crap.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
So I think that makes it a little...

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
Actually, that system you mentioned, if that came to Pokemon, I would love that. I would really, really love that.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
But it's not, so it is what it is.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
I know some of the older Final Fantasy games have a bunch of side quests and some of them are missable.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Like, if you don't do this at this point in the story, you don't get to do it at all.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
So that's, you know...

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
Hey, you know that character you wanted to be in your party? Well, you missed him.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Yeah.

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
Alright, let's see. Go into the chat again over at live.vognetwork.com and looking for some comments here.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
DungeonBuster says, I love it when a game lets you explore, though. I'm a sucker for poking around and seeing if there might be something cool hidden in a forgotten corner.

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
In the first dungeon, I didn't want to leave when the quest was done because I wanted to keep exploring what might be behind those locked doors or the next cave.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Anyway, I want to go to the Skype line real quick, a little bit out of character.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
But I'm getting a phone call because somebody's listening in his car.

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
And this happens all the time. Of course he feels very opposite how I do on this game.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
So he said, you need to let me call in, so I'm doing it.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
Welcome to the show, everybody. Live from his car, Shane.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
Live from the Del Taco drive-thru, basically.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
Alright, you're a little quiet, so just make sure you're speaking into the speaker.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Okay, is that better?

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
I guess. What are your thoughts on Final Fantasy XV?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
I'm ready to trade it in because it's not fun.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
Why? I need more whys. Why aren't you enjoying the game?

42:44.000 --> 42:51.000
Let me preface this with I'm about, I think last count said like 16 or 17 hours.

42:51.000 --> 42:58.000
And I am at the end of chapter 7, I think.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
And one, there's no story still. I'm bored out of my mind.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
I don't like the combat. The characters aren't interesting.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.000
I don't think it particularly looks good as a PS4 game.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
And it's just like a piece of crap.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I think that pretty much sums it up.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
A piece of crap, really? Like, I can understand.

43:22.000 --> 43:34.000
For a game that has been 10 years in the making, I think I hold garbage games like No Man's Sky in higher regard.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
Like, I tried to like this game. I'm still trying to power through it just to say I beat it.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
But I'm not having a good time.

43:41.000 --> 43:50.000
And it feels like you're supposed to already understand everything that's going on in the game, but they never tell you anything.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Ever.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Did you watch the movie or the anime or any of that?

43:53.000 --> 44:01.000
I watched, okay, first of all, if you're supposed to watch all this extra media to understand the story for a game, there's something wrong with your game.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I'll agree with that.

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
But I did watch Kingsglaive, which actually was pretty good. I liked that movie. I didn't watch the anime, though.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Huh.

44:11.000 --> 44:19.000
But the combat never gets fun. All I do is like, so I ride in my chocobo around, which is kind of okay.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
But if I'm doing anything else, I turn on my, at one point you get an MP3 player, like the music in your car.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
I just put on Final Fantasy XI music because the music in this game is so forgettable.

44:29.000 --> 44:38.000
I completely disagree. There are, there's like the battle songs when you're doing the quest for going out to get the cargo in the car and you get to this newer area.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Like that battle song is amazing.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I don't agree at all.

44:42.000 --> 44:52.000
I was going to say Ziba in chat and Act Deft as well are both saying in unison to you saying you don't like the game. Why? And they both said it's not Pokemon.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
That's not true because I play other games that aren't Pokemon. Granted, I have over 100 hours in Pokemon Moon already.

44:58.000 --> 45:09.000
But no, the game, it's just, it feels very lifeless and hollow. Like, kind of like a cash grab game, sort of.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
The interactions between the characters do nothing for you. You don't, the, like I would think.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
I don't find the characters endearing. Like Prompto is sometimes kind of funny, but usually annoying.

45:19.000 --> 45:26.000
I'm sick of Ignis figuring out recipes to cook because he can only say the one line whenever he figures it out.

45:26.000 --> 45:35.000
And Gladio is, I didn't even care for. Noctis is okay. Noctis I'm actually okay with as a character. He needs a better supporting cast though.

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
But what about that whole like brotherly friendship they show in the game that like, I don't know if I've ever seen in a video game before?

45:41.000 --> 45:55.000
They just seem like party members to me. Like they kind of goof around, I guess. But it's like the dialogue and the like relationships they have, I expect in games now.

45:55.000 --> 46:03.000
It's like, maybe it's novel for Final Fantasy, but I don't feel it's novel for other games I've played and have done much better.

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
All right. Like there's just things like I just, I'm sitting here going, I just don't get it when Shane says, like with the graphics and all that stuff.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
Like I just don't get how you can think this is an ugly game. I'm just, I don't.

46:15.000 --> 46:25.000
I don't, let me rephrase. I don't think it's ugly. I just, I'm not wowed by the graphics. I think there are other PS4 games that look much, much, much better.

46:25.000 --> 46:37.000
They clearly only spent time on the character models for like the main characters, all the NPCs. Like there's four different NPCs, basically the entire game.

46:37.000 --> 46:43.000
And I think Final Fantasy 10, like all of these came from there and they slightly up-res their models.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
I don't know. I think they spent quite a bit of time on Sydney.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
Okay. Well, no, see, she's like a main character. I hate her. She is terrible by the way.

46:53.000 --> 47:07.000
Like honestly, she is not a good, like, like they kind of pushed her in the tree views and stuff. It's like, look, we have a female character in the game and it's like, that's not the one.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
That's not helping.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
That's not, that's not helping. And like her character is awful. Yeah. I agree. Her character is not.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
She has to breathe through her skin. That's why she's naked.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I was about to, I was about to make a quiet joke too.

47:18.000 --> 47:32.000
Here's the thing. And again, I don't want to be spoilery. There are other women, they're not showing. That's all I'm going to say, but they, but they not nobody, but to be fair, nobody plays at that level that the four main, the four main dudes do.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
So anyway, I just leave it at that.

47:34.000 --> 47:43.000
But let, let me just say, if you're playing this game and you expect the story to pick up, it has not, and I'm in chapter seven, which I hear there's only like 10 chapters in the game.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Okay. So I still feel like nothing has happened.

47:46.000 --> 47:55.000
Okay. I do want to move on from 15 because there's been a lot of news this week, but I got, I got a couple other quick questions for you. First off. I love this comment from chat. This is perfect. Alan, get ready to laugh. You ready? Okay.

47:55.000 --> 48:05.000
Okay. And chat says, if Shane was a dentist, he would be that one dentist out of the nine of 10 that wouldn't recommend the toothbrush or toothpaste.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
If it was blue, I would.

48:08.000 --> 48:16.000
That's like the perfect, like, like just, Hey, Shane, you want to try it and don't get me started.

48:16.000 --> 48:27.000
I don't, but see, that's the thing. I don't get it. Like people like, cause I've posted on Twitter, my thoughts and I've had these arguments. I'm like, why is it wrong for me to not like this game? No, you're, you're welcome to your opinion.

48:27.000 --> 48:43.000
I'm just, I'm trying to understand it because I, I so don't get it like, but this is not the first time you and I, your, your rash conversation about a video game, you're going to have issues with people thinking that your rationality or your rationale is not relatable.

48:43.000 --> 48:59.000
That's really, I think the issue, which is fine because I don't think everybody likes everything I like, but when I've put so much time when there's only supposed to be 10 chapters and I'm about to finish seven, I think I have a pretty good grasp on the systems and everything that I feel like I can say, Hey, you know what?

48:59.000 --> 49:08.000
Holding down the circle button. Isn't a really fun way to play a game. At least there's one thing we can all agree on is that that new design of alpha five is fucking terrible.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
If they got rid of his eyes, I'd be okay with it. Those little eye things are weird though.

49:12.000 --> 49:25.000
All right. Um, I want to ask you this too, because early on, you know, one of the things I said about the game is that it doesn't feel like final fantasy at all to me. Do you, do you agree with me on that or what are your thoughts on that conversation?

49:25.000 --> 49:35.000
It doesn't feel like one at all. And like, I wouldn't send the biggest final fantasy fan, but I tend to like a lot of them. I think there's only a few I I've played that I didn't really care for.

49:35.000 --> 49:47.000
And this one included, but, um, it doesn't, I think it falls under final fantasy because there's chocobos and there's a Sid and there's a crystal.

49:47.000 --> 49:56.000
There you go. I think that's really it. Otherwise this could be generic open world Japanese game. Number one.

49:56.000 --> 50:03.000
But are there mogs? Because there has to, has to be mogs in order to be, I hear there are, there are single one there.

50:03.000 --> 50:10.000
There are because somebody spoiled it in a GIF on tumblers. That's all I'm going to say. Um, what did you think when I called it the Japanese dragon age inquisition?

50:10.000 --> 50:20.000
I think that's really mean to inquisition. I think, but if I remember right, that was also a game you were really excited for and then you also didn't care for at the end of the day.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
Or was that, am I confused? I liked it. I never beat it. Maybe I'm confusing that with Alan. Alan felt more negative about that than you did.

50:26.000 --> 50:35.000
And maybe I think the problem with inquisition was that like the first place they sent you to was so massive and you just wanted to stay there forever here.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
I want to get out of every area as fast as I can because they're pretty bland.

50:40.000 --> 50:55.000
All right. I do want to move on with the show where every gamer has a voice. Shane, thank you for expressing your opinion, even though like honestly I don't get it, but I still, you know, I wouldn't be friends with you if I didn't respect your opinion.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
So see if you feel the same way once you get to where I'm at, if it's picked up for you.

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
If somebody could tell me where it's fun at, maybe I would have more fun. I just haven't found it yet.

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
You know what? And I do kind of preface everything I've been saying tonight. And I said that at the beginning is, well, that's why I told you guys, I've played 12 hours.

51:10.000 --> 51:18.000
I'm only on chapter three, but I'm doing all the side quest stuff because I do want to reserve that right that, you know, when I play more of the story, the story might end up being really bad.

51:18.000 --> 51:27.000
I'm into it so far, but maybe it will take a dive. And if it does, I'll come back on next week and tell you guys I changed my mind on some things.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
That happens with games sometimes, right? Hating Mass Effect at first, but then playing it...

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Oh yeah, Mass Effect 1 was garbage until I...

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Playing it the second time, you're like, oh my God, I was so wrong about this.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Exactly.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
Yeah. All right. Shane, what's your Pokedex in Sun and Moon up to?

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
A hundred percent.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
A hundred percent. Congrats. How many shinies?

51:45.000 --> 51:55.000
Zero. I have killed like 700 rock roughs at this point. Like, I don't think they exist anymore because I've murdered them all trying to get a shiny.

51:55.000 --> 52:04.000
All right. Well, I can at least agree with you that Sun and Moon is probably the best Pokemon game, but SOS battles ruin it.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
Oh, nope. They're awesome. You can prevent them.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
SOS battles are the worst. The worst thing that's ever happened to the Pokemon franchise.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
No.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
They're a pretty annoying mechanic.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
All right. Shane, I'm gonna let you go so we can move on with the show.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
All right, bye.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Bye.

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
All right. Shane from Ranger Pride and Pokestop Podcast, both on the VoG network, VoGnetwork.com.

52:25.000 --> 52:36.000
All right. Let's... I want to get into other stuff we played in our gaming weeks, but I do want to say, if you guys have further thoughts on Final Fantasy XV, I'd really love to hear them over in our mailbag.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
Participate at orangelountrader.com. We'll read some of those next week, but I do want to move on.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks outside of XV, the other games we've been playing this week.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Loki, why don't you start? What have you been playing?

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
I played Skyrim, the remastered whatever.

52:52.000 --> 52:58.000
So I played that because, you know, my Final Fantasy XV wasn't downloaded in time.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
So I'm still enjoying that quite a bit, especially with mods now. It's really nice on console.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
It kind of sucks I can't earn trophies still, but whatever, I don't care.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
I mean, it's all about going through the game endlessly.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
So yeah, I'm enjoying that.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
What else did I play?

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
I played Excite Truck a bit, because we set that up so that my wife can play it.

53:22.000 --> 53:26.000
And I apparently am still good at it, so that's pretty good.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
More Ingress. I played a little bit of Pokemon.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
Literally like a minute of Pokemon just here, because...

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Pokemon Go.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Pokemon Go, yeah.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Because we have the Pikachus here all the time.

53:40.000 --> 53:45.000
Yeah, I didn't catch a Pikachu. I caught a Mankey and a Eakins.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Check again in 30 minutes. There's always a Pikachu up here somewhere.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
I have no motivation to play that game anymore, even Ditto.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
It's not even motivating enough for me to play that.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
So, I mean, I don't know. I keep it on there just for the hell of it, but I really don't play it anymore.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
And then, what else?

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
That's pretty much it.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
I've been working Unity, trying to make stuff.

54:11.000 --> 54:17.000
I've been learning UNET, so doing networking and stuff like that.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
So, I've kind of got a little bit of an understanding of that, which is nice.

54:21.000 --> 54:27.000
And I'm just going to work on some concepts I have, just to get a little bit more non-Rusty again.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
And then go back into what I was going to work on originally.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
So, we'll see. We'll see what I work on.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
I'm just kind of playing around with it right now.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
All right. If that's it for your gaming week, let me move over to JD.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Talk a little bit about his gaming week.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I noticed you've been playing a lot of Pokemon.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I have been, yeah.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
Because we actually did a little trading in Sun and Moon. You gave me a couple more Pokemon.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
I did.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
And then you said something about the whole fact that you want to trade with more people because the numbers go into the lottery.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Oh, yeah. Well, this is a thing since Gen 2.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
There's an in-game lottery that you...

54:59.000 --> 55:05.000
It's like once a day in this game, and it's based on the ID number of the original trainer of the Pokemon.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
The more people you trade with, the better your odds of getting the top prize are.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
So, you know, the more people you trade with, it's good.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
But you've been enjoying Sun and Moon a lot, right?

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
I've been playing, yeah, like 85 hours worth of it.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
Wow, that's impressive. But, yeah, what's interesting to me, you are only on Island 3.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I just got to Island 4 today.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
85 hours in the game?

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Yeah.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Okay.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
I've spent a lot of time looking for Pokedex completion, basically.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Because you're doing the side quest thing.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
Yeah.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Alan, I say he, I'm pointing at Alan.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
Alan just said, how come you don't do this with Pokemon? You're doing that.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I mean, for me, it's pretty finite.

55:40.000 --> 55:48.000
Like, I know which ones I'm missing because it shows me in a grid where you've caught this one, you have seen this one, you haven't seen that one.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
So, it's a lot easier to explore.

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
I mean, I've also been looking at Serebii to see what the percentage rates are because sometimes I'm just like, oh, there's a 1% chance?

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Yeah, I'm going to come back to that.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
I might get it in Wonder Trade.

56:00.000 --> 56:07.000
We mentioned at the top of the show you had been to Round 1 recently, and I know you're a big music game fan, so you probably got to play a lot for the first time, right?

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
There's a good number, yeah.

56:08.000 --> 56:14.000
I played Sound Vortex, which I couldn't hear at all because it was really noisy in Round 1 because it was a Friday night in a mall.

56:14.000 --> 56:20.000
And I've learned that you need to bring headphones to an arcade if you want to play music games because that's a thing now.

56:20.000 --> 56:29.000
There was Sound Vortex, we played Groove Coaster, Music Gun Gun, which is like a shooter music game, which I was kind of reserved about because I don't like shooters.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
But it was pretty fun.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
Yeah, but it's shooter like point-blank shooter. It's not shooter like Call of Duty.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
I have terrible aim. Terrible.

56:36.000 --> 56:44.000
See, I don't play shooter in the context of first-person shooters, but I love Misa point-blank. It's like carnival games.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
The only shooter game I like is Portal, and that's about as far as I'll go.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Which some people would say is not a shooter. I'm with you.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
You're pointing a gun and firing portals.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I get it. It's a thinking shooter.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
First-person puzzle game.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Yeah, it's a thinking shooter game, but anyway.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
There was also Hit the Beat, which is a ticket redemption game, but it's made by Pump It Up.

57:04.000 --> 57:11.000
So they had Beethoven Virus and Seacoast Post, and I was like, I'm playing Whack-A-Mole with Pump It Up songs. It was hilarious.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.000
And then I played DDR Ace, which was the first time I had played that.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Because I've never been to round one. This is the first time.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
How'd you like Ace compared to other DDR games?

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
So I played for one round because there was a line of people, and it was getting late.

57:26.000 --> 57:31.000
Honestly, I didn't really look at it all that much because I was playing with somebody else, so I only chose half the songs.

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
But the cabinet was really good. I could tell a difference. The pads were responsive.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
And it's kind of sad that that's the standard because a lot of machines are not kept up very well.

57:40.000 --> 57:48.000
For me, just in a nutshell, Ace really feels like a step up for the series that I haven't really felt in DDR since maybe Supernova.

57:48.000 --> 57:54.000
And a lot of Supernova was just the fact that, oh, we finally have a DDR game after a multi-year break.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
Supernova was like, oh, look, we're going international for the first time.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
Supernova wasn't really that different from Extreme, all things considered. It really, really wasn't.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
The interface was still the same, but Ace really feels like a step up in a way that the franchise hasn't seen in a while.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
And yet I'm even counting that 2014 release or whatever it was.

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
I was going to say, what came before Ace? I know X3 vs. 2nd Remix was around, but was there one in between?

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
There was the X series, and then there was the 2014 game. I think they just called it DDR 2014.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
I don't even know if that came over here very much. I couldn't find it.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
I only ever saw it at one convention.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Does D&B have Ace now?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I haven't been.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Because I thought they were getting those machines. I have to go over there.

58:38.000 --> 58:45.000
So I got a 3DS for Pokemon, basically, and I've been basically spending all my free time doing that.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
Anything else you've been playing you want to mention real quick before we move on?

58:50.000 --> 58:57.000
I've been playing Pokemon Go. Part of my work commute involves walking, so it's basically something I can do, and it works out pretty well.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
There's a good synergy there.

58:59.000 --> 59:06.000
And I've actually been playing Miitomo, because now that I have a 3DS, I have something to spend the coins on, which made a world of difference.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
Our 2DS says that D&B does have Ace.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Well, there you go. I had no idea.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
So, good to know. We'll have to go over there and check it out at some point.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
If that's it for your gaming week, JD, let's talk to Alan. How was your gaming week?

59:18.000 --> 59:26.000
Good. Oh, I just wanted to add, though, when we went to round one, their BeatMania machine was 2DX, was off, and had been off for like a week.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
That's why I was so happy I made the decision not to go over there after I'd already had a long day, because I would have been so mad if that had been off.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Like, the one game I'd want to play more than anything.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
And they didn't have a sign-up saying out of order, so we're like, can you turn on the 2DX machine? What's going on?

59:38.000 --> 59:45.000
And I guess the reply was, it's on order. There's only certain techs that can work on it. Like, it's been a week. We know.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Go away.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Well, how was your gaming week? What else did you play?

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
I've been playing lots of Skyrim and now Morrowind.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The reason why I never really got into Morrowind before is that I never played a lot of the really down and dirty, like, AD&D, like Ravenloft.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Like, some of the really not beginner-friendly Dungeons & Dragons games that came out on PC.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And I think Elder Scrolls originally came from that school where, like, there's a barter system.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
If you level up in a really weird way, you have to spend your skill points very carefully.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Because if you put it in stuff that isn't combat-based, you'll die.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And, like, it was just really overwhelming. I didn't know what to do. And now I just finally...

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I have the strategy guide that's almost like new for Morrowind that I got out of the cat's room.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I realized, like, oh, I can play this. So I'm a couple hours in now.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I was playing Overwatch for a bit. Season 2 ended.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Since season 3 started.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Season 3 started, like, a week ago, I think, and I haven't done any of my eval matches.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And it's funny that you're, like, still level 18 or 19 on PC.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
On PC. And now I'm catching up on PS4.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Yeah, so you're never gonna really do the ranked seasons.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Never say never.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Because I know, like, in Diablo, you always wanted to...

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Except we've each had two or three seasons go by, though, on Diablo 3 where we haven't played.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That's really it, though. And then, of course, I did do a Mortal Kombat 9 story run.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And then I was playing X, but now I just watch, like, a Let's Player or a YouTuber that plays X.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Mortal Kombat X, and I just watch what he does.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Because I know I can't perform juggle combos like that.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Okay. All right. Well, that's it for your gaming week?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah, that's it. We're running long, so I'll keep it brief.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
That's fine. My gaming week, and I really don't have a lot to say, because Final Fantasy XV really took up a lot of my week.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The one other thing I will mention is that Monday night, after last week's OLR, but before I had my copy of XIV,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I did check out No Man's Sky because of the patch.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
15?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I'm sorry, yeah. Well, I still do play Final Fantasy XIV.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I understand. I know.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I don't talk about it every week, but it is the MMO of choice.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
But I certainly haven't been playing that as much.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And I think even my free company, like, just hasn't been as active.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Which, you know, of course, a lot of people playing XIV are Final Fantasy fans.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Of course, everybody's checking out the new game, so, you know, it's logical.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But anyway. But I did play No Man's Sky on Monday night.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Because they did that patch. And I was really curious about, okay, does this, you know, fix some of the problems I had with it?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And so the first thing I did was fire up Creative Mode.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000
So when you go into the game now, there's a new menu you didn't have before that says pick the game you want to play.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Do you want to do normal? And it actually shows, here's your last normal save.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Do you want to do creative? Here's your last creative save.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So it's now you kind of juggling three separate games.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
So the first thing I did was went into Creative Mode just to kind of see what I could do.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And I have to admit, like, they did change a lot just on an interface level.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Like, especially with the fact that Creative Mode.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Creative Mode, you just, like, you can build whatever you want and it doesn't subtract resources.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
That's what Creative Mode is.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But it really now gives you the sense, like, oh, you can really see, like, what all the options are.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And, wow, they really did add a lot of different stuff.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Like, now you can put little beacons on the planet to leave messages behind for other players.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Like, this is Dark Souls or something.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Yeah.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Which, you know, so if I want to, so, but the thing is, what's, I haven't run into somebody else's beacon enough because I didn't play that much.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
But, like, is it going to show, like, oh, there's a beacon on this planet.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
You should go get it.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And then you go and you find the beacon, you land, you find it, and then you activate the beacon and it says, poop fart.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Like, oh, wow, I wasted all that fuel to come find this beacon that says, poop fart.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Honestly, it would probably be just about as important as all the other story stuff that they have in there.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
So, I mean.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Yes. Little did you know.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
They should have new words that you can learn.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
They should have it where you can put those, like, word rune things.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It's like, you learned the word for dick butt, you know?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
But anyway, but I also played around with the base building stuff.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And so they put in this whole new, like, quest thing.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So, like, you can build the base and it's, it's kind of on a grid system.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You know, you pick, like, you don't see it on a grid, but you can kind of tell, like, that's how it's, like, you choose, like, everything is a perfect little square and what goes here, what goes here, you know, that type of thing.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
But I like that it was, like, okay, now that you've built a terminal, you need to go find somebody to staff this terminal.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So, you've got to blast off into space, find the dude, you know, come back to your base.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
So, it seems like there's this whole quest around it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So, the patch that the game got is substantial and I didn't even really have enough time to explore it in one night.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
But, you know, I know people have aired their grievances with this game and so on.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I thought this patch was very interesting.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
The one thing I didn't get to figure out with creative mode is, did it remove the sentinels?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Because it's telling me that the planet is still, like, the sentries were normal, I think, on this planet that I started on.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
But I never saw a sentry.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But then again, I also wasn't farming the planet because you don't have to. It's creative mode.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah. Also, in the original game, the sentries weren't really an issue unless you were on a planet that had really rare commodities on the ground.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Like, the pearls and the weird things where if you find the right galaxy that has the economy for it, you could sell it for, like, two and a half or three times the price.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
That's how I made all of my units.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
TigerClawInChat asks, if this patch was released on day one of this game, would the game still have received the same reception as gotten prior to it?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Yes.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yes. It would have. Because some of the biggest problems about the game were the PC issues that jammed it up the first day, which had kind of already been fixed.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It didn't even run until, like, a week after release.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah, this patch didn't really do anything with that because that's already been fixed in progressive patches.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Some of the inventory stuff would have been less frustrating, though, because of the stacking.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I think maybe some of the grievances would have changed, but, you know, gamershateeverything.com, there was still going to be complaints somewhere.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:00.000
So, but, and, you know, I'm not poo-pooing the complaints. Like, I understand that people felt certain things were promised and that, you know, they underdelivered.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Does this address all of the issues? No. Does it address some of the issues? Yes.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I would say maybe.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Okay, I'll let you have one.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I haven't really read too much about it because, LOL, I don't care that much, but I guess there are some people in the community, by which I mean Reddit, that are, like, deeply offended by this patch.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Like, you guys don't say a damn thing for five months, then you put out this content that you never even, like, gave us a sneak preview of. Why should I care about this? Or how dare you?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I see that partway because I know, and I've been critical of Hello Games, you know, through this whole ordeal, is that you need to say something. You need to do something, you need to reassure your customer base, you're working on it, you need to say something.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:52.000
But I do understand, I also, at the same time, understand the perspective of, they probably feel like they can't say anything without the entire internet screaming at them.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
So why say anything at all?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yeah.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:05.000
In a way, I get it. But I just, I still sort of feel like, okay, you know what, say something and then don't look at your notifications. Like, seriously!

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:19.000
So the issue I have with the base, and I know, I guess you can build a teleporter to warp back to it, but the original game, when it came out, because of their randomly generated universe that is so massive, like, it'll never be 100% explored, which, yeah, right.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:28.000
The way that the original game played was that they always wanted you to keep it moving, explore new planets and galaxies at the expense of everything else.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You can't make your way back to a planet that you visited, you name it and you move on. Keep going, explore, explore, explore.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So now that they're setting up things where you have, like, a base, like, before in the previous game, you couldn't even record and set a waypoint for a station that you had found on the planet that you're still currently on from four hours back.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Now you're on the other side of the planet and you're like, I need to sell the stuff I have. I can't find a shop. Where's that shop I went to a couple hours ago?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
You can't find it because it's like, no, keep, just leave the planet and find a new one then.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So I just don't understand how they can put in these new centralized features when the original game had problems where you couldn't even tell where you had been, if that makes sense.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yeah, no, totally, totally. It was always a little weird in that regard, but I do think the patch is worth looking at if you still have somewhat of a retained interest in No Man's Sky.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
But I also understand, you know, and I think another follow-up question in our chat, Tigerclaw says, does this patch change people's perception?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I don't know because I think a lot of people just moved on to the next hot game of the minute, which right now is Final Fantasy XV, Pokemon Sun or Moon, back to Overwatch, just depending on what your community is and the gamers you play with.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I think a lot of people have just moved on to the next hot game of the minute.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:09:04.000
When we were at Fry's this weekend in the PS4 section, they had No Man's Sky and it was like, think of like a bookshelf and the amount of layers, like how thick the amount of copies were is where if you put one more, it would have fallen off the shelf because that's how dense it was.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And it was like $39.99. I was like, that's still too much. I know, I imagine if you go to GameStop and look in the You section, they're probably like two bucks because of how...

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I thought there were Black Friday deals for $19.99 at this point.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:34.000
So it was funny that all of the other games just had one or two copies each, but No Man's Sky specifically, they had like one chunky stack of 15 and another chunky stack of 15 that looked totally disproportionate to all the other games and it's like a game that's like three or four months old. It's like 40 bucks, was 69.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I'm going to be extremely interested. I really hope somebody is filming Hello Games right now. If somebody was making a documentary on Hello Games throughout this whole ordeal, I would love to see that in two years.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:07.000
You know what I mean? Like if somebody was like documenting this from the inside, which I don't think is happening, but I'm just saying if it was for whatever reason, like, oh my god, this would be so fascinating to me. Like, I really want to see the postmortem on No Man's Sky from Sean Murray's mouth in two years, if he'll do it. I don't know.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:30.000
For all I know, dude is going through severe mental trauma because of this. But I don't know. I don't want to make up or try to diagnose other people when I'm not serving. But I'm just saying he could be having really extreme reactions to a lot of this stuff on the internet. Maybe he'll never want to talk about it in two years. I don't know.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I'm going to be so curious to see what the postmortem for this looks like in a couple years time. Anyway, let's see. Bobby Black Wolf. Interesting. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I think Sean Murray will walk away like Phil Fish did. I don't want him to walk away. I don't like to see people walk away.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
He'll get the game to a point where he's whatever over it and then he'll take his marbles and go home.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I don't know. Or maybe he'll say, you know what, I'm going to do it right the next time or I'm going to learn from this. It just kind of depends on where he's at right now. God, you know what, I gotta say there's a lot of people I've always wanted to interview on the show. I would love to interview that guy on the show. I would love to interview that guy on the show, respectfully. I'll have a respectful dialogue with that man about everything. But I also realized we're a small fry podcast, you know.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Peter Molyneux is probably like, Oh, thank God he came along. Jesus Christ. I'm so like, I know it sucks, dude. You're a pariah. But like, you've helped me so much with my reputation.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
He's got that with a walking game now was a hiking game or something.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Look, I thought that was Ingress. All right. We got to move on. We got to move on. We like an hour and 15 into the show and we've barely touched what's going on in gaming news. And you know, there's been a lot that's been going on this week because, you know, interestingly enough, we're at the halfway point between E3s, right? E3 is the beginning of June every year. And here we are at the beginning of December. And it does feel like we got a lot of news this week, which early December didn't used to be a part of the video gaming news cycle. But then, you know, internet happened and so on.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Sony decided they were going to hold an event in December to get people talking about Sony products right around Christmas time. Genius move. So let's talk about some of the big events that have happened this week. That's kind of the news we want to start with the top of the show.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So first off Thursday night, the Game Awards. Loki, you actually watch the Game Awards, right?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I watched most of it.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I didn't. I didn't watch it at all. I saw all the news. So I'm prepared to talk about this stuff. I watched the highlight reels and all that, but I did not watch the show because I just had something else going on. It was just not a bad time for me. I wasn't trying to hate just conflict.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I watched most of it. I missed the beginning or part of the beginning. So one of the things they showed was a new trailer for Breath of the Wild, which I watched that later on.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I also missed the middle because I had to put the kids to bed. But on the Breath of the Wild trailer, I mean, everyone was kind of gung ho with it. Honestly, I could have cared less. I mean, or couldn't have cared less because it was just kind of, it looked all right, but didn't really show me anything like that.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I haven't seen it before. Not necessarily the trailer, I guess, the actual gameplay footage that they did.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
With the treehouse guys and all that?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:19.000
With the treehouse guys. That was just kind of like, it was like ho-hum. Like, eh, whatever. Like, the E3 stuff was exciting because it was like, whoa, man, wow, this is really cool. And that didn't really show me anything different.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:28.000
You know, that's kind of the impression I got from the footage, too, is that the footage kind of made me go, okay, it looks like a Zelda game, which isn't bad. God, no, Zelda games are fantastic.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:40.000
But there was definitely that part of me that was kind of bracing myself for, ooh, that he keeps saying that, you know, he really likes playing Skyrim. You know, this is going to be Zelda meets Skyrim, and this is going to be a radical departure for the series and all that stuff.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And that footage kind of made me go, okay, it's not going to be that much of a departure.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:57.000
No, it's not. I mean, I think the big open world is sort of like Skyrim, but the one thing I really don't like is the weapon durability. That is just a terrible idea. Has there ever been a game with weapon durability? It's like, wow, this is really awesome.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:09.000
No one has ever said that. It's a stupid mechanic. I really don't like it. I'm not looking forward to having that in there where, oh, I'm fighting something, you know, my stupid thing broke.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The game looked great to me. I'm still on board, but I think there, I saw a great tweet and I kind of stopped and went, huh, that's a very interesting observation that said it was not the best idea to put out this Zelda Breath of the Wild footage the day after Final Fantasy 15 hit.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Because now a lot of people are looking at him side by side going, the limitations of the Wii U are showing a little bit.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Yeah.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
A little bit. But again, I don't want to sound overly shady with that comment.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I think it's going to be a fantastic game, but yeah.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Yeah, I still think, you know, graphics, you can take a hit on graphics and still have a fantastic game. And I think Zelda still will be good at the end of the day. It's just that maybe that wasn't the right time to get the hype machine going. But that's maybe out of Nintendo's control a little bit. I don't know.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Yeah. So, I mean, it was okay, I guess, but it wasn't all that exciting. Of course, you know, they talked, they had given awards or the, what was it? Not a lifetime achievement award, but like a, some sort of, I don't know.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
It may as well be the lifetime achievement award. Same type of thing. Video game pioneer or something like that. They called it. Yeah.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000
So anyways, and they gave that to Hideo Kojima. And I think a lot of it is because he couldn't give him an award last year. And so it was kind of like.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Did you see the whole Jeff Keighley lead up to that?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Yes, I did.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Where like I was waiting for Jeff Keighley to open mouth kiss Hideo Kojima after that.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It seemed kind of awkward.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah. Well, and I also, I expected that and I expected him like as he's open mouth kissing Hideo Kojima to have like a little tattoo on his hand that says, fuck Konami. Like I was just, I was waiting for that.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Industry icon award. That's what it was. Yeah.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Same lifetime achievement. Same thing.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And then they showed that.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
What's that Alan?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Kojima is only open mouth, open mouth kissing one dude on the planet. And that's Norman Reedus from Walking Dead.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
It could be two people already since then.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So they did show, they did show the new trailer for Death Stranding, which we still don't know really what it's about, but honestly just, you know, gauging by what we're seeing.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It looks like kind of a melding of Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid, which I think for a lot of people is like, fuck yes.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I think there's definitely like, he's taking some of the ideas from Silent Hill and putting them in this game, but I'm sure he recognizes he has to walk a very fine line because Konami will sue if there's too many similarities.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
But this also huge that Guillermo del Toro is involved.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Yeah, he is involved.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Why didn't they drop that bombshell at E3?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I don't know.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Oh my God.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000
He is involved and now also they revealed that Mads Mikkelsen is involved with it as well.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Which, you know, people fucking obsess about Hannibal.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I gotta say that.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Alan, you're on Tumblr, right? Tumblr, Hannibal.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Yeah.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So I am not a fan of Metal Gear Solid. I'm the, I like the idea of Silent Hill, but I don't like it, but I've watched this trailer about 30 times because the music is fucking awesome.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Like the music and the atmosphere of it, I am on board with that.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000
And I think, I don't know what the hell this game is about, but I love the way it looks.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Like I can seriously, I'm down for it.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
But again, I feel like we're going to go down, people are going to hate me for this comment.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
We need to be very careful not to go to a no man's sky place with this game.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I understand.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Because I'm starting to feel like we're going to a no man's sky place with this game.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Okay, but this is, this is Hideo Kojima.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
That's fair, that's fair.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And Sean Murray.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Sean Murray made a motorcycle racing game, and then, you know, Hideo Kojima, the pedigree, I have higher expectations for him. I feel that he will be fine.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I'm just warning everybody else, don't fucking do that to this game.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I'm not saying that, but like, I think that he can, he can live up to that.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
That's fine. There's a lot of people that would open mouth kiss Hideo Kojima at the end of the day, right?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
But like, I don't know what the hell this game is about yet, and what is up with all these fetuses and everything around.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Did you see the whole conspiracy theory about what happens when you play the two trailers side by side?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
No.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Oh, mind blown.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Go look at one of those series about playing the two trailers side by side.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
What sort of Wizard of Oz, Dark Side of the Moon nonsense?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
It is dark sided. It's that lady from trading spouses from like 10 years ago, the way, it's ungodly, I don't want it.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
It's that. Have you seen the whole, have you seen the whole thing about the two trailers?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
No.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000
If you play the two trailers at the same time, the baby moves in between the two trailers.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
The baby is never in both trailers at the same time.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Okay.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
No, like there, it's, you have to

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Like it's on the left monitor, then it's on the right monitor.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yes, like it's, it's almost like it's intentional the way it is laid out.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And I can see them doing that, especially the way they kind of did PT and everything.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Yeah. I know. I know. I get it. It's one of those things where you go like, is this, this is all, this is all intentional, right?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Like this is, this is a total mind fuck. Like, is there going to be a third trailer that then, you know, even does that even worse? So

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Avril Lavigne was replaced with a clone.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Fuck off.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Wait, what?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Oh God, I never knew this was a meme until he said this. I never knew this was a meme.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Okay. So, so sorry. We were talking about kids.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Thank you for bringing this up on the show. This has nothing to do with video games yet.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But you have piqued my interest in that.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Now you have to explain what the fuck this is.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:38.000
So, um, there's like, it's kind of like the jokes where George W. Bush makes a joke about how like Jet Fuel doesn't melt steel bars and all this stuff.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And Beyonce is the Illuminati. One of them is Avril Lavigne was, died horribly, discreetly, and was replaced with a lookalike that had plastic surgery to look like her.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
And that's not the real Avril Lavigne. And I guess it's, I don't know if it's a 4chan or a Reddit thing, but I guess people really believe this. It's like a meme.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Like you can go to YouTube and look up Avril Lavigne imposter conspiracy and find like videos on it.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And I was just saying with the two trailers side by side and like Wizard of Oz and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, if you run together, is it real? Is this intentional?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Or are we just like getting like confirmation bias? Like we want to see some weird shit. So we're seeing some weird shit.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And I just thought it would be funny to say Avril Lavigne was replaced with a clone and then Rob peed his pants.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:30.000
The baby moves between the two trailers. Avril Lavigne is a clone. Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's. All that.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Okay. Yeah.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Anyway, so, uh, yeah, Death Stranding trailer. Uh, you know, again, I, I'm, I'm hyped for the game, but I would like the next thing we see to be gameplay footage.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:54.000
But then again, if Kojima is going to keep them, I have a feeling that this game, maybe I think this is like 2018, at least, at least, at least.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.000
So, I mean, okay. Which, which comes first? You ready? Which comes first? Everybody. Final Fantasy seven remake.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Kingdom Hearts three or Death Stranding, which hearts three, which one will we see first?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I think Kingdom Hearts three. Cause we've seen gameplay of that. We have seen gameplay of Kingdom Hearts three.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000
We've also seen gameplay of the seven remake. Yeah, but that's just tech, I mean, I think that's just assets basically thrown on top of the, uh, engine.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
You heard though that he's using the engine that they're using for that now is the same one that's being used for Horizon Zero Dawn.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Oh no, I didn't hear that. Yeah. That's the engine that they're using for that game.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
TigerClaw in chat says, uh, Sky, the third Death Standing trailer will introduce Betty White. Yeah, thank you.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
That would be awesome. Film her parts now.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I would open mouth Kissadeo Kojima if that happened. And I'm sure that man smokes a pack a day.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Uh, Stoppy says, same theory as Paul McCartney being replaced. Was that a thing? So this, this, so this rumor just repeats itself every generation.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I'm sure there's one for lots of people. I mean, some people think Elvis is still alive.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Oh, that's, or Tupac is the other one I hear all the time. Tupac is Elvis.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Well, I mean the hologram didn't help that.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Do you, did you see the, did you see the reaction people had when that hologram fucking thing happened at Coachella in the desert?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Like, did you, did you see the look, something like those, those reaction YouTubes?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Can you imagine people that were like fucking stoned out of their head and they're like, what the fuck is going on? I thought he was dead.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Seriously. It's just, wow. Anyway. Okay. So what else, please don't turn this into conspiracy theory. Episode 666 passed. You should have done it two weeks ago.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Bobby Blackfolf in chat says the first episode of the remake or all episodes for FF7.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Um, that's a great question. I would say the first episode of the remake and me personally, I think the first episode of the remake is going to be the 2018 release.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Square's got to, Square is going to have to put one of those things out next year. One of those two is coming out next year.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
And I think it's going to be the first part of the Seven Remake.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
In 2017.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Huh?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
2017.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
2017. Square has to deliver one of those two games because they've been hyping it for way too long.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I mean, granted, look at the fucking game they released this week and hype, but I really think Square's on the line to release one of those two games in 2017.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I think it'll be the first part of the Seven Remake, but that's me personally. And the Death Stranding 2018.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But anyway, what else? Game of Words.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Um, so, one of the things that happened was Nolan North won for Best Voice Actor.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And so, of course, he had some words to say regarding the whole voice actor strike.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So, basically, I guess I'll just kind of quote what he said here.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Performance matters. And the performance of every designer, every programmer, and of every hardworking and talented person who works at the office, that performance is so important.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And their performance matters more than mine. And it's important in this day and age with all the talk going back and forth because without their performance, my performance wouldn't matter. It wouldn't even exist.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.000
That almost seemed like it went against the strike, didn't it? Did anyone else take it that way?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I mean, it kind of seemed like it played an interesting middle ground, but that almost seemed, especially because he said their performance matters more than mine, that was interesting.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I mean, the way I kind of take it is like, yes, the voice actor should get paid more, but the programmers and designers should get paid more because we hear all the horror stories of all the shit they have to go through.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And I think it's like he's just trying to say, listen, recognize that what we do is important, but these guys that actually make the game are just as important, if not more important.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Why are we treating them so poorly?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I see that side of it too. And I've said this, I think this is a good reminder, I think because of the way the video game news cycle is, right? I bet a lot of you forgot that this, well maybe not, not you personally, but I bet a lot of people out there forgot that this voice actor strike is going on.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And we're talking about what do 2017, what do 2018's games look like and all this stuff. These strikes could severely impact 2017 and 2018's gaming releases. Like we're not seeing the impacts yet, but there's all these games further down the line that could severely be impacted because of the voice actor strike. This is still going, it is not resolved.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
That's why you just get actual actors to do the roles.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Because SAG-AFTRA is one guild, I don't think people like Norman Reedus would be allowed to cross the lines. I'm not sure how that works. I don't know the science of it, but I don't, because it is all one union, I don't think they can do that.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Well technically he hasn't said anything yet, so that could be very well.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Yeah, we don't know. So anything could happen. But I'm just saying, this is still a situation that needs to be resolved. And the one thing that Nolan North didn't bring up that I think is still an important issue about the strike altogether is the safety issues.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And there's a lot of people, you know, about the whole fact that you can't do all these screams and yells in one recording session without sufficient breaks and rest and all this stuff. And there's still a lot of issues to be resolved.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So, you know, I hope if nothing else, you know, this speech reignites a conversation between the two sides. Because if this doesn't get resolved, do you guys remember how the Rider's Strike ruined TV? Wait for it.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Remember the show Heroes when it was good? And then the Rider's Strike happened? Yep. Anyway, what else?

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Alright. And then, see, so, moving on from there, there was a trailer for a remaster of Bulletstorm, and they had Duke Nukem featured in that, which was kind of like, why the hell is Duke Nukem here?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Because they really want people to give Bulletstorm a look, because that game really got, I think, didn't that come out almost the same time that Overwatch did?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000
No, Bulletstorm was way older than that. Bulletstorm came out, like, several years ago.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Oh, did it? I'm confused.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Yeah, it was an Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 game.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I'm totes confusing it with Battleborn.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
You're, yeah, you're thinking that.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Whoops!

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
No, no, this came out back in 2011.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Okay.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And there's supposed to be, it's an enhanced version that's going to be offering at 60 FPS, Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4, and then they're going to also have 4K visuals on it. But Duke Nukem's going to be in it as well, so...

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Okay, but still a second chance for people to check out a game they may have missed, and now, you know...

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:40.000
It was alright. I played a little bit of it, and I think I actually have it, it's in my library, well, it wasn't my library when I was paying for live gold, but it's one of those free games with gold that they had a while back, so, I don't know.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000
But yeah, it's, it was supposed to be pretty good, but I haven't played it.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Let's see, what else?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:28:04.000
So then, after that, we had a teaser for Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy, so that's kind of been confirmed that's coming now. I'm assuming it's going to be timed around the time of the movie, the new movie, which we actually had a trailer for this weekend, which is kind of nice.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Oh yeah, I missed that, but I heard that came out.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
It was cool.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
You know, I still haven't seen the first movie.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
You should really watch it, it's a good movie.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I just never see movies.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
You should see it, it's a great movie.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And then they showed some footage from Prey. This is one of the things I missed.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I watched a portion of that, you know, and I saw that he turned into a coffee cup and rolled himself through a hole, and then that was that.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And I'm just like, wow, this really doesn't look like Prey, the original game, or it doesn't look like Prey, the reimagining of it that was supposed to be coming out a long time ago.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I don't even know what this is, so it's a thing though, but I wasn't all that interested in it.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I have neglected to watch the new footage, but I did enjoy the old Prey game, but yeah, I could get the sense from what we saw at E3 that it was not even going to be the same thing.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
No.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:03.000
It must be some of the original ideas from the original series, and going somewhere else with it.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Yeah. Then there was a trailer for Specter of Torment, which is the prequel for Shovel Knight, which kind of reminded me a lot of a Castlevania-type game, at least visually, it kind of reminded me of that.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:27.000
It looks like a whole new game to me. It doesn't even look like it's Shovel Knight. Well, okay, yes, it has that same retro kitsch, but it doesn't look so much like an expansion like it does just a whole new game.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Yeah.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
In that same style.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
But it looks good.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Yeah, I'm with you. It looks really cool.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And then, of course, I'm sure you saw the footage of Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Fuck yes, I did.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So, you want to talk about that?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:54.000
It looked great. I mean, it was interesting, because I got a very Mass Effect 1 vibe from it. Maybe that's the fact that you have the not Mako in it, the new car, but now you have the jetpacks, which is going to really change things up a little bit.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:04.000
But I was actually somewhat comforted by the fact there was a lot of familiarity to it, you know? The combat didn't look all that radically different.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I mean, yes, there are clearly some differences with the jetpack, and they were showing more action-y stuff and less cover stuff, but I wonder if that's because cover doesn't make for a very good trailer.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:19.000
They had cover stuff, too. They had one that almost looked like they put out one of those... I don't remember what their energy weapon was.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Omni Tool, yeah.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Almost like it had an Omni Tool. He built a... I don't know, like a cover, a piece of cover that he was hiding behind. A half-wall thing.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000
So, I mean, I was really interested in what I saw. The one thing that kind of made me grimace a little bit was that they were showing that, oh, you can pick flowers and you can craft in this game.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And I was like, Mass Effect has enough in it that you'll spend thousands of hours playing. You don't need the fucking...

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Because the min-maxer in me is like, I'm fucked, if that's a thing.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And then they also basically said, oh yeah, here's your galaxy, go explore and stuff. I was like, I'm getting too much of a No Man's Sky vibe with this.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
No, no, no.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
At least the plan is much nicer than No Man's Sky.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Well, and then if you actually... I don't know if this is spoilery or what, but Alan and I both noticed, which is funny because Shane...

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
When I talked to Shane, he'd watched that trailer a billion times. He didn't notice what we noticed, Alan.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Like the quest names in the right-hand corner of the screen, the missions that you're on.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Remember how we caught one that said loyalty mission? You were on somebody's loyalty mission. It was like, oh, they're bringing that back. That's going to be a key point.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Because Mass Effect 3 was rushed so badly, Mass Effect 2 was such an incredible game.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And you got to fight mechs and robots, and there was all this stuff in the loyalty missions.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And in the Andromeda trailer, there are mechs that you fight. So it looks like they're bringing back a lot of the stuff from 2.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Which is why they've taken their sweet ass time doing it.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Was really good, yeah.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:52.000
So I'm really on board. I'm really, really looking forward to the game. I mean, of course I'm going to fucking buy it because it's Mass Effect.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
But you know, there's been other talk about how multiplayer might be a little different.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:02.000
And they're saying that multiplayer will not influence the single player game the way it did in Mass Effect 3, where it felt very required.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And a lot of people really resented it for that.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:12.000
But I still love the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3, so I can't wait to try it in Andromeda.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Yep, and then they showed off some stuff for the new Walking Dead series that's going to be coming out.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It looked okay, and I know they have some reoccurring characters. I still haven't played any of those, so I don't know.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And then as far as the Game Awards winners, one of the things I didn't really care for on the Game Awards is like,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000
a lot of these, they're like, oh yeah, and this person's accepting the award for this, but they also won this!

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And it's like, okay, wow, there's no fanfare whatsoever for that.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Must be a time thing, because they kind of did that last year too, or it was like, I'm going to interview you, and you won this award!

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Yeah, so, for example, Game of the Year went to Overwatch. Game Direction also Overwatch.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Narrative was Uncharted 4. Art Direction went to Inside, which I thought was pretty cool, and then Indie won that.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Doom won best music and sound design. Of course, best performance was Nolan North.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Games for Impact went to That Dragon Cancer, which, you know, very touching speech,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000
but my god, those people that were presenting were a little too enthusiastic about saying that.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.000
It went to That Dragon Cancer! It's like, okay, dude, chill the fuck down.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:38.000
This is about a game about some kid who died. Don't need that much fucking oomph from you, okay?

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Just calm the fuck down.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Come down to about a seven.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Yeah, calm that shit down.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Best independent game also went to Inside, which is awesome.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Best mobile or handheld game went to Pokemon Go, which I don't agree with that whatsoever.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Maybe a few months ago, yes, but honestly, compared to the other games that were in the category, it is least game of all of them, I think.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I don't know if I agree, but that's alright.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Best VR game, Rez Infinite. Best action game went to Doom. Action adventure, Dishonored 2, which is weird because that just came out.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Best RPG went to Witcher 3. Best fighting game, Street Fighter 5. Civ 6 won best strategy game.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Family game went to Pokemon Go. Sports racing went to Forza Horizon 3.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Multiplayer went to Overwatch.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:42.000
And most anticipated game, which is most throwaway category ever, went to Legends of the Breath of the Wild.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And trending gamer went to Boogie2988.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.000
And of course, best fan creation, apparently there was no award listed for that.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
What do you think about the whole... I guess there's some controversy out there, and I didn't really realize this until, you know, it was brought up on Bobby's show,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000
and I did see a little bit about this on Twitter as well, is that apparently some people are really not okay with the fact that Overwatch won Game of the Year.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I'm not sure I understand that because I kind of think Overwatch is a fantastic game.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I do understand some people are bothered by the fact that it's multiplayer only, although I could nab you on a technicality.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
You can play against AI. It's just not nearly as fun.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I think to disqualify something for, you know, not having a single player version, if you want to fault them for anything, you fault them for their fucking loot system,

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
but aside from that, I mean, everyone likes it, so what's the big deal?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I would rather they do that loot system than what Mortal Kombat X did, for what it's worth.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I mean, but I kind of think Overwatch in many ways has changed the game, and there's a lot of people out there that don't play first person shooters that got sucked into Overwatch,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:58.000
and I think Overwatch kind of opened up that new genre, and I think especially, like, this is a shooter game.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:08.000
A first person shooter game, team game, where the characters are so rich and developed that it's like a Disney cartoon.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Like, this game has accomplished a lot that a game like Doom that I really enjoyed, mind you, I don't think did in the same way.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Well, I think, you know, Team Fortress 2 did it first, but, you know, they really cut back on what their, you know, advertising for that.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
They did do it first, Overwatch took it to another level, in my opinion, but these are opinions.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And of course, we're always gonna bitch about award shows, that's what these fucking things are for, is to get us to bitch and complain about them,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
just like the Oscars, when, you know, remember when Crash won the Oscar? Jesus Christ.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
You know, all that type of stuff. Like, anyway, but Alan, you play a lot of Overwatch, what do you want to say?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I was gonna say, Overwatch, unlike any other game I've ever seen before, has a huge fan art, fan fiction, and, you know, player created universe,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:07.000
comprised of people that have no intention of playing the game and haven't played the game, because the characters are so vibrant, and the little ship wars and all this stuff.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:15.000
So, like, they'll watch the, because the story that Blizzard provides for Overwatch is kind of paper thin to begin with.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:23.000
You really just have those YouTube shorts, but I've never seen a game that has such a huge fandom comprised of people that have never played the game,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:30.000
that understand the characters, know about the characters, draw them, fantastic fan art, all this stuff.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000
That, in itself, I think is worthy of giving a game of the year, that it has some type of appeal like that.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
But anyway, everybody's gonna bitch about award shows, so obviously, I can even see in chat, there's people that disagree, and we're having the same things in there,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:53.000
and I'm just kinda, I'm rolling my eyes in a way, I'm not rolling my eyes at the opinion, I'm rolling my eyes at the whole, and this is what award shows do.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Like, this is the hype they build, so you tune in next year and all that stuff, so.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:06.000
But, at the same time, I also just kinda feel like, okay, wait, there are reasons why Overwatch is worthy of game of the year consideration.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.000
But again, just like Shane hated Final Fantasy XV, and I don't fucking understand it, there's just always gonna be differences of opinion.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:22.000
But, and one thing we can agree on that was really cringey about the whole show was the product placement, and granted, yes, I do understand they have to pay for the show,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
but my fucking god, do we really need a person dressed up like a shit hydro robot?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000
It was just such a weird, like, oh hey, let's just watch this awesome trailer for Death Stranding, wow, that was so cool.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Now let's talk about the shit hydro bot, and fucking, what the fuck was that?

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
At least it wasn't Doritos and Mountain Dew.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
It is now, it's a new meme, so, I mean, it's just, it's bad.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Alright, so let's talk about the PlayStation Experience.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.000
So, I mean, literally two days later, then we have the PlayStation Experience happens, but you didn't watch the keynote.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I did not watch this, I watched the trailers a little bit afterwards, for the ones I was interested in.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.000
So I did watch the PlayStation Experience, so I'll take the lead on this a little bit, you fill in any gaps that I'm missing on this stuff, okay?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Because I'm gonna do it from memory.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.000
So, the PlayStation Experience had the thing, and JD, you actually watched this with me, even though you don't really play a lot of the modern games.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Did you like what you saw out of the keynote?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Well, I mean, I recognized Parappa, that's for sure.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
We'll get to that. I will say that, you know, I think Sony did a bang up job.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I mean, really, this was like an E3 level conference.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
The news was there, you know, and they promised it at the beginning, it's gonna be games, games, games.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And no backwards compatibility news, so fuck them.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000
There isn't, and there's, yes, there are places that Sony still needs to improve.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000
But hey, you know what? At least a guy came out on stage and said the word Vita multiple times.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
So, we gotta give him a little credit, we're gonna give him a little credit, partial credit for that.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.000
But no, I think all things considered, despite the lack of backwards compatibility, when they so set it up for that, at one point,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
the words he was saying was talking about the classic games, he's like,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
and we know you're excited to play classic games and stuff.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And like the whole audience is like, we are about to jizz all at once because of what you're about to say.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And they said, let's talk about the Crash Bandicoot remaster.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And everybody was like, motherfucker, you know, all that, not, not really.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Because Crash Bandicoot remaster, I guess we'll start there.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
The Crash Bandicoot remaster looks really neat.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I mean, it's not just a simple up res, like they've gone back and they've redid a lot of stuff.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
The question is, will that game formula hold up all this time later?

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
But I kind of think it will. I'll check it out.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yeah.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Yeah. I mean, you know, I've, and the fact that it's like all three original games kind of helps quite a bit.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So, you know, that's, that's good.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I know it started, they started the PlayStation thing with some footage of a game that you didn't know what it was.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000
And it looked really pretty and it looked like it was set in India, you know, and the lead character was wearing a burka.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So you were kind of like, oh, is this like, this is new IP?

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
What is this?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
And actually we were all sitting in the room and we were going, it's Tomb Raider.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
This is a Tomb Raider game.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.000
But then we're kind of looking at, but I'm kind of looking at going, but I just, Tomb Raider in the city just, but I'm like, okay, well maybe they're going to go a radical new direction.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I think it was supposed to be Syria, but they showed a horizon shot where it was obvious that this place that she was at was very war torn.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000
And Tomb Raider doesn't really go to those types of topics.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So, but, but I mean, in the beginning it was like, oh, this could be Tomb Raider.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
This might be like, oh, just like Microsoft got the second Tomb Raider.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Maybe Sony's got a deal for the third.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:26.000
But then it turns out, no, it's not Tomb Raider, but it's like literally the adjacent thing. It's Uncharted.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
It's, it's a, it was an Uncharted game.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
It was Uncharted Lost Legacy, except this time, and I have to admit, I'm not super, I don't super follow Uncharted.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And I realize a lot of you are into it, but again, you can only play so many games as a hobbyist.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
But I understand this is a very popular female character in the game.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:49.000
When she took off her scarf and the entire audience like gay gassed, I'm like, I have no idea who this woman is.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And I guess, yeah, it's Nathan Drake's ex from 2.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And she's, I guess, a fan favorite character, very recognizable face.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Oh, Claudia Black, who is Morgan in Dragon Age and the woman in Farscape.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
That's, that's one of the characters that she voice acts for.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Oh, okay.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
So it's, it's going to, so she by herself is amazing.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:21.000
But yeah, she's getting her own game and it was, it was really interesting for me to hear the entire audience go like, it's hard.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I'm like, I don't know who this, who this chick is.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Darts at Sea and chat says gay gasp. That's a thing.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
No, no, no, that's not, that's, that's, no, this, yeah.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Like, yes, has to be very over the top.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You have to clutch your pearls as you inhale.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Yes, you have to clutch your pearls as you inhale.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
That's the, that's the difference. Yeah, exactly.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Like, and it has to be like big, has to be really big news.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
You know, crash beat Brokeback Mountain for best picture.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And I made, I made an Uncharted joke before we were like, I think this is Tomb Raider.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And then it turned out actually it is tangent.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
It is, it is a part of the Uncharted umbrella.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I was like, of course.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
So didn't you like shout out to Nathan Drake?

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Oh, yeah. Like it looked, yeah.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.000
It's, it's obviously a woman with long hair that's wrapped up in a scarf covering her face.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
But like once the scarf comes off, it's just like Nathan Drake's like face, like with the stubble and everything.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Like, I just thought that would be hilarious.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
It would be hilarious. It'd be good.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Dungeon buster chat over at live.vognetwork.com says she's like Nathan Drake only with less scruples.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
So what I see of Nathan Drake on Tumblr, he doesn't have many scruples at all.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000
But, but the game looked great for what, I mean, cause that looked like it was being rendered like in game.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Like that was like an actual, like, so it looked really neat.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
And you know, again, I don't really play a lot of the Uncharted games and I totally recognize it.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I guess one of those series I need to play, but you know, tear me away from the MMOs and maybe I will.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Then they announced Marvel versus Capcom.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000
It is, and even last week, didn't we sit here last week and say it was debunked, but I guess not.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Somebody did a good job saving that thing from leaking completely, I guess.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:01.000
But it is more Marvel versus Capcom infinite, not Marvel versus Capcom 4, but you know, same thing.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Except as the joke I said with Loki earlier, infinite DLC perhaps, but we'll see.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:14.000
They did show gameplay. Now in the, in the press thing they did in the morning, well it wasn't really a press thing, but it might as well have been.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
That thing they did in the morning, they didn't really show the gameplay.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But if you watch the Capcom Cup later on, which we just happened to be watching Twitch at the time.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:28.000
We turned it on right as the Street Fighter V finals were happening, and then right after that, they showed the gameplay footage.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
And it looked pretty good. I'm assuming it's being done in Street Fighter V's engine?

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
No, Unreal 4.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Oh really?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Yep.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Interesting.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.000
But it looks good. There's only four characters we know so far. Ryu, Mega Man X.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
They were supposed to, Captain America was another confirmed character apparently, but yeah.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Ms. Marvel, or Captain Marvel.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Mega Man X and Iron Man.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
And Iron Man.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Yeah.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
So that's all we know so far, but then again, the rumors are out there, there are no X-Men.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Which would be a very strange departure for the series, because Storm has always been there, Cyclops has always been there.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
It would be very strange to not have that, but.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It would be a departure for the video game, but it's very current with what's going on in the comics right now.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
True, fair enough, fair enough.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.000
It would be cool though if we could get some more of the Cinematic Universe, maybe Doctor Strange, maybe Ant-Man or something.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Several people in chat are saying Morrigan was also confirmed, as well as Captain America.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
So, well that's cool.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Alright, so Marvel vs. Capcom, and then they drop the bombshell, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is out on Playstation 4 today.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Which, all those copyright issues we talked about a few weeks ago, I guess they worked that shit out, because there it is.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Which is weird, because that does have X-Men characters, and that also has Deadpool in it.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
And it's like, well shit, if you can work that shit out, why can't you work it out for this game?

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
It must be something about the fact that the game was already done a long time ago.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And if they did backwards compatibility with PS3, you could just run it that way, but now you have to buy it again.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Yeah, nice.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
They didn't do any remaster or anything to it, right?

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:00.000
No, they did. I thought it was upres, and it's also 60 FPS or something.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I just figured they took the 3 and made it playable on the 4.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
They could maybe.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
It has all the DLC though.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
That's cool.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:16.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, fear.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I was really into this.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Some folks in the room, like Alan and JD when this came on, were like, is this F-Zero?

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
But no, it's the next best thing on a Sony console, it was Wipeout.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And so they are remastering the Wipeout series, which is interesting because that developer had closed years ago.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:44.000
So Sony must be taking those assets and they must have given it to somebody else to develop the Wipeout Omega collection that is confirmed is going to come out on PlayStation 4 this summer.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I'm a fan of the Wipeout series. It took me a little bit to warm up to. I didn't like it right away.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.000
But it was a game I played a lot of all things. I think it was on the Vita or on the PSP, one of those.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I played a lot of the Wipeout. I remember playing that on the portable.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
And it's a fun series.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I mean, again, since Nintendo keeps denying me a fucking HD F-Zero, I will take what I can get.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:15.000
So an HD Wipeout, even though we did have one on, but you know, a more HD-er Wipeout on PlayStation 4 will be welcomed.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I'm excited to check that out for sure.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Then there was that Crash Remastered footage, Ace Combat 7, which I gotta admit I don't really follow the franchise.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
That has PlayStation VR support. I didn't know that.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.000
That looked pretty cool. But I also know this series does have its diehard fans, as Flight Sim games also do.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Although Ace Combat's not a total Flight Sim game.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
It's more arcade-y, I think.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Yeah, it's more arcade-y. I feel like it kind of fills that void for like, if Top Gun on the NES had become a series, on and on, this is what it would be now.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:56.000
You know what I mean? But obviously, because of licensing and stuff, there really wasn't any more Top Gun games after the NES.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
But I kind of feel like that's what this would be years later.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
But I know people are super into it, so I wanted to give it a shoutout.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000
I no longer care about Half-Life 3 because I saw that NAC 2 was coming out. Just kidding, no one cares.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Yes, NAC 2 was announced. And that kind of came out of left field.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Was the first one even good? Was the first one even a hit?

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
He had a cult following, I think.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:27.000
This is the sequel nobody asked for. Was it well-received in Japan compared to here, maybe? I don't know, Kuma?

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
There's a lot of people that are fans of NAC.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Really? Alright, well, hey, if that Windjammer game, which I'd never fucking heard of, can get a release that gets everybody riled up, then why not NAC?

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
What the fuck's Windjammer?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So, apparently, it's one of those, like, okay, you know how we never shut up about the Guardian Legend and how the Guardian Legend deserves a sequel or it deserves another chance, you know, all this stuff?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:58.000
So, is it GameSpot or is it Giant Bomb? One of those does that with Windjammer.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000
So, because they're bigger and more people pay attention to them, they actually got their wish.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It's a Neo Geo game where, if you wanted the home version, you had to get the console where the games were, like, $300 because it was the arcade board that you were basically buying. I think it's a Neo Geo game.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000
As the homeowner, Matt, insists, we're playing Windjammer at MAGFest. That's fine. I mean, there's obviously a reason they won't shut up about it.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:32.000
It looked like it must have had the competitive edge. It looked like the game, maybe this is something somebody stayed up all night playing at, like, a sleepover party, like, years ago or something, and that's why, you know, people have, like, a sentimental attachment to it or whatever.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:40.000
But, like, literally, as I was watching it, I was like, okay, like, the audience seemed to be losing their shit, and I'm like, there is clearly a joke I am not in on.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:48.000
So, I, like, went to Twitter and I'm like, what's the joke? Because I don't get some, I got some tweets. It's like, oh, Giant Bomb, they love it over there, all this stuff. I was like, oh, okay, so.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Well, what about what we want?

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I know, what about what I want? I guess we have to get about 2 million more followers before we'll get our Guardian Legend remake.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:10.000
All right. Let's see. So, what else? Oh, speaking of remakes, Parappa the Rappa unveiled as a remaster. That was a little bit of a bombshell that they dropped.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Now, we had heard Inklings a couple days before that Sony had filed a trademark or something for Parappa the Rappa, so there was a lot of news going into Saturday that it was coming back.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:32.000
And maybe that was a little bad that that came out because my mind went, finally, they're going to give us a new Parappa game. This is the game, they're going to right all the wrongs with Parappa 2.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Maybe Umjama Lamy will make an appearance in it, and it'll be like the must-have Parappa game. I am so excited. We're finally going to revisit this series, and it's a remaster of the first game.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Buy one of your favorite games again.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Yeah.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000
It's what they're doing, because why bother adding backwards compatibility when you can resell these games for 20 bucks a pop again?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Well, but if they're going to remaster them like they're doing Parappa, then I'm a lot more okay with it than I am when they don't.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Which, by the way, they released Parappa the Rappa 2 on PlayStation 4 last year when they kicked off their whole PS2 thing.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:16.000
So, is it really an accomplishment to remaster a game that's art style, was cel-shaded, and very...

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
4K graphics, Alan.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:28.000
But the whole point of that game is the music, which is fantastic, but it's like, we rebuilt Parappa the Rappa from the ground up or whatever, and it's like, but it was always cartoons. Who cares?

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And it wasn't that crazy of a system. I mean, what? It's a rhythm game.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
They look like, they're like paper dolls.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
And where the fuck is Vib-Ribbon? Wasn't I supposed to get that on PlayStation 4 like a year ago?

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I was promised Vib-Ribbon.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Yeah, where the hell's Vib-Ribbon?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
You know, did Parappa ever get the Space Channel 5 treatment where they like...

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Sorry, just quickly. I understand it was released on PlayStation 3, but we were supposed to get it on PlayStation 4 at some point too. That didn't happen. Anyway.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Do they ever like release a collected edition with the sequels all together in one place, or are they just like scattershot, like here's this one, here's that one?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I think they're scattershot because Parappa 2 was on PlayStation 2.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Right.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And so, yeah, and Umjama Lammy, for some reason everybody's forgotten about even though it was the superior game.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Because it had a different name.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Well, it was the sequel that Parappa, like, needed.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Should have been or whatever.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Yeah, should have been or whatever, even though Parappa 2 came later. But anyway, anyway.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Look, here's the thing. I don't want to sound like I'm hating on it too much because of course I downloaded the demo and it was a lot of fun to play.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.000
I still love Parappa. If this is how a new generation can get introduced to Parappa, then cool.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I just wish they'd go somewhere new with it. Maybe this is them testing the water, this has to do well for them to justify another stage.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:43.000
But it's like we just got Rez again, which, but I love Rez and it's great in VR and all this stuff.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
But Area X.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
But they added Area X. They added some excuse to it.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Now did you play Area X finally?

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I still haven't gone to Area X.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
You really need to do Area X.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:03.000
But it's like I would be ten times more excited about Parappa if like, oh, but you can, you know, get a new stage that we added to the game or there's something else and it's kind of missing for me.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:16.000
However, as part of that same announcement, in the same breath, they also said, by the way, LocoRoco and Patapon are also going to be redone just like this.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:30.000
And actually, this is really weird for me to say, I'm almost more excited about those two than I am Parappa because those two, the fact that they came out on the handhelds originally, I think a lot of people overlooked those series, especially Patapon.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:39.000
You know, Patapon's a pretty cool little, like it's like part music game, part, you know, but that's, I think a lot of people missed that game because it was never on a console.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
So I'm actually more excited that that is getting a second chance than even maybe something like Parappa.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Yeah.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
So what were you gonna say, Loki?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Oh, I was just gonna say that.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
That same thing.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Orange Right says, it's cool to have both Parappas, hopefully Umjama Lamy follows suit.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Exactly.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:08.000
But at the same time, if you're going to do Umjama Lamy, you can either A, add a new stage or B, give me the original version with the hell stage, not the censored stuff.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.000
That would be a draw, but I just, I'm not going to hold my breath that that would ever happen, but I'm just going to say.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
All right.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Let's see.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Gran Turismo Sport looked pretty gorgeous.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
It did, and it's also VR support.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
They were like, it supports the pro.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
It supports PlayStation VR.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It supports the camera.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I don't know if they said the camera, but it feels like it supports everything.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
4K.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Yeah, 4K HDR.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
And it looked gorgeous, like absolutely gorgeous, which Gran Turismo games usually do.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
So, um, you know, I'm, even though I don't get into that series because I can't do this.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Yeah, it's per sim.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I wish, I really wish that you go the Forza Horizon route where you can dial that sim or arcade in.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Do you know how bad I would love a Gran Turismo like arcadey game, like a Gran Turismo Horizon?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Like, why is it, is that what Drive Club was supposed to be?

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Drive Club is still more sim racing, I think.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Okay.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Motorstorm is more of like your arcade racing type thing.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Well, that was even so somewhat sim, but I mean, you know, Motorstorm Paco is not sim.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:18.000
If any Sony peeps are out there, Gran Turismo, but Forza Horizon it, like there's people that would love to see that.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Just like even the settings, like even if you can have the settings, just like you do in Forza Horizon,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:31.000
where you can, if you really suck at racing games like I do, and you just want to dial that old arcadey and stuff, then fine, you should do that.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I will point out though, they did change the name to Sport.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Could that indicate that it's a little bit different from the mainline games?

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Could be.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
So maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves. Maybe there is going to be a shift here.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Maybe, yeah.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
All right, so we'll see, to be continued.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Let's see, Ni No Kuni 2, they showed some more footage of, which that game's a little bit legendary here at VOG Network.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000
But I like to, I mean, they're very heavy on the anime and the cut scenes, but you saw a little bit of the playable stuff.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:03.000
It looked like it didn't maybe necessarily connect so much to the first game, which might be a good thing, because I'm sure there's a lot of people,

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I mean, the first game came out a while ago now, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of people who never played the first game are going to be curious about this one.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:14.000
So are they Final Fantasy-ing it a little bit, where the two games don't tie together?

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
But, you know, I really liked what I saw, so I'd be curious about it.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Just, you know, maybe reconsider the demo this time.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Maybe you guys can get Bobby Black Wolf on board with Ni No Kuni 2.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.000
If you approach the demo differently, just re-approach that a little differently.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Yakuza 6 and Kiwami, both were shown back to back.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I know Yakuza, like, super has diehard fans and very cinematic presentation and lots of things to do in those games.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So I know people are very excited about those games.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Again, another franchise like Uncharted that I know I need to play.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
So what's Kiwami?

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
That's the reimagining of the first game, if I'm not mistaken.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Oh.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
So that is both on the horizon for the next year.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Then, believe it or not, I'm going to bring up a sports game because MLB 17, the show, right?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000
They showed a little bit of that, but they showed this retro mode that looked awesome.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Like, it was like, you still, but it was like you had the modern-day graphics that you get with one of these games,

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
but the play style was like the NES or something.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
And the scoreboard looked all NES style and there were sprites,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
but all over like the photo-realistic graphics that come with one of these newer sports games.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:29.000
And I was like, you have my attention because I could play baseball games back during like, you know,

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.000
RBI baseball and bases loaded and all this stuff on the NES.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
It's a little rough for me now.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
So if they kind of dumbed it down a little bit in a retro mode, I really want to try that.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
So I think that was a very interesting approach for that.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Do it in a hockey game so I can feel like I'm playing Blades of Steel all over again, please.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Lara Croft GO, coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Actually, that was a It's Out Today release.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.000
That game has already existed, if I'm not mistaken, on PC and I think the mobile tablet space.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.000
So it's not a new game per se, but a lot of people will be giving that the first go.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
They announced a free game on PlayStation 4, Let It Die.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Although I used my quotey fingers with free because I noticed when I went to get Let It Die in the store,

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
they were selling gems in different sized packs.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Well, yeah, it's free to play.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
It's one of those free to play games.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
It's the guy that did, you know, all the, I forget the name, Grasshopper.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
The manufacturer, I think, is the one that's behind it.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I think that's who it was.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:41.000
They're the ones that did like, you know, Killer7 and No More Heroes, all that stuff.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Ys Origin, I was just surprised to see that at the press conference,

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
because usually we don't talk about the Ys series on the American shores.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000
I just wanted to say I was pleasantly blown away that they showed that here,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:56.000
because, you know, that's more of a cult type game for the really JRPG affectionados.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And they showed that on the main stage.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I thought that was cool.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:06.000
And then the big finish, you know, just explosion everywhere was The Last of Us 2.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
And a lot of people lost their flippin' minds over that, even though we don't have any gameplay,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
but just the fact that they're doing it.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And the characters that are coming back have a lot of people very, very excited.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And I know a lot of people really, really love that game,

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:23.000
so I understand why people are excited about the sequel.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Also on my list of games, I must have something against Naughty Dog.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Like, I keep skipping all their games. I'm not doing it intentionally.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I haven't played Last of Us either, and apparently a lot of people see it's fantastic.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Yeah, I keep meaning to visit the PS4 remaster, because it's only like 20 bucks,

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
but it's just, you know, again, pull me away from the RPGs if you can.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
But I know a lot of people very excited about the sequel.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
And the trailer did look really good.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:48.000
You know, for a reveal trailer, what I liked about it is that, yes, it was not gameplay footage,

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
but it definitely looked like it was something that was rendered completely in the game.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
You know what I mean?

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
So that's what I thought was really nice about that.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
So, very exciting.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Also, now, there's a game missing from this list, and, chat, you might have to help me out with this.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
What was the game? It was a twin-stick shooter game.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Oh, yeah.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
And they actually have the guy from Smash TV is on board with that game.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Is that the Supergiant Games game that they were showing?

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
What was the twin-stick shooter game? Because that soundtrack was amazing.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Whatever that was. I was so here for that.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
It was Hex Machina, Death Machine.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Thank you. Dark to see us as Hex Machina. That was the name of the game, yes.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And Eugene Jarvis, of course, of Smash TV Legend, is involved with that game.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:38.000
And the soundtrack was amazing. So, yes, please, to that.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
So, we'll be seeing more on that in the future.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Was that also the game that Supergiant Games was doing?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Or, no, I'm mixing up my games right now.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I don't see who's attached to that. Let's see what the other one was here.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Actually, I feel like the Supergiant Games had a different name.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000
I think I am mixing up games. I think Supergiant Games had a one-word game.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
That might be this one here. Let me just take a look.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Was it Vain?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I don't remember.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
No, that's Friend or Foe Games. That's different.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I do remember they also showed a concept trailer or whatever.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
They showed a little more about that Edith Finch game.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Like, whatever happened to Edith Finch.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
And that trailer was pretty conceptually pretty cool.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Did you see that? Oh, no, you didn't see that because you didn't see the show.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
So, never mind.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Pyre. I am mixing up my games.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Pyre is the Supergiant Games that's being worked on.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
But, anyway, that Hex Machina looked amazing.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
So, I'm here for that.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Okay, let's move on. That's a lot of gaming news.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
My god, we've had a two-hour opener tonight show.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
That's how much news has been going on this week. It's a busy week.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
But we've got to get to the classic game of the week.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.000
We've got to go back to a time. Let's go back to a time when retro mode was simply mode.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
The classic game of the week.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a week that she thinks,

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000
hey, brats, play this game instead of your fancy pants, Last of Uses,

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
and your Nax that you all want a sequel for.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Go back to this classic game.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Obviously Dark Sakura not here in studio tonight.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
She'll be back to take over the segment next week.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.000
So, here it is, the last chance to stealth this segment away with Halo.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000
But I'm going to allow JD to pick tonight's game.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
JD, what is the classic game of the week this week?

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
So, this is Generation 2's side game. It's Pokemon Puzzle Challenge.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Oh, a timely Pokemon selection to go with all the...

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000
We can't forget that Sun and Moon, there's still a lot of hysteria around that game.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Right.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Even though Final Fantasy XV came out this week.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Yeah. So, this is a game. It's a puzzle game, as you might guess from the name.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
This is for Game Boy Color, and it came out in 2000.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
There's a grid that's like 6 by, I want to say 18 or so.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000
You match the color blocks by switching two adjacent spaces horizontally.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
This is basically a remade version of Tetris Attack,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
which itself is a remade version of Panel de Pon.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:18.000
And you end up making a lot of combos, which are simultaneously matching three or more,

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
and you end up to about 10 or so.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And there's also chains when the blocks cascade, because this game has gravity.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
And if you continue to make combos, you make bigger and bigger chains,

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
which are worth more points and do more damage.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
There's a couple of different modes.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.000
The most prominent mode in the game involves what are called garbage blocks,

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000
where the game just drops entire rows of unbreakable blocks on you.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Well, of solid blocks.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:50.000
You try to break them by making a combo that's adjacent to them,

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000
and they turn into usable blocks, and they drop down on the field.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.000
And you are fighting various Gen 2 Pokémon.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:07.000
There's also time limit modes, and get all the blocks below a certain point.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
So it's a lot of fun.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
The really big advantage of this game is that it was on the Game Boy Color,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
so you could take it with you anywhere.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I've taken hours into this because I could just take it wherever I wanted

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
on road trips and stuff like that.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
There's a couple of goals that you can do besides the main storyline.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:29.000
If you do certain achievements, like make a chain of seven chain,

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
which is like blocks falling and cascading and continuing,

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000
you get to catch rare Pokémon and things like that.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000
This also had an N64 version that was Pokémon Puzzle League,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
and that was much more reliant on the anime.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But this version just had remixed versions of the Game Boy Color music

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:57.000
from the various towns that you have in Gold and Silver.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Yeah, I think that's about all I have to say about it.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
So I like to hear memories about playing the game.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
You kind of addressed this.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
You like to play this on long road trips and stuff?

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Yeah, well, I was in school when this came out,

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
and we would go on family trips, which were like six to eight hours in the car.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.000
And if you take a Game Boy Color with you, the battery will last that long.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
And it's something you do when you're just driving down the highway

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
and there's not much to look at.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Some of the Pokémon spin-off games were really good.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Yeah, this is one of the top-rated Game Boy Color games from the life of the system,

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000
despite being a spin-off game from our franchise.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
But puzzle games are one of my favorite genres,

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
and this one is absolutely worth picking up.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
It's also on the 3DS Virtual Console,

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000
so if you don't have a Game Boy Color anymore, you can still pick it up.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Ooh, good call.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Now, something I want to ask about, though, is that, you know,

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
if it had been me picking the Classic Game of the Week

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
and my brain went to Pokémon spin-off games,

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I probably would have picked Pokémon Puzzle League on Nintendo 64.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
But then again, you know, personal does a lot with that.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
But did you ever play the N64 version?

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Oh, yeah.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
So I love the N64 version.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I have it on Virtual Console on my Wii because I don't have it at 64 anymore either.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
It's a different game.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Part of it was just I had a Game Boy Color.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
That was my first video game system, so I got it earlier,

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
even though the game came out later.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
So part of it is personal memories, and part of it is just, like I said,

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I think the portable nature of it made it a much more accessible game.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
You know, you can't just take an N64 around with you.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
You have to have a TV and a power source and all of that.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:36.000
You know, the N64 version did have a 3D mode, which is cool, but...

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
And, like, those anime-style intros are pretty impressive.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Yeah, so the Pokémon Puzzle League is actually, you know,

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:46.000
it only came out in the U.S. because it relied so much on the anime dub.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I mean, it's a worthwhile game in its own right,

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
but this one really focused a lot more on the basics of we're doing puzzles,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
and that's the heart of this game.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Yeah.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
No, awesome.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I mean, again, this is a great, great spin-off game and just a fun puzzle game.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
And I'm seeing in chat, there is a little shade being thrown in chat,

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
so I should bring this up.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, Tetris Attack SNES greater than Pokémon Puzzle League N64.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Did the SNES one have a 3D mode?

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Because that was a really, really neat feature.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Yeah, and Tetris Attack didn't really have the Pokémon stuff in it,

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
which was a really cute license.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
I think it had Yoshis and stuff, though.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Yeah, yeah, Tetris Attack was a Mario license.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
And Tetris Attack wasn't bad by any means.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
It just, you know, I don't know.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
I mean, the original game this is based on in Japan,

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000
the Panel de Pon, that's where the lipstick item comes from in Super Smash.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:41.000
So, I mean, all of it is just let's throw our licensed characters on it

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.000
to make a theme for it because that's how you do puzzle games to make people buy them.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
And I'm with folks in chat who say both are great.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Let's leave it at that.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Yeah, they're both top-level games.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That's right.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Absolutely.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Puzzle games are awesome.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
So there it is, your classic game of the week Pokémon Puzzle Challenge

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
on the Game Boy Color.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Thank you for that pick.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
A very timely pick with a lot of Pokémon fever going around right now.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
We are going to take a break.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
It is time to finally take a break here.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
We still have plenty more show to go.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Believe it or not, even though there was all that big news,

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000
we still have news and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Live tonight with episode number 668 of our show for this,

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
December the 4th of 2016.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Again, Dark Sakura is still out for one more week,

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
but JD, you did a very good job of classic game of the week this week.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Thank you.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Appreciate that.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Good job.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
And speaking of kind of like classic games,

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Loki, you and I were talking about something before the show tonight

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
that I thought was kind of interesting.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Yes, I was discussing how I was playing Excite Truck and stuff,

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
and I said, you know what?

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Those launch Wii titles are 10 years old now

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000
because, you know, and so they're all contenders of the classic game of the week.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Yeah, for sure.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
That's kind of weird to think about is that, like, oh, my gosh,

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
and I remember when we were covering the Wii launch and all that stuff,

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:11.000
but, yeah, now things like the Zelda Twilight Princess would be eligible,

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
and we were talking about Trauma Center just the other day, right?

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
There was a Trauma Center game that was a Wii launch game.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Trauma Center was slightly about a month late,

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
so you have to wait a couple of months.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I thought it was a launch title.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
It was a launch title.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
It was close.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000
It was, like, a couple weeks later.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
It was a remake of the DS game anyway.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Oh, okay.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I thought we got that when we got the Wii game, but whatever.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
But anyway, yeah, that's great.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Red Steel.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
So, oh, yeah, Red Steel.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Oh, my God, the Ubisoft game, right?

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Yeah.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.000
So it's crazy to think that, yeah, Wii games are now eligible for classic game of the week.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Are Raving Rabbids also a launch title?

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
What is Raving Rabbids?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
I think that might have been later.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I'm trying to think what I got at launch because I bought a ton of the launch games

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
when they came out.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
So I know Wii Sports, that would be one.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Obviously, Excite Truck.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I think I got, I'm trying to think what other games I bought.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Twilight Princess.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I don't know.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Well, Excite Truck's all that matters.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Next time you get to pick a game, that would be one.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Exactly.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Yeah.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
All right.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Anyway, let's get back.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
You know what's not eligible ever, though, is Halo.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Just kidding.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Let's get back into the news cycle with some rapid fire news.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Loki.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
So YouTube has upgraded their streaming.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.000
So now you'll be able to stream in 4K, which is fantastic,

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.000
except I don't think that my internet can handle that.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I mean, I can't even download in 4K, I don't believe.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Well, then again, I don't have a 4K TV, so I wouldn't know.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
But yeah, you can do that.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:47.000
And also, they're going to extend, I guess, you're going to be able to do 360 videos.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Well, I guess in 4K.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000
It says the 4K streaming option also extends to 360 video.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Wow.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000
And then, of course, this was kind of cool.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Not necessarily during the PlayStation conference,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.000
but there was another conference going on in Vancouver, Canada.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
And that was MechCon 2016.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.000
And apparently, they announced that Piranha Games is going to be releasing

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
And it looks pretty awesome and MechWarrior-ish.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
It's going to be taking place in the year 3015,

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
and you're going to take the role of a rookie mech pilot

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000
who finds themselves in the midst of the war between factions.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000
And they said there's some gameplay footage that they showed off,

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.000
and also there's going to be a single-player campaign.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000
And that's supposed to come out on PC in 2018.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Are you going to get it because you like mech games?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
You know, I haven't played a MechWarrior game in a long time,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000
but I would be down for a new MechWarrior game with VR support.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
That would be pretty fucking awesome, to be honest.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Yeah, a VR mech game would be a lot of fun.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:59.000
It would be bringing back to the virtual world stuff.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Heck yeah.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.000
All right, let's talk about some backwards compatibility on Xbox One.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.000
There was a brand new game that came out that's a pretty big deal on Xbox One

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
for the Xbox 360 backwards compatibility,

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
and that is Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Speaking of launch titles, or at least I think Oblivion was more launch window.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I think it originally was supposed to come out that day,

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
but it came out a few months later.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Oblivion did, but obviously that is an Xbox 360 game a lot of people checked out

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
because the PlayStation 3 version had problems when it first came out especially,

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
and that had even come out later.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000
PlayStation 3, Sony botched a lot in the early days of that

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
that they had to fix later on.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
So a lot of people really associate the Elder Scrolls Oblivion,

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
if not PC, on Xbox 360.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
That's really cool that that is now backwards compatible.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I'm sure it also helps in free promo for Skyrim Remastered, if nothing else.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Not the only game to hit backwards compatibility this week, however.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Medal of Honor Airborne, Trine 2, and Astro Pop, the PopCap game,

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000
also now available on Xbox One.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Guess which one of those I actually own?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Astro Pop.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000
So I guess I do have Elder Scrolls as well, though.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I thought that game was phenomenal on the 360.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
The next games for PlayStation Plus have been announced.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.000
So December's PlayStation Plus titles, which will go live on December 6th.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000
It's a little bit later. It didn't go live this week,

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
but they're going to be going live a little later.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.000
For the PlayStation 4, Invisible Inc. Not I-N-K, but Incorporated.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Invisible Incorporated is going to be free for PlayStation Plus users,

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
as well as Stories, Path of Destinies.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.000
On the PlayStation 3 there is Hyper Void, which by the way is also a PlayStation 4 title.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
And also PlayStation VR.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Tiny Troopers Joint Ops, also a PlayStation 4 title.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.000
And then on the PlayStation Vita, Color Guardians, also a PlayStation 4 title.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.000
So there's a lot of smaller, but still games that you're going to be able to pick up on PlayStation 4,

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000
because when you cross by them on the PlayStation 3 and the 2...

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Yeah, I have to remember, apparently I had not downloaded or marked all the games for November,

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
so I went and grabbed the rest of them.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Like, oh, hey, there's some other games I missed.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Yeah, everybody's gone to the Rapture. If you still haven't played that, make sure you mark that.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
That was, I think, October.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
No, it's still up. I think it's still up for this week.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Well, I must have already gotten that then.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Like, there was BMX something, and then, oh, there's another game.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.000
And then if you haven't played this yet on the Vita, VVVVVV, which, you know, that's been out a million times.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Why isn't it on PlayStation 4?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000
It is.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Why isn't that free?

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:33.000
That's a good question. That one was not marked as cross by, but I'm almost positive VVVV is on PlayStation 4,

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
because I think I bought it.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Yeah, so, because I have that, you know, you guys all tease me about the Mass Effect 3 thing,

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.000
but I'm pretty sure I have VVVV on PC, 3DS, and PlayStation 4.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.000
So, yeah, that is interesting that maybe, maybe they all are. I don't know.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.000
But for some reason, they don't have it marked as such.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.000
All right, so let's now get into the mailbag.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Every week, you guys email us. Oh, I'm sorry, we're not going to do that.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I almost forgot to talk about what's in stores this week.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000
What is in stores this week?

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Lots of important things, actually.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:10.000
So, this week, we've got a lot of Oculus Rift games coming out.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.000
So, actually, it started off Arizona Sunshine on HTC Vive and the Rift.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Carnival Games VR coming to the Rift.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Dead and Buried, Dead Hungry, those are also both for the Rift.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Dead Rising 4 coming out on PC and Xbox One.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Dexed on Oculus Rift.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Enigma Sphere, Fantastic Contraption, Final Approach.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Hollow Ball, those are all on the Rift.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I Expect You to Die on the Rift and PlayStation VR.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Oculus First Contact, also on the Rift.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Pure Head Arcade.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Quar Battle for Gate 18.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Rip Coil, also all on the Rift.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Shadow Tactics, Blades of the Shogun on PC, Mac, and Linux.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Sports Bar VR on the Rift.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:04.000
The Climb, also Rift.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
A little PlayStation 4 game by the name of The Last Guardian,

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
I'm sure that no one is looking forward to.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
That comes out this week.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Well, yeah, just that little dump it at the end of the year title.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Exactly.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
The Unspoken on the Rift, VR Sports Challenge, also Rift.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.000
And then Werewolves Within on pretty much all VR platforms,

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.000
HTC Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
And then we've got a little later in the week,

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Apollo Justice, Ace Attorney on Android.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Nitro Plus Blasters, Heroines Infinite Duel on PC.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Yakuza 6 on PlayStation 4.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000
And let's see, what else?

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Space Hulk Deathwing, that's on PC.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Star League Girls Episodes, Starcia on iOS and Android.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
And that's it.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Bobby and Chad is talking about,

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
he's going to have a big show next week with all this VR stuff.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Yeah, there's lots of cool stuff,

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.000
and a lot of stuff that was on PlayStation VR,

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:11.000
so I know that apparently the Sports Bar VR

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
is supposed to be pretty good.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
I'm actually waiting to get that, maybe.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Well, let's look at the Japanese releases.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.000
The last couple of weeks were kind of slow,

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
but it's picking up again in Japan.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
There's a very big game out this week in Japan

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.000
on the PlayStation 4.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
In fact, this is a game so big

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000
that it actually has a special 500 gig system bundle,

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000
also a terabyte system bundle.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Yeah, all the kind of big stuff for this game.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
It's Ryu Ga Gotoku 6.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Do you know what that is? Ryu Ga Gotoku?

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Yep, that's Yakuza.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
It's Yakuza.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000
So Yakuza 6 is making its way to Japan this week,

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
and that is the big release on the PlayStation 4.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
But there are some other games as well.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.000
We also have Touhou Shin Pieroku Urban Legend in Limbo

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
is out this week,

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.000
and Dishonored 2 gets its Japanese release this week as well,

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
so a pretty busy week there in Japan with that being it.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
So it's like we're getting The Last Guardian.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
They're getting Yakuza 6.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Pretty big deal.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I imagine they've got to be getting

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
The Last Guardian there as well, though, in Japan.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Yes, they are also getting it the same day we are,

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
so it's kind of like a worldwide release, if you will.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Looking at the 3DS,

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
the 3DS has some Monster Hunter amiibos

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
that are coming out this week, so keep an eye out for that.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Miitopia is a game that's coming out on the 3DS in Japan.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
I'm not familiar with this title,

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
but I feel like this is something you would think

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
would have been released over here,

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
but Miitopia does look like, yes,

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
it's a game that involves the Miis,

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
and I'm trying to see if it bears a resemblance to, like,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
is it Tomodachi Life or something like that,

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.000
but no, it looks like you have the little Mii characters

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000
living in an apartment complex,

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000
but it's not like Tomodachi Life

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.000
because then you have this little battle mode and stuff too,

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000
so it looks like it might be a collection of minigames involving Miis.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Jamie would be very happy to hear that Puyo Puyo Chronicle

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.000
is coming out in Japan this week as well,

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
and that is on the 3DS.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
There's also a special Nintendo 2DS

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
to celebrate Pokémon Sun and Moon

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.000
is coming out in Japan this week.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Lastly, checking the Vita

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.000
because the Vita is still seeing a stream of releases in Japan.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
No Yakuza 6 on the Vita,

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:21.000
but Momo Touji Taisen Ryoku 3 is out on the Vita this week in Japan.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
It's a busy week. How about the UK, Loki?

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.000
The only thing I've listed right now is The Last Guardian.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Well, it's a pretty big release, so...

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Yeah.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.000
All right, now we're going to get to the mailbag.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Every week you guys e-mail us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:48.000
and we try to find some of our favorite messages to read here on the show,

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000
so let's get to it.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Our first e-mail this week, I believe, comes from a new e-mailer.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000
That's always exciting to hear from new people, so hello.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
This is from Lorcan, sends us this e-mail,

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
so a big hello to this first-time e-mailer,

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000
who says,

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Hello, O-L-R.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:07.000
In the last episode, you briefly mentioned enderall the shards of order,

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:10.000
which in German is die...

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I'm going to totally mispronounce this.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.000
The e-mailer apologizes.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Sorry if my English is not perfect.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Well, guess what?

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
My German is atrocious, so what?

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Die trumer der ordnung.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
I don't know if that's even right,

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
but anyway, that's what they call it over there.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I got the impression that you may not be completely aware of this gem.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
That's why I wanted to highly recommend it to you.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
If my impression was wrong, this mail is probably obsolete.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.000
No, you're right.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
This came up last week in the fan game stuff.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Yes, I have no idea what it is.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.000
They didn't even end up giving that away at the award show.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:41.000
That award, by the way.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Did you know that?

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000
No, I noticed.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.000
So anyway, Lorcan continues and says,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Enderall is a so-called total conversion of Skyrim.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000
It's an independent and free game that only requires the Steam version of Skyrim without DLCs.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000
It comes with its own soundtrack and professional voice acting.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
According to the website, in German and English.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I've only played the German version so far.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.000
It's basically like Skyrim, just better in my opinion.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
The atmosphere of the whole world is much denser with more details.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.000
If you like exploring, there's an enormous amount of things to find on and off the road.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
The skill system differs from Skyrim,

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000
and the story and quests seem more interesting as well.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
I haven't finished the game yet.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:23.000
So if you like Skyrim, you may want to give it a try instead of playing the special edition.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Greetings from Deutschland, Lorcan.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Sorry if my English is not perfect.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
No, you did a fantastic job, and thank you.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I love it when emailers will email us and tell us their side of the story on a gig.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Because again, we all have day jobs and lives and things like that.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
We cannot play every single stinking video game that's released.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
If I was getting paid a salary to do this show, maybe we could do that.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
But we don't, so it is what it is.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000
So we love when fans give us their opinion on things.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
I would have loved to get Alan's opinion.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Alan had to step out and run an errand, so he can't really tell his side.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
But I will tell him to check it out, because he does like mods.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.000
So the fact that you have this as a complete redo of Skyrim from the ground up with different stories,

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
that sounds pretty awesome.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Weird that we will never find out who won that award, though.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
This is very, very weird.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Reginator emails us, saying,

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Hello, OLR. It's your favorite friendly neighborhood gaming deals expert, Reginator.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I thought that I'd write in to mention that GOG is currently having their winter sale.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.000
It's been going on for four days as of now today, Sunday the 4th.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000
While not everything is on sale, a good many games are, including some true classics.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Now the nice thing is, during the sale, you can earn XP by performing certain tasks or buying certain stuff.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.000
As soon as you meet certain XP thresholds, you can claim up to three specific games for free.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Lastly, although it's too late to do anything about it if you hadn't done so already,

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:44.000
for the first 48 hours of the sale, you could have claimed an old D&D game, Temple of Elemental Evil.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Yeah, I went to go get Neverwinter Nights, and then realized it was only free for 48 hours.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Whoops on me.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.000
So, yes, I was aware of this, and I was disappointed that I missed out on the free game,

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000
but that's on me. I should have got it when I had the chance.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
I think it's only like four bucks otherwise.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.000
And then finally, I do have a game recommendation for you.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:08.000
If you like games Portal 1 and 2, then you'll love Maize, M-A-I-Z-E.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:13.000
The game will have you laughing so hard that you'll end up either pissing or shitting yourself.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Did that happen to you, Reginator?

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000
If you really want to tell us all here at OLR that that's what happened to you, it's a little embarrassing.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Keep that to yourself.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.000
I'll just say that the game is, wait for it, amazing.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Yeah, yeah, I know, the pun was corny. It was pretty bad.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:33.000
But I do like recommendations, especially for games that are like Portal.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.000
And Portal's a funny game, and so I'm all for this Maize a funny game too.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:43.000
This email was brought to you by the next Classic Game of the Week, Halo. No.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:50.000
And if you also like Portal, you should try Portal Stories, Mel, which is also a free expansion thing that they have.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Yeah, that's like a fan thing that they did on Steam or something, right?

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Yeah, it is. And then they also have one that's without the portal guns, it's with just the...

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:02.000
They're the paint guns, I guess, that do the...

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:12.000
It's with the bouncy one and the acceleration gels, the gel guns, so that's pretty cool too.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Our next email here is from, I think, another new emailer, Jose, who emails us and says,

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Dear OLR crew, I would like to say that I'm a huge fan of your show.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I want to know if you ever had a game that made you so angry you couldn't stand to finish it.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000
For me, it would be Spider-Man 3 on the Xbox 360.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Loki, a game that made you so angry you couldn't finish it.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.000
I know there has been, I just can't think of what it is off the top of my head.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I certainly get frustrated with games.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Like, you kind of hit a wall in a game and you feel like you're never going to get past that point,

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
and so you're kind of like not able to beat it.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000
God, I feel like this happens with a lot of different games.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I know what, for me, my copy of God of War, when I had the original God of War,

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:05.000
like at the very end boss, got all jacked up and it wouldn't work right and it couldn't kill the end boss.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000
And I remember that was frustrating, so I didn't ever finish that game.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000
But that's the only thing I can think of.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:17.000
I know there's been others that have been like that, but I can't remember what they are off the top of my head.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Here's some comments in our chat on that.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Act F says, Space Giraffe.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Akuma JP says, Mega Man or Final Fantasy XIII.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:29.000
And then some folks chiming in about that rock cyclops in Mega Man.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
That's what Dungeon Buster is saying.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Dark Tetsuya says, Dragon Quest Swords.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I was probably near the end, but I was fighting this super tough knight enemy.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I'd already expended all my healing items.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I finally kill it and a second one drops down in its place.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Oh, for me, that would be Pokemon Sun and Moon because one too many SOS battles killed it for me.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
I just want to be a little shy. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Actually, Shane gave me a copy of all the starter Pokemon.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I say a copy because he bred them and all that stuff.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
So I have a team now that's every starter Pokemon in a Mimikyu.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.000
The door is wide open for me to just play through the damn game.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I don't even have to catch any freaking Pokemon.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I can just take these all the way to the end.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
So hopefully that will happen in the next few weeks.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
We'll see.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Anyway, continuing on with the email.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Also, I want to know if you guys like anime.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
What's your favorite and least favorite?

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I was going to say also, Final Fantasy XIII on some of those, what were they called?

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
I always want to call them summons.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
You know, summons, whatever they call them.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Whatever their word for summons in that game was, you know, where you had to fight those to get them.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Eidolons.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Eidolons.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Yeah, some of those fights were really hard.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Okay.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Yeah.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Why the fuck do we got to change what they call that shit?

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000
I know.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Game, the game, the game.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
It's like fucking Final Fantasy XIV.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
That's why some people-

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
It's like, dude, they're the same fucking classes that were in XI.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Why the fuck did they change the names on all of them?

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000
That's why some people took issue.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000
They're just the fucking same.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000
That's why some people took issue.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.000
All right.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Anime.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Anime.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
What's your favorite and least favorite, Loki?

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
I don't watch a lot of it, but I like Miyazaki movies.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
That's my serious answer.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Yeah, they're good.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:06.000
They're good.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
I don't watch a lot of it.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I mean, recently I haven't watched a whole ton.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I do like the CG remake of Captain Harlock.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.000
I thought that was pretty badass.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
I've seen pieces here and there.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I've gone to enough conventions where they show it.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:29.000
My last anime that I watched, the anime series that I watched was Attack on Titan.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I really liked that.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000
But I don't really watch a whole lot of series.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
I mean, there's not a whole lot.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I used to just kind of get into the really short series.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Trigun was before that.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:42.000
I think it was probably the last one I liked a lot.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.000
And before that, even just a lot of- Neon Genesis was all right.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.000
But it's been remade several times now.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I don't even know.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:57.000
I'm talking about the original series, so I have no idea what it even looks like now.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.000
That's too damn hard to follow anyways.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.000
What else did I like?

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I used to like Golden Boy, which was a pretty pornographic one.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:09.000
But it wasn't too pornographic.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
It'd be like a rated R.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
It's not straight up porn.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000
It's this perverted guy, and it was a hilarious six episode series.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
But I liked that a lot, and I still like that.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
I think that's a hilarious series.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Project Aco, going way old school, I used to love-

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:31.000
That was such a weird series with the women that looked like men.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Just the whole, I don't know, world for that was pretty funny.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Yeah, and I used to watch the Pokemon anime back in the day.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I need to watch the new ones.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
I don't think the Pokemon anime is that great.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
The early ones were so cheesy.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I mean, it has a lot of character, but it also has a lot of,

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.000
oh, we're going to this random filler town of the week, and we're not advancing the plot any.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Anyway, there's going to be judgy people out there.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Yeah, and of course, if we're talking standalone movies,

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Ghost in the Shell, Akira, I mean-

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Urosu Toji?

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
No.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Oh, can I say the Tron anime?

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
No, seriously.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:12.000
That was pretty awesome, and I never finished watching.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I saw two episodes of that, and it was just-

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I have another answer. Daft Punk music videos.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Okay, you mean like the Interstellar 555 movie?

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Yeah.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000
The whole album?

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Is that a legit answer?

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Yeah, well, Interstellar 555 is basically all those together in one movie.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Yeah, I mean, it's short on plot, but-

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Isn't a lot of anime.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Well, depends.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I think as far as recent anime goes,

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Moatopenguindrum was amazing, and I liked that one a lot.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Stuff I watched when I was a kid, Digimon Adventure,

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.000
and, I don't know, Azumanga Daya was kind of old, but I loved that a lot.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
All right, let's get to-

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I think I have one more email I want to make sure I get to here,

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
except I accidentally closed the screen, so I got to bring it back up.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
But again, if you want to email us and participate with the show,

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000
it's participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Here it is. The email's from Rob-ba-ba-ba-ba.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000
That's the Rob with two Bs. Not to be confused with this Rob.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Rob-ba-ba-ba says,

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.000
I was happy to hear you report Lego City Undercover was coming to other consoles.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I called the Wii version best game of the year.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
I think he meant Wii U.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Or did it come out on the Wii at the same time? Maybe it did.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
No, it was only Wii U.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Okay, thank you. I think the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One may be superior,

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
because the load times were horrible on the Wii U.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
About 90 seconds each time you do a story, go inside police headquarters, etc.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000
The Wii U had the advantage of the touch screen being a map, though.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I found the game extremely funny, and it proved that GTA-type games can be family-friendly.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
I just hope it isn't $60.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I completed it 100% on a system with no achievements.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.000
I'm telling you, there's a lot of money that I would pay for a Lego Grand Theft Auto game.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
You know, let's hit it all.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Here it is.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
I understand that, but Lego City Undercover was different,

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
and they honestly need more in that series.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I think it would be pretty awesome.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Just dumb it down. Don't make it so violent.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I would totally play the crap out of that.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Participate at orangelaundry.com

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:11.000
if you would like to email us in the future week for Dark Soccer to read on air.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
We'll pick our favorites.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Sometimes we do have to edit them for content and time a little bit,

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
but we will always read your emails.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Unless we get inundated one week.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Then we're going to spread around the love.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Raginator, we love you, but when you email us every week,

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
we'll let someone else have a chance.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Participate at orangelaundry.com.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Let's get to some other news. Loki.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Speaking of a game that's also in the Lego franchise,

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I haven't played this in a while because I bought it on early access on Steam a long time ago.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:43.000
It wasn't really fun then because of the early state that it was,

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
but it's come a long way since then.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Now it's leaving early access,

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
and that game would be Lego Worlds.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
It was kind of that cross between Lego and Minecraft

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.000
where basically you're just building whatever the fuck you want,

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000
and you can dig and gather resources and stuff like that and get designs.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:03.000
And apparently I guess it was in early access for 18 months.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Man, that's been a while.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
But now it's going to be coming to consoles.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:11.000
So that's going to be coming to consoles on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in February.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.000
So you can go check that out.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.000
It looks interesting.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I may have to go try it again on PC again because I do have it on PC,

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
but like I said, back when I played it originally,

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
there was no point to the game.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:27.000
The building didn't seem that easy,

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:31.000
and just kind of the exploration was kind of lame.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I don't know.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
But it could be good.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.000
So I'll have to check it out again.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Alright, so this is different though from the Lego...

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
I mean, this is that Minecraft-y Lego game, right?

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Yeah, it's like the open world Minecraft-y game that you can kind of build whatever.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
So I'll have to check it out.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Did you actually play it on PC?

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I did a little bit,

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
but it was only, you know, it was early access,

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:58.000
so it was really glitchy and just kind of, I don't know,

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
there was no point to it.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Okay.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Well, maybe they'll put a point in the console releases.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
That would be something, wouldn't it?

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Minecraft kind of got a point when it came out to consoles,

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
so that was nice.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Alright, this is interesting.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:18.000
You guys know I'm not a fan of Facebook these days.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Tangent time.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.000
I've been needled a little bit on why did the show lose the Facebook question of the week.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:30.000
And admittedly, part of that is my own frustration with social media in general.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Part of that, you could say, is maybe the election stuff

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
and the whole fake news and all that stuff that kind of goes on around there.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
But this was something that I think even existed before that,

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000
is that like, you know, the whole, I just...

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
The social media has taken over too much, and especially Facebook in a way.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Like, I'm just, I'm really getting sick and fucking tired

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000
of how Facebook will just do what they want to do

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
because they think they know what you want.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Right?

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Facebook reorders your timeline.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Facebook shows you that friends are live when you don't really give a shit.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Yeah, it's so hard.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Like, I loved back in the day when everything was in order.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
You know, granted, I know there's plug-ins that do that,

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
but like now it's so hard.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Like, even like you couldn't say you can view someone's, you know, story or post or whatever,

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.000
and you go and look at something else and you come back and you can't find it again

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.000
unless you go to their page because it's just been reordered the shit.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000
So, you know, I just, I feel like on that type of personal level,

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:30.000
like, I don't necessarily want to keep supporting Facebook more and more

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:35.000
because I feel like Facebook is something a lot of us should be cutting back on,

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.000
myself included.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:41.000
You know, Facebook is just too much right now.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
And I think that's kind of like where my head is at,

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000
is that like I don't necessarily need Facebook to be like a central part of the show,

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000
but at the same time, I don't want you guys to hear that as, you know,

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
I don't have a lot of love for the community and you guys that are out there

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
and wanting to get more voices on the show.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:58.000
I do realize that Facebook is so integrated into our lives and all that stuff

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.000
and that I'm almost committing suicide for the ratings of this program

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
by not being more active on Facebook.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:08.000
And I'm really, you know, robbing the show of more potential listeners and all that stuff.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.000
But that's just where I'm at personally is that I'm kind of willing to give that up

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.000
because I believe that strongly that we need to cut back on the amount of Facebook in our lives

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:20.000
and not necessarily increase it, like it's just too much.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I realize it's a little tangeny, maybe a little political,

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
which you guys don't always like it when we go there,

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
but that's just my honest to God answer.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
So, I hope you guys don't take it personally.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.000
If there's other ideas you guys have, I'm all ears.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Google Plus, though, even that's, I mean, you guys might think that,

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
even Google Plus is starting to be like,

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:43.000
well, since we didn't work as a social network, we want to be more,

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I feel like they're going for more like a Pinterest angle or something,

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
where it's about communities and groups.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Google Plus is failing to tell me what the hell they are right now,

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.000
and that's why I'm struggling with Google Plus even.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000
So, JD?

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
You could always just post the question on Twitter.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.000
That's true.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Because Twitter, at least, I mean, it has its issues, but it's not the worst.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Twitter does have its issues, but Twitter is extremely filterable,

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:07.000
and the fact that Twitter limits you to 140 characters is a lot.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000
But Twitter has its own drawbacks as well.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Sure.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Some folks in chat say more VoG, less Facebook.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, use the VoG forums instead of Facebook.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I feel like Facebook killed internet forums, so many of them.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:23.000
I mean, yes, I know NeoGaf is still a thing, and there's others as well,

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
but, like, it's rough. It's rough.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
And Facebook is a poor replacement.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:30.000
It does not work well as a message board because of all the algorithmic,

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
you know, stuff like that.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Like, I mean, Reddit is better for message boarding.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000
And maybe that's the thing.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I've actually had somebody suggest you should do an OLR Reddit.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Maybe. Again, Reddit has its own issues too,

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
but I'm a little more open to that right now.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000
I feel like Reddit has a lot of good cross-promotion opportunities.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
So anyway, that's where I'm at, so I apologize.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
I just wanted to respond to that because people have been calling us out on it.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Like, why did we kind of?

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.000
And, you know, after the hiatus, I thought we could incorporate it back into the show,

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:02.000
but I felt like it was like we were doing more Facebook instead of less.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.000
And it was like that promotional side of me was starting to take over,

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.000
and I was like, you know what?

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
I want to do this for the right reasons.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.000
But speaking of which, this is about Facebook.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:18.000
And as exciting as something like this sounds,

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.000
there's a part of me that winces because Facebook owns it.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
And this is Facebook gaming.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.000
So this is separate from the games that cluttered your feed at one time

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
before Facebook banished them to their own feed.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.000
And even the separate, like they have a store type of thing, like Steam,

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
like a Facebook client, Facebook universe or something they call it.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
And their own platform.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000
But this is separate from all that.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Now they're going to shove games into Messenger, or they have.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000
They say it's in closed beta, but it showed up on mine.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000
And so in a message with Alan, you hit the little controller,

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.000
and now you can challenge Alan to play a game of Pac-Man.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
And it's a little HTML5 Pac-Man.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:58.000
It's just one stage, one life, and it's who can get the highest score.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.000
They're like little micro games.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Yeah, my wife did this with like, they had like,

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.000
if you do some of the emojis for like basketball sports games,

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
like there's little mini games associated with that.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Is this going to be Farmville all over again?

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Perhaps.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Because I got tired of invites real quick.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.000
I don't know.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Space Invaders, Words with Friends, also involved in like micro versions

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
available on.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Yeah, you send this through Messenger, Jimmy.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000
I'll have some Words with Friends.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000
I spammed one of my groups today just because I wanted to test it,

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
and I don't think anybody else tried it.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.000
It was just me and some of my friends from like Chicago and other places.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.000
I don't think anybody else touched it.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:38.000
But I did play the Pac-Man, and it was a competent conversion,

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000
and there's a lot I like about the idea.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.000
I just, it's on Facebook, and therefore I'm already kind of like,

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000
does Facebook need to have more?

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I don't know about that.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
So anyway, there you go.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000
So Facebook is launching the gaming thing,

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.000
but it is a little bit more micro, in tune to play a messaging.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.000
I guess to play while you wait for somebody to respond,

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
and you will know when they've read the email,

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
because Facebook will tell you that,

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
and it does not allow you to turn that setting on or off.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Just like Facebook won't allow me to get rid of,

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
apparently I have an Instagram account.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:16.000
I have never set up an Instagram account.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I have an Instagram account,

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000
and I get fucking notifications on it constantly,

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
and it fucking pisses me off.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.000
So anyway, let's move on.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.000
I could talk about my grievances with that for a long time,

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
but we're going to move on for now.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
All right, so this is kind of cool.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Ubisoft, you know, they're putting out some VR games,

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
and one of the things that's kind of neat about this is

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
that they're going to be going cross-platform

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
for their multiplayer on those.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
So for Eagle Flight, Werewolves Within,

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
and Star Trek Bridge Commander,

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
players will be able to play against each other

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.000
across PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive,

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.000
and apparently the first game to have that available is,

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
well, I guess the only one that's out right now,

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Eagle Flight, so that's coming,

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.000
and then Werewolves Within looks like December 6th,

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:07.000
and Star Trek Bridge Crew is on March 14th.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.000
But see, I always thought that would be kind of difficult

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
with all these different platforms that are out there.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
You know, how are we going to have some sort of synergy

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
with being able to play with each other,

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
and now this is kind of neat that they're doing this.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:19.000
I don't know how that's going to work

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
with all the different control schemes and everything,

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
if that's going to play into it quite a bit,

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000
but it's nice to see that at least this is playing nice

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
with the other platforms.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Nintendo Switch, a lot of you want more information

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
on the Nintendo Switch, and you're going to get

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.000
the information on the Nintendo Switch in early January,

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000
January 12th.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
That date is coming sooner than we think.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
I mean, that's only about a month away now.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
So finally, finally we know what Nintendo's future

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
will be looking like a little better.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Not only will we be getting the announcements on January 12th,

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
there is going to be an event in New York.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:53.000
It is private, so I imagine this is a press-only event,

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
but it will be happening on January 13th,

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:56.000
the very next day.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
It is a five-hour event that will further emphasize

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000
on some of the details that Nintendo plans to announce.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.000
This is my perception, is that this is the press

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
to get their opportunity to play the Switch,

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000
to write all about it, because this is around the time

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
pre-orders will be going live.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
I can't stress this enough.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.000
If you think you want a Nintendo Switch,

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
you need to be prepared to pull the trigger

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000
on a pre-order on January 12th,

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:28.000
because that is likely when it will be going live everywhere.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:31.000
And you guys know how Nintendo is with hardwares.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Incompetent.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000
So I would highly suggest, if you want a Switch,

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
get in on that on January 12th.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.000
So if you don't have money and you need to put down 50 bucks

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000
at GameStop or whatever, either A, find a place

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
that doesn't ask for money upfront,

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:49.000
because Amazon doesn't, pretty much any other place doesn't.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Maybe Target wants like a dollar, right?

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Did they do systems at Target, though?

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
They do games on systems.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000
I feel like they do.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000
So my advice, strong advice, do that research now.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Where are you going to pre-order?

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
What are you going to look up on the 12th?

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
And get ready to go when that announcement is done.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:11.000
But anyway, we will get all the details on January 13th.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:14.000
And I'm not guaranteeing pre-orders are going live that day

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000
or even the January 13th, but they will go live around that time.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.000
If they're still launching in March, they gotta be coming soon.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Like, two month pre-order window?

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:25.000
I'm shocked that they haven't already started taking pre-orders for that.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:28.000
I am also shocked as well, but I believe Nintendo

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.000
is truly waiting for the holidays to be over,

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
so that that is off everybody's minds,

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000
because in early January, Nintendo will dominate gaming news.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000
There's really nothing else going on in January,

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000
except we will have a lead-up to Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.000
I think we have a couple games in early January that were put,

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:48.000
like the South Park game.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
No, we don't have a date for that, do we?

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000
That's sometime around that.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.000
But anyway, my point is, there's not going to be a lot to compete with.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
So Nintendo will have an open news cycle.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
They will dominate that conversation.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000
It's a risk, but we'll see.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Anyway, William Murderface in chat says,

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Incompetent? I doubt it. More like manipulative.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Well, since they won't admit to being manipulative,

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
I am left to assume the other.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Also, in Wii U news and Switch news,

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Stardew Valley for the Wii U has been canceled.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
It will not be happening on the Wii U,

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
but Nintendo fans, do not be disappointed.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
They're just going to move it over to the Switch.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.000
And I think this makes a lot of sense coming from the dev team.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000
They're looking at Wii U and the current gaming landscape,

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000
and they made the difficult choice to shift things over to the Switch.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Hey, look, I get it.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
The Wii U's got one foot out the door.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:44.000
I know it's going to have a last hurrah with Breath of the Wild,

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
but it has to share that with the Switch.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000
So I think this is the right call.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
And I still consider myself a Nintendo fan.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
This is the right thing to do.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Sucks for Wii U owners,

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:59.000
but I'm sure a large percentage of the folks

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
that would be interested in Stardew Valley who own a Wii U

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
are probably looking into the Switch.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.000
The only question is the supply.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Just a couple more stories,

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
and then phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Loki.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Alright, so we had talked a little bit about Pokémon GO

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.000
kind of expanding their whole update with the new tracker.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Well, that previously was on just the west of the Mississippi.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.000
Now it's updated, I guess, for the whole United States

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
and most of Europe.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.000
And not sure if they're going to be adding anything else near future,

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:38.000
but yeah, it's nice that that new tracker's out there.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.000
So hopefully a lot more of you can experience it.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.000
So luckily it didn't take a long time for that to get everywhere.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Right.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Once it started expanding, because it took a long time

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.000
once they were beta-ing it to go everywhere.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Even if I feel like some days I'm the only one still playing Pokémon GO.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Well, Alan's still playing here and there.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:57.000
He just hit 27, right, last night?

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
24.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.000
No, not that high.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.000
24.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Yeah.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.000
You're farther along.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:03.000
I hit 26.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I took advantage of the bonus XP to use a lucky egg over Thanksgiving.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Got it.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
And so you're still playing Pokémon GO.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.000
I am.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.000
So there are people playing Pokémon GO.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:12.000
It's just not nearly what it was.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
I'm not nearly playing as much as I used to.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
If I get more burnt out on Ingress, maybe.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000
I mean, because I like having something to do, but I'm just...

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
I'm hitting that point in Ingress where I'm getting burned out.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Like, I pushed too hard to get to level 15 by the end of the double XP event and all that.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.000
And I'm just kind of hitting this point where I'm like, I have...

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.000
And that happening at the exact same time Final Fantasy XV coming out,

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:36.000
it's like I'm having that whole sit-down discussion with myself,

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
because I do that with the voices in my head, of the whole,

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
do I spend too much time playing MMOs?

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:44.000
But there's a very social and real element to Ingress I don't want to miss out on.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
So I'm kind of like one of those, I don't really want to play Ingress,

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.000
but if there's a pizza party involved, then I'll get it out.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Right? That's what it is for me.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:59.000
It's more of when a game becomes, you know, it's from when it's fun to when it's a chore.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.000
And it's been more on that chore side.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I am, in full admission, I am still having a hard time letting it go.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.000
There's a very, very competitive side of me that doesn't want to let it go.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Right.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:11.000
And I still have to work that out.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
No one likes losing, but you know.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.000
No, it's not, I mean, but our team isn't losing for the entire year,

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
because we've won more cycles, of course.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.000
But what happened, we may be losing the current battle,

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
but we're definitely not losing the war.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:29.000
But anyway, all that joke and smack talking aside and all that stuff,

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:33.000
I just really have to evaluate the priority level,

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
but that's going to take some time, I think.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
As it would with any MMO.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Anybody who's been spending two nights a week playing World of Warcraft

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
kind of has to hit that point, I think.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:46.000
And either you quit cold turkey, or you kind of start to ease out,

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000
and you say, maybe I'll play one night a week, or that type of thing.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Yeah.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Anyway.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
All right.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
See, I need more time to play Pokemon.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:57.000
That's my problem.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.000
I can't play Pokemon Sun.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
I'm not even talking about Pokemon Go.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
I'm talking about Pokemon Sun and Moon.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
I don't have enough time to play it.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.000
But Pokemon Sun and Moon, I mean, a lot of you are into it.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.000
And this is not a surprise to me whatsoever.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon sold a whopping 3.7 million units

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
in just two weeks.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.000
That is an 85% increase on what they sold with Pokemon X and Y.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000
And I firmly believe this is Pokemon Go's doing.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:31.000
I think it's also the smart intertwining between Pokemon Go

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.000
bringing back Generation 1 Pokemon to people's minds

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
and the throwback to Gen 1.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Especially if we had that cross interaction with it.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Well, at the end of the day, Pokemon Go was probably rushed

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.000
not only for the peripheral, but for this reason.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Pokemon Go had to come out when it came out to get the hype,

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.000
to get the pre-orders, to get people in for Sun and Moon

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
so I could be reporting this today.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:01.000
So even if I'm sitting here saying, overall, well, Pokemon Go is declining

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:06.000
and all this stuff, this, I firmly believe, is in large part,

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:10.000
not solely, but in large part to the fact that Pokemon Go happened

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
and it was such a big deal that it was.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:16.000
However, it shouldn't be dismissed that, SOS battles aside,

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Pokemon Sun and Moon probably are the strongest Pokemon games

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:22.000
they've, dare I say, ever made.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
JD, ever?

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Well, I mean, yeah, probably.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
I'm nostalgic for Gen 2.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
I know you are. I know you are.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
But, I mean, Shane on the last PokeStyle podcast was saying

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
these are his favorite, hands down, and I can see why.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I really can. And all the quality of life stuff really, really helps.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Yeah. And it's really pretty.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
It is!

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.000
You know, there's a legendary they're giving away for free tomorrow

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.000
if you've beaten the game, and it'll be up until March.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
I haven't beaten the game. I guess I better get on that.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Well, I mean, your deadline is, like, March 5th.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Oh, well, I have a little time.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Yeah, but the distribution starts tomorrow, December 5th,

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.000
and it's a QR code that you use the scanner in-game for.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Okay. Which will I finish first? Are we ready?

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Here it is. Another multiple choice for everybody.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Which will I finish first?

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Final Fantasy XV.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Pokemon Sun and Moon.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Level 16 in Ingress.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Which will happen first?

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
I think that depends on social pressure.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Loki, care to guess?

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Final Fantasy XV?

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
That's where my money is.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Act-Def says Mass Effect Andromeda will happen first.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
That's a fair bet. That's a fair guess.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Alright, we'll see. We'll see.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Alright, anyhow, also, if you want to experience Sun and Moon

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.000
and other times, the soundtrack is now available on iTunes,

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
so you can check that out.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:47.000
The pricing appears to be 8.99 euros,

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
at 16.99 Australian dollars.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.000
I guess when this report came out, it was only in those stores,

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
but usually when those come out in Australia and Europe,

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:59.000
they will be available everywhere else in a matter of time.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.000
That brings us to the end of the news that we had slotted for tonight.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
We kind of ran through Part B here,

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
but we had a really long Part A tonight,

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
so I guess everything balanced itself out.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
But we're not done yet, because you guys have a chance to call us.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:16.000
If you want to talk about Pokemon, or the Game Awards,

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:20.000
or possibly want to talk about the PlayStation Experience,

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:21.000
or something else that happened this week,

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.000
please feel free to give us a call.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Ooh, it's lighting up already, so let's get to it.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
Well, a lot of things happened this week,

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:40.000
but I want to ask about the PlayStation Experience.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Sure.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Basically, my question is, how does this affect E3?

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Like, we got a lot of announcements yesterday with the keynote,

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
and the PlayStation Experience,

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.000
and really big bombshells like Marvel vs. Capcom,

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:04.000
and The Last of Us Part II, like really big games.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:09.000
And I wouldn't see these announcements outside E3,

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:14.000
but now with events like this, we have them.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.000
So what's going to happen now with E3 in the future,

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:24.000
with events like this, like PlayStation Experience?

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
My honest answer, Akdeft, nothing.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I think we will continue to see E3.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
Because, and the reason why I'm saying this is that

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
if this was year one of the PlayStation Experience,

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
I would be with you a little bit.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
But this is year three, and every year,

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
they have dropped some pretty big bombshells on us.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Street Fighter V was announced at the PlayStation Experience.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:45.000
What were some other big stuff that came out of PlayStation Experience?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:46.000
You remember Loki?

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
I just remember Street Fighter V was the big one.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Final Fantasy VII, not remake, but remaster.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Remember that whole, like everybody started to lose the...

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.000
That was that whole thing.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:59.000
But honestly, I think Sony is pumping out enough games,

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
and they've figured out the news cycle well enough

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:04.000
that they can kind of do both.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
And this year, if I'm not mistaken,

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:10.000
didn't they have an additional conference about virtual reality

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
that they were still able to do?

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
So Sony's got enough news.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.000
I was really surprised, Akdeft, that God of War didn't show up,

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:18.000
at all.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
That ended up being a little more exclusive to E3.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:23.000
I'm sure that game is still in the oven, still cooking.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
We need to see what's going to come with that.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:28.000
So I'm not disappointed it didn't show up or anything like that.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
But I imagine we'll get an update on God of War at E3,

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
and everybody will lose their shit.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
We didn't see Final Fantasy VII remake.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
We didn't see Kingdom Hearts III.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:39.000
One of those has to be next year, as I said earlier in the show,

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:43.000
just like there was a lot of pressure for Last Guardian to be this year.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:46.000
So yes, I think we'll get an update on one of those games

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:47.000
next E3.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:50.000
So I think there's still plenty left to talk about, Akdeft.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:54.000
So I don't think this is going to ruin E3 or the news cycle or anything.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
I really don't.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Yeah, me either.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:04.000
I don't think E3 is going to disappear from one day or one year to another.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Because we also have third parties.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:14.000
But I think E3 is going to become more and more irrelevant

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:21.000
for at least the big three, like Microsoft, maybe Sony and Nintendo eventually.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:27.000
I'm pretty sure I'm seeing right now with Nintendo not taking E3

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:35.000
like a serious platform to show their games on.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:36.000
You know what, you raise a really good point.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
I kind of see where you're going with this now.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I see why you brought this up in the first place now.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:41.000
You're right.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:45.000
This is kind of all about the diminishing of E3's relevancy.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:49.000
The fact that the Nintendo Switch...

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:54.000
When was the last time we had a console not unveiled at E3?

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Not unveiled at E3.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:58.000
A console, not a peripheral.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:02.000
So not like VR or any of that stuff, the Move or any of that stuff.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:05.000
A console, not at E3.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
I can't think of one.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.000
I really can't.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:11.000
Nobody in chat can think of one that has a memory that goes a little further back.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:12.000
I can't.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:16.000
So that alone, you're right, Act F, that's huge news.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
But I still think at least for the next couple of years,

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:22.000
I don't see E3 going belly up next year,

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:25.000
but I definitely think the ESA probably has to be having that conversation

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.000
about how do we keep this show exciting?

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Are we going to open it up to the public like Tokyo Game Show,

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:34.000
which would be fascinating, or what's going to happen?

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I don't know.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.000
I could see E3 as a whole changing,

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.000
but for now I think Sony still has enough news

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:47.000
that their E3 press conference will still be a big deal.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:52.000
And yeah, you bring up a good point.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:55:02.000
The public, E3 only accepts media and people from the industry,

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
but it's not open to the public.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Something like PlayStation Experience, it is.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:11.000
The whole perception of what is media is changing,

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:15.000
and ESA has not always done the best job of catching up to that.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:18.000
I'm not just saying that as some bitter-beddy podcaster

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
who used to be able to get an E3 no problem

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
and now has a really hard time doing so

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:27.000
because E3 doesn't know how to measure the impact of podcasts and so forth,

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
which, you know, whatever, whatever.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
But it's not even podcasters.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:34.000
We were the question marks of ten years ago.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
It's just a lot of us are still going.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Now the question is YouTubers and Twitch streamers.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Are they media?

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Or not?

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
Because many of them have like 50,000 followers.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Some of them are still getting into E3.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:51.000
What is that all about?

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.000
And I think ESA has a lot of these types of questions to answer.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Yeah, and we've seen in the last few years

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.000
that many YouTube personalities go to E3 like,

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Oh, I'm going to E3 like it's something uneventful.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Yeah, I'm going to E3, whatever.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:15.000
And yeah, what it means for the rest of the media

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:18.000
or journalists in the industry.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.000
And I was talking about this in my podcast

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.000
that something like PlayStation Experience,

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000
I don't even need a media badge.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Probably if I want to do interviews,

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:38.000
I want to cover more for my site and all that, maybe.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.000
But even if I don't get it, I can just buy a ticket and go

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:46.000
and at least play the games, live the experience

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:50.000
in my personal level and report from that.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:55.000
So I think that E3 at least needs to change that.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
So yeah.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
Very, very good perspective and some really good points,

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Zach Deft, gold star for you for this call tonight.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
I do want to say, though, on chat,

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:07.000
SSJ100Matt says the investors will still want E3 around

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:10.000
regardless just to be that figure piece to tout the stocks.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.000
You know, Loki, let me go back to you

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
because you worked on that side of the industry

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
that we often don't talk about on this show

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
because let's be real, it's not the glamorous side of games.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:24.000
And that is the wheeling and dealing of the distribution

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
and the marketing and all that side of things

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
because we only get that whole, you know, the media fire up

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:32.000
and so forth. Does that side of the industry still need E3?

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Does that side of the industry still need that big show

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
every year to have those wheelings and dealings

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
about how many copies are on shelves and all that?

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:42.000
They do. I mean, to a certain extent, yeah,

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
they do meet a lot of, I mean, I don't know

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
if it necessarily needs to be E3, but there aren't

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
a lot of conferences that they go and meet

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.000
with all these first-party publishers and stuff.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
So that is really the only time that they're sitting

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.000
face-to-face to renegotiate deals and to try to get them

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.000
to get you enough supply. I mean, because you think

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Nintendo's bad in stores. I mean, it's just as bad

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
on the distribution side. It's like, oh, hey, by the way,

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:08.000
yeah, we know that, you know, you have customers looking

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
for thousands of units of, you know, the Wii,

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:14.000
you're getting five. It's like, it's ridiculous.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:17.000
All right. Akdeft, again, great call.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.000
I still think E3 is going to be a thing,

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.000
but the ESA definitely needs to evaluate a lot of things

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:26.000
with E3, and I wouldn't be surprised if we, you know,

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
get some press release in 2017. You know, they haven't

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
opened registration for 2017 yet. That's not going to happen

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.000
until after Nintendo does their thing.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
But I'll be very curious to see if maybe there's going to be

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:38.000
some changes with this year's show. We'll see.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Hopefully. We'll see. All right. Take care, my friend.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Hey, no problem. Anytime. Bye-bye.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Great call from Akdeft. OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
all one word on Skype. See, I thought he was kind of

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
going one place at the beginning of the call.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
It was just like, I took it one way about the announcements,

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:56.000
but he really made a great point about E3

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:59.000
and that shows like PlayStation experience.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
I don't want to say they take away from E3,

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:04.000
but they kind of show that Sony can throw their own damn party.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Nintendo can throw their own damn party.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Microsoft is certainly capable of throwing their own damn party

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:12.000
if they want. We just live in a different time now.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:15.000
All right. Let's take another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:18.000
And to be honest, on the retail side,

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Microsoft does throw their own damn party.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Sony also throws their own damn party.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Nintendo's pretty much the only one that doesn't.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Microsoft threw a party when they announced the Xbox One.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Now, granted, that backfired on them spectacularly,

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
but I don't think they're ruined.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
I mean, there's a new person in charge at Microsoft.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:37.000
Microsoft is not barred from ever being able to do their own.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Like, if Microsoft wanted to do a Microsoft thing, people would go.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
I'd probably have an Xbox One already.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
If Crackdown would have fucking come out already.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
All you people that never shut up about Halo, you'd go.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
Anyway, we have another call on the line. Let's get to it.

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Well, the only reason why people complain about Halo is because of the budget.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Because you're cutting in and out a little bit,

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
but I think you said because they want to bug Jamie?

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
No, the budget.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Oh, the budget.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Yeah, that's the Fifth Avenue store.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
Ah.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
Did we have our... Okay, so our feed went down live.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
They're saying... Yeah, it just...

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:15.000
That's okay. We're going to keep going for the sake of the recording.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
So, Rama, what's on your mind tonight?

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.000
First off, can we give an F.U. to Comcast for the feed going down?

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:23.000
Yes, I agree. Big F.U. to that.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
That was a weird hiccup, though.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:28.000
But here's the thing, Rama, it actually might not have been on my end,

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
because you're still here on the call.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:34.000
So that indicates to me an F.U. to the VoG hosting service,

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:37.000
because our call didn't drop, so the internet connection didn't cut out.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Yeah, and I was starting to freak out.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:43.000
I'm just like, my settings were set perfectly when I called Bobby earlier tonight.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:46.000
I mean, nothing changed except I turned up the volume.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
We're under attack, we're getting hacked.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.000
First they came for the voting machines, then they came for O.L.R.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Alright.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
My DM hurts.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Maybe I said too much about the E.S.A. tonight, they're coming for me.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
Alright, no, in all seriousness, what's on your mind?

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Well, there were some things I wanted to say, but I forgot.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:10.000
But I will listen to the show, it'll come back to me, and I'll just send an email.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Can I just give a fuck you to Capcom real quick?

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Oh, why is this?

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:19.000
Nobody wants Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:20.000
I think we're at the...

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000
I do.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Well, you are one out of like a thousand people, okay?

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.000
When that was announced, the majority of my Facebook was like, no, no, no, no.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:31.000
I don't know the people in yoga have something pretty excited about it.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
Alright, let the man finish.

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:36.000
Even though there's a little confirmation bias at work here,

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:39.000
what is it that people really want?

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:44.000
New stuff. I get it.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:47.000
Capcom is rehashing these IPs because they're like,

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:50.000
oh, let's throw some more money and just make more money out of it,

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:55.000
instead of like, let's bring an older IP or older franchise out,

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:59.000
blow the dust off of it, tweak it some, and put it back out there and see what happens.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.000
What's fascinating to me is something like Resident Evil 7 is like,

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
it's a Resident Evil game, but it's kind of not.

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:09.000
Like, you look at all the previews, you're like, this is going a really different direction.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.000
Obviously inspired a lot by the PT stuff and all that.

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:16.000
It's interesting that they kind of won't put a new name on some of their games

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
that have clearly changed.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Yeah, but I'm like, well, I remember when we used to complain about Nintendo doing this,

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:29.000
and I was like, well, you know, Nintendo's bringing back, recycling some of these IPs

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
to get the newer generation. I get that.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:34.000
Then it's like, other companies are jumping in on the bandwagon,

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:37.000
and I'm just like, well, I've already played these.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
I mean, you're bringing it back, you're adding a little bit extra.

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:42.000
I'm like, I'm not going to pick this up, you know?

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:46.000
See, I thought the FU was going to be because Mega Man was in that trailer,

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000
yet they still won't give us another fucking Mega Man game.

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
I could give two shits about that.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:57.000
My thing is, they trolled everybody on the Marvel license

03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:00.000
because everybody knew that they no longer had it,

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:05.000
and right about now, if you ask me, everything Capcom is doing now

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:08.000
is to make money back off of Street Fighter V, okay?

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Yeah, Street Fighter V is kind of Capcom's Final Fantasy XIV right now, a little bit.

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:18.000
But, yeah, do you think people are going to get jazzed about Akuma?

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:21.000
I will say, watching the match, we did watch the final match,

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:24.000
and I don't know a lot about Street Fighter V, but it was pretty exciting to watch.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:27.000
I wasn't even around, so I did not catch that.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:30.000
I would just pick up bits and pieces from people on Facebook

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
so I could figure out what the hell is going on.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:36.000
And to be perfectly honest, like I said, I'm getting a PS4.

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
I'm only getting it for one reason.

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.000
Final Fantasy VII, and that's it.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:46.000
I was like, alright Capcom, give me another reason to get a PS4.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:50.000
I want multiple reasons. Y'all ain't doing it for me.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
Alright Mama, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
but thanks for the call as always.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:59.000
No problem, and one more thing, I want to give you a couple of quick anime titles

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
to check out since you were talking anime earlier.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:04.000
You are the anime connoisseur here at VOG Network.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
Yeah, and Mako-chan's the hentai connoisseur.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:09.000
Yes, you and your pals, to be fair.

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:12.000
The other two don't call into this show, you do, so I'm picking on you.

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:16.000
Aruska Doji? Really, you had to mention Aruska Doji.

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
It was a joke, it was a joke, please.

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.000
Everybody from college knows that anime.

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:25.000
Everybody from college got high or drunk and watched that anime at some point.

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Not that I would advocate doing that, but I'm just saying a lot of people did it.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:31.000
I actually know of one of the people who did voices on that one, okay?

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:34.000
We'll just leave it at that.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
What would you recommend?

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:41.000
Okay, long-term series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:44.000
It's on its fourth season now, Diamond is Unbreakable.

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
It's really great, it's really cool.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.000
If you like fifth of the North Star style animation,

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:52.000
that's the first series and the second series.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:56.000
And as each series goes, the animation kind of goes up to date

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.000
for the time period it's supposed to be.

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:03.000
Seasons one and two take place in the 1800s to the 1920s,

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:06.000
so it's like older 80s style animation.

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:12.000
And then part three, Stardust Crusaders, has a 90s style to it.

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:15.000
And now the new series, no wait, older 80s style.

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:19.000
The new series, Diamond is Unbreakable, 90s style to it.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:22.000
It's pretty cool.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:28.000
It's a lot of posing and so forth when you get to seasons two, three, and four.

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:31.000
Alright, well those are some good recommendations.

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:34.000
If I have time, which I don't, I'll watch them at some point.

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:37.000
No, I really do need to make an effort to watch more,

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:40.000
but I haven't even seen the Guardians of the Galaxy movie, Rama.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
That's how weird I am.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:45.000
For a short series, Digimon Adventure Tree,

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
it's like three movies, that's really it.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:50.000
It's like the sequel to the first two Digimon seasons.

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:51.000
It's fantastic.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:52.000
I like short series.

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:55.000
That's how I was able to get convinced to watch Black Mirror.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
Somebody's like, dude, season one is three episodes.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:58.000
I'm like, sign me up.

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
At least season one's pretty good.

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
I haven't watched the other seasons yet, but I hear they're a trip.

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
So Stranger Things was eight episodes.

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
Easy peasy.

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
Did you ever watch Glee?

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:12.000
I watched half of the first season, and then I was like,

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:16.000
this show has fallen up its ass so hard, I can't stand to watch it anymore.

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
Go watch Love Live.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:21.000
It'll reprieve Glee. Trust me on this.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
Go watch Love Live.

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:24.000
We'll thank you for it later.

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:25.000
All right. Fair enough.

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up.

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:28.000
Cool. Take care, man.

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:29.000
All right. Bye-bye.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:30.000
All right.

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
Anime Jam Session, of course, live Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:36.000
if you want to hear more talk about anime.

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:39.000
S.G.O. 100 Matt said, I was going to call in just to say,

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:40.000
MAGFest is one month away.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:43.000
If people are listening via the podcast and plan on attending MAGFest,

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:48.000
keep an eye on the VOG forums for a rally call and possible meetup plans.

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:52.000
I am actually trying to work out to still get on a panel.

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:56.000
It won't be a VOG-related thing, but I can't say much more on that now

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
because I don't have anything confirmed yet.

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:01.000
But stay tuned is all I can say.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
But for now, I'm about to wrap up the show,

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
but I do want to check if there's any last-minute stories.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:06.000
Loki?

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:07.000
Yeah, there's one thing.

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:10.000
Apparently, P.T. has been data mined.

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
Oh, yeah, I heard about this.

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:13.000
And they found some...

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
Why did it take so long?

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
The encryption, maybe, or something.

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:23.000
But they found some monster models that were not in the game.

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:28.000
So this weird, like, I don't even know, it's missing a head, missing a leg, and an arm.

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:31.000
Yeah.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:34.000
The things that could have been, but they're not.

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:35.000
Sigh.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:36.000
All right.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
Well, I think that's going to do it for another episode of Orange is Ontario.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
It's 9.30 here on the West Coast,

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
so this show has run very long.

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
But granted, we had a little bit of a long break there,

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:48.000
and then we started at, like, 6.10, so we were a little late tonight.

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:49.000
But that's all right.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:52.000
We had a very fun show tonight, and that is large part thanks to JD.

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:57.000
Thank you for being here and filling us in on Pokémon and music games and all that.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Thank you for having me.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:59.000
Do you have anything to plug?

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
You don't do your own show.

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
No, I mean, I have Twitter.

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
You can follow me if you want.

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
I post really terrible puns.

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:10.000
I retweet a bunch of social justice stuff, and I game.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
So, you know, that's...

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:13.000
Awesome.

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:17.000
And you'll still be involved with GamerX when they do another one here?

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
As long as it's here.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:22.000
I mean, I can't promise anything if they do it in New York again.

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:23.000
Ah, gotcha.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:24.000
Sounded like that was a good time, though.

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:25.000
Extra win.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:26.000
He had a great time.

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:27.000
I heard it was really good from a lot of people.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:28.000
I just wasn't able to go.

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:29.000
That's all right.

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:30.000
All right.

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:31.000
Well, thank you.

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:32.000
We'll see you again soon, I'm sure.

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:35.000
Alan, I know you didn't get to sit in on a lot of the second half,

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:36.000
but thank you for being here tonight.

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
And filling in on the first part of the show.

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:39.000
No problem.

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:42.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight, or anything you want to plug?

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
Papa Murphy's Pizza.

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:47.000
Go buy some.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:48.000
It is pretty good.

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:49.000
It is good.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:50.000
It is good.

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:51.000
All right.

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:52.000
They didn't pay for that sponsorship.

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:55.000
As always, thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
Thank you so much for taking the time out of your week

03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:00.000
to either listen to us live or listen to us on the podcast feed.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:07.000
a five-star review on a nice site like iTunes or Google Podcast or TuneIn.

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:11.000
They all go a long way in helping to spread the word about the show.

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:12.000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.000
That's all we ask.

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice,

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
but we can't air those voices if they're not here.

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:20.000
And look, after that phone call with Shane tonight

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:23.000
about Final Fantasy XV is crap graphics or whatever it was he said,

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:27.000
clearly we are able to have dissenting opinions here at OLR.

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:30.000
Even when somebody is as blatantly wrong as he is,

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:34.000
we will still hear those voices here at Orange Lounge Radio.

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
So thank you again.

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:37.000
And yeah, e-mail us.

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
We're also on Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:44.000
And that's all I've got to say.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
I guess my final thought for tonight would be

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:50.000
I'm ready to do more side quests in Final Fantasy XV.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:53.000
I have now realized there is no penalty for staying up eight days straight

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
except for the nighttime creatures.

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
So I may have a new approach in Final Fantasy XV.

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:58.000
We'll see.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
Loki, any final thoughts from you?

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:03.000
I guess I'll have to play Final Fantasy XV.

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
I think you should.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:06.000
Report on that next week.

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:07.000
Okay.

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000
All right. We'll be back next week to do this all again.

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:13.000
DarkSakura makes her return to the show again

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:16.000
because she kind of did have a little fling there with Episode 666,

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:17.000
but she will be back full time.

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:20.000
I was texting with her a little bit during the show on another issue,

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:23.000
and she did want me to pass along the hellos.

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000
So hellos, and she will be back next week.

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
We will be back next week.

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:28.000
I hope you will be back next week.

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.000
In the meantime, happy gaming, whether it's Final Fantasy XV,

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
Pokemon, or whatever it is you're playing.

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:34.000
Have fun.

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
Treat each other with a little bit of respect, please,

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
and we'll see you next time.

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:39.000
Good night.

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:42.000
