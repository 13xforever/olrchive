00:00.000 --> 00:17.360
T'was the night of Christmas and all through the house, you tuned into VOG Network by clicking

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360
your mouse.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.920
There's news of Utada and Pokemon too, more C&D's delivered with the usual round of

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
boos.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.360
We have lots of news from This Week in Gaming, come celebrate your geekiness, no one here

00:26.360 --> 00:27.360
is shaming.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.800
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.400 --> 00:37.280
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.280 --> 00:45.640
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 671 for this December the 25th

00:45.640 --> 00:48.080
of 2016.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.440
Kind of a big day today and I think maybe in the...

00:50.440 --> 00:51.840
Yes, the second night of Hanukkah.

00:51.840 --> 00:56.240
Coming up on 15 year anniversary of our show.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.920
This is the first time I think we've ever done a show live on December 25th.

00:59.920 --> 01:05.880
So Merry Christmas, or I'm sorry, as we were saying before the show, Merry fucking Christmas,

01:05.880 --> 01:10.080
Happy Goddamn Hanukkah, and shit.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.560
And fuck 2016 in the ear.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.560
That's right.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.560
With something hard and sandpapery.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
That's right.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.600
My God.

01:17.600 --> 01:24.840
So horrible to hear about Carrie Fisher, although apparently she's in stable condition, and

01:24.840 --> 01:29.560
if any celebrity was going to say, not today, Satan, it was going to be Carrie Fisher.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.840
But then George Michael just gone today unexpectedly.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
And it's like...

01:33.840 --> 01:35.920
Is that what we had to sacrifice to keep our princess general?

01:35.920 --> 01:39.480
I don't want to think about that because well, and it's okay.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.480
Here's the thing, because there's...

01:40.480 --> 01:41.760
By the way, I'm Rob Roberts.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.760
She's Dark Sakura.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.760
Hi.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.760
If you didn't know that by now, I...

01:44.760 --> 01:45.760
Where...

01:45.760 --> 01:46.760
What rock have you been under?

01:46.760 --> 01:47.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.500
Tech master Loki not here tonight enjoying the holiday with his family, obviously.

01:50.500 --> 01:54.300
You guys there at VogueNetwork.com joining us live as you do every Sunday night, six

01:54.340 --> 01:59.780
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Dark Tetsuya

01:59.780 --> 02:05.660
in chat commending Jason there on the intro, which Jason, our voiceover guy should be commended.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.540
That was one of his best intros he's ever done.

02:07.540 --> 02:11.260
I mean, he does great work, but that was one of my very, very favorites.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.620
A great holiday present.

02:13.620 --> 02:14.620
Anyway, where were we?

02:14.620 --> 02:15.620
Oh, yes.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.620
Dead celebrities.

02:16.620 --> 02:20.020
So everybody on Twitter, you know, RIP George Michael, right?

02:20.020 --> 02:21.020
Because it sucks.

02:21.020 --> 02:22.020
He was only 53.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.020
That's nothing.

02:23.020 --> 02:24.020
That's nothing, right?

02:24.740 --> 02:25.740
Still young.

02:25.740 --> 02:26.740
So...

02:26.740 --> 02:27.740
This year, though.

02:27.740 --> 02:28.740
Yeah.

02:28.740 --> 02:29.740
This year has been ridiculous.

02:29.740 --> 02:30.740
Prince.

02:30.740 --> 02:31.740
Well, yeah.

02:31.740 --> 02:32.740
David Bowie.

02:32.740 --> 02:33.740
But here's the thing.

02:33.740 --> 02:38.840
So, of course, when people start eulogizing celebrities on Twitter, here comes the snark

02:38.840 --> 02:40.340
police here.

02:40.340 --> 02:41.940
And so here come the tweets.

02:41.940 --> 02:47.260
Well, I'm really happy to hear that when 2017 starts, all those celebrities are going to

02:47.260 --> 02:55.020
stop dying or, you know, something about like, you know, people die all the time.

02:55.020 --> 02:57.780
It doesn't matter that it's 2016 and all this stuff.

02:57.780 --> 03:03.980
And it's like, okay, first off, if you don't got nothing nice to say, don't say it at all.

03:03.980 --> 03:10.580
But for you snarky bitches, take a seat, take all the seats, shut your mouth and listen

03:10.580 --> 03:11.580
for a minute.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.060
Get the tree out of your ass first.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.340
This year, we've lost Prince.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.220
We've lost David Bowie.

03:18.220 --> 03:22.320
We've lost George Michael, among countless other celebrities.

03:22.320 --> 03:29.140
But I named those particular ones in particular because as far as like gender bend, queer

03:29.140 --> 03:33.900
rock goes, those are like some of the biggest names.

03:33.900 --> 03:37.200
I mean, you know, Freddie Mercury, but we lost him a long time ago.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.840
But out of what we, you know, what we had left in 2016, it really feels like mother

03:41.840 --> 03:43.820
nature just, you know, just like...

03:43.820 --> 03:50.700
Queer Lady Gaga, don't drive, don't go out in public, just stay in the safe little bubble.

03:50.700 --> 03:51.700
Tim Curry.

03:51.700 --> 03:52.700
Tim Curry.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.700
Oh my God.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.700
Do not leave your house.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.940
Do not or, you know, leave your house to get a sufficient amount of air, but stay in the

03:57.940 --> 03:59.140
plastic bubble.

03:59.140 --> 04:03.140
But anyway, the point why I bring all this up is that, you know, these are, it's the

04:03.140 --> 04:07.220
fact that we're losing all these iconic people back to back to back.

04:07.220 --> 04:11.740
And we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago on the show before I inadvertently

04:11.740 --> 04:16.960
condemned Zsa Zsa on the show was you were talking about, yes, somebody's going to have

04:16.960 --> 04:20.840
to die in 2017 because that's just the way life is.

04:20.840 --> 04:25.300
But who's 100 years old, Kirk Douglas?

04:25.300 --> 04:26.300
Okay.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.880
If Kirk Douglas passes away next year, I'm going to be sad.

04:29.880 --> 04:30.880
But it's like...

04:30.880 --> 04:31.880
But not surprised.

04:31.880 --> 04:32.880
But he was 100 years old.

04:32.880 --> 04:33.880
Right.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.880
It was time.

04:34.880 --> 04:35.880
Right.

04:35.880 --> 04:36.880
Same thing with Zsa Zsa.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.880
Yeah.

04:37.880 --> 04:38.880
That's all I ever said about Zsa Zsa.

04:38.880 --> 04:39.880
Pretty much dead already.

04:39.880 --> 04:40.880
It's just officially.

04:41.020 --> 04:42.020
He was in a coma.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.020
Yeah.

04:43.020 --> 04:44.020
Yeah, exactly.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.700
So, you know, and somebody, somebody on my Twitter feed, I made a post about the bubble

04:46.700 --> 04:49.860
and somebody on my Twitter feed said, put Carol Channing in that too.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.740
She's 96 years old.

04:51.740 --> 04:55.020
And yes, Carol Channing does belong in the bubble.

04:55.020 --> 05:02.220
However, if Carol Channing passes away, I'm going to be like, she was 96 years old.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.740
But she is a fan of Bob the drag queen.

05:03.740 --> 05:08.500
So you know, you can, you can apply this to a lot of the 90 year old celebrities, except

05:08.500 --> 05:09.680
Betty White.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.680
Don't you fucking touch Betty White.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.420
Betty White will cut a bitch.

05:12.420 --> 05:13.420
That's right.

05:13.420 --> 05:14.420
Anyway.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.420
Death's gonna come for her.

05:15.420 --> 05:16.420
She'll be like, ho!

05:16.420 --> 05:17.420
Yeah.

05:17.420 --> 05:22.300
Flaco Jones in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the older you get, the more famous people

05:22.300 --> 05:23.300
you know die.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.300
Ain't that the truth?

05:24.300 --> 05:27.980
I mean, when you were younger and you heard about famous people passing away, it was like,

05:27.980 --> 05:29.860
oh, it's old people anyway.

05:29.860 --> 05:33.200
But now, yeah, it's, it's kind of like a reminder of our own mortality.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.020
Not to get to a dark place here on Orange Lawns Radio, the show where every gamer has

05:37.020 --> 05:40.280
a voice, but it is our special holiday episode.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.900
It's our holiday episode.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.800
And if it's your first time listening to OLR, I would really encourage you to go listen

05:45.800 --> 05:48.720
to a different episode of OLR for your first OLR.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
Not that tonight's-

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
I don't have enough wine in me.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.720
Not that tonight's going to be bad.

05:52.720 --> 05:57.280
Tonight's just going to be fun because Dark Soccer and I, I mean, it, this is what happens

05:57.280 --> 06:02.960
on December 25th, Christmas, Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate, is that today you kind

06:02.960 --> 06:04.640
of just don't give a fuck.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640
And so-

06:05.640 --> 06:06.840
No fucks are given.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.840
Exactly.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.540
We are quite the chaste group tonight.

06:09.540 --> 06:10.540
That's right.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.540
That's right.

06:11.540 --> 06:12.540
So what is this?

06:12.540 --> 06:13.540
What is this?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.540
By the way, you brought us to start off with.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.540
Stroopwafel liqueur.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.220
Does that mean it tastes like waffles?

06:17.220 --> 06:18.220
Stroopwafel.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.220
What's the Stroopwafel taste like?

06:19.220 --> 06:20.820
It's those little flat waffle crackers.

06:20.820 --> 06:23.780
I'm actually, if you can hear that clicking, I'm actually opening this.

06:23.780 --> 06:26.420
This is that little like dollar store shot thing.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.260
Although I bet this wasn't a dollar, but it was a little more.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.060
It actually was a dollar.

06:31.060 --> 06:32.060
It was a dollar?

06:32.060 --> 06:33.060
Oh, well.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.060
L'Chaim.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.100
Ooh, it smells pretty good.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.100
Here we go.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.560
Winter holidays of your choice.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.560
Fuck.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.560
Okay.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
Hold on.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
Pardon the silence.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.560
I drank half of it.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.560
Oh my God.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.560
It does taste like waffle, kind of.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.560
Right?

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
I was not expecting that.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
Holy shit.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.560
This is good.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
I'm going to get a big fucking bottle of this.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.560
I'm not-

06:55.560 --> 06:56.560
Contains caramel color.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
This is good.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.560
I'm not going to eat anymore.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.560
I'm just going to drink.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
You only paid a dollar for this?

07:00.560 --> 07:01.560
For the little teeny ones.

07:01.560 --> 07:05.040
The big bottle is like 11 at Total Wine.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.040
That's a pretty good deal.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.040
Let's go get some.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.040
Wow.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.040
All right.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.040
Sorry, show's over.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.040
We're going to get more Stroopwafel.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.040
Anyway.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.380
VXJ6V in our chat says, Stroopwafels are so good.

07:16.380 --> 07:17.380
Yeah, this is-

07:17.380 --> 07:18.380
Ooh, this is great.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.380
This is amazing.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.380
But it's also fun to say, Stroopwafel.

07:21.380 --> 07:22.380
It is.

07:22.380 --> 07:23.380
It is.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.380
We are-

07:24.380 --> 07:25.380
Get to the Stroopwafel.

07:25.380 --> 07:29.100
We are going to give you a play by play of what we drink tonight.

07:29.100 --> 07:36.240
So this first beverage was, hold on, Van Mier's Stroopwafel Liqueur.

07:36.240 --> 07:42.080
Now we are also enjoying the Chenin Blanc of Charles Spinetta Vineyards.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.080
Yes.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.080
Winery.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.080
There's wine here as well.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.080
I'm not done with Stroopwafel, so.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.080
Well, I drink mine.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.080
All right.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.080
Also, I had two shots of rum before I came over.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.800
Does this girl know how to party or what?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.520
Well, it was rum from Panama.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.980
Well, you got to drink that.

07:55.980 --> 07:56.980
You got to drink that.

07:56.980 --> 07:57.980
Panama.

07:57.980 --> 08:00.080
Anyway, where was I?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.080
I'm going to be totally-

08:01.080 --> 08:02.080
Stroopwafel.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.080
I'm going to be totally scatterbrained tonight, you guys.

08:03.080 --> 08:10.360
Oh, so part of the reason we're here on Christmas, second day of Hanukkah, whatever it is, is

08:10.360 --> 08:13.960
the fact that we're actually not going to be live for a little bit.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.120
We're going to be dead.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.120
Stop.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.120
No, not today.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.120
Not today to make that joke.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.320
I started to say it and I figured I may as well finish it because-

08:21.320 --> 08:22.320
Today not the day to make that joke.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.320
No fucks are given.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.040
No, it is not.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.780
So here's the thing.

08:26.780 --> 08:30.840
We're going to be gone for the next two weeks live because next week is New Year's and a

08:30.840 --> 08:34.520
lot of people are going to be recovering, out of town, all that sort of thing.

08:34.520 --> 08:39.360
I'm going to be gone at MAGFest in two weeks, which I'm not really prepared for how early

08:39.360 --> 08:42.780
MAGFest is this year, although everybody tells me, well, this is the normal time that they

08:42.780 --> 08:43.780
do it.

08:43.780 --> 08:46.000
And I'm kind of like, you know, I kind of liked that February day.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.240
It worked out a lot better, but all right, this is the way they party in DC.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.560
But I'm going to be MAGFest on January 8th, so we'll be off that week.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.360
So we're not going to be back live until January 15th.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.360
You have to see Tiara while you're there.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.360
Hmm?

08:56.940 --> 08:57.940
You have to see Tiara while you're there.

08:57.940 --> 08:58.940
Is she going to be in MAGFest?

08:58.940 --> 09:02.400
No, but she lives in Arlington.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.980
The thing is, I'm going to be kind of on an island in National Harbor.

09:04.980 --> 09:06.140
It's really separated over there.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.460
She want to come do dinner some night or something.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.460
I'd totally love to see her.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.460
You should tell her that.

09:09.460 --> 09:10.460
Yeah.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.460
I'll have to hit her up on Facebook or something.

09:12.460 --> 09:16.540
Anyway, Tiara hasn't been on the show in like 10 years.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.540
Yeah.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.140
Hands up and chat if you remember Tiara.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.200
No, but she was fabulous.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.320
She ran the Geek Dash life, right?

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
When that was still going.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.320
Yeah.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.540
She did the Monday Comic Insanity with her.

09:26.540 --> 09:27.540
That other podcast she did.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.540
Monday Comic Insanity.

09:28.540 --> 09:29.540
Is that what it was?

09:29.540 --> 09:30.540
Monday Comic Insanity.

09:30.540 --> 09:31.540
That was a while ago.

09:31.540 --> 09:32.540
Yeah.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.540
That was a while back.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.540
That was a while back.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.540
Anyway.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.540
And I'm planning to start that again.

09:36.540 --> 09:37.540
Wink, wink.

09:37.540 --> 09:38.540
Spike.

09:38.540 --> 09:39.540
Nudge, nudge.

09:39.540 --> 09:40.540
No subtlety here.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.540
We've been talking about it.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.540
All right.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.140
And Spike only does this to...

09:46.140 --> 09:47.140
What's the word?

09:47.140 --> 09:52.760
Spike only does this to spite me because I'm the biggest podcaster, but no, Spike always

09:52.760 --> 09:55.340
has to one up me with all the podcasts he has.

09:55.340 --> 09:58.140
So you know, but Spike's amazing.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.340
So I can't even joke about hating because I just can't.

10:01.340 --> 10:04.340
I have one and I need more.

10:04.340 --> 10:05.340
Don't we all?

10:05.340 --> 10:06.340
Don't we all need more podcasts?

10:06.340 --> 10:07.340
All right.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.340
Good.

10:08.340 --> 10:12.660
SSU 100 Matt is saying, so far the weather is showing it will be in the 50s that weekend.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.020
That's warmer than it is here.

10:14.020 --> 10:15.200
I'll take it.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.980
It's 42 right now.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.300
So the 50s?

10:18.300 --> 10:19.300
Warmer than that.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.300
Love it.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.300
All right.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.300
Anyway.

10:22.840 --> 10:23.840
I'm ready because I've had rum and Stroopwafel.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.840
I know right?

10:24.840 --> 10:28.160
Like I'm already feeling this Stroopwafel.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.160
You're buzzy.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.160
Buzzy beetle with a penguin hat.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.600
This is going to be one of those shows tonight.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.120
I got Rob a penguin hat everybody.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.680
And if you're on Facebook, you can look at it.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.680
So did you put it on Facebook?

10:39.680 --> 10:40.680
I did.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.680
When did you take a picture of me with a hat on?

10:41.680 --> 10:45.680
Like you were talking to Bobby and you're like, Rob's like, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,

10:45.680 --> 10:46.680
bah, bah, bah, bah.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.680
Wait a minute.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.680
That's one nice CD.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.680
She's, she's, she ninja'd a picture of me and didn't tell anybody.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.680
It's a good picture.

10:52.540 --> 10:53.540
It's just kind of.

10:53.540 --> 10:56.540
Was I holding booze in my hand because my mother's on Facebook now.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.540
No, it was before you poured our wine.

10:58.540 --> 10:59.540
All right, good.

10:59.540 --> 11:00.540
All right.

11:00.540 --> 11:01.540
So, uh, let's see.

11:01.540 --> 11:02.540
Where was I?

11:02.540 --> 11:03.540
Oh yes.

11:03.540 --> 11:06.220
No show over the next two weeks because this show will have killed the show effectively

11:06.220 --> 11:07.220
for a few weeks.

11:07.220 --> 11:08.220
No, but we'll be out.

11:08.220 --> 11:12.540
We are looking though, however, we'll try to do like a pre tape thing, but I don't want

11:12.540 --> 11:13.540
to promise anything.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.540
That's all with it.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.540
Tape before you tape.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.540
I don't want to over promise.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.700
I hear you like tape, so I'm going to tape before you tape.

11:19.720 --> 11:24.560
So don't expect us to be back until the 15th, but you may get pleasantly surprised.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.560
Sounds good?

11:25.560 --> 11:29.220
Nobody expects the OLR Inquisition.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.220
But it was weird.

11:30.220 --> 11:37.520
It's weird to be thinking that by the time we're back, the switch will be, I can't say

11:37.520 --> 11:38.680
the switch will be out.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
That's not true.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.920
But the switch information, all these mysteries, all the, did Zelda get pushed back or not?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.880
Is the switch coming out of March or not?

11:46.880 --> 11:50.500
All these questions are going to be answered by the time we're back on OLR and new ones

11:50.500 --> 11:55.100
will be posed.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.740
Why does it look like that?

11:56.740 --> 12:01.700
You for a moment, I thought you said posed because your hand was out like you were posing

12:01.700 --> 12:04.880
and I was like, Ooh, Rob, here's a quick, there's a question to pose.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.700
Why isn't OLR on video yet?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.900
Because reasons.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.060
Because dark Sakura doesn't want y'all to see her pretty face.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.320
No, you know what I was thinking though, you know, I was thinking though, um, there's that

12:15.320 --> 12:18.540
software that, um, I think Tiger Claw or somebody showed it to me.

12:18.540 --> 12:19.940
I don't mind my face.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.260
Well, and you have a, you, you're a very pretty lady.

12:22.260 --> 12:28.340
You should, you should, uh, embrace it for, but I was thinking, well, there's those programs

12:28.340 --> 12:32.720
that will like turn you into a furry on your stream so you can actually sit there.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.940
You could be a penguin or something that talks during the show.

12:35.940 --> 12:36.940
We could do that.

12:36.940 --> 12:37.940
I have a kigurumi now.

12:37.940 --> 12:43.620
Do you, so wear that to the show and just have a different, I have a Pikachu kigurumi.

12:43.620 --> 12:44.620
That could be your thing.

12:44.620 --> 12:46.520
I have a different kigurumi every week to the show.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.640
I can't afford that many.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.280
Ask the listeners nicely to donate.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.000
If we move over to Twitch, we can start collecting bits.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.480
I want a red panda kigurumi and I wear the regular size from kigurumi-shop.com.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.960
Tiger Claw says face rig.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.120
Yeah, I think that's the name of it.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.360
I think it is.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.080
So I think that was the name of the software.

13:09.080 --> 13:16.220
So anyway, the video question I will be tackling in 2017, I would expect something's going

13:16.220 --> 13:21.220
to change with that because I'm realizing more and more each day, there's a huge untapped

13:21.220 --> 13:25.340
audience out there on those streaming sites that we really need to get our faces in front

13:25.340 --> 13:26.340
of.

13:26.340 --> 13:27.340
Can we tap them?

13:27.340 --> 13:28.340
So what's that?

13:28.340 --> 13:29.340
Can we tap them?

13:29.340 --> 13:30.340
Can we tap them?

13:30.340 --> 13:31.340
Tap the faces?

13:31.340 --> 13:32.340
Tap all the faces.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.620
So we're going to figure out what to do about that in the coming, coming year.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.620
Anyway.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.060
I need to stop eating these things because they're amazing.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.060
These truffle things?

13:39.060 --> 13:40.060
Uh-huh.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.060
These are really good.

13:41.060 --> 13:48.240
This is the quintessential Christmas thing that shows up because let's say your aunt,

13:48.240 --> 13:52.180
your aunt didn't want to buy you a big gift, but she had to get you something.

13:52.180 --> 13:54.160
So she gets you these truffles.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.160
That's what this gift is.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.160
They're the Ferrero Rocher, isn't it?

13:57.160 --> 13:58.160
Don't talk with your mouth full.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
That's rude.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.160
Fuck.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.160
All right.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.160
I can do what I want.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.160
I'm a liberated woman.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.560
Uh, let's talk.

14:04.560 --> 14:08.320
Let's try to get into video games a little bit tonight.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.320
Let's talk a little.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.340
It is, by the way, we do have a, we're going to just run through the show and I have a

14:12.340 --> 14:13.340
break tonight.

14:13.340 --> 14:17.400
We're going to run through the show straight and we'll find, we're going to run through

14:17.400 --> 14:23.260
the show Gailey and then, uh, then we're going to start this off with some gay.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.340
Well, we're not getting into news yet.

14:25.340 --> 14:26.340
I am.

14:26.340 --> 14:27.340
Okay.

14:27.340 --> 14:30.340
I don't care tonight.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.160
Our soccer does what she wants.

14:32.160 --> 14:36.580
She looks the show, roll heads and sees that there's a kickoff topic and how is your gaming

14:36.580 --> 14:37.580
week?

14:37.580 --> 14:38.580
I don't know.

14:38.580 --> 14:42.280
I don't want to, I want to talk about, I want to talk about lesbians are fine.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.280
Fine.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.280
You know what?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
I don't care.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
Jamie do what you want.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
Talk up.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.280
Fine.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.280
Start with this.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.280
I've decided to do the kickoff topic.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.880
Then what's tonight's kickoff topic?

14:51.880 --> 14:53.720
Um, I have no idea.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.840
Holiday gaming.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.000
Did you get any presents?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
I did.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.480
You better say yes cause I bought you some.

15:01.480 --> 15:06.280
My, my, my bestest friend in the whole wide world, dark Sakura bought me final fantasy

15:06.280 --> 15:11.160
games on steam because she saw them on my wishlist by old games and so she bought me

15:11.160 --> 15:15.780
the final fantasy 10 and 10 to remaster, which by the way, do you know why that's on my steam

15:15.780 --> 15:16.780
wishlist?

15:16.780 --> 15:17.780
Why?

15:17.780 --> 15:19.820
Because it's the whole mass effect three thing.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.040
What can I do for you?

15:21.040 --> 15:27.520
So now I own the 10 and 10 to remaster on PlayStation three, PlayStation four and thanks

15:27.520 --> 15:31.120
to friend, buddy, pal, Sakura, I own it on PC as well.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.640
So I own the final fantasy and I have it on PlayStation two.

15:34.640 --> 15:38.920
So I think I own final fantasy 10 on as many systems as I own mass effect three.

15:38.920 --> 15:39.920
Yay.

15:39.920 --> 15:40.920
Yay.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.920
I got, I got Alan thingies.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.560
What'd you get Alan?

15:45.560 --> 15:48.040
The tales of symphonia and tales of zestria and undertale.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.120
Oh, he'll like, Oh, you finally got him undertale.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
Good.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
Maybe he'll finally play that.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
Undertale.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.120
Oh, you got Loki undertale.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.320
You bought, I got him some other game, but I need to find something else because I didn't

15:57.320 --> 15:58.320
spend enough money.

15:58.320 --> 16:02.040
You're buying, you're buying everybody, uh, undertale already have it.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.980
I bought, I bought your undertale.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.980
You did.

16:04.980 --> 16:05.980
Fuck.

16:05.980 --> 16:08.660
I'm a dealer and I haven't even finished it yet.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.640
And then I bought you games and I bet you haven't touched him yet.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.900
Do you remember what I bought you?

16:12.900 --> 16:13.900
Disgaea.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.060
I did buy you Disgaea PC.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.480
Orrery in the blind forest.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.480
That's right.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.000
And I bought it on your list too, isn't it?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.820
It is, but I own it on Xbox one.

16:20.820 --> 16:21.820
Okay.

16:21.820 --> 16:23.240
So it's another one of those things where it's like, well, I just kind of wanted it

16:23.240 --> 16:24.240
on PC as well.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.240
Finish Duncan Rompa too.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.820
You, but at some point you really need to play or in the blind forest because or in

16:28.820 --> 16:32.620
the blind forest is like super Metroid, but like cute and sad.

16:32.620 --> 16:33.780
All right, I'll start it.

16:33.780 --> 16:38.460
I wanted to play Disgaea and I'm glad it was on PC finally, but if Ultra Despair Girls

16:38.460 --> 16:41.580
comes out on PC soon, then I'm going to be all over that.

16:41.580 --> 16:45.100
Cause I've been playing on a Vita TV.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.180
I love Duncan Rompa.

16:46.180 --> 16:52.500
I almost bought a Monokuma, uh, uh, Kigurumi, except I don't wear white things cause I can

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
help it.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Okay.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
Okay.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
That begs a whole nother question.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
Question number one.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
What is with the Kigurumi thing lately?

16:58.500 --> 16:59.500
Like this came out of nowhere.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.500
It's warm.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.500
And comfortable.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
And uncomfortable.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.220
Okay.

17:04.220 --> 17:07.020
What is the difference between a Kigurumi and a Snuggie?

17:07.020 --> 17:08.020
Cartoon characters.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.020
That's it.

17:09.020 --> 17:13.620
Because when I was, when I was doing a Snuggie thing on OLR, I got teased relentlessly.

17:13.620 --> 17:14.620
There's kind of pants.

17:14.620 --> 17:19.380
No, there's no pants on a Snuggie unless you put your legs through the arm holes and then

17:19.380 --> 17:26.420
find another Snuggie and then you're like, then you look like the biggest shit ever.

17:26.420 --> 17:31.140
You look like a blind quilters creation.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.140
That is not the same thing.

17:32.780 --> 17:37.180
Kigurumi, first of all, Snuggies are also made out of the worst material ever to exist.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.740
They're not, they don't stay cozy.

17:38.740 --> 17:43.420
They're soft for like a day and then you wash it and then suddenly it's cardboard.

17:43.420 --> 17:47.340
They are made out of that material that like grandma bought at Walmart in the crafting

17:47.340 --> 17:48.340
section.

17:48.340 --> 17:54.080
Kigurumi are nice and soft and fluffy and fleecy and it feels like you're, it does feel

17:54.080 --> 17:57.300
like you're wearing a whole blanket if you get a good one.

17:57.300 --> 18:01.400
You know, I have my Pikachu kigurumi, well it's Alan's Pikachu kigurumi, but what's his

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
is mine.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.400
Right?

18:03.400 --> 18:04.400
So I can steal it.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.400
Should I wear that to magfest?

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
Yes.

18:06.400 --> 18:10.080
Not just yes, but yes, yes, queen.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.880
All right.

18:11.880 --> 18:12.880
Let's see.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.600
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.280
Act Def says the booze got to Jamie hard.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.280
Just Jamie?

18:18.280 --> 18:19.280
No.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.280
I haven't even finished the Stroopwafel and I'm already feeling it.

18:21.280 --> 18:27.880
I am only vaguely buzzy right now, but it makes me more talky and, and yes, that's what

18:27.880 --> 18:29.320
kigurumi means.

18:29.320 --> 18:34.600
Like I said, if this is your first OLR, the other episodes of OLR are not quite this unorganized

18:34.600 --> 18:37.360
or random, but it's the holidays.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.080
So fuck it.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.080
Kombai.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.760
Uh, let's see.

18:42.760 --> 18:47.220
Rageinator in chat says dark Sakura, wouldn't the worst material be a blend of sandpaper

18:47.220 --> 18:51.600
and poison ivy and corn and corn.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.600
Corn is awful.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.600
Corn is terrible.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.960
And corn gives me hives.

18:54.960 --> 19:00.760
No, you know what would be, what would be worse if it was like, if it had a, um, uh,

19:00.760 --> 19:07.760
a habanero glaze on it, that would make it the worst.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.760
The worst.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.180
Now I like mayonnaise, Rob.

19:10.180 --> 19:14.880
And I will say that if you've accidentally burned yourself, mayonnaise is oddly comfortable.

19:14.880 --> 19:15.880
Okay.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.160
Why are we talking about wearing mayonnaise?

19:19.160 --> 19:20.680
This doesn't make any sense.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.600
You dismissed the greatest of all condiments, sir.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.520
Uh, you can stop right there.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.640
First off, ketchup, far more versatile of a condiment than mayonnaise.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.240
Ketchup is nasty as fuck.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.280
Yeah, but you can put it on hash browns.

19:32.280 --> 19:37.120
The only thing ketchup is good for is meatloaf when you bake it into the meatloaf.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.600
And I prefer to use tomato paste.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.500
I don't even like ketchup that much.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
You know what I like?

19:41.500 --> 19:42.600
And some people hate this.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.600
So trigger warning.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
You ready?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.600
You know what I love?

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
Mustard.

19:46.600 --> 19:52.360
I could do French fries and mustard, but the best thing ever is the soft, soft baked pretzel.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.280
You are doing your hand like you're squeezing someone's nuts.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.480
No, it's a pretzel.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.740
It's a pretzel you fucking pervert.

20:00.740 --> 20:02.760
It's a pretzel that you dip in mustard.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.560
You invited me into your home, sir.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.560
I know.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
And sometimes I ask myself why.

20:06.560 --> 20:11.200
I am now two shots of rum, a bottle of Stroopwafel and a glass of wine in.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.920
And I've had half the Stroopwafel, which this is so good.

20:15.920 --> 20:16.920
Right.

20:16.920 --> 20:17.920
I got to find more.

20:17.920 --> 20:18.920
I'm going to have more wine.

20:18.920 --> 20:19.920
Where does this come from?

20:19.920 --> 20:20.920
Do my story for me.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.920
Bye.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.880
It's got a freaking Dutch name on it.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.880
Product of Holland.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.040
Oh, this is the product of my people.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.680
I married a Dutch guy.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.080
I am a Dutch guy.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.080
I'm Dutch by marriage.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.000
I need to call Cyl and see if she's got Stroopwafel.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.240
I had a dream about Cyl.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.240
Oh my God.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.240
Okay.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.240
Okay.

20:39.240 --> 20:43.560
Cyl from the Geek Card, formerly Girls Gone Wow.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.040
What's her other show she has now?

20:45.040 --> 20:46.040
Battle Chat show.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.040
Okay.

20:47.160 --> 20:52.680
I had a dream that I was working somewhere and my current boss was my boss there, but

20:52.680 --> 20:56.800
it was like a different place with like our computers laid out on like folding tables.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.600
Excuse me.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.000
And Cyl was my desk mate.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.640
And we looked at each other and it's like, let's go, let's just go.

21:05.640 --> 21:12.320
So we got up and called in sick from our desks and we went out in my little roller skate

21:12.320 --> 21:18.160
Fiat and also the town kind of looks like Mobile, but a really weird version of it.

21:18.160 --> 21:23.480
Like if Mobile had turned into Silent Hill-ish and we found an Indian buffet, like a hole

21:23.480 --> 21:29.760
in the wall Indian buffet and we got, we got our fucking curry on and then the next thing

21:29.760 --> 21:32.920
I know I hear, hello, which is the sound.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.600
It's Vanellope saying hello from your iPhone, my iPhone.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.760
It was my sister saying, uh, you want to talk to dad?

21:40.760 --> 21:41.880
I guess.

21:41.880 --> 21:46.160
And then I woke up all the way cause, but that, that, that dream could have happened

21:46.160 --> 21:50.760
like, and I've never even, I've never even met Cyl, but this just sounds like something

21:50.760 --> 21:54.080
that would happen if Cyl and Jamie got together like, Hey, we're podcasting.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.080
You know what?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.080
Fuck this.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.080
Let's go get some curry.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.080
It could happen tonight.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.080
Fucking curry.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.080
Yeah.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.080
All right.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.080
Anyway, look, before you leave, uh, I want to ask some questions here at the top of the

22:02.080 --> 22:03.080
show.

22:03.080 --> 22:08.960
So holiday gaming, great memories about holiday gaming presence.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.720
And I opened this up to chat as well.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.480
So I know I've told this story on the show previously, but I'm gonna tell it again cause

22:13.480 --> 22:14.840
I'm a little do it.

22:14.840 --> 22:15.840
Okay.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.320
So when I got the super Nintendo, right?

22:18.320 --> 22:22.000
I got a super Nintendo for Christmas when I was 12, I think.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.680
So, um, it's the one thing I really wanted more than anything.

22:25.680 --> 22:29.420
And I opened all the presence under the tree and it wasn't there.

22:29.420 --> 22:33.220
And so I got sad, but it's like, what is, it's one of those things where it's like,

22:33.220 --> 22:36.800
you want to be grateful for the stuff you did get, but you're still kind of, you're

22:36.800 --> 22:40.680
still that like stupid spoiled horse, sad, you know, like, but I wanted it.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.800
It's so bad, you know, type of thing.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.960
So I'm, I'm trying to walk that fine line of not showing that I'm sad because I don't

22:46.960 --> 22:50.080
want to be that ungrateful asshole, but I actually deep down inside, I'm sad because

22:50.080 --> 22:57.040
I'm a nerd and I wanted the super Nintendo, but then miraculously a Christmas miracle.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.400
My sister shows up who's 16 years older than I am.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.400
My sister shows up.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.400
She's really cool.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
Have you met my sister?

23:02.400 --> 23:03.400
Yes.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
She's hilarious.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
Your sister looks like Lori Petty in the tank girl era.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
Yes, she kind of does.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.940
Uh, anyway, so not, not the orange is the new black era.

23:09.940 --> 23:11.180
Very important distinction.

23:11.180 --> 23:16.460
Um, so, um, my sister shows up and she has just a tiny little envelope and she gives

23:16.460 --> 23:21.020
it to me and the envelope says, go check in the closet and you go check in that.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.220
There's another envelope in the closet.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.260
Go check in the backyard.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.420
So it's one of those fucking wild goose chase things that ends under the bed.

23:26.420 --> 23:27.660
There's my super Nintendo.

23:27.660 --> 23:28.660
Yay.

23:28.660 --> 23:29.660
Christmas is saved.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.940
So I get the super Nintendo and a super Mario world comes with it, right?

23:32.940 --> 23:39.660
And my parents got Dracken on the super Nintendo, which I was like, the fuck is this?

23:39.700 --> 23:40.700
I mean, you know, I'm still happy.

23:40.700 --> 23:41.700
I got some new.

23:41.700 --> 23:42.700
So I don't, I don't give a fuck.

23:42.700 --> 23:43.700
I'm just like happy.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.700
And I'm like, oh cool.

23:44.700 --> 23:45.700
Another game.

23:45.700 --> 23:46.700
I've never heard of this game, but whatever.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.900
Super Nintendo, you know, I'm really excited.

23:48.900 --> 23:53.920
But apparently the guy at Montgomery ward told my parents that it was like the game

23:53.920 --> 23:55.180
everybody was buying.

23:55.180 --> 23:58.660
Although I think he lied because I don't know anybody else that owned Dracken.

23:58.660 --> 24:03.900
But any, but anyway, uh, I did, I didn't appreciate Dracken at first, but like it was one of those

24:03.900 --> 24:08.100
games like a year later, I kind of went back and I said, why did I never play this game?

24:08.100 --> 24:09.260
And I went back and I played Dracken.

24:09.260 --> 24:11.180
It actually is really cool.

24:11.180 --> 24:17.340
Um, it was like one of the, it was the, the overworld was in that nineties virtual reality

24:17.340 --> 24:18.340
style.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.380
Did you ever play Dracken?

24:20.380 --> 24:24.220
It's kind of, I know of it, but the battles were all automated.

24:24.220 --> 24:27.780
And that was the weird thing about it is that when you would run into a monster, your little

24:27.780 --> 24:30.820
army of people would just, and they just start fighting on screen.

24:30.820 --> 24:33.040
It was kind of like, you couldn't really control them very well.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.300
So that was the weird part of it is it was very like not final fantasy, which is what

24:36.300 --> 24:39.020
I was used to, but I came to appreciate that game a lot later.

24:39.020 --> 24:45.140
And you know, it was really awesome was dragon's view, which was Dracken 2.

24:45.140 --> 24:49.660
And what they did is they took out the auto battling and they put in more like Actraiser

24:49.660 --> 24:51.700
style side scrolling things into it.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.820
And that is like a really underrated gem on Super Nintendo.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.640
Kind of like wonders from East.

24:56.640 --> 24:57.640
I think so.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.980
I haven't played wonders from East in years, but wonders from East was more, wasn't that

24:59.980 --> 25:03.980
the more of the top down Zelda style top down, but when you went into caves or dungeons and

25:03.980 --> 25:06.100
things, that's right.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.100
That is right.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.780
That is right.

25:08.780 --> 25:10.340
So yeah.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.000
Classic RPGs that I came to love.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.580
So that was, that was a holiday gaming memory that I have.

25:14.580 --> 25:18.140
I know I told this story just like a month ago on the show, but there was the time that

25:18.140 --> 25:22.820
I got $200 for Christmas and I went and bought a PlayStation when my mom was pissed because

25:22.820 --> 25:25.460
that's like the thing she didn't want me to have, but it's like, you give me money.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.460
What'd you think was going to happen?

25:26.460 --> 25:27.460
Yeah.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.460
So anyway, uh, what about you?

25:29.460 --> 25:31.260
And then I'll open it up to chatters over at live.

25:31.260 --> 25:36.500
I got my Nintendo as a kid, my NES, and then my mom would like play it more the fuck than

25:36.500 --> 25:37.500
me.

25:37.500 --> 25:41.300
And every time she tried to put me on a restriction and hide it, I'd go get it and say, you didn't

25:41.300 --> 25:42.300
buy this for me.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.300
Daddy bought this for me.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.300
So I own it.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.340
I was that kid, but you're that adult.

25:47.340 --> 25:48.340
Fuck.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.340
Yeah.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.340
I grew up that way.

25:50.340 --> 25:56.300
Um, but the fun thing is that my mom pulls me aside and was like, okay, so I'm going

25:56.300 --> 25:57.780
to get your brothers a gaming system.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.060
You have to tell me which one to get them.

25:59.060 --> 26:01.540
Do I get him a Genesis or super Nintendo?

26:01.540 --> 26:03.700
And I was like, get him a super Nintendo.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.420
Why better graphics?

26:05.420 --> 26:09.900
He's got a better sound processor and dark soccer gets out like this, the whole table

26:09.900 --> 26:16.500
that shows the pros and the cons is now you see here where Ninten does what Genesis don't,

26:16.500 --> 26:21.300
I got that backwards, but you know, she, she has her whole charts and grass.

26:21.300 --> 26:26.340
Plus you have to get them the legend of Zelda, a link to the past, cause that's the game

26:26.340 --> 26:27.340
you want.

26:27.340 --> 26:28.340
That is the asset.

26:28.340 --> 26:29.500
That is the best game.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.420
I've seen so many good reviews about it and you've played the first legend of Zelda with

26:33.420 --> 26:34.420
me, right?

26:34.420 --> 26:35.540
That's how good it was.

26:35.540 --> 26:37.540
This was supposed to be going back to that.

26:37.540 --> 26:39.980
Oh, that's a good idea.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.200
So my mom buys it.

26:41.200 --> 26:46.420
My brother's like, and then she got them home alone, which was awful.

26:46.420 --> 26:47.420
Super Nintendo.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.660
There's a home alone game on super Nintendo or several.

26:49.660 --> 26:50.660
I remember one on NES.

26:50.660 --> 26:55.020
I don't remember it on super Nintendo and then, and then, and then she got a super scope

26:55.020 --> 26:56.020
six.

26:56.020 --> 26:57.020
Yes.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.300
And of course the game that came with it, I played a lot of blasters now.

26:59.300 --> 27:00.300
Here's the kicker.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.740
My brothers didn't have a TV in their room.

27:02.740 --> 27:04.740
You know who had the TV in her room?

27:04.740 --> 27:05.740
Me.

27:05.740 --> 27:06.740
How did that work?

27:06.740 --> 27:07.740
How did you get that?

27:07.740 --> 27:09.740
My dad bought me a TV.

27:09.740 --> 27:13.140
Well, he kept trying to bribe me for my love.

27:13.140 --> 27:18.540
Somebody spoiled raw and no, he just was guilty and would buy me stuff to cover his guilt.

27:18.540 --> 27:19.540
All right.

27:19.540 --> 27:20.540
All right.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.540
We're not going to go to a dark place.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.180
It is fucking Christmas.

27:23.180 --> 27:25.560
I can say it cause he admitted it when I was an adult.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.560
So whatever.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.560
All right.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.560
And plus I was actually smart.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.860
So anyway, I was like, okay, keep bribing me.

27:30.860 --> 27:31.860
I don't care.

27:31.980 --> 27:32.980
I'm not a statistic.

27:32.980 --> 27:37.940
So anyway, so we hooked it up in my room and of course my brothers would be like, can we

27:37.940 --> 27:38.940
play?

27:38.940 --> 27:39.940
No.

27:39.940 --> 27:40.940
I am almost unbeaten.

27:40.940 --> 27:45.860
And I would scream at whatever, what was that thing that was the big round lizard that kept

27:45.860 --> 27:51.860
knocking you off the platform and you had to keep either hitting it in the head and

27:51.860 --> 27:52.860
it would turn purple.

27:52.860 --> 27:55.700
The thing that was like a series of circles, like a centipede, I forgot what it's called,

27:55.700 --> 27:59.380
but it was like one of the early levels and it was the only boss in there that was actually

27:59.380 --> 28:05.900
hard and I would just yell at it and my brothers would say, they're going, Oh my God, can we

28:05.900 --> 28:07.860
watch some more?

28:07.860 --> 28:10.540
And then they'd go off to their dads and I was left with the super Nintendo.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.940
So I was like, Oh, it's fine.

28:12.940 --> 28:16.140
And then when they moved, they took it with them.

28:16.140 --> 28:23.780
So but by then, then your strategy backfired, but by then I went to the pawn store and I

28:23.780 --> 28:27.420
bought myself one for 30 fucking bucks.

28:27.420 --> 28:33.980
And dated a guy who gave me super street fighter two and Kirby's avalanche.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.180
You want to prove you love me?

28:36.180 --> 28:37.180
Street fighting.

28:37.180 --> 28:38.180
Seriously.

28:38.180 --> 28:39.180
I was the only way to do it.

28:39.180 --> 28:42.580
There was one night that when my brothers were visiting and we stayed up all night trying

28:42.580 --> 28:48.040
to see if the 250 fight thing was immortal combat two and it wasn't.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.660
And you're still scarred to this day.

28:49.660 --> 28:50.660
No pong, no pong.

28:50.660 --> 28:51.660
Okay.

28:51.660 --> 28:52.660
I'm gonna have more wine.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.660
You still have half the glass.

28:53.660 --> 28:55.020
I'm getting more wine.

28:55.020 --> 28:57.640
Because I've only drink in the Stroopwafel, but I finally finished it.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.360
But I want to go to the chatters and here's some of your stories.

29:00.360 --> 29:04.640
So vidpower in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says my most memorable gaming present was

29:04.640 --> 29:09.740
me and my brother getting our super Nintendo and playing super Mario world all night long.

29:09.740 --> 29:13.500
Fifth Dream in chat says my favorite Christmas was dreaming about getting donkey Kong and

29:13.500 --> 29:19.860
Ms. Pac-Man on 2,600 on Christmas Eve and waking up and they were under the tree.

29:19.860 --> 29:20.860
Let's see.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.020
Dark Tetsuya says there was the year I got Chrono Trigger.

29:23.020 --> 29:26.900
They hid it in a bigger box so I didn't suspect what it was.

29:26.900 --> 29:30.940
Stoppy says getting an NES is my earliest Christmas gift memory.

29:30.940 --> 29:33.460
Ragenator says I bought the Super Nintendo on my own.

29:33.460 --> 29:38.500
The NES, the one that came with Rob the Robot was the only system that my parents got for

29:38.500 --> 29:43.300
me, which I got 29 years ago today.

29:43.300 --> 29:48.820
Dungeon Buster saying Draken was an interesting RPG and the Montgomery Ward guy was definitely

29:48.820 --> 29:49.820
exaggerating.

29:49.820 --> 29:50.820
Well, that's why they wouldn't.

29:50.820 --> 29:51.820
Holy shit.

29:51.820 --> 29:52.820
I remembered something else.

29:52.820 --> 29:53.820
What?

29:53.820 --> 29:59.500
When Dan owned a video game store, I forgot he owned a video game store at some point.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.500
Yeah, Game On.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.820
I created the name for that, you know.

30:01.820 --> 30:02.820
Did you really?

30:02.820 --> 30:03.820
I did.

30:03.820 --> 30:04.820
I didn't know that.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.740
So anyway, he gives me this huge box and I'm like, the fuck is this?

30:07.740 --> 30:09.740
And I'm like, I thought it was a vacuum cleaner.

30:09.740 --> 30:10.740
It was that big.

30:10.740 --> 30:14.100
So open it up and open, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, and you know what was inside?

30:14.100 --> 30:16.980
Popful mail for the Sega CD.

30:16.980 --> 30:17.980
Nice.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.340
So it was a gigantic box with a tiny CD in it.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.340
Yeah.

30:21.340 --> 30:22.340
Perfect.

30:22.860 --> 30:23.860
Good on you marrying him.

30:23.860 --> 30:24.860
I married well.

30:24.860 --> 30:25.860
Let's see.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.860
Why?

30:26.860 --> 30:29.620
I'm going to chat as well.

30:29.620 --> 30:35.980
Tars ZXF is in chat saying, I remember hours of Uncle Fester's quest on Rob's NES.

30:35.980 --> 30:39.260
Yes, that was the Christmas I ruined because...

30:39.260 --> 30:41.820
Okay, talk about the ruined Christmas.

30:41.820 --> 30:45.740
Well, that's because, well, my parents to this day don't know it unless they're listening

30:45.740 --> 30:48.140
tonight, which I doubt.

30:48.140 --> 30:53.380
But my parents had gone to the store, like Bel Air or something, it was a local grocery

30:53.380 --> 30:54.380
store.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.260
And the big Bel Air bags were sitting on my mom's bed.

30:56.260 --> 31:00.780
Well, me being the nosy kid I was, I went to go see like what candy did she buy because

31:00.780 --> 31:01.780
I'm going to take it.

31:01.780 --> 31:06.940
So I'm looking in the bags and I noticed in one of the bags was Uncle Fester's quest for

31:06.940 --> 31:07.940
the NES.

31:07.940 --> 31:10.100
And I'm like, oh shit, I put two and two together.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.760
I'm like, wow, you just spoiled one of your Christmas presents.

31:12.760 --> 31:13.940
So I didn't say anything about it.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.460
So I just, I quickly left the room, went somewhere else.

31:16.460 --> 31:19.300
And sure enough, what showed up under the tree that Christmas?

31:19.300 --> 31:20.300
Uncle Fester.

31:20.300 --> 31:21.300
But do you know what I did?

31:21.300 --> 31:22.300
Okay.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.300
So how old would I have been at this time?

31:23.300 --> 31:24.300
Probably about 11.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.140
This probably would have been like the year before the Super Nintendo.

31:26.140 --> 31:33.100
So even from a young age, I like to fuck with my mother in a, you know, joking sort of way.

31:33.100 --> 31:37.460
So what we did, you know how like you used to go out and rent games?

31:37.460 --> 31:40.480
So I remember one time we were at the video store.

31:40.480 --> 31:44.620
This was between the time I knew what I was getting and before Christmas, and we were

31:44.620 --> 31:48.620
looking at games to rent and I saw Uncle Fester's quest on the shelf and I actually pulled it

31:48.620 --> 31:51.100
down and I said, doesn't this game look really good?

31:51.100 --> 31:52.300
I think we should rent this one.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.940
I should rent this game and I should beat it this weekend.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.060
Shouldn't we do that?

31:56.060 --> 31:58.700
And my mom was just kind of like doing like that shifty-eyed thing.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.820
Like she's just like, she's not even going to say anything because if she says anything,

32:01.820 --> 32:02.820
she'll give it away.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.700
She's like, I'm going to go look at new releases or something.

32:04.700 --> 32:08.320
So I didn't end up renting that game and like you could beat that game in a weekend anyway.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.580
But that's my story about how I was a little asshole on Christmas.

32:11.580 --> 32:12.580
So there you go.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.580
Or at least in the season.

32:13.580 --> 32:17.340
That doesn't exactly ruin Christmas, Rob.

32:17.340 --> 32:18.340
So yeah.

32:18.340 --> 32:19.340
Only for yourself.

32:19.340 --> 32:22.340
Uncle Fester's Quest was kind of an underrated NES game.

32:22.340 --> 32:26.400
First off, the Addams Family movies were awesome that that game was based off of.

32:26.400 --> 32:32.040
And second off, it was just, it was Blaster Master without the blast part.

32:32.040 --> 32:37.020
It was just the overworld parts was all that Fester's Quest was.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.980
So it was still a fun game, even though it was really, really hard.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.240
Was it kooky?

32:40.960 --> 32:43.880
It was mysterious and spooky.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.560
Tarzy XF is one of my oldest friends.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.840
I've known him since I was 12 years old.

32:47.840 --> 32:51.220
I've known him for a very, very long time, since junior high school.

32:51.220 --> 32:56.560
So I remember going to his house and this wasn't necessarily during the holidays, but

32:56.560 --> 33:01.880
just whenever, and we would play Atari 2600 because him and his brother own like at least

33:01.880 --> 33:05.160
what felt like at the time, every Atari 2600 game under the sun.

33:05.200 --> 33:10.840
So I remember we would stay up till ungodly hours playing adventure Pitfall 2.

33:10.840 --> 33:14.800
I think that's where I probably played more Pitfall 2 on the try to 800 than anywhere

33:14.800 --> 33:15.800
else.

33:15.800 --> 33:16.800
It's probably over there.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.940
So do you have friends that you'd go over to their house and just play their games till

33:19.940 --> 33:20.940
you beat them?

33:20.940 --> 33:21.980
Like all night?

33:21.980 --> 33:27.300
We did that with just about every Magnavox Odyssey 2 because my friend had that.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.400
And then we had a Cliquavision though.

33:29.400 --> 33:34.200
We had a Cliquavision before we had any Atari system at home.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.800
RZXF in chat says, God world, we rated Denios regularly for cheap games.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.800
Denios is like the flea market out in Roseville.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.120
And we still do that today, or at least I do.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.760
I'm pretty sure Neil does too.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.400
Like I still like to go out there today and look for games.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.600
Granted, most of the people there kind of that are selling them kind of know what they're

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
worth.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.320
So you don't always really get a good bargain out there.

33:55.320 --> 34:00.520
But I got, I got Goonies 2 for like eight bucks last time I was out there.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.240
So, and that's a great NES game that I didn't own as a kid.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.720
So good times, good times.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.720
All right.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.720
Anyway, that was a good trip down memory lane.

34:08.720 --> 34:09.720
Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

34:09.720 --> 34:11.720
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

34:11.720 --> 34:12.720
Dark Saga.

34:12.720 --> 34:15.160
I haven't really had a lot of chance to play much of anything.

34:15.160 --> 34:16.360
Just World of Warcraft.

34:16.360 --> 34:23.400
But I am now 30 lingering soul fragments in on my quest to save space demon husband elf

34:23.400 --> 34:26.400
boyfriend.

34:26.400 --> 34:30.620
In the game story, this fucking weird story.

34:30.620 --> 34:35.540
And then I finally bought a chopper.

34:35.540 --> 34:39.440
So I have the motorcycle and I have the sands of time.

34:39.440 --> 34:43.620
So that's pretty cool.

34:43.620 --> 34:44.620
That's really about it.

34:44.620 --> 34:45.920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

34:45.920 --> 34:46.920
What did we play?

34:46.920 --> 34:50.020
Oh, yeah, I'm playing Pokemon Go.

34:50.020 --> 34:52.460
I finally got a Clefairy.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.460
So yay.

34:53.460 --> 34:54.460
That's it.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.460
Me too.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.460
Of course.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.460
But that's it.

34:57.460 --> 34:58.460
Really.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.020
I'm still eating.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.780
You got to make your gaming week longer.

35:02.780 --> 35:13.920
I also played chase Midna all over the house and hiccup and OK, OK, I'm done.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.620
Let's see my gaming week.

35:15.620 --> 35:18.180
I played a lot of the same stuff as previous weeks.

35:18.180 --> 35:22.380
I've been continuing with endgame and Final Fantasy 15, which is going back and doing

35:22.380 --> 35:24.720
all the side quests I didn't do in the beginning.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.340
So I'm making my way through that a little bit.

35:27.340 --> 35:28.700
I've been playing other random stuff.

35:28.700 --> 35:32.660
I was playing Crypt of the Necrodancer very randomly last night.

35:32.660 --> 35:36.180
Played a little bit of Overwatch, even though I'm still terrible at that game, but it doesn't

35:36.180 --> 35:37.740
stop me from being bad.

35:37.740 --> 35:40.300
But I did play one new game.

35:40.300 --> 35:44.620
So Alan bought me some games in the Steam sale for Christmas, and one of the games he

35:44.620 --> 35:47.140
bought me is something that's been sitting on my list for the longest time.

35:47.140 --> 35:50.100
It's a game called Grim Dawn is the name of it.

35:50.100 --> 35:54.740
And it was on my wish list because it's a Diablo-esque kind of game.

35:54.740 --> 35:58.980
And so Click Party, one of those types of games, click all the things and get the loot.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.100
So I've been playing that a little bit.

36:00.100 --> 36:03.180
I've always spent maybe like an hour in it, but it's pretty good so far, except for the

36:03.180 --> 36:07.500
fact that it doesn't really handhold you very much, which I understand.

36:07.500 --> 36:11.720
I think it's supposed to be more of a hardcore type of one of those games.

36:11.720 --> 36:16.120
There's a lot of like veteran mode and difficult modes and stuff like that.

36:16.120 --> 36:19.900
So I don't think the game is really meant to handhold you very much, but I would have

36:19.900 --> 36:25.340
just liked a little more explanation to some of the stuff because I guess it's this thing

36:25.340 --> 36:29.860
with those games, and this is true of Diablo as well, is that I want to spec my character

36:29.860 --> 36:34.180
really well from the get-go, but you know you're going to fuck up your first character

36:34.180 --> 36:37.220
really bad, and you're just going to have to play everything over again.

36:37.220 --> 36:40.900
And I feel like that's what I'm doing right now with the current character that I'm running.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.140
But that's okay.

36:42.140 --> 36:44.380
I'm still having fun with it, and that's the important thing.

36:44.380 --> 36:48.220
And sometimes you just want to pick skills because they're cool.

36:48.220 --> 36:51.540
And I think that's important in a game too, is that you don't necessarily have to min-max everything.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.780
You just want to sometimes play things because they're cool.

36:53.780 --> 36:59.020
So like my character, I have a shaman, and my move is throwing bugs at people.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.220
And that's cool.

37:00.220 --> 37:04.300
So I kill people by throwing bugs at them.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.540
And I don't even know, like when I try to look up builds for shaman, I don't see that

37:07.540 --> 37:10.820
move listed anywhere, so it must not be a very efficient move.

37:10.820 --> 37:12.500
But it's fun, and that's what's important.

37:12.500 --> 37:17.820
So I'm throwing a lot of bugs at people in Grim Dawn and finding lots of loot to click on.

37:17.820 --> 37:22.460
So I think that's really about it.

37:22.460 --> 37:28.340
Probably Grim Dawn, and I feel like there's some other game I got into randomly this week,

37:28.340 --> 37:31.100
and I can't think of it off the top of my head, and it's probably the alcohol kicking

37:31.100 --> 37:33.420
in a little bit that's doing that to me.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.600
But I feel like I was playing more classic games as well.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.600
You know what it was?

37:36.600 --> 37:37.600
What I also played?

37:37.600 --> 37:40.180
Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 I played.

37:40.180 --> 37:45.340
Which for some reason people give a lot of shit compared to the original and the DX Plus

37:45.340 --> 37:46.520
and all that stuff.

37:46.520 --> 37:51.720
Which I understand, because DX Plus is like modern day Pac-Man perfection.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.720
It's frickin' amazing, and it's really hard to improve on that formula.

37:54.720 --> 38:00.700
But I think there's a lot of flashiness, and music is really good in part two, and there's

38:00.700 --> 38:02.800
a lot of stuff to really enjoy about too.

38:02.800 --> 38:07.960
The one flaw is the part where you have to chase the ghosts around the board when the

38:07.960 --> 38:12.200
ghosts are running on rails, and everything amps up at nitro speed, and it can be very

38:12.200 --> 38:14.620
difficult to actually chase the ghosts.

38:14.620 --> 38:16.120
But it looks really cool when you get them.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.560
But that's the only thing, it does throw the rhythm of the game off, and I think that's

38:19.560 --> 38:21.640
where a lot of people have a problem with it.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.720
But otherwise, I like it.

38:23.720 --> 38:24.720
Good stuff.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.720
Alright.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
So that's it for our Game of Weeks.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.720
Yes?

38:27.720 --> 38:28.720
Yes.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.720
Nothing else to mention.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.720
For now.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.720
Alright.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.600
So I will mention, of course, Twitter.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
Follow us on Twitter.

38:34.600 --> 38:35.600
Twitter.com.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.600
Slash O-L-R.

38:36.600 --> 38:37.600
We're also on Facebook.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.600
Facebook.com.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.600
Slash Orange Lounge Radio.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.400
And as I mentioned earlier in the show, we are here tonight on December 25th doing a

38:42.400 --> 38:48.960
live show for fun for y'all, but we will not be here for the next two weeks live, because

38:48.960 --> 38:54.120
next week is New Year's, there's other stuff going on, and in two weeks, I will be at MAGFest.

38:54.120 --> 38:57.920
So if you're gonna be at MAGFest in the DC area, I highly encourage you to pay attention

38:57.920 --> 39:03.120
to our forums over at vognetwork.com, where SSU100Matt has already started a thread to

39:03.120 --> 39:05.160
try to organize people.

39:05.160 --> 39:09.300
Because I'm not, I don't have like a panel or anything like that, like I'm not, like,

39:09.300 --> 39:10.300
nobody cares.

39:10.300 --> 39:11.300
You're not doing a thing.

39:11.300 --> 39:12.300
No, I'm not doing a thing.

39:12.300 --> 39:16.340
So, but I would like to do some type of like unofficial meetup, or just, just kick back

39:16.340 --> 39:18.360
and play old school video games.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.360
You know what?

39:19.360 --> 39:23.420
We need to just, we need to find a place to play the Guardian Legend and play it.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.420
And cry.

39:24.420 --> 39:25.420
And cry.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.420
And cry.

39:26.420 --> 39:31.820
Because that's what, the last PAX I ever went to, that's what happened, is that Bobby Blackwolf

39:31.820 --> 39:35.180
made the mistake of saying, you know, I've never played the Guardian Legend.

39:35.180 --> 39:36.180
Yes.

39:36.180 --> 39:38.960
So I said, no, and I said, I looked him right in the eye and I said, we are fucking fixing

39:38.960 --> 39:39.960
this right now.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.200
And so we went to the classic game room because, you know, it was still early in the day.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.920
So a lot of people hadn't opened yet.

39:44.920 --> 39:49.000
And I was like, you know, one car, you have to trade your driver's license, one copy of

39:49.000 --> 39:50.660
Guardian Legend, please.

39:50.660 --> 39:52.000
And we went and I made him play it.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.600
And a good time was had by all.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
Yes.

39:54.600 --> 40:00.840
And then I played Kid Icarus as far as I could, which I think I got to like the first dungeon

40:00.840 --> 40:04.400
before I had to kind of give up my seat.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.520
So we need to do that at MagFest.

40:05.520 --> 40:11.040
I want to play some old school NES games because Lord knows I can't play the new ones.

40:11.040 --> 40:15.120
We can try to play the new ones, but I'm trying to sing this song and I'm like losing my place.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.120
That's all right.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.120
Sorry.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.120
You've had a little bit to drink.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.120
A little?

40:19.120 --> 40:20.120
Just a little.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.120
Just a little.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.120
Here, catch.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.120
What are you throwing at me?

40:23.120 --> 40:24.120
Balls.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.120
More candy.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
Eat it.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.120
I'm into a story now.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.120
All right.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.120
Yes.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.120
Let's get into some news.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.120
Well, I was just going to see if our chat had anything to say.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
Too bad.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.120
Our turn.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.120
Over at live.vognetwork.com.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.120
You know what the story is about?

40:35.720 --> 40:36.720
Pay attention.

40:37.720 --> 40:38.720
Listen up.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.720
If you play Overwatch UK.

40:45.720 --> 40:46.720
Okay.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.720
I'm sure everyone knows it by now.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.720
Tracer's a lesbian.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.720
She likes to munch carpet.

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
Jamie.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.720
She likes fish tacos.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.720
Jamie.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.720
You're not supposed to say those things.

41:01.720 --> 41:02.720
She's had a bit to drink.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.720
I'm not.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
I don't think so.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
I think.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.320
Well, we live in that culture where everybody gets offended really easy.

41:09.320 --> 41:12.320
So you got to watch what you say.

41:12.320 --> 41:18.320
Well, yeah, but I do too.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.880
My favorite, my favorite thing I've heard from all this is cheers, love the Calvary

41:21.880 --> 41:22.880
is queer.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.000
That's, that's my favorite thing I've heard from all this.

41:25.000 --> 41:32.480
And for the record, absolutely no problem with lesbians or anybody, the people I have

41:32.480 --> 41:35.240
a problem with are assholes.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.240
Assholes.

41:36.240 --> 41:41.240
Well, Reaper's kind of an asshole, so does it balance itself out?

41:41.240 --> 41:42.240
Okay.

41:42.240 --> 41:46.000
And by the way, didn't we just have a big discussion at the end of last week's show

41:46.000 --> 41:47.920
that was nothing but cunt.

41:47.920 --> 41:52.240
I think that was after the show was done recording, but yes.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.240
Oops.

41:53.240 --> 41:57.880
Uh, anyway, uh, I would have mentioned this in chat cause I, I don't, I think this is

41:57.880 --> 42:00.600
being said very tongue in cheek, but I'm going to address it anyway.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.200
Santa and Chad over at live.vog network.com says, I read the comic.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.400
I'm not convinced Tracer is a lesbian.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.200
British people kiss each other all the time.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.200
Wasn't that on a forum?

42:09.200 --> 42:12.000
I think, I think it's tongue in cheek cause I think that was one of those forum posts.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.040
Did you see the screenshot of the forum posts?

42:14.040 --> 42:16.520
No, but I don't care because...

42:16.520 --> 42:17.520
My favorite.

42:17.520 --> 42:23.840
I'm a top 500 straight male Overwatch player and all the responses were like, how do you

42:23.840 --> 42:24.840
measure that?

42:24.840 --> 42:27.840
Cause what the guy meant to say was that he was a top 500 player and happened to be a

42:27.840 --> 42:29.040
straight male.

42:29.200 --> 42:33.000
But like all the responses were like, how do you prove that you're one of the top 500

42:33.000 --> 42:35.440
straight males of the planet earth?

42:35.440 --> 42:36.840
How do you, how do you prove that?

42:36.840 --> 42:39.040
Is there a, is there a measurement system?

42:39.040 --> 42:41.040
A dick litmus test.

42:41.040 --> 42:46.280
Nope, no gay on this dick.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.520
This dick has never been in a butt.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.520
Wow.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.200
Jamie cut back on the liquor.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.200
Jesus.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.200
We're going to get emails tonight.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.880
This show is going to end up on tumblr and I'm going to be embarrassed.

42:55.880 --> 42:56.880
All right.

42:56.880 --> 42:57.880
Um, so let's see.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.880
Okay.

42:58.920 --> 42:59.920
Again.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.920
Oh my God.

43:02.920 --> 43:03.920
What?

43:03.920 --> 43:10.320
First of all, you see now I'm sober again.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.320
Okay.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.920
Because it's like a switch so you just turn on and off.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.920
It is pretty much.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.280
I have to drink some more.

43:17.280 --> 43:24.160
First of all, everyone who's listened to the show knows that I will say whatever I want

43:24.160 --> 43:27.200
whenever I want for whatever reason I want that are only known to me.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.840
That doesn't make it okay.

43:28.880 --> 43:29.880
Number two.

43:29.880 --> 43:30.880
You're problematic.

43:30.880 --> 43:35.440
Number two, everyone who listens to this show knows that I am a very tolerant person that

43:35.440 --> 43:39.280
judges nobody unless they have earned my judgment.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.280
With bad grammar.

43:40.280 --> 43:43.800
With bad grammar or for being a dick.

43:43.800 --> 43:52.320
But there are certain things that people need to learn of intent.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.280
So now I'm going to go back and talk about the lesbian.

43:54.280 --> 43:57.200
Okay, wait, I have to address this comment in chat.

43:57.200 --> 44:01.120
Barb, my favorite character from Stranger Things in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com

44:01.120 --> 44:06.280
says Xtaphir is a top 500 gay, no T all shade.

44:06.280 --> 44:10.920
Barb, although I appreciate you being here, let's be real, Xtaphir is not a top anything.

44:10.920 --> 44:14.440
Oh, come on.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.720
That comment invited itself.

44:15.720 --> 44:16.720
Come on.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.720
Come on.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.280
By the way, if you want to edit all of that out.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.040
I'm not editing anything.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.040
Come on.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.040
Whatever.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.720
Anyway, let's talk about.

44:25.720 --> 44:26.720
Let's talk about.

44:26.720 --> 44:27.720
Tracer.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.720
Yes, she's gay.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
Oh, yeah.

44:29.720 --> 44:30.720
The comment from Santa.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.720
The foreign post.

44:31.720 --> 44:32.720
Important.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.000
But it's wrong.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
One of the right.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
No, it's not.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
It's absolutely right.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.600
One of the writers came out and said, Tracer identifies as lesbian.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.800
Michael Chu said it.

44:42.800 --> 44:43.800
There.

44:43.800 --> 44:44.800
Thank you.

44:44.800 --> 44:45.800
The senior game designer.

44:45.800 --> 44:46.800
That's it.

44:46.800 --> 44:47.800
Thank you.

44:47.800 --> 44:48.800
He is her God.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.240
And he made her gay.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.960
She didn't choose to be gay.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.040
She was born that way.

44:58.040 --> 45:01.080
So fuck off.

45:01.080 --> 45:03.080
Top 500 straight males of the world.

45:03.080 --> 45:06.320
Top 500 straight.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.320
Dick lit.

45:07.320 --> 45:08.320
Miss test.

45:08.320 --> 45:09.320
It's the Dick.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.660
Well, this is okay.

45:11.660 --> 45:18.480
So this is a big deal because Tracer is kind of the poster child for Overwatch.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.160
I mean, there's a few things you can say about this.

45:21.160 --> 45:24.440
I mean, one of my favorite comments I've seen on this is, well, isn't everybody in

45:24.440 --> 45:25.440
Overwatch gay?

45:25.440 --> 45:28.560
And, you know, that's probably true.

45:28.560 --> 45:34.040
But the fact that Tracer is the one that's on the box and Tracer's, you know, was the

45:34.040 --> 45:37.200
very first hero in one of the trailers, right?

45:37.200 --> 45:38.200
Maybe Winston.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.200
Maybe Winston.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.760
But she's the poster girl for Overwatch.

45:41.760 --> 45:46.720
And you know, Overwatch is the biggest game of 2016 in many different ways.

45:46.720 --> 45:50.500
And for them to come out and be like, oh, by the way, Tracer just happens to be gay.

45:50.500 --> 45:56.620
You know, I think was, was a great thing for, and people always want to have this fucking

45:56.620 --> 45:59.740
argument about, does it matter?

45:59.740 --> 46:00.740
You know, it doesn't matter.

46:00.740 --> 46:03.900
Why can't she just stay in the closet and all this stuff?

46:03.900 --> 46:04.900
No.

46:04.900 --> 46:08.580
No one should have to fucking stay in the fucking closet, which is why I am being as

46:08.580 --> 46:11.140
fucking crude as I can be.

46:11.140 --> 46:14.060
Doesn't everybody like to see themselves a little bit?

46:14.060 --> 46:15.620
Why don't you go back to your little closet?

46:15.620 --> 46:18.660
Doesn't everybody like to see themselves a little bit in a game somewhere?

46:18.660 --> 46:20.420
Do straight people have a basement maybe?

46:21.340 --> 46:25.220
There are top 500 straights in almost every single video game.

46:25.220 --> 46:32.520
So let the lesbian gamers out there, and believe me, there are some lesbian gamers out there

46:32.520 --> 46:33.520
that will kick your ass.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.720
Hey, we finally have ace representation.

46:35.720 --> 46:36.720
Do we?

46:36.720 --> 46:37.720
Maya.

46:37.720 --> 46:41.060
In, um, uh, uh, Borderlands.

46:41.060 --> 46:42.460
Oh, that's right.

46:42.460 --> 46:44.220
I asked at gamer X.

46:44.220 --> 46:45.220
Yeah.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.220
And her God said.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.220
Yeah.

46:47.220 --> 46:51.680
Do you talk to, do you talk to gods often in your thoughts, um, created these worlds

46:51.680 --> 46:52.680
there.

46:52.680 --> 46:53.680
Let me finish my thought.

46:53.680 --> 46:54.680
Well, fine.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.700
My thought was seeing yourself reflected in video games.

46:57.700 --> 46:58.700
Yes.

46:58.700 --> 46:59.700
That's important.

46:59.700 --> 47:03.860
Why do people have the whole create your character mode and why do people razz those, create

47:03.860 --> 47:07.940
your character modes when it's missing obvious things like, you know, the ability to change

47:07.940 --> 47:11.980
your skin color and things like that, because people want to be able to see themselves in

47:11.980 --> 47:12.980
games.

47:12.980 --> 47:17.980
Representation of sexuality is, is really a great thing.

47:17.980 --> 47:22.100
Representation of different skin colors, men and women and gender and all that stuff.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.420
These are all great things.

47:23.420 --> 47:28.380
And again, and I can't stress this enough because people always think like, Oh my God,

47:28.380 --> 47:32.580
they're taking over and there's not going to be any top 500 straight characters left.

47:32.580 --> 47:34.980
And that's not the case.

47:34.980 --> 47:37.980
Nobody is saying to take away characters.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.340
You don't need to take away anything.

47:40.340 --> 47:44.500
Just add a little bit of rainbow.

47:44.500 --> 47:47.580
I like this one person's quote on Twitter.

47:47.580 --> 47:49.060
I love Tracer's new voice line.

47:49.060 --> 47:51.860
I am gay and playing as me makes you gay.

47:51.860 --> 47:55.860
And how her alt sends an email to your dad that reads, dad I'm gay.

47:55.860 --> 48:00.260
Well, and that's the other side of it is that, you know, if there's that whole perception

48:00.260 --> 48:03.820
of, well, she doesn't need to announce to the world that she's gay or whatever, well

48:03.820 --> 48:08.180
then by that same fucking matter, then by that same token, playing as her in the game

48:08.180 --> 48:14.020
means nothing except you're a cheap motherfucker because I always get killed by fucking Tracer.

48:14.020 --> 48:17.860
I can't stand her, but has nothing to do with the fact that she's a lesbian that just has

48:17.860 --> 48:20.700
everything to do with the fact that she's cheap.

48:20.700 --> 48:26.820
Well, and I mean, it's just, and this is the thing.

48:26.820 --> 48:33.180
It's everyone needs to have something that's going to tie them to the world of the game.

48:33.180 --> 48:37.740
Something that makes the characters live for them.

48:37.740 --> 48:38.740
You know?

48:38.740 --> 48:40.420
True, true facts.

48:40.420 --> 48:43.860
The first time I played Mass Effect, I wasn't into it.

48:43.860 --> 48:47.940
Like somebody, it must have been somebody driving the Mako in Mass Effect 1 or something

48:47.940 --> 48:51.340
where I, you know, one of the like not so great parts of Mass Effect 1 where I must

48:51.340 --> 48:53.740
have been like, eh, I'm not really into this game.

48:53.740 --> 48:59.260
It wasn't until somebody said, did you know that in this game you can have like a male

48:59.260 --> 49:05.260
male relationship and it's really well done and it's thought out and it's not like ridiculous

49:05.260 --> 49:08.700
or you know, like totally like token or whatever.

49:08.700 --> 49:12.340
It's just, it's something that feels very natural to the plot and all that stuff.

49:12.340 --> 49:16.500
That made me interested in playing the game because yes, I wanted to see that represented

49:16.500 --> 49:17.500
in a game somewhere.

49:17.500 --> 49:24.020
I wanted to, I was like, wow, that's a story that I would like to hear more about, right?

49:24.020 --> 49:30.380
So that got me to play Mass Effect and now I love Mass Effect and that's one of many

49:30.380 --> 49:32.660
reasons why I love Mass Effect.

49:32.660 --> 49:36.820
Mass Effect is a great fucking game for a variety of reasons.

49:36.820 --> 49:38.420
That is one of them.

49:38.420 --> 49:47.900
I also think that apart from just the representation factor, you know, the one thing that is going

49:47.900 --> 49:53.100
to attract a person to the game or make someone go, Hey, this game has someone like me in

49:53.100 --> 50:04.380
it is the fact that it's also acknowledgement that it's not abnormal, that it shouldn't

50:04.380 --> 50:05.380
matter.

50:05.380 --> 50:09.900
Now, Tiger Claw on Chat says, let's not forget, Tracer was the one who was in the middle of

50:09.900 --> 50:12.020
controversy because of her butt pose.

50:12.020 --> 50:15.620
You remember that a few weeks or a few weeks ago, a few months ago, it was actually before

50:15.620 --> 50:20.340
Overwatch was out, but there was a pose that somebody had made a post and kind of complained

50:20.340 --> 50:21.420
about it a little bit.

50:21.420 --> 50:24.420
And Blizzard said, you know, we were kind of thinking about changing it anyway.

50:24.420 --> 50:25.980
And they changed it back.

50:25.980 --> 50:31.100
And then everybody, all of a sudden, everybody piped up out of, out of, out of all the different

50:31.100 --> 50:34.660
ends of Twitter and stuff saying, you shouldn't change it.

50:34.660 --> 50:38.020
Stick to your vision, stick to what you had planned and all this stuff.

50:38.020 --> 50:40.900
And now Tracer comes out of the closet and it's like, well, maybe you shouldn't stick

50:40.900 --> 50:41.900
to your vision.

50:41.900 --> 50:42.900
And you know what?

50:42.900 --> 50:48.260
People are going to be offended.

50:48.260 --> 50:49.260
It happens.

50:49.260 --> 50:53.780
And the things that you shouldn't, that you should take to heart for offense are when

50:53.780 --> 50:58.260
people truly intend to be fucking offensive.

50:58.260 --> 51:01.380
When people are trying to repress your rights.

51:01.380 --> 51:07.500
When people are trying to tear down the programs that help us and keep us alive.

51:07.500 --> 51:11.980
When people are trying to ruin the world that we live in and make it only safe for people

51:11.980 --> 51:14.420
who fit one mold.

51:14.420 --> 51:18.740
Those are the people that you should offend the ever living fuck out of.

51:18.740 --> 51:21.860
So do it.

51:21.860 --> 51:23.140
And you know what?

51:23.140 --> 51:30.740
If they get offended by a lady in a fictional environment who loves other women and likes

51:30.740 --> 51:37.460
to smooch and do other things in bed, put it, rub it in their fucking face.

51:37.460 --> 51:40.900
Blizzard is never going to go into detail about that because it's, it's just not important.

51:40.900 --> 51:43.380
But I can picture it and it's kind of hot.

51:43.380 --> 51:48.820
So anyway, you take that and you rub it in their fucking face.

51:48.820 --> 51:50.660
This is your reality.

51:50.660 --> 51:56.040
You cannot live in your little closed bubble, closets don't exist dream.

51:56.040 --> 51:57.340
Fuck you.

51:57.340 --> 52:00.860
That's how I feel.

52:00.860 --> 52:01.860
I was going to say something.

52:01.860 --> 52:03.580
I was just going to rile you up even more.

52:03.580 --> 52:04.580
Do it.

52:04.580 --> 52:05.580
Rile me.

52:05.580 --> 52:06.580
Here, I'll drink some more.

52:06.580 --> 52:13.900
But Dark Sakura, in my America now, I get to build a wall and I get to wall off those

52:13.900 --> 52:16.180
images.

52:16.180 --> 52:18.620
And make Mexico pay for it.

52:18.620 --> 52:19.620
Moving on.

52:19.620 --> 52:26.620
Havoc978 in chat says, if only people cared about the payload this much, amen.

52:26.620 --> 52:29.060
Amen.

52:29.060 --> 52:30.060
You know what?

52:30.060 --> 52:31.060
Two glasses in.

52:31.060 --> 52:34.400
All right, let's move on to another story.

52:34.400 --> 52:38.640
Let's move on to something else that talks about, hey, the Legend of Zelda, Link to the

52:38.640 --> 52:39.640
Past.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.640
That's right.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.640
This hot new game.

52:41.640 --> 52:44.440
This hot new game that all the kids are getting under the trees this Christmas.

52:44.440 --> 52:46.220
All right.

52:46.220 --> 52:47.940
So here's the thing.

52:47.940 --> 52:52.880
This I don't know why this is making the rounds this week on the blogs, but it is because

52:52.880 --> 52:57.840
it comes from an interview from January 1992.

52:57.840 --> 53:03.160
But people unearth things and it is kind of cool and it's worth talking about because

53:03.160 --> 53:05.520
this is a legendary game.

53:05.520 --> 53:06.520
So here it is.

53:06.520 --> 53:12.600
This was a Famicom Soushin interview with Shigeru Miyamoto.

53:12.600 --> 53:17.000
And they were talking about what other ideas for Link to the Past had to be cut because

53:17.000 --> 53:19.080
of the eight megabyte limitation.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.760
Miyamoto says a lot.

53:20.760 --> 53:23.260
You can't just throw every good idea you have in a game.

53:23.260 --> 53:26.720
The idea has to connect up with something else in the game and there needs to be consistency

53:26.720 --> 53:27.720
between the ideas.

53:27.720 --> 53:29.920
There was a ton more we wanted to do.

53:29.920 --> 53:33.640
And when pressed, Miyamoto said, one idea was with the lantern.

53:33.640 --> 53:38.400
If you used it on a grassy area, it would cause a huge brush fire.

53:38.400 --> 53:43.440
If you cut a little circle of grass around you, you could safely stand there in the middle

53:43.440 --> 53:44.440
of it.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.600
That sounds kind of cool.

53:45.600 --> 53:51.060
I'm all for starting fire in games.

53:51.060 --> 53:56.120
And then when pressed further, anything else, Miyamoto said in swamp areas, you could use

53:56.120 --> 53:58.240
a shovel to dig a ditch.

53:58.240 --> 54:03.480
And then if you bombed the swamp breakwater, it would cause the water to rush in the hole

54:03.480 --> 54:04.600
you dug.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.720
The idea was actually half complete.

54:06.720 --> 54:10.360
If we had another six months, we might have been able to make it a reality.

54:10.360 --> 54:16.720
So kind of neat, and I just like these sorts of tidbits because I like to hear about what

54:16.720 --> 54:18.200
really went into these games.

54:18.200 --> 54:22.920
This reminds me of a story a couple weeks ago about how Super Mario Brothers 3 was originally,

54:22.920 --> 54:24.440
they were designing it as overhead.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.000
You remember we talked about that on the show?

54:26.000 --> 54:30.920
So I like these little tidbits about old games and hearing how things transformed and things

54:30.920 --> 54:33.580
that had to get cut and all that stuff.

54:33.580 --> 54:38.220
It's the type of stories I'd like to hear also about Final Fantasy 15, because we all

54:38.220 --> 54:41.120
know stuff got cut in Final Fantasy 15.

54:41.120 --> 54:44.840
So I'd kind of like to hear about some of the decisions they made and why they did it.

54:44.840 --> 54:49.240
So anyway, just kind of a cool, like, this is something that could have been, but it's

54:49.240 --> 54:51.880
not type of story.

54:51.880 --> 54:52.880
That's it.

54:52.880 --> 54:53.880
Dr. Sakura.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.040
Valve owes some money.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.040
Money.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.400
Valve owes us any game starting with the number three.

55:01.400 --> 55:09.840
Valve owes us a freaking Half-Life 3 already, but they have actually been found guilty by

55:09.840 --> 55:16.680
the Australian Federal Court by the, well, at the Australian Federal, I can't make words

55:16.680 --> 55:22.280
happen, Rob, by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC.

55:22.280 --> 55:26.600
They were guilty of violating consumer law in Australia.

55:26.600 --> 55:38.400
And so now they, last month, they said that Valve's fine for the breaches should reach

55:38.400 --> 55:44.280
around three million Australian dollars, which is about two point fifteen million United

55:44.280 --> 55:46.000
States dollars.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.680
And the judge basically is like, yep, we think that's right.

55:50.680 --> 55:59.640
So now they have, have to make that payment for it.

55:59.640 --> 56:07.400
So it's like, basically what happened is that if a game or a product is deemed effective,

56:07.400 --> 56:13.720
defective or not acceptable quality or unfit, then the consumer is entitled a refund.

56:13.720 --> 56:20.380
And so there were many refunds that Valve did not allow through or did not process.

56:20.380 --> 56:22.980
And so that's where all that money has to go.

56:22.980 --> 56:31.760
So and then along with the fine, Valve actually has to put up a link on the Steam homepage

56:31.760 --> 56:35.580
in a typeface of at least 14 points, times New Roman.

56:35.580 --> 56:38.420
Who the fuck uses time to New Roman?

56:38.420 --> 56:39.420
Seriously?

56:39.420 --> 56:40.420
Romans.

56:40.420 --> 56:41.420
They're dead.

56:41.420 --> 56:42.420
New ones.

56:42.420 --> 56:43.420
Oh, New Romans.

56:43.420 --> 56:44.420
Okay.

56:44.420 --> 56:46.460
You know, you know where that font came from?

56:46.460 --> 56:47.460
Rome?

56:47.460 --> 56:48.940
Supposed to be for the New York Times.

56:48.940 --> 56:49.940
Oh, okay.

56:50.500 --> 56:51.500
Anyway.

56:51.500 --> 56:52.500
True story.

56:52.500 --> 56:57.100
So anyway, they have to make that visible to anyone who opens that page within Australia.

56:57.100 --> 57:09.220
So but Valve hasn't been sentenced to any kind of death, booting, as they call it.

57:09.220 --> 57:12.780
So whatever.

57:12.780 --> 57:18.660
They are, but they have implemented a refund policy in August as of last year.

57:18.660 --> 57:21.100
You know, we were just talking about this a little bit last week on the show.

57:21.100 --> 57:25.860
The whole backlash against Valve, which I guess, I don't know if this really plays into

57:25.860 --> 57:30.940
that or not, but it's just very interesting to see how like Steam kind of, and especially

57:30.940 --> 57:34.180
with the sale just having happened on Steam, I mean, a lot of people are participating

57:34.180 --> 57:39.560
and involved, but I don't know, it hasn't felt like the big event that it used to.

57:39.560 --> 57:42.560
And I don't know if that's because of Humble Bundle or Good Old Games, the fact that there's

57:42.560 --> 57:46.860
other options now, or just the fact that, you know, I think people are starting to get

57:46.860 --> 57:52.820
a little irritated that Valve will not make a Half-Life 3, a Portal 3, a Left 4 Dead 3,

57:52.820 --> 57:57.260
or really anything at all that isn't Dota.

57:57.260 --> 58:01.580
Or the Vive stuff, which, you know, funny because now I'm naming all these things that

58:01.580 --> 58:07.340
are out there, but if you can't afford a Vive, then that stuff might as well not exist.

58:07.340 --> 58:13.740
And Dota is a very kind of specific sort of game that not everybody's into, so, you know,

58:13.740 --> 58:20.180
I just feel like Valve really needs to, needs to come back and do a game that everybody

58:20.180 --> 58:21.180
can get into.

58:21.180 --> 58:22.180
You know what I mean?

58:22.180 --> 58:23.180
Yes.

58:23.180 --> 58:28.100
Well, Valve has until February 20th to appeal.

58:28.100 --> 58:29.100
Whether or not they will.

58:29.100 --> 58:30.100
Which they probably will.

58:30.100 --> 58:31.100
Everybody appeals.

58:31.100 --> 58:32.100
Yeah.

58:32.100 --> 58:35.340
I will appeal to you for crackers if you have any.

58:35.340 --> 58:36.340
I don't, I don't know if we do it.

58:36.340 --> 58:37.340
You'll have to bug Allen.

58:37.340 --> 58:38.340
Why don't you have crackers?

58:38.340 --> 58:39.340
We might.

58:39.340 --> 58:40.340
There might be like-

58:40.340 --> 58:41.340
You knew this was happening.

58:41.340 --> 58:42.340
There might, go raid that little-

58:42.340 --> 58:43.340
Waffles!

58:43.940 --> 58:44.940
Stoop waffle?

58:44.940 --> 58:45.940
No I don't.

58:45.940 --> 58:46.940
Because that shit was good.

58:46.940 --> 58:47.940
Alright.

58:47.940 --> 58:48.940
I don't want to drink the rest of the wine bottle by myself.

58:48.940 --> 58:55.020
VXJ6V in chat says, everybody didn't get into Half Life, nor Portal, not Team Fortress 2,

58:55.020 --> 58:57.060
nor are they all into Dota 2 either.

58:57.060 --> 59:00.060
Was there nothing in the orange box?

59:00.060 --> 59:02.560
Nothing in the orange box to satiate you?

59:02.560 --> 59:07.220
But if, okay, maybe if that's the case though, then you're not also chomping at the bit for

59:07.220 --> 59:09.140
Valve to make something new.

59:09.140 --> 59:12.820
I mean, when was the last time Valve put out a console game?

59:12.820 --> 59:16.220
When was the last time Valve put out a console game?

59:16.220 --> 59:17.220
Portal 2, right?

59:17.220 --> 59:18.220
Yeah.

59:18.220 --> 59:20.220
Now how long ago was that?

59:20.220 --> 59:21.220
A while.

59:21.220 --> 59:22.220
A while.

59:22.220 --> 59:23.220
So, just saying.

59:23.220 --> 59:24.220
It's been a little while.

59:24.220 --> 59:26.220
It was first Xbox, wasn't it?

59:26.220 --> 59:27.580
Uh, Portal?

59:27.580 --> 59:28.580
Portal 1 was-

59:28.580 --> 59:29.580
The orange box.

59:29.580 --> 59:30.580
Oh, the orange box was first Xbox.

59:30.580 --> 59:31.580
Yeah.

59:31.580 --> 59:32.580
Well, and PC.

59:32.580 --> 59:33.580
And then Portal 2.

59:33.580 --> 59:34.580
PC.

59:34.580 --> 59:35.580
Obviously PC.

59:35.580 --> 59:36.580
But, yeah.

59:36.580 --> 59:37.580
Alright, anyway.

59:37.580 --> 59:38.580
Uh, let's see.

59:39.020 --> 59:40.020
Let's talk about.

59:40.020 --> 59:43.540
I want to talk about streaming software and websites and stuff.

59:43.540 --> 59:46.100
Because, you know, all the talk is always about Twitch.

59:46.100 --> 59:47.580
But there's other stuff out there.

59:47.580 --> 59:49.060
You know, YouTube gaming.

59:49.060 --> 59:52.020
And this other new site kind of caught my eye this week.

59:52.020 --> 59:53.940
Which I thought was interesting.

59:53.940 --> 59:56.740
And I'm curious what you guys think about this website.

59:56.740 --> 59:58.140
I want to talk about Beam.

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.580
Have you heard about Beam?

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.020
Beam is a newer video game streaming website.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.820
It's beam.pro is where you can find it.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.060
And Beam was bought by Microsoft not that long ago.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.700
So Beam is now a Microsoft property.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.660
And Beam did these big updates today.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:22.940
Or, not today, but in this past week, saying that they are readying their live streaming

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.460
service for Xbox and Windows.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.940
And I guess that went out in beta.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.780
Although I haven't seen it yet.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:35.600
I've just seen what's on their website and on their iPhone app and all that stuff.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.200
But Beam's big thing, if you don't know, and this is why I'm kind of into it.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.200
They're really big on interaction.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.120
They want to really be about interactive streams.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:51.600
So they're testing this low latency thing where, you know, just within seconds, not

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.920
even seconds, what you see on the video, you can respond to and chat and you can have more

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
of a real...

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.560
It's kind of like the way Twitch used to be back when it first started until they got

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560
really big.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.680
But then, as I understand it, Twitch kind of...

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.800
You can enable a mode now on Twitch where you can kind of go back to that.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.840
But I think there is still a latency of probably like 10 seconds.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.580
Beam, I think, is trying to get it lower than that.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:17.800
And then, as you watch these streams on Beam, you get little credits, like little lightning

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.360
bolt credits, that you can then use to interact with streams.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.760
You can play little sound clips, or I don't know what all goes into it.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.520
But you can do these little interactions.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.120
But then, as I understand it, they're also encouraging game designers to design games

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.400
where people could make things spawn in the game.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.620
And you've seen a little bit of this already with stuff, and again, over on Twitch, with

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.680
things like the Jackbox Party Pack, what, Tomb Raider had some of this as well, right?

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.240
So you're seeing this already, but Beam really wants to kind of focus that and play it out

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.000
in a very low latency environment.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
So I just...

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I think it's interesting.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.280
The competition stuff is very interesting.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.280
Beam is also talking about that the max bitrate is now 10 megabits per second and supports

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:09.720
60 frames a second rendering speed up to 2,560 by 1440 resolution.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.360
So whoo.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.040
Also a new homepage and all this other stuff, HTML5 player that eliminates Flash, better

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.280
video on demand playback, and all this stuff.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.040
They are saying that Xbox One and Windows support is coming sometime in the winter,

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.160
and there will be new hybrid applications to mobile in 2017.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:35.520
Beam right now, 100,000 monthly users as of August, Twitch, 100 million.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.240
So there's quite a few more people on Twitch than Beam.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.180
But the competition stuff is always interesting.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.960
It's interesting to see what they might come up with.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960
I've used the website.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.200
I actually signed up for an account over there just to check it out and poke around.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.680
It's a slick interface.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680
It's very flashy.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.360
I like the interface over there.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.520
And I do like the gamification of the streams.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.240
I do think that's a neat concept, and I really want to see what they do with that more.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.560
Because I feel like, you know, yeah, Twitch supports it, but Beam feels like it's built

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560
around it.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.720
So I think that's kind of neat.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.320
I want to see what they do with that.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.320
Over in chat, everybody in chat is like, BLEAM?

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.760
Are you talking about BLEAM?

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.080
No, I'm not talking about a fucking emulator on the Dreamcast.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.080
It's something else.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.660
BLEAM was an up-rezzing thing.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.640
And Tekken 3 for BLEAMcast was pretty cool.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640
So there you go.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640
Let's see.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.080
AkumaJP in chat says, bought by Microsoft.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.560
Another great software going into the abyss.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.480
Look, you knew Microsoft was not going to sit by and watch Amazon run the show.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.600
Amazon and Google, I guess, because YouTube gave me.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.960
They're not going to sit by and watch those two run the show.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.800
And yes, I know there's other things like Hitbox, but I would bet the user numbers of

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.640
those bases are probably similar to where Beam is at, right?

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.400
So Dungeon Buster says, the delay is noticeably lower versus Twitch.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.200
VXJ6V says, I expect very little to come out of those features on BLEAM.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.480
And Kaijuto says, BLEAM sucks too.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.600
I'm assuming Kaijuto thinks they all suck.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600
I'm just assuming.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600
I don't know.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.800
You just can't please some people.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.280
Dungeon Buster says, a streamer I used to watch went over to BLEAM because of the community

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.720
tools alone.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.640
See, that's going to be what's interesting, because if BLEAM can woo the big Twitch people

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.700
over, at least enough of them, that's how you're going to really get competitive.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.620
Same thing with YouTube gaming, right?

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.460
So I'm just, I'm curious to see how this plays out.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:35.800
You know, like back probably what, three years ago before YouTube got into this, I know I

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.400
sat here on the show and went, why is nobody trying to compete against Twitch?

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.280
Why does Twitch run this show all by themselves?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.000
What is, what's going on here?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.820
So I kind of think a lot of these people are showing up late to the party, but if you can

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:56.180
woo people over with the right features, hey, MySpace, we all thought that was going

01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:00.140
to be a thing forever at one point, and LiveJournal, we all thought that was going to be a thing

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.140
forever.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.940
And well, LiveJournal still exists.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.460
Not that I'm saying Twitch is going to suffer the same fate.

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.300
That's not what I'm saying, but I'm just saying none of this stuff is invincible, right?

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.780
With the right features and all this stuff, it could be a different internet tomorrow.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.740
So I'm going to keep my eye on it.

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.740
I'm just curious.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.900
I'm still, I don't know, I'm still into Twitch, but I like what I'm seeing at Beam.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:26.140
I'm just kind of curious what develops when they put out the Xbox app and all this other

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.140
stuff.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.140
They'll grow up.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.140
We'll see.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.140
We'll see what happens as they, as they age and all of that.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.140
Oh.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140
Let's move on.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.140
How about something that has nothing to do with aging?

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.140
Dragon Quest.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.220
Well, that series is getting older.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.220
Well, yeah.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.220
So are we all.

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:46.380
Anyway, Dragon Quest is actually going to be involved with the Universal Studios Nintendo

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.380
thing that's going to happen.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:52.180
They're doing something called Real Battle Attraction that will involve getting weapons,

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.380
going into dungeons and battling monsters.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:04.780
It's also going to be, I guess, overseen by Ryutaro Ichimura, who is the general producer

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.320
of the series so that it's authentic.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.020
So it'll be great.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.580
It'll be fun.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.300
And I want to go.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.200
So someone send me a ticket right now.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.440
So you need kukurumis and a trip to Japan.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440
I need.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.280
Oh, I'll just deal with the trip to Japan.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.160
And then we can have Orange Lounge video.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.160
Yeah.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.960
It'll be Orange Lounge Travelo.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.520
All right.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.720
Moving on to an article about the NES Mini, which obviously has been a big thing this

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.020
holiday season.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:40.460
The NES Mini has sold in 30 days what the Wii U sold in six months.

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.460
That's right.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:49.380
The NES Mini has sold 196,000 units were sold.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.640
That's just in November.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.260
That's not even counting December.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.140
And of course, I'm going to make the obvious reference here.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.740
Just imagine how many more of these they would have sold if they could have kept these fucking

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:05.280
things on shelves and actually made the amount of NES Minis to match the demand for the Wii

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.500
or to match the demand that was out there, basically.

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:16.920
So yeah, by comparison, Nintendo shifted 220,000 of the Wii U's in a six-month period.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:21.480
So a little bit more of the Wii U, but honestly, that's pretty crazy.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:29.880
Also, by the way, 261,000 units of the Mini Famicom sold in Japan in one week.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880
Crazy.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.960
Well, we'll see.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:38.880
I'm curious to see what this plays out in in January or in February or so forth.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:42.640
If they're able to keep these things on shelves, if people are still buying them, what it looks

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.780
like.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.800
But it does have me thinking, you know, if Nintendo really wants to sell a lot of these

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.840
Nintendo Switches, maybe they should consider, maybe not necessarily building in the classic

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:02.260
NES Mini, but maybe they should just consider bundling in 30 classic games into the Switch

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.260
by default.

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:08.580
And yes, look, I understand Nintendo can make a lot of money off virtual console games because

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.400
people are still going to buy Zelda Link to the Past no matter how many times you put

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.400
it out there.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:19.800
But just imagine if Nintendo would just reach to their catalog, pull out 30 games from the

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:26.860
NES and package it all into the Nintendo Switch and say, hey, and it's part of being an early

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:31.000
adopter of the Nintendo Switch, you know, kind of like the 3DS Ambassador thing, I guess,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
even though the Ambassador program was to save that console from flopping.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.280
Imagine if they just said with the Nintendo Switch, hey, if you buy this console in the

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.380
first year, you're going to get 30 games free, classic.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:48.180
I mean, I think the Switch would stand to sell very well, just like the NES Mini, because

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:53.680
again, these strong games clearly are pushing the consoles.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.960
It's really just blow my mind that the classic NES Mini sold as well as it did.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:03.500
And I think a lot of that is probably, you know, 30 something parents who grew up with

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.300
these systems buying this stuff so their kids could play the same games they did when

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.300
they were their age.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.480
I think there's a lot of that going on.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:19.120
So actdeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Switch is $300 and for day one buyers

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.780
you'll get 30 NES classics for virtual console.

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.380
Honestly, that's the way for Nintendo to do it.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:29.340
Although I wouldn't do day one buyers, because you know they're not, that you know, you know

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.040
there's going to be stock problems.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.660
Don't make the stock problems worse.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:41.860
But maybe like, for the rest of 2017 or something, through holiday 2017, all those people are

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:44.340
going to get the classic games.

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.620
But vidpower in chat brings up another good point.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.600
The NES Classic Mini is also attractive due to its price point, right?

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.160
It's only 60 bucks.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.360
You know, the Switch is going to be like 250, $300.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.560
But again, I think at least if Nintendo, you know, can throw in some of their back catalog

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:05.280
to really sweeten the pot, Nintendo really needs to stop this shit of one to two virtual

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.280
console releases a week.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.600
I mean, they can continue to do that, but they need to launch their system.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:15.440
The Switch ought to fucking launch with 50 virtual console games in the pool.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.320
Even if they don't give them away, they ought to have like 50 games waiting to be picked

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320
up.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.000
Like, don't, and they did this on the Wii U, they waited way too fucking long on the

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.440
Wii U for this.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:31.860
Switch needs to do this day one virtual console and a lot of games and some free games to

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.600
sweeten the pot.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.480
And if that sells more hardware, then you know what?

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.360
Nintendo's going to win in the long run.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360
So.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360
Nintendo already wins.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360
In my heart.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:48.200
Tarsi XF in chat says, also appliance-like nature, instant play, no updates.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.460
Great point.

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:55.140
If this Switch is at home and connected to Wi-Fi, it should download the fucking updates

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.940
while it's sleeping and then update itself.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:02.100
I mean, the 3DS kind of does this, so we know Nintendo is capable.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.580
Except even with the 3DS, you have to wait.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.840
Like you have to acknowledge that the update's about to begin and you have to wait.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.180
And I'm assuming the reason they do this is because many people put their games right

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.780
in the middle of the game and then sleep their 3DS.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.180
And if it were to do a system upgrade while you're right in the middle of a game, you'd

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:19.880
lose your progress in that game.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.140
So I can kind of understand that, but I think the Switch should have something set up so

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:28.780
that if you're not in the middle of a game or you're on the main menu or something, that

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.100
it should update automatically.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.900
It should just do it.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.540
That would be very important.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.900
Dark Tetsuya says, I think the Wii U kind of does it too.

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.540
It does, but not with the software.

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:43.740
And I know this because I actually, I forgot to mention this earlier, I played Super Smash

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.780
Brothers on Wii U for the first time in months this week.

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:52.500
And we put in the disc, we were ready to play, and had to wait for it to update.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.940
Now granted, it didn't take very long for it to update, thank gosh, but it's no fun

01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.520
to sit there and wait for the fucking thing to update when you're ready to play.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.420
So yes, these things should do it while the device is asleep.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.420
I like that.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.420
Appliance-like nature.

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.420
That is important.

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.960
All right.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960
You know what?

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.960
We need to take a trip back.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.580
We need to go back to a time when it was simpler.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.700
And there was no updates.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.220
You got what you got with your system, and if you didn't like it, too bad.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:26.660
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.900
you need to play this game, or I hate you.

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:32.140
I hate everybody anyway, Rob.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.060
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.480
The game is Tapper.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.380
I figured it was appropriate for tonight, even though we have drunk no beer at all.

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.500
No, this is a great choice.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.500
I love this.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.500
This is one of my favorite classic games, like ever.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.500
I'm surprised I haven't done it either, but I'm getting to that point, you know?

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:51.180
I'm also very surprised that I recognize the name of this game when it's not Root Beer Tapper,

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.260
because all I ever played was Root Beer Tapper.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:56.540
I don't think I ever played just Tapper.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:03.380
Well, the difference with the two, I mean, Tapper came out in 1983 by Bally Midway, and

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:08.020
basically you play as a bartender, and you have to serve your patrons and collect the

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.700
empty mugs and your tips.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:16.340
Tapper was called Tapper because it was associated with Budweiser.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:25.300
When the Budweiser branding expired in 1984, they did Root Beer Tapper, and it was developed

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:32.220
specifically for arcades because the original version was considered advertising alcohol

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.220
to minors.

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.780
Yeah, I always thought that's why they did Root Beer Tapper in the first place.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.220
I never realized it was a licensed thing.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.780
I mean, I figured the licensing came into play later.

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:43.940
It was apparently a licensed thing, but they also did it so that it would be able to be

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:51.980
had in more arcades, or as Tapper was supposed to be more like four bars or adult-oriented

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:54.420
locations, you know?

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.060
Like titty bars.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:08.180
I guess, but it was, the patent for it was filed in 1984 covering the game and its variants.

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:15.780
Tapper was also ported to the Atari 8-bit machines, the Atari 5200, Atari 2600, BBC

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:24.740
Micro, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, and IBM PC and Amstrad CPC.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:32.820
Most of the home versions had a Mountain Dew logo, but had the bartender of the original

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:37.840
arcade game instead of the soda jerk from Root Beer Tapper.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:45.440
It had four different bars that you would play in, and so patrons would basically arrive

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.280
at the end of the bar and then want their drink, and then you have to serve their drink.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:56.000
They slide their mug back, and you refill the mug, and you go serve more booze, or root

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
booze.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Root beer.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Root beer!

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Did I say root booze?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Oh my god.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.680
So anyway, your goal is to push the customer completely off the screen, but if they are

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.840
not they will stay and drink their drink where they are.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.720
And so when the customer finishes the drink, he slides the mug back, and you keep going.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.440
So you basically have to keep taking care of all of your customers.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:29.360
You have different settings, you have the western bar with a couple of cowboys, and

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:34.920
you have a sports bar with athletes, a punk bar with punk rockers, and a space bar with

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:35.920
aliens.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.600
It's like, really.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.720
I think I've seen the alien level one time on the 360 version of this game.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.040
Well and of course the first version of the game was sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, so they

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:56.480
had the Budweiser logo in the back, and the machine was supposed to be sold to bars with

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.160
the cabinets that looked like bars.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:04.060
And actually, if for anyone who's ever watched John's Arcade, he has a tapper behind him

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:09.100
that has the classic side panel art that looks like the old school, or the old timey

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.100
bartender.

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:15.500
You know, like a saloon bartender.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:20.900
And they also, some of the machines were designed to look like bars with brass rail footrests

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.860
and drink holders.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:29.180
And the first machines had controllers that looked like Budweiser beer tap handles, and

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:35.740
then they were replaced by cheaper beer taps with the Budweiser logo on them.

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:46.260
The music, though, was created by Ricky Cardo, who was the sound designer, who also was supposed

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:53.740
to be a pretty talented musician, and he used a proprietary sound synthesizer that was developed

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:57.700
at Marvin Glass and Associates for all the sound effects and music, and it was called

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:06.460
the Synclavier 2 Sound Synthesizer, which was pretty much a professional synth that

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:10.500
contained a 16-bit computer and synthesizer keyboard in it.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:17.620
So it was pretty crazy, for its time, sound design that was with it.

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:26.300
And this one was, instead of creating the music by a molten code, it was actually recorded

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:31.180
on the keyboard first and then recorded directly into memory and burned directly into the ROM.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:42.620
So it had different versions of Oh Susanna and Buffalo Gals and The Can Can.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:46.700
So the music in that was fairly unique for its time.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:53.900
It had re-releases for the Midway Arcade Treasures for PlayStation 2, Xbox GameCube, and PC,

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.100
and Midway Arcade Origins for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:04.100
Rootbeard Tapper was released on Xbox Live Arcade for Xbox 360 in 2007 and has since

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.660
been delisted.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:10.660
And there's a modern interpretation for mobile devices called Tapper World Tour.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.180
They came out in 2011.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:19.220
And the style in the art was almost identical to an earlier game called Domino Man, and

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:22.500
then another game after that called Timber.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.500
And in fact-

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.500
I love Timber.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:32.700
The main character for Timber is a rework of the main character in Tapper.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:36.300
This whole era of Bally Midway Arcade games is some of my favorite stuff.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.300
Like for real.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.980
Like I love those Midway Treasure games that existed that have this and Timber and so like

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:44.860
Satan's Hollow and some of the other games that are like around the same time.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:45.860
Yeah.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:48.060
This is a great era of gaming.

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.940
This game was an inspiration for Plants vs. Zombies.

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:51.940
Get out, really?

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:52.940
Yeah.

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:56.980
To having to defend against a constantly approaching thing in all these lines.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.300
Wait, is Tapper the reason we have tower defense games?

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.340
Because if so, I'm a little upset.

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.340
I'm just kidding.

01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:04.540
Well, and Tapper was also featured in Wreck-It Ralph.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.540
Yeah.

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.980
But the world record for Tapper was set on December 5th, 2015 by Kelly Tharp of Louisville,

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:11.980
Kentucky.

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.380
Sorry, Louisville, Kentucky.

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.300
Apologize to Brad from Pod Culture.

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.300
Louisville.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:23.260
And it was set in Humboldt, Texas at Totally Amused.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:28.540
And it was a Twin Galaxies Golden Age Showdown event that this happened at.

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.100
And then, there you go.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:35.500
There is a clone by the way called Brewmaster that came out on the TRS-80 color computer.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.500
Cool.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.500
Now we're done.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.540
There it is, your classic game of the week, Tapper.

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.740
Or as I remember it, Root Beer Tapper.

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.220
But tonight, it's Tapper.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.780
Yeah, tonight it's Tapper.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.620
I would love to have a cabinet of this actually.

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:53.740
You know, I kind of got that whole like itch like, I want to get a cabinet in the house.

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:58.860
Like even though we totally don't have room for it, and Alan is going to judge me so harshly.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:02.100
But I'm thinking like, you know, if we were to arrange things a little bit and move like

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.580
this little thing on the cart here, I know this is great, we don't have video, but with

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:10.060
this thing on the cart here into the back room, I could put a cabinet right there.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:13.100
And you know, I want to baby pack my machine more than anything.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.300
Could have made that happen.

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:20.340
I know there was one here locally, and I almost pulled the trigger on it, but it just, it

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.300
just sometimes sometimes it's not right.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.780
I know you were trying to enable me so bad.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.780
I almost bought it.

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.260
Because I told you that we would buy it if you decided you never wanted it again.

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.260
I know.

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.620
But then I was like, giving you an outro.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:32.780
But money and responsibility.

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.900
Fuck money and responsibility.

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:38.220
The purpose of money is to spend it.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.340
But 401ks and saving and retirement and adulting.

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:44.340
It's really hard.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:47.380
I don't have stock options.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.300
I'm supposed to get stock options too?

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.780
I don't like crackers.

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:54.260
Alright, let's travel around the world and do some rapid fire news.

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.580
Again, we're gonna do kind of a shorter, just one segment show tonight.

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.220
I'm not used to this layout.

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.220
What?

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.140
The one, the one half show?

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:06.740
No, to Loki's thing and now it's gone.

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.740
What Loki's thing it's gone?

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:08.740
No.

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:09.740
What are you talking about over there?

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:10.740
You're skipping things.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:11.740
No I'm not.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.300
You're skipping to release dates.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300
I'm not doing release dates.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.300
I'm doing rapid fire news.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.300
Oh, whatever.

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.300
Can you read Dark Sagra?

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.300
No!

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.300
Hey!

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:23.140
Let's talk about Final Fantasy XV's latest patch.

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.140
No.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:29.300
Yes, the 1.03 patch hit this past week which adds New Game Plus to the game.

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.300
Why?

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.300
I don't know.

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.300
New Game Plus.

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:35.580
You can go through and play it again at the level you left off at if that's what you want

01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.580
to do.

01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:39.900
I guess it would make it easier for you to hit level 99 if that's, you know, what you

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:40.900
want to do.

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:47.300
Anyway, it's a 3.2 gigabyte update and contains that as well as the holiday pack which I did

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:52.360
also actually buy this week while I got the season pass so that you got the holiday plus

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.380
and those are some really helpful items that you get with that to gain AP.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:59.800
So it is a little shitty that it's in a pack that's for sale, although I think one of the

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.900
items is in the free pack so there's something in that.

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:07.800
So anyway, let's see.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:18.840
So the other stuff that's in this patch, outfits, more photo borders and more photos, the ascension

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.920
grid is all unlocked and all that, oh that's, I'm sorry, that's in New Game Plus.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.800
But you get all these little updates in the patch that came out this week.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:32.700
Also, more information on Final Fantasy's 30 year celebration.

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.880
It will be kicking off on January 31st.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.360
That is Final Fantasy VII's 20th anniversary.

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:44.200
We may already know the plans for that if we are to believe rumors and things that was

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:49.360
talked about a couple weeks ago here on the show, but we'll get the official unveil of

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.920
the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary plans on January 31st.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.120
That's not too far away.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.760
Anyway, they'll be holding this unveil at Toho Cinemas in Tokyo.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:04.500
They'll be guests and multiple talks and a raffle is being held for 200 Square Enix members

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.840
to attend.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:11.260
So if you are in Japan and you want to go, nearby Tokyo, where this is being held, you

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.260
should check that out.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:15.260
Dar Sakura, how about you for rapid fire news?

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.260
Stuff.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:20.860
Well, H2 Interactive is bringing out a new Kunio game.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:28.060
We're getting River City Melee Battle Royal Special, which in Japan was downtown Rantou-kyo-

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:34.820
I'm gonna mispronounce this- Kyoushin Kyoku Kachinuki Kakuto SP.

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.820
I can't read.

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.260
Actually, I can't.

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.260
I'm blurry.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:46.860
Anyway, so they are- it's actually being localized by the developers for BlazBlue, so we're gonna

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.420
see a fun little game come out.

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:57.780
And in Japan, it's out actually probably today now, December 26th, as it likely is in Japan.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.620
And hopefully we'll be getting it out soon, over here in the US.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:06.540
Because if there's a game series my hub's like, it's the Kunio games.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:09.740
And Otada Hikaru, yay!

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.300
Will be working on some Kingdom Hearts 3 music.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.300
Waaaaay!

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.540
That's exciting.

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:20.460
So that means that we will have her for Kingdom Hearts 3, because apparently Square can count

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.180
to three and beyond.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:28.820
Well, nothing's confirmed until, you know, we get a game on the shelf.

01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:29.820
Yes.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.820
Anyway.

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:35.980
VidPower in our chat over at live.vognetware.com, speaking on the Kunio game, saying Kunio games

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.780
are so underappreciated.

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.780
I agree with that.

01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:44.500
I think it'll be nice to have a modern Kunio game that still has that retro flair.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:45.500
Excited about that.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.580
Now let's travel around the world.

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:50.180
I guess for some reason, it's probably because of liquor, I said travel around the world

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.660
with rapid fire news, and that's what confused people.

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:57.580
So now that we've traveled around the world once, let's do it again and talk about release

01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:58.580
dates.

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:00.580
Are you able to do the US ones, StarSagra?

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:02.540
I don't see jack shit coming out.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.380
Yeah, probably this week.

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:05.780
There probably isn't a lot coming out.

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:09.980
I kind of feel like this is going to be the theme this week, is, you know, there's, you

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.540
know, we just had a major holiday, so I don't think there's a lot coming out.

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.420
Let's look at Japan, though.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:22.220
Japan, no, there's some cables and peripherals that are out, but I don't see any games that

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.660
are actually releasing this week.

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.460
Checking the DS just to be sure.

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:32.700
No, there's some new, like, peripherals and bags and cords and things like that, but as

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:37.200
far as games go, it's also dry in Japan this week.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:41.060
And honestly, for the next couple weeks into January, probably going to be the same thing.

01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.500
We have one in Europe.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.500
One game in Europe.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:48.580
December 31st, Dovetail Gamers Eurofishing for Xbox One.

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:49.580
So nothing exciting.

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.980
Well, hooray for you fishing game fans out there.

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:52.980
Oh, good.

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:53.980
Feesh!

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.420
My least favorite thing to do in Final Fantasy XV.

01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:01.580
The reason why I won't Platinum XV, because it's going to make me fucking fish.

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.900
All right, how about the mailbag then?

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.580
Fuck me, there's a bunch in here.

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:06.900
Yeah, we got a lot of emails this week.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:09.860
Well, I begged people to email us last week, and I think it happened this week.

01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.220
Well, why did you do a dumb thing like that?

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:16.900
Because I love you.

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.620
Every week you email us, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:25.700
DarkSakura very happily and appreciatively dives in the mailbag and reads her favorite

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.620
emails here on the show.

01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.620
One from Fifth Dream.

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:31.100
I exist or something.

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.100
Oh, yes.

01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:36.020
Do you remember last week I said people should email us and just tell us they exist?

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.300
So you probably have a lot of those emails tonight.

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:40.820
Thank you for existing, Fifth Dream.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:41.820
We appreciate you.

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.900
Next question comes from Jose.

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.740
Merry Christmas, OLR, or whatever holiday you celebrate.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.540
I am glad DarkSakura is feeling well.

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:53.820
My question this week is, do you think free-to-play freemium games need to end quick?

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:59.380
And do you think those types of games are bittering the perspective on mobile gaming

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.380
in general?

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.740
Thanks again for being awesome, guys.

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.340
Keep on working on your game, Loki.

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.860
I'll try to write soon if I'm not busy with the holidays.

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:06.860
Take care.

01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.860
Signed, Jose.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.620
Um, complicated question.

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:11.980
I don't think these games are going anywhere.

01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:15.500
They're, you know, free is too good of a deal to pass up.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:20.020
And I think it's really weaved itself into the mobile marketplace for better or for worse.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:24.620
And there's going to be free games that are engrossing for a very long time for some people.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:29.060
Some people like to play like what I caught Alan playing Bejeweled Stars or whatever that

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.060
is that's out.

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.060
I caught him playing that.

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.940
I know DarkSakura plays some of these games.

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.820
I play Ingress and Pokemon Go.

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:38.140
Those are free-to-play games, essentially.

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.900
So I think there is a marketplace for them.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:44.460
I mean, I've played a lot of those games that I just named, Ingress and Pokemon Go, and

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:48.580
those are just two of several mobile games I've tried over the years that were free-to-play

01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:51.940
that weren't necessarily bad.

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.660
Did it skew things too much on the mobile platform?

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.660
Maybe.

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:58.420
Especially when we talk about something like Super Mario Run.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.500
But it's part of the reason why I said, you know what, Super Mario Run, they should have

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.780
just charged $10 in the store.

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.620
I understand why they didn't do that.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.780
They wouldn't be able to brag about 40 million downloads or whatever they're saying this

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:12.620
week if they hadn't set that price as free in the store.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:18.540
But I think it sets some people's expectations in a weird place.

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.320
And I kind of think they should have just charged $10 out the gate.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.820
But I don't think free-to-play games is going to go anywhere, and I don't think free-to-play

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.180
means necessarily bad.

01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:31.060
It just depends on how much are you going to nickel and dime your audience.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.060
You know, a game...

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:33.060
Go ahead.

01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:36.700
The crap thing about it, though, is that it prevents people who have a family sharing

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:40.620
plan to use said family sharing.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:42.820
Yeah.

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.880
And I know that's kind of a thing about Super Mario Run as well.

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:52.260
But a game like Ingress, for example, you can play very well and very thoroughly without

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.980
ever spending a dime.

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:54.980
You know what I mean?

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.980
I don't think I did.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:58.500
You don't think you ever did spend a dime, or you don't think you played well?

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.500
It was funny.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.500
Come on.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.500
It was funny.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.500
Drop the phone.

01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.940
I'm trying to catch this Nidoran.

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.100
Oh, there's always a million Nidorans here.

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.660
But I need a couple more to get a Nidoqueen.

01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:14.140
I think our Pikachu spawns here got replaced with stupid Nidorans, so that's all I ever

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.140
see here at the house anymore.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.140
I don't mind right now.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:18.820
Alright, well, but we gotta get to the next email, so...

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.820
We'll find...

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820
Put your balls down, DarkSaka.

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.820
I'll read the next email.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:22.820
I just fed you my balls.

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.820
Oh, sorry.

01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.820
Wrong balls.

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.420
Anyway, the next email comes from Robert M.

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:38.300
Felizan Cristinacón, sorry, and it is Esperanto, so thank you, because I had asked for some

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.300
Esperanto.

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:42.340
Oh, look at you with your Esperanto.

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.220
Just wondering about a prominent iOS app.

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:50.220
Super Mario Run has its unlock through an in-app purchase, but I can't find a restore

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.740
purchases button.

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:56.580
If heavens forbid my iPod were to be reformatted again, or I want to download my game on iPad

01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:03.380
or iPhone on my Apple ID, would I need to have set up a My Nintendo account specifically

01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.380
for the unlock?

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:08.540
I haven't really contacted any developer or forum about this yet.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:13.100
I'm generally enjoying the game, but more Wi-Fi time is going to other apps, admittedly,

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:20.200
Robert M. I will tell you that Hubby tried to...

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:27.600
He did link his My Nintendo account to it, and as it turned out, it did have a restore

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:35.680
purchase on there, but I don't think it restored his progress.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680
It's just the purchase.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.400
Yeah, just the purchase.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:43.320
You have to have the Nintendo account linked, and by the way, it tells you that in the very

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320
beginning.

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:47.540
You might have clicked through it, as a lot of people do in the very opening screens,

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:52.020
but I did think that was curious, that it actually said, if you want to be able to restore

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.840
your purchase later, you need to have this on a My Nintendo account.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.540
They did the same thing with Miitomo, actually.

01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:02.560
So now my question is, and I don't know the answer to this, I'm sorry, can Robert M. was

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:03.560
the emailer, right?

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.560
Yeah.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.560
Can Robert M. do this after the fact?

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.740
Now that he's bought the game, can he now assign a My Nintendo to it?

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:12.720
Will it work, or now is he screwed because he bought the game without that association?

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.700
That I don't know, sir, I'm sorry to say.

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:22.600
So I would try associating it with a My Nintendo account at this point, just to save yourself

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.780
if something does happen to your phone.

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.880
Let's hope not.

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:31.260
But hopefully, cross fingers, knock on wood, by the time your phone breaks, you won't care

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:35.980
if you lose the game, hopefully.

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:36.980
That's it.

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:37.980
Okay.

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.180
Hey gang, first a song, and there's a link.

01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:42.140
It's Loss of Me from Final Fantasy IX.

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.860
We're not going to play it, sorry.

01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:49.120
In the hype surrounding Final Fantasy XV, you guys compared it to other mainline Final

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.120
Fantasy titles.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.660
I mentioned all of them, except for one of the titles I hold most dear, Final Fantasy

01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:58.820
IX, which for me is my second place game in the series, the first being X.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:04.060
It is an amazing game, not only for the music and battles, but for the story the game tells,

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.500
and the antagonists that conspire against you.

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:13.100
No, really, I've never been more upset at a villain in any other game, in any game than

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:17.140
the horrific acts committed by Kuja and those that follow him.

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:21.740
The story does a crazy good job building up hope and affection toward the characters of

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.980
the world before you watch their tales quickly become tragic.

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:29.340
It's not all doom and gloom as you watch the main cast come into their roles quite nicely.

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:33.060
Even Steiner, who I couldn't stand at the start of the game, really grew on me.

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.060
Thoughts?

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:35.180
Sincerely, Osfer.

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.460
I appreciate Final Fantasy IX.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:42.960
I wouldn't say I love it the way I love IV and VI and some of the other games.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.080
But again, and I even said this last week, the only Final Fantasy game I can't play and

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.040
I don't like playing is VIII, and I know that's a controversial statement and some of you

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.800
hate me for it, but sit on that and deal with it for a minute, because I just cannot stand

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.320
that junction system and the draw and all that stuff.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.500
Otherwise, the story in VIII is even fine.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.240
I'll watch somebody else play VIII maybe.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.240
There's a PS.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.240
Oh, what's that?

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.240
Rob, please finish Undertale.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.320
I really want to hear your thoughts on the game.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.320
Frown.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.320
I'll do my...

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.480
There's so many games to play, so many.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.480
I contributed.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:14.480
So many.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.480
Yeah, I know you did.

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.920
But anyway, as far as Final Fantasy IX goes, it's a good game.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:23.440
And you know why IX was important is because people were a little turned off by the sci-fi-ness

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.720
of VII and even VIII a little bit.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.200
So IX, I remember when it came out, was kind of like a return to form for Final Fantasy.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.360
Like you had a black mage who looked like the black mage from Final Fantasy I, right?

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.820
That was a big thing in Final Fantasy IX.

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:38.720
So I would actually love to see, and I think I even tweeted something about this, I would

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:45.000
love to see that Final Fantasy XVI is something like Final Fantasy IX in XV's engine.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I would love that.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
But we'll see.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.240
I'm not going to hold my breath.

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.400
Here's the other thing, though, I wanted to say to Osfer, the emailer.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:56.640
I would be curious, how old were you when Final Fantasy IX came out?

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.040
You know why?

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.580
Because I think it was Bobby who said this, and I don't know if he stole it from somewhere

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.800
else or if he came up with it on his own.

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:08.100
But he once said that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that came out when

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:09.940
you were 12.

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:14.180
And so I'm wondering if Final Fantasy IX came out, because I know Osfer is a little younger

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:21.460
than me, who was 12 when Final Fantasy II and III America, IV and VI for everybody else,

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:22.540
came out.

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:28.740
Because that's, I was 12 when Final Fantasy II, IV, whatever you want to call it, when

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.900
that game came out, and that's probably why it's one of my favorites.

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.340
I remember having such an emotional connection to that game.

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:40.820
I think that for me, it was the first U.S. Final Fantasy, but it's not my favorite.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:42.220
Well, it's not your favorite.

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.220
It's not my favorite.

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:45.180
I love the Japanese III a lot.

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:51.660
I love V, but VI was the one, actually, I really have a hard time comparing them because

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:54.180
each of them are their own contained stories.

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:58.500
And it's hard for me to like one more than the other, but I did sink more time into VI.

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:03.080
So well, and some of the chatters are saying it's not exactly right.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:06.400
And I'll also say that I like Chrono Trigger better than the whole series.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.400
Which would be wrong.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400
I'm just kidding.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.400
But here's the thing.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.800
Even if it's not exactly 12, it's around 12.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:14.800
You know what I mean?

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.760
You still picked one of the earlier games, you know what I mean?

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.280
So I was in high school.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:24.520
Anyway, anyway, this is, I would just be curious, was Osfer 12 years old when Final Fantasy IX

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.520
came out?

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.520
Well, you didn't say so.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.520
How old is Osfer?

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.160
I don't even know if I know off the top of my head, but I pretended to have the flu for

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.480
a whole week so I could play it.

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.720
I think Osfer is in his mid to low 20s.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.960
So I'm trying to do the math in my head.

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:36.960
That'd be about the...

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:37.960
So next email.

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:38.960
Oh yeah.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:39.960
Next email.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:44.200
Comes from Claire and it's just smile, hugs, smile.

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:47.440
And a picture of a dragon with an ornament, a star on top.

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.800
Oh, I saw that picture in the email.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.040
Now my question is, did the emailer draw that?

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.040
I don't know.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.240
But if he did, nice talent.

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:54.240
Yeah.

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.920
If you drew that and you were just emailing it to us to show off, then kudos to you.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.920
You're a good artist.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:35:59.920
All right.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.880
If you drew that from DeviantArt, then all right.

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.880
That's cool.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:03.880
Thanks for the wishes.

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.880
If nothing else.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:05.880
Hello Sky, Dark Sakura and Loki.

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:06.880
Hi.

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.880
Merry Christmas.

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:08.880
Happy Hanukkah.

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.520
All of the season's greetings.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.640
Martin the Belgian here.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.480
I love that you're Martin the Belgian.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.020
Thanks so much for doing a show on Christmas.

01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:21.280
This will give me something to listen to while recovering from my food coma tomorrow and

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:26.360
spending the holidays playing games and trying to resist the sales on Steam and GOG.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.320
I am trying not to buy games I will never play, but it is hard.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:35.360
I am home in Belgium for the holidays, the home of wonderful chocolate and stroopwafels.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.960
A long time ago, I promised to send you some Belgian chocolate, but you never sent me an

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.760
address I can send it to.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.480
Being home now, I am stocking up, so I would love to thank you for the wonderful show you

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.320
do each week with some chocolate.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.640
If you send me address, I will.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.880
Hope you're all enjoying a nice break with some great games.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.400
Hugs from Belgium, Martin.

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.900
I will send you my address right now.

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:55.900
I'm happy to do that.

01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:02.220
I'm happy to do that, however, if I remember right, he relocated to Atlanta.

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.940
If I remember an early email, I'll correct.

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:10.400
As a reminder, I will be in Atlanta again in 2017 over Labor Day weekend for Dragon

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.220
Con 2017.

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:18.540
I would like to enjoy these fine chocolates in person while I'm drinking stroopwafel,

01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.180
which by the way, this is fucking happening at Dragon Con.

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:22.180
But I want some too.

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:23.820
Brad from Pod Culture, are you listening?

01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.860
Then you need to fucking come to Dragon Con.

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.900
Bitch, I don't have money.

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:29.900
You got money for stroopwafel.

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.460
They were a dollar.

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:35.460
Put the stroopwafel money away every week until Labor Day and then you can do.

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.420
I also can't get off work.

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:38.660
Stroopwafel.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:39.660
Brad from Pod Culture.

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:40.660
Send me my address.

01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:42.860
Stroopwafel, the new official drink at Dragon Con.

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.940
Although, I don't know, Brad from Pod Culture is a big fan of Fireball.

01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:46.940
Maybe we can mix them.

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:51.540
Do you think stroopball, stroop, stroop, stroopball, fire, fire, firewaffle?

01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:52.980
I don't like Fireball.

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.980
I like Fireball.

01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:54.980
Firewaffle.

01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:56.980
I'm sitting in my address right now.

01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:57.980
Okay.

01:37:57.980 --> 01:37:58.980
All right.

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:00.980
Is that it for emails?

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.980
I think.

01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:03.980
I'm just sitting in my address right now.

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:04.980
You can't.

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:05.980
Make up some time.

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:06.980
Talk about stroopwafel some more.

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:07.980
I don't know.

01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:08.980
I don't have time.

01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:09.980
All right.

01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:11.980
Going to our chat over at live.fucknetwork.com.

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:13.980
Brad from Pod Culture says cinnamon and waffles.

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:17.980
See, it sounds pretty good, doesn't it, when I mention it like that?

01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:20.980
Some folks talking about age and Final Fantasy.

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:25.340
RageNator in chat says, I got Final Fantasy one on the NES when it first came out and

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.900
I was 13 at the time.

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:27.900
Not my favorite.

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.460
Seven, I got day one and loved it.

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.300
I was 20 when seven came out.

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.300
Okay.

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.500
Everybody wants to break the fucking theory.

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.500
All right.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.500
Fine.

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:40.360
The theory does not, like most theories, it doesn't hold true 100% of the time.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.380
So I don't know what to tell you.

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.380
All right.

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:44.380
Anyway.

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.380
Let's see.

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.380
Other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:48.780
Um.

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.780
That was the last email, by the way.

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:54.380
Robis's Final Fantasy nine was a complete throwback to Final Fantasy one.

01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:55.380
Yeah.

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.380
That's probably why it was popular.

01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:00.340
And then everybody's complaining that the stream died, which it does look like we had

01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:05.420
a little server hiccup, uh, which another Christmas thing out of my control.

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:08.000
What can I do?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
You know what, Rob?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
What?

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.820
An important thing happened ages ago.

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:12.820
What's that?

01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:17.660
The person who was born that would change the world for the better.

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660
Freddie Mercury?

01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:19.660
Isaac Newton.

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:20.660
Oh, okay.

01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:27.580
I had to quote Neil deGrasse Tyson on this day.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.860
Long ago, a child was born who by age 30 would transform the world.

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:34.580
Happy birthday, Isaac Newton, born December 25th, 1642.

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:35.580
No.

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.580
You know what?

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.580
You know what?

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:41.620
That whole gravity thing, that kind of the gravity sucks sometimes just want you to know.

01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:46.840
Gravity is what gives plastic surgeons a job.

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:51.180
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com.

01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:54.340
Use the passphrase arrow.

01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.440
That's it for the mailbag.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:58.200
We are going to take calls here in just a moment.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.740
We're going to open up the holiday Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:08.540
So get ready, but hold your calls for just a moment because we've got two more stories

01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:09.540
for you.

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:13.100
Our girls in the eighties.

01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:14.100
Darsyra?

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:15.100
Fake plastic trees are stuck in my head.

01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:16.100
Oh yeah.

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.100
Yeah.

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:18.100
That's a good song.

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:19.100
Pokemon go.

01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.100
It's doing some shit.

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:23.740
Um, it's a fun little holiday adventure.

01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:26.780
Did you hack your pokey stop and get your incubator for the day?

01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:27.780
No.

01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.260
That, that's a thing.

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:31.940
If you hack a pokey stop now you get an incubator.

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.180
I did hack it, but I didn't get an incubator.

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.380
Did you do it this today?

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.380
Yeah.

01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:37.380
25th.

01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:38.500
Well then you need to write, you probably got one.

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:41.660
I used to realize it after I already bought one.

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:42.660
Oops.

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:47.340
Um, anyway, um, it'll be a lot easier to get the gen two Pokemon and the Kanto starters.

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:53.220
Um, so for the morning of December 25th to January 3rd, pokey stops will award one single

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:54.220
use incubator.

01:40:54.220 --> 01:41:01.540
Like you said, um, each day after your first photo disc spin, photo disc spin.

01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:06.300
Does that mean maybe it doesn't work through the Pogo plus maybe you have to actually have

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:07.300
the app open.

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:08.300
Oh yeah.

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:10.420
Well, I, I'm only using the app anyway.

01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:15.540
Um, and there's also a higher chance of earning eggs that will hatch into the new gold and

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:18.500
silver babies like Pichu and Togepi.

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:22.700
And uh, of course you get the Santa, uh, Pikachu and I caught a Santa Raichu.

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:23.700
Congrats.

01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:26.180
Yeah, I heard the Santa Raichu's are out there in the wild too.

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:30.660
Um, and then from the afternoon of December 30th through the afternoon of January 8th,

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:36.300
lure modules will last a full hour, which is twice as long as normal and the Kanto region

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:39.620
uh, starters and their evolved forms will be made more common.

01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:46.140
Adding Charizard, Blastoise and Venusaur, um, should be a lot easier.

01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:47.340
When does the second half of that start?

01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:48.340
The 28th you said?

01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:49.340
Or now?

01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:51.100
December 30th through January 8th.

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:52.500
So we still got some time.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.900
I'm going to get a Venusaur.

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:56.460
Yeah, I know.

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460
I need those starters.

01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:58.460
That's a great event.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.780
I'm going to get a Charizard.

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:04.540
Even though those incubators are single use only, it's, it really needed it.

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:08.140
The game really needed them with the way they're rolling out these new Pokemon.

01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.580
So I think that was a great little incentive for people.

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:11.580
So good job.

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:12.580
Yes.

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.580
Yes.

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:16.900
Um, can I, we go get more.

01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.900
There's still some of the bottle.

01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.780
Uh, the other thing I want to ask you about the dark soccer, did you know the app for

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:23.660
Apple watch came out a couple of days ago?

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:24.660
Yes, I did.

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:28.080
And I kept hearing that it wasn't going to work on the first gen watches and I couldn't

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.100
get it to run really.

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:34.340
And then, um, I don't know what happened, but I got a notification and suddenly it was

01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:35.340
working.

01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:36.580
Oh, well that's good.

01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:37.580
Right?

01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:38.580
Yeah.

01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:41.740
But there's some people with the first gen Apple watches that's just not working for.

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:47.000
And so, um, I just been, you know, trying to leave feedback and whatnot to see, but

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.340
it finally came through on mine, but it wasn't working fully properly.

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:55.020
I like that it's more of an exercise tracker and you'll get the egg credit at least if

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.020
nothing else.

01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.020
That's the best part about the plus.

01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:58.020
Yeah.

01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.140
But the big, the big bad thing though is that it will drain both batteries.

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:07.460
So I only have it on when I know I'm going to be doing some walking.

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:10.580
And usually if I've got the walking, I've got the app open on my phone anyway.

01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:11.580
So yeah.

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.940
Well, it's the same thing with the plus, you still have to have the app running on your

01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:17.540
phone and it will drain your phone a little bit, but not nearly as bad as like running

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.540
the entire app.

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.540
Yeah.

01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:20.540
So there is that anyway.

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:21.540
Uh, all right.

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:25.980
Well, speaking of Pokemon, I have one more story for you guys that has to do with Pokemon.

01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:33.140
Uh, it has to do with, uh, a ROM hack that got shut down by Nintendo, the Grinches that

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.140
stole Christmas.

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.140
Uh, that's right.

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:37.820
There was a fan made Pokemon ROM hack in the work.

01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.620
It has been in the works for eight years.

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:45.380
It was called Pokemon prism and it was being made off of Pokemon gold.

01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:49.020
So it was a ROM hack to do an entirely new adventure.

01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:55.520
And apparently though, uh, a, uh, Nintendo, uh, law firm in Australia, uh, because I guess

01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.560
that's where this was being hosted or whatever, sent the cease and desist and the guy put

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:07.560
the letter up on Google drive and said that basically Nintendo is shutting this down as

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:13.280
they did with Metroid to return of Samus as they did with other Nintendo fan, Pokemon

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.400
uranium and all this stuff this year.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.080
So a yep.

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.440
No news if this will ever come out.

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:25.840
I don't know if he's going to turn to the dark side or what have you of, um, uh, Torrance

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.520
and all that to get that out there.

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.400
But, uh, for right now it doesn't sound like this is ever going to come out.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.580
So that's sad.

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.600
At least the guy made the game for himself.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:37.600
Nothing else.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.600
Hmm.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.600
Yeah.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:44.640
Tiger call and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm sure downloads of this are out in

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.640
the wild.

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.640
Yes.

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.720
Uh, I'm sure that is a very true.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.600
And once it's on the internet, always on the internet.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.960
You know how that goes.

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:56.200
Speaking of on the internet, it's time for you guys to give us a call.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.960
If you'd like orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.000
I know it's a little early tonight, but we are doing a little bit of a shorter show.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.760
So that way, uh, dark soccer and myself can enjoy what we thought would be Chinese food

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.620
on Christmas, but it turns out it's going to be sushi on Christmas because the sushi

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.840
joint nearby last night too.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:14.840
That was funny.

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.440
Oh, do you want to try to find something else we can do?

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.440
We could do that.

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.160
Oh, the Korean barbecue open.

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.160
Oh, the big one.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.160
Not Oz.

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:27.200
There's the YD Tofu house and another Tofu house down the, down the way, but we can do,

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.200
we can do either.

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:29.200
I'm fine with it.

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.200
We'll see.

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.200
We'll see.

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:32.200
All right.

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.200
Our phone lines are lighting up at orange lounge radio on Skype.

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.200
So let's get to it.

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.200
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.200
Who's this?

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.200
Hey everyone.

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.200
It's Rama.

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:39.200
Hey Rama.

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.200
How you doing?

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.200
Pretty good.

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:42.200
If it makes you feel any better, I'm eating Chinese food here.

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:43.200
I'll eat on your behalf.

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.200
Thank you.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.200
I appreciate that.

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.200
We'll drink on your behalf.

01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.200
Well, that's okay.

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:49.640
I have a nice can of beer right here too.

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.640
You know what you don't have?

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640
What?

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640
Stroopwafel.

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:59.400
Well, you know, but you know what I will have in two weeks?

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.400
Me.

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:01.400
Stroopwafel.

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:04.800
I think Skye's a little bit better than Stroopwafel.

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:05.800
Oh, that's right.

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.520
I keep forgetting that you're actually going to Stroopwafel with you.

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520
I know, right?

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.320
I keep forgetting that you're actually going to Magfest this year.

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320
I'm so excited.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320
So we get to hang.

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.320
Hang, drink.

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.640
What's the difference?

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.640
I know.

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.640
I'm excited.

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.520
We're going to have a good time.

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:21.520
That makes two of us.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:25.840
I'm still putting together my list of cosplays I'm going to do.

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.240
Any hints for us?

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:31.120
Well, I will say this much.

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:37.040
One of the characters I am cosplaying from is a character from a fighting game that was

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:40.480
covered by Dark Sakura.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480
What?

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480
All right.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480
All right.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.280
A little show trivia with that.

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.280
I like that.

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280
Mm-hmm.

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.360
All right.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:49.360
So what's on your mind tonight?

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.360
What did you call us for?

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.480
Did you just call to talk about Magfest or something else on your mind?

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480
That too.

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.080
And also I just spent the last six hours putting together my Christmas gift.

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:01.000
I rebuilt and redid my entire computer.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Wow.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Okay.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Yeah.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I saw you doing some of this stuff on Facebook.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Yeah.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.440
I was doing a live stream because I couldn't get it to work on Twitch and I was like, you

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.440
know what?

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:11.840
I'm just going to do the stream and do this.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.200
You know, I got it up and running finally.

01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.920
So everything is working great.

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:16.920
Congratulations.

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:17.920
Thank you.

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920
Thank you.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:19.920
What are you going to do with this new computer?

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.720
Is it something for like more streaming stuff?

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:25.680
Like, I know you guys took over the feed yesterday and we're doing the holiday music, which thanks

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.680
for that.

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:27.680
Got a lot of love on Facebook.

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:34.080
Are you going to do more things like that or no, this is just a game.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.720
The funny thing is everyone asks me games and stuff like that, but no.

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:39.720
Multimedia.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:45.600
I just rebuilt my machine so that I can do better audio podcasting and video editing

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:52.920
and get stuff up onto our sites and then play some games because steam took 21 bucks from

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.400
me the other day.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:56.800
I know how that goes.

01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.800
Yes.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:03.160
But also I think when you talk about the whole like more oomph in video editing and audio

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:07.600
editing, like that was actually a big incentive in updating my own computer is that when the

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.120
show's done here on the studio computer, I usually I'll drop the files in Dropbox,

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:16.720
which is harder now that Dropbox doesn't support XP, but I just do it through the website.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.640
And then I take them to my other computer and you know, cause editing three hours of

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.640
MP3s, those can, I mean, and you know this from anime jam session, those files can get

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.560
pretty big, so they can be really slow to convert and save sometimes.

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:35.400
But on the newer computer I have blazing fast, exactly.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:40.400
Maybe like seven minutes to convert the whole show, which is fast for like a three hour

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.400
show.

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.400
That's fast.

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.920
Well, let's see our drunken podcast show, which was a little bit over two hours.

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.800
I re edited and rendered it in under two minutes.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800
Nice.

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.800
Wow.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.800
That's really good.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.480
Keep in mind, I save in multiple formats and I think that's part of the reason why it takes

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.080
me a little longer.

01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.400
Probably so better safe than sorry.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.400
Yeah.

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.920
I save one for VOG and I save one for the podcast feed cause I figure, uh, it's, it's

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:11.520
a lot of space on some of these iPhone cause one episode of OLR is like what, 80 megabytes

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:13.640
I think podcast sized.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:16.440
So maybe less, maybe less, maybe it's like 60.

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.760
I don't remember now.

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.440
Um, but it's like a hundred megs on VOG so, but now everybody streams them like I shouldn't

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.480
have to worry about that anymore cause everybody streams it now.

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.520
That's the big thing people do.

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:29.120
So I only do one.

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:36.280
I do the save for VOG upload and did I just go back and just drop in edit for RSS feed

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.480
and call it a day?

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480
You know?

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:44.200
I think a lot of our shows do that, but it's one of those things where the particular quality

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.920
of OLR I kind of set a long time ago before they were even VOG, before there was even

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:49.920
all games.

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.680
So it's kind of one of those I've just never really deviated from that.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:56.720
Not to say I never will, but I haven't been convinced otherwise by anybody.

01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.600
None of the listeners have complained about the quality or the file size of the format

01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.600
of the show.

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.560
So par for the course for now.

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.560
Sounds like a plan.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.560
Yep.

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:08.560
All right.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.560
Anything else on your mind, my friend?

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.560
Oh yeah.

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.240
I was trying to call it about last week about MAGFest, you were complaining about food places

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.240
and stuff.

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.240
Yeah.

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.920
Um, did you hear the news?

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.920
No.

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.600
There's a casino right up the street.

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.600
Really?

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.400
They built a casino out there now?

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:26.400
Yes.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.280
It opened up about a week and a half ago.

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.280
Oh shoot.

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.920
So there's probably a ton of food options in there, huh?

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:35.160
An MGM Grand Casino.

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.160
Holy crap.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.160
That's going to be a pretty big deal.

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:38.160
Well, that's great.

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:42.480
So they'll have food options and that'll, I hope they're ready for all those people.

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:43.800
I hope so too.

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:44.800
Yeah.

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.640
It would still be great if they could just get oodles and oodles of food trucks come

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:48.640
out there.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.600
And especially if it's not going to be like horrific snow and all this stuff, it's going

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:52.780
to be 50 degrees out there.

01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.780
That sounds awesome.

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:55.840
I'm very, very happy to hear that.

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.240
Hopefully the weather stays the same, knock on wood.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:03.640
So I was saying yesterday, this time last year, yesterday, it was 66 degrees and I'm

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:04.640
walking around.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.640
It's like 52.

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:06.640
Hmm.

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.840
Well, that's, I mean, again, that's warmer than it is in California right now.

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:14.000
So uh, I'll take it by all means.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
You can have it.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
All right.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.640
It snowed in SoCal today, if you can believe it.

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:23.480
Granted on the grapevine where it's a higher elevation, but still you don't hear about

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480
that every day.

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.480
Anyway.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.520
There you go.

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.520
To get more calls.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.520
All right.

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.520
Take care.

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:30.520
Take care of my friends.

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:31.520
See you in a couple of weeks.

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.520
You got it.

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.520
Bye.

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.520
Bye Ron.

01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:35.520
Jon and Stroopwafel.

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.520
Stroopwafel.

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:37.520
You know what?

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.640
The Stroopwafel people need to pay us in Stroopwafel.

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:42.000
Well, at least the Stroopwafel booze.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.480
I mean, I like the actual waffles though.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.720
It's like free advertising for them left and right today.

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:46.720
Just like Pinkberry.

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.720
How come we never got free Pinkberry out of this show?

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.720
Pinkberry.

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:50.720
Do it.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:51.720
Hi.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:52.720
You're on Orange Dots Radio.

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:53.720
Who's this?

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:54.720
Hi.

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:56.960
Not a whole lot.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:09.160
Well, since this is the last show of the year, I kind of figure, I ask the two of you, what

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.160
is your favorite game that you got this year?

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.480
It doesn't necessarily have to come out this year so long as you buy it this year and play

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.480
it this year.

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:24.520
Oh, Ray Jeter, you might be dipping into a topic if we do do a show in the next week.

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:28.320
This is something that would be a prime topic for that show would be what is the game of

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:35.440
the year, but taking Ray Jeter's little twist on it, what is the best game that you got

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.080
this year?

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.760
Do you think you have an answer for that?

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:39.760
Dark Soccer.

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.840
What's the best game that you got this year?

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:47.120
Well, I haven't played them yet because then it doesn't count.

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.120
No.

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:52.320
I actually really liked the new wow expansion and I'm still playing it.

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:53.320
Okay.

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:55.640
I got it for myself, so I got it for me.

01:52:55.640 --> 01:53:01.200
And I've been playing Danganronpa and Danganronpa 2, which I just started this year, so both

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.200
of them are great.

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.200
All of them are great.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:07.680
I don't think I've played anything that sucks balls this year.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:12.440
Don't confuse this with my game of the year, but I would actually probably answer Final

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:18.480
Fantasy 15 just because you guys know what crazy gamer ADD I have and the fact that I

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:22.960
actually played that game start to finish, I think says a lot and that was a game I knew

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:25.160
I was going to buy and bought.

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:29.600
And so, yeah, I think to answer your question the way you asked it, I think I would say

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:30.600
Final Fantasy 15.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:31.600
Oh, cool.

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.600
What about you?

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:40.200
Well, it's kind of hard to answer if only because I just started playing the game, but

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:50.920
I just recently got myself Transformers Devastation, which is pretty much just as a refresher to

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.280
everyone that's listening.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:59.720
It's basically a love letter to all those that grew up watching the Generation 1 cartoon

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:06.120
from the 80s and, oh my God, is it amazing.

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:12.720
I practically had a nerdgasm as soon as I loaded the game up.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:17.400
I swear to God, I probably like this game more than I like Magic 2014.

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.400
What?

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.520
Well, that's quite an endorsement.

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.520
Don't go overboard.

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:25.320
I know, shock and awe, what the hell happened to Reginald?

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:28.680
What did you do with him?

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:30.960
But yeah, it's pretty good.

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:40.400
Now, normally it's a $40 game, but in fact, I picked it up when it was on CL.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.720
I paid $10 for it.

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.400
I can't figure what the hell, I can't pass that up.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:50.920
It might still be on CL now that the Christmas sale is going on.

01:54:51.760 --> 01:55:01.800
If you're a fan of the Transformers franchise, do yourself a favor and pick it up, especially

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.280
if it's on CL for cheap.

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.280
Well, guys, you're just pointing out it was free on PlayStation Network, so if you didn't

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.240
get it there, I mean, free's a pretty good deal.

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:12.960
Oh, definitely, definitely.

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:17.320
Well, I'll probably let you go.

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:23.280
We're imagining a lot of other people calling for this show, so have a nice night.

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.280
Thank you, you too.

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:25.280
Have a good holiday.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.280
Take care.

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:27.280
Yep, you too.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.280
All right, bye.

01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.280
I'm getting you to think about it.

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:31.560
All these people that are calling us tonight and participating with the show, they're here

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.360
on what is traditionally a pretty busy day for a lot of people, so thank you for being

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:37.360
here tonight, everybody.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.360
Hearts.

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.360
Hearts and love and love and hearts.

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:42.280
And those of you on the podcast feed as well, don't get me wrong, I still have a lot of

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:45.000
love for you guys as well, but anyway, we got another call coming in.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Let's get to it.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.840
Hey, everybody, you're on Orange

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:49.840
Haunted Radio.

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:50.840
Who's this?

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:51.840
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.840
Hey, my friend.

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.840
How are you?

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.840
Not Stroopwaffling, that's for sure.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.840
Well, that's unfortunate.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:56.840
We'll have to fix that.

01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:01.840
Did you know, by the way, Brad from Pod Culture, that your Skype icon is a lesbian?

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:02.840
Yeah.

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840
Okay, just checking.

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.640
Still doesn't change the fact that she's my favorite player in the game.

01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:08.640
Amen to that.

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:09.640
Amen to that.

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:10.640
Doesn't change a goddamn thing.

01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:11.640
That is absolutely right.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.640
There's the one that does the snow.

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:15.600
She's my favorite character in the game.

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:18.680
Tracer is the icon for Brad.

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.960
May is the one you're thinking of.

01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:21.720
That's who I was using and really liked.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:22.720
Yeah, May's cool.

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.680
I actually play Pharah a lot.

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.080
Yeah, I love Pharah.

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.800
Pharah's the one I play pretty much because it's just rocket launchers everywhere.

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.800
I like D.Va.

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:31.720
But I really like Symmetra as well.

01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.800
And I like Junkrat since I know we're naming a lot of ladies, but there's some love for

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:36.800
some of the boys too.

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.800
I like Junkrat as well.

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800
I just found something wonderful.

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:42.480
You gotta know Junkrat and Roadhog are a couple.

01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:44.040
That seems to be the next thing.

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.640
Yeah, that Junkrat and Roadhog are gonna end up being a couple.

01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:47.640
We'll see.

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:48.640
We'll see.

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:50.080
Anyway, Brad, what'd you call in for tonight?

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:55.800
Oh, just gonna end that, you know, tying into what Rageinator was saying, I gotta be surprised.

01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.280
My favorite game of the year that I got was Overwatch.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:02.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:03.680
There's a lot of love out there for Overwatch.

01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:08.960
And again, I want to stress, the way I answered Rageinator's question is not the same way

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:12.440
I would answer what is the best game of 2016, but we'll get into that possibly later.

01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:16.040
But anyway, what made you say Overwatch?

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:19.240
It's just a lot of fun.

01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:25.120
It appealed to my gamer ADD to jump in, play for a while, jump back out.

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.600
The only frustrating thing is those damn loot boxes.

01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.880
Did you get the five free ones for the holiday, which by the way, Overwatch players, if you

01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.560
didn't already check that out, they gave out five free loot boxes for the holiday.

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:41.360
I opened up five on PlayStation 4 and five on PC, and you know what I got?

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.880
Jack shit.

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:45.240
I didn't get anything useful.

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:49.040
I got sprays, voice lines I don't like, like nothing.

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.040
I didn't get any skins.

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:53.040
Yeah, I get all kinds of shit from characters I don't care about.

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.040
Exactly.

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.560
All I want, I wanted just like a Christmas skin for somebody.

01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:03.240
At least during the Summer Games event, at least I got Lucio's Summer Games outfit, which

01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:06.760
was awesome because I actually play Lucio quite a bit, so that was really cool to have.

01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:11.600
I actually had a lot of luck with Lucio skins because I have his gold frog DJ thing too,

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.600
which is awesome.

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.600
I got Yeti Winston.

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.080
Oh, that's cool.

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.840
I just don't play Winston a lot.

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:24.520
I guess if I play any tank, I usually play Winston, but I'm starting to get used to Reinhardt

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:30.680
a little more too, and Reinhardt's a really effective tank, so it's hard to not play Reinhardt.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:38.920
Yeah, I've been playing that, and then I've been trying the new update to No Man's Sky

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:39.920
on PS4.

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:43.640
Oh yeah, what do you think of No Man's Sky, especially post-update and the whole base

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:45.400
building and all that now?

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.400
It's still a very zen game.

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.400
Yeah, it is.

01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:50.640
It's a good one to chill out too.

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:53.760
But it's nice that you can build the base on your planet so now you can go back and

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:59.400
stuff and do all that, so I'd like to hear more about what they have planned for the

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:01.520
future, but I guess this is the way it is now.

01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.920
We're just going to get the updates when they come out, and they're not going to talk on

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:08.560
Twitter because people on Twitter are mean.

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.560
I think you can get it for like 20 bucks now, so it's definitely a 20-buck game.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.920
Yeah, I was just telling somebody else this earlier today.

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:18.140
We were talking about it because he mentioned that he's getting a PlayStation 4 soon and

01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:22.280
finally catching up and getting on that band, or at least like he says, finally catching

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:26.200
up, but I'm kind of like, there's a lot of people that are still on PS3, and not everybody

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:28.460
can afford to get the newest gaming tech.

01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:31.780
But anyway, he said he's getting it, and I said, he was kind of asking about No Man's

01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:32.780
Sky.

01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:35.760
We were talking about the controversy a little bit, and I talked about how the controversy

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:39.900
didn't really bug me with No Man's Sky because my expectations were low.

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:43.120
I didn't buy into all the hype about the game in the first place, so when I played the game

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:44.120
I was fine.

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:48.460
And I said, you know what, now that it's a 20-dollar game especially, it's a great deal

01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:49.460
at 20 bucks.

01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:50.460
Oh yeah.

01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:51.460
Yeah.

01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:52.460
Very definitely.

01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:57.780
So just don't expect to actually do multiplayer or anything like that, and you'll be fine.

01:59:58.100 --> 01:59:59.100
Yeah.

01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:00.100
Yep.

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:01.100
All right.

02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:03.100
Well, Brad, anything else you want to share with us before we let you go?

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:04.100
No.

02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:08.660
If I had some Fireball in the studio, I'd do a shot with you, but unfortunately I'm tapped

02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:09.660
at the moment.

02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:10.660
Well, I appreciate that.

02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:14.500
Have you been tappered?

02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:15.500
Only if you ask nicely.

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:19.180
A happy holidays to you and everybody over there helping you out with pod culture.

02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:20.180
All right.

02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:21.180
Same to you guys.

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:22.180
All right.

02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.180
Take care, my friend.

02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:24.180
Thank you.

02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:25.180
Bye-bye.

02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:26.180
All right.

02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:27.180
Let's see if anybody else tries to call in.

02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:30.180
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:34.920
If you want to do it the old-fashioned way, you can as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR, but I don't

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:37.740
think we've had a call on that line in a very long time.

02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:40.900
But Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:45.740
We'll give it a few minutes, but if nobody else calls in, then that will be a show.

02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:49.140
Dark Sakura, any last-minute stories or things you want to bring up with our audience before

02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:52.980
we pull the plug on tonight's show if we don't get any calls here?

02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:54.900
Christmas is really a pagan holiday.

02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:58.700
You're going to edumacate the listeners tonight?

02:00:58.700 --> 02:00:59.700
It's true.

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:00.700
Yeah.

02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:05.340
Basically, if you don't already know, and I've explained it a bajillion times, all of

02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:12.920
these traditions, with the exception of the Jesus stuff, all came from pagan winter holidays.

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:19.060
They did not have decorated fir trees in Bethlehem.

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:22.540
So just saying, know your history.

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:25.100
I feel like you're a living Tumblr post right now.

02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:28.700
Well, yeah, Tumblr was made for people like me.

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:32.580
And dick.

02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:38.980
One last call, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR, some folks in chat, Bob

02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:42.300
Coffey just stumbled into chat saying, oh, I forgot OLR was on tonight.

02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:43.300
Yep.

02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.020
Well, the good news is, this will be on the podcast feed.

02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:49.380
You came in time to hear me talk about dick.

02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:50.380
So there you go.

02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:52.020
And you're not even as drunk as you were at the beginning of the show.

02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:54.900
And I never did finish this glass of wine.

02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:55.900
Frickin' Stroopwafel.

02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:56.900
Oh my God.

02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:57.900
Rob.

02:01:57.900 --> 02:01:58.900
Rob.

02:01:58.900 --> 02:01:59.900
What?

02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:00.900
Rob.

02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:01.900
Rob.

02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:05.740
You sound like a broken car or something.

02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:06.740
But what?

02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:07.740
You need more.

02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:11.740
I'm finishing off this one.

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:12.740
Hold on.

02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:15.980
Please understand that there will be silence for a moment here.

02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:18.100
Not really, because I'm going to sing.

02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:19.100
We need to do-

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:20.100
No, no singing.

02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:21.100
I will mute the mics for their singing.

02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:31.260
We need to do the Careless Whisper saxophone line on repeat in honor of our departed.

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:34.540
Can we do the sax line from Carly Rae Jepsen's Runaway with Me?

02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:35.540
No.

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.540
Why not?

02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:37.540
Because?

02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:38.540
Carly Slay?

02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:39.540
Because George Michael.

02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:42.480
This is the day of our Lord Carly Slay Jesus Epson.

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.480
Come on.

02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.480
Anyway.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:46.580
I quit for the year.

02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:47.580
All right.

02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:50.660
Nobody's calling in, so I guess we are definitely done.

02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.020
And I chugged the rest of the wine.

02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.020
Thank you very much.

02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:55.580
And I'm sorry for my poor taste earlier.

02:02:55.580 --> 02:03:00.340
Actually, I'm only vaguely sorry for it, because it was pretty funny.

02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:01.340
All right.

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:03.280
So anyway, there it is.

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:07.340
And she did have a little bit to drink, so she was a little unhinged, y'all.

02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:10.300
But thank you for tolerating us for two hours tonight.

02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:14.140
I told you all at the very beginning, I said, if this is your first OLR, maybe you should

02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:17.340
go listen to a different episode to start, because tonight's going to be a little crazy.

02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:21.980
But I hope you guys in our chat and the fans that have been listening for over 670 episodes,

02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:27.260
I hope you enjoyed our show full of holiday cheer, shall we say.

02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.940
Liquid holiday cheer.

02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:33.280
I hope you all enjoyed that in our chat and out there in podcast world.

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:39.620
We're going to wrap up, but we will be back in three weeks live with an all new Orange

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:40.620
Laundry Radio.

02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:43.260
January 15th will be the next live Orange Laundry Radio.

02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:48.540
But you guys, 670 back episodes that you can catch up on.

02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:51.620
We'll see if we can put out something that is taped and advanced as well.

02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:53.660
That's still going to try to do that.

02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:57.020
But again, I try very hard not to over promise and under deliver.

02:03:57.020 --> 02:03:59.100
So expect no show.

02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:03.180
And if there's a show that pops in on the podcast feed, then hooray, right?

02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.180
That's how we work.

02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:05.180
Right, DartSakura?

02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:06.180
Yes.

02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:07.180
Expect nothing.

02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:08.500
You know what, though?

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:09.500
Maybe it will surprise you.

02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:13.740
I wish everyone warmth and love and kitty kisses.

02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:16.140
Yes, lots of kitty kisses.

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:17.140
Your final thought.

02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:19.740
Well, let me just quickly do my line about plugging the show.

02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:20.740
Do it.

02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.140
So thank you for listening to Orange Laundry Radio.

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:25.660
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show tonight, please tell a friend or five

02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:28.500
or 25 about the show or 12 apostles.

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:33.260
Tell them about the show and help spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:34.420
has a voice.

02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:36.860
But if the voices aren't here, we can't share them.

02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:37.860
So we don't ask for your money.

02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:38.860
We don't have them in our head.

02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:43.860
We just ask for word of mouth and a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, Google

02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:46.140
Play Podcast or wherever you found this goes a long way.

02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:48.060
Unless you have 10 available, then do 10.

02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.060
Then do 10 out of 10.

02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:50.060
A pluses.

02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:51.060
Maximums.

02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.060
Yes.

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:53.060
Maximum.

02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:54.060
Maximum ratings.

02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:55.420
Now let's do everybody's final thought.

02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:58.100
I'll do my sappy final thought first, then you can do yours.

02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:02.980
My final thought is that, you know, Christmas is a time that you spend with family a lot

02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:04.020
of times, right?

02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:07.080
So I just really appreciate you guys showing up.

02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:08.080
You guys are like a family.

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:09.300
Aww.

02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:14.520
But no, I mean, part of what motivates us to do this show every Sunday when we know

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:18.200
we know there's not 5000 people listening to this show.

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:23.220
We know we're not some huge podcast that matters out there, even though we are the oldest.

02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:24.980
We know that all that stuff.

02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:30.360
But we still do this show because even though we have a small audience, y'all are a faithful

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.360
audience.

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.360
You're a loyal audience.

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:33.660
You have family here.

02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:38.440
And that's why we love you guys and why we're crazy enough to do a show on Christmas.

02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:39.860
So thank you very much.

02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:41.400
And I hope you do have a great holiday.

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:45.580
When I say holiday, that not just encompasses everything that whatever it is you celebrate

02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:48.360
this time of year, but also New Year's.

02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:49.820
Be safe.

02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:52.100
Have a safe New Year's celebration.

02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:54.100
Don't do anything stupid like drink and drive.

02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:56.300
Don't be fucking stupid.

02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:57.300
Be safe.

02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:58.300
Have fun.

02:05:58.300 --> 02:06:02.340
And let us all hope that 2017 fucking stops killing people.

02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:04.940
Except like Kirk Douglas.

02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:06.620
That's, you know, again, he's 100, you guys.

02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:07.620
He's 100.

02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:13.300
But 2017 needs to not kill celebrities at the rate that 2016 has been doing.

02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:15.260
And a lot of great games.

02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:18.420
And let's hope the Nintendo Switch, you guys, you guys, you know what would be the awesome

02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.900
way to start 2017?

02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:25.940
For Loki to walk in here on January 15th and go, I preordered a Switch.

02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:26.940
Y'all know you want to hear it.

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:27.940
Y'all know you want to hear it.

02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:33.080
So let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that that happens in a couple weeks.

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:34.480
DarkSakura, any final thoughts?

02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:35.480
Thank you.

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:37.880
I am reading chat, by the way, and thank you very much for the very kind words.

02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.880
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:44.680
I love you guys, but not in that way.

02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:48.640
I think that you are all mostly wonderful people.

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:51.160
And thank you for listening to us.

02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:54.560
And thank you for putting up with me.

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:59.880
And thank you for all of the wonderful things that you have sent us.

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:01.280
Folks who have sent us stuff.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.680
The rest of you, we're waiting.

02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:04.680
Stop it.

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:05.680
I'm kidding.

02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:07.280
You can send us a five star review.

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:08.280
That will be plenty fun.

02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:11.960
You can send me a gift certificate to Sephora.

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:13.720
Actually Dan got me a gift certificate for Sephora.

02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:15.640
Then the listeners don't need to.

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.640
You can send us Stroopwafel.

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:17.640
Stroopwafel.

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:19.440
Send us Stroopwafel.

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:21.440
The liquor and the real things.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.440
Crunch, crunch.

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:26.640
But no seriously, without you guys, we would not have been, well I don't know, we might

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:30.040
be stubborn, but we don't know that because of you guys.

02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:34.880
So thank you for being encouragement and sometimes Devafit.

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.680
Hey now.

02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:37.680
Reactionary.

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.680
It's Christmas.

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:39.680
Be nice.

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:40.680
I am being nice.

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:41.680
I'm always nice.

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:43.240
I am nice.

02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:45.640
I was born ready.

02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.640
Action.

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:49.680
Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.680
Don't think I don't know.

02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:51.680
Don't think I don't know.

02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:54.440
My cousin-in-law got a new bike.

02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:58.480
And Dan's response, say that's a nice bike.

02:07:58.920 --> 02:07:59.920
Anyway.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:03.080
It's not a Christmas movie, but it ought to be.

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:04.080
Anyway.

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:09.840
All of you are rad in your own individual unique way.

02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:15.460
Sometimes I come across, I think, a little bit harsh, but it's all out of love and getting

02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:17.600
people to fucking think for themselves.

02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:20.160
You guys are all free thinkers.

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:21.780
Continue to be free thinkers.

02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:24.840
Continue to resist through the next year.

02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.520
And talk to you then.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:28.320
Or enlighten if you play Ingress.

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.640
Please don't resist.

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:30.640
Enlighten.

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:33.640
Just saying.

02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:37.960
There are certain boundaries I have to draw with that line.

02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:38.960
Little boundaries.

02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:39.960
That's all.

02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:42.720
All right.

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.320
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:47.320
Thank you guys so much.

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.320
Oh my God.

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.320
What?

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.320
Oh my God.

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:51.320
What?

02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:52.320
You.

02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:53.320
Me?

02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.320
What?

02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:55.320
What do you do?

02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:56.320
Why?

02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.320
Because.

02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:58.800
This is awesome.

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:01.960
And this is why you've put up with me for going on 15 years.

02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:07.320
Rob, I will put up with you for another 15 and then it will expire and I'm done.

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.480
You're kidding.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:09.480
Kid, kid.

02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:12.120
I will put up with you when you're old and gray.

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:13.120
We will.

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.120
I'm already old and gray.

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:15.120
Next year.

02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:16.120
All right.

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.120
We will see you at the Quiceniera.

02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:21.040
I will put up with you when you're older and grayer.

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.040
Thank you.

02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:23.040
And gayer, hopefully.

02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:24.040
All right.

02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:25.040
Gayer and grayer.

02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:32.840
That's the Orange Lounge Radio 2017, gayer and grayer, but not to be confused.

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:34.800
I can just, I can just see Loki in the background.

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.280
Hey, but not to be confused with clear, which is a cheat.

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:40.280
That's it.

02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:41.280
We're definitely done.

02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:42.280
Have a great holiday, everybody.

02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.280
Good night.

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:44.280
Thanks for listening.

02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:45.280
Bye.
