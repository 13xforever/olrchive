00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,360
T'was the night of Christmas and all through the house, you tuned into VOG Network by clicking

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
your mouse.

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,920
There's news of Utada and Pokemon too, more C&D's delivered with the usual round of

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
boos.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,360
We have lots of news from This Week in Gaming, come celebrate your geekiness, no one here

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,360
is shaming.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,800
Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,280
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,640
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 671 for this December the 25th

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,080
of 2016.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,440
Kind of a big day today and I think maybe in the...

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,840
Yes, the second night of Hanukkah.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,240
Coming up on 15 year anniversary of our show.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,920
This is the first time I think we've ever done a show live on December 25th.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,880
So Merry Christmas, or I'm sorry, as we were saying before the show, Merry fucking Christmas,

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,080
Happy Goddamn Hanukkah, and shit.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
And fuck 2016 in the ear.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
That's right.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,560
With something hard and sandpapery.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
That's right.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,600
My God.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,840
So horrible to hear about Carrie Fisher, although apparently she's in stable condition, and

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,560
if any celebrity was going to say, not today, Satan, it was going to be Carrie Fisher.

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,840
But then George Michael just gone today unexpectedly.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
And it's like...

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
Is that what we had to sacrifice to keep our princess general?

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,480
I don't want to think about that because well, and it's okay.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Here's the thing, because there's...

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
By the way, I'm Rob Roberts.

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
She's Dark Sakura.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Hi.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
If you didn't know that by now, I...

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Where...

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
What rock have you been under?

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Yeah, exactly.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,500
Tech master Loki not here tonight enjoying the holiday with his family, obviously.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,300
You guys there at VogueNetwork.com joining us live as you do every Sunday night, six

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,780
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Dark Tetsuya

40
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,660
in chat commending Jason there on the intro, which Jason, our voiceover guy should be commended.

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,540
That was one of his best intros he's ever done.

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,260
I mean, he does great work, but that was one of my very, very favorites.

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,620
A great holiday present.

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
Anyway, where were we?

45
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
Oh, yes.

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,620
Dead celebrities.

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,020
So everybody on Twitter, you know, RIP George Michael, right?

48
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,020
Because it sucks.

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,020
He was only 53.

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,020
That's nothing.

51
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,020
That's nothing, right?

52
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Still young.

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
So...

54
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,740
This year, though.

55
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,740
Yeah.

56
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
This year has been ridiculous.

57
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
Prince.

58
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Well, yeah.

59
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
David Bowie.

60
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,740
But here's the thing.

61
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,840
So, of course, when people start eulogizing celebrities on Twitter, here comes the snark

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,340
police here.

63
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,940
And so here come the tweets.

64
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,260
Well, I'm really happy to hear that when 2017 starts, all those celebrities are going to

65
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:55,020
stop dying or, you know, something about like, you know, people die all the time.

66
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,780
It doesn't matter that it's 2016 and all this stuff.

67
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,980
And it's like, okay, first off, if you don't got nothing nice to say, don't say it at all.

68
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,580
But for you snarky bitches, take a seat, take all the seats, shut your mouth and listen

69
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,580
for a minute.

70
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,060
Get the tree out of your ass first.

71
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,340
This year, we've lost Prince.

72
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,220
We've lost David Bowie.

73
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,320
We've lost George Michael, among countless other celebrities.

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,140
But I named those particular ones in particular because as far as like gender bend, queer

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,900
rock goes, those are like some of the biggest names.

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,200
I mean, you know, Freddie Mercury, but we lost him a long time ago.

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,840
But out of what we, you know, what we had left in 2016, it really feels like mother

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,820
nature just, you know, just like...

79
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:50,700
Queer Lady Gaga, don't drive, don't go out in public, just stay in the safe little bubble.

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Tim Curry.

81
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Tim Curry.

82
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Oh my God.

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Do not leave your house.

84
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,940
Do not or, you know, leave your house to get a sufficient amount of air, but stay in the

85
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,140
plastic bubble.

86
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,140
But anyway, the point why I bring all this up is that, you know, these are, it's the

87
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,220
fact that we're losing all these iconic people back to back to back.

88
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,740
And we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago on the show before I inadvertently

89
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,960
condemned Zsa Zsa on the show was you were talking about, yes, somebody's going to have

90
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,840
to die in 2017 because that's just the way life is.

91
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,300
But who's 100 years old, Kirk Douglas?

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Okay.

93
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,880
If Kirk Douglas passes away next year, I'm going to be sad.

94
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
But it's like...

95
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
But not surprised.

96
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
But he was 100 years old.

97
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Right.

98
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
It was time.

99
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Right.

100
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Same thing with Zsa Zsa.

101
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Yeah.

102
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
That's all I ever said about Zsa Zsa.

103
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Pretty much dead already.

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
It's just officially.

105
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,020
He was in a coma.

106
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,020
Yeah.

107
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
Yeah, exactly.

108
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,700
So, you know, and somebody, somebody on my Twitter feed, I made a post about the bubble

109
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,860
and somebody on my Twitter feed said, put Carol Channing in that too.

110
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,740
She's 96 years old.

111
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,020
And yes, Carol Channing does belong in the bubble.

112
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,220
However, if Carol Channing passes away, I'm going to be like, she was 96 years old.

113
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,740
But she is a fan of Bob the drag queen.

114
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,500
So you know, you can, you can apply this to a lot of the 90 year old celebrities, except

115
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,680
Betty White.

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Don't you fucking touch Betty White.

117
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,420
Betty White will cut a bitch.

118
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,420
That's right.

119
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,420
Anyway.

120
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Death's gonna come for her.

121
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420
She'll be like, ho!

122
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
Yeah.

123
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,300
Flaco Jones in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the older you get, the more famous people

124
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
you know die.

125
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Ain't that the truth?

126
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,980
I mean, when you were younger and you heard about famous people passing away, it was like,

127
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,860
oh, it's old people anyway.

128
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,200
But now, yeah, it's, it's kind of like a reminder of our own mortality.

129
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,020
Not to get to a dark place here on Orange Lawns Radio, the show where every gamer has

130
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,280
a voice, but it is our special holiday episode.

131
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,900
It's our holiday episode.

132
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,800
And if it's your first time listening to OLR, I would really encourage you to go listen

133
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,720
to a different episode of OLR for your first OLR.

134
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Not that tonight's-

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
I don't have enough wine in me.

136
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Not that tonight's going to be bad.

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,280
Tonight's just going to be fun because Dark Soccer and I, I mean, it, this is what happens

138
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,960
on December 25th, Christmas, Hanukkah, whatever it is you celebrate, is that today you kind

139
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,640
of just don't give a fuck.

140
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
And so-

141
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
No fucks are given.

142
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Exactly.

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,540
We are quite the chaste group tonight.

144
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
That's right.

145
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
That's right.

146
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
So what is this?

147
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,540
What is this?

148
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,540
By the way, you brought us to start off with.

149
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Stroopwafel liqueur.

150
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,220
Does that mean it tastes like waffles?

151
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,220
Stroopwafel.

152
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,220
What's the Stroopwafel taste like?

153
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,820
It's those little flat waffle crackers.

154
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,780
I'm actually, if you can hear that clicking, I'm actually opening this.

155
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,420
This is that little like dollar store shot thing.

156
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,260
Although I bet this wasn't a dollar, but it was a little more.

157
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,060
It actually was a dollar.

158
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
It was a dollar?

159
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
Oh, well.

160
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,060
L'Chaim.

161
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,100
Ooh, it smells pretty good.

162
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Here we go.

163
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,560
Winter holidays of your choice.

164
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Fuck.

165
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Okay.

166
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Hold on.

167
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Pardon the silence.

168
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
I drank half of it.

169
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Oh my God.

170
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
It does taste like waffle, kind of.

171
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Right?

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I was not expecting that.

173
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Holy shit.

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
This is good.

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm going to get a big fucking bottle of this.

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm not-

177
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Contains caramel color.

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
This is good.

179
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
I'm not going to eat anymore.

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm just going to drink.

181
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
You only paid a dollar for this?

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
For the little teeny ones.

183
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,040
The big bottle is like 11 at Total Wine.

184
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
That's a pretty good deal.

185
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Let's go get some.

186
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Wow.

187
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
All right.

188
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Sorry, show's over.

189
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
We're going to get more Stroopwafel.

190
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Anyway.

191
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,380
VXJ6V in our chat says, Stroopwafels are so good.

192
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Yeah, this is-

193
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,380
Ooh, this is great.

194
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,380
This is amazing.

195
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
But it's also fun to say, Stroopwafel.

196
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
It is.

197
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
It is.

198
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
We are-

199
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
Get to the Stroopwafel.

200
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,100
We are going to give you a play by play of what we drink tonight.

201
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:36,240
So this first beverage was, hold on, Van Mier's Stroopwafel Liqueur.

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,080
Now we are also enjoying the Chenin Blanc of Charles Spinetta Vineyards.

203
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Yes.

204
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Winery.

205
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
There's wine here as well.

206
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
I'm not done with Stroopwafel, so.

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Well, I drink mine.

208
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
All right.

209
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Also, I had two shots of rum before I came over.

210
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Does this girl know how to party or what?

211
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,520
Well, it was rum from Panama.

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,980
Well, you got to drink that.

213
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
You got to drink that.

214
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Panama.

215
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,080
Anyway, where was I?

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm going to be totally-

217
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Stroopwafel.

218
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
I'm going to be totally scatterbrained tonight, you guys.

219
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, so part of the reason we're here on Christmas, second day of Hanukkah, whatever it is, is

220
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,960
the fact that we're actually not going to be live for a little bit.

221
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,120
We're going to be dead.

222
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Stop.

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
No, not today.

224
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Not today to make that joke.

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,320
I started to say it and I figured I may as well finish it because-

226
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Today not the day to make that joke.

227
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
No fucks are given.

228
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,040
No, it is not.

229
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,780
So here's the thing.

230
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,840
We're going to be gone for the next two weeks live because next week is New Year's and a

231
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,520
lot of people are going to be recovering, out of town, all that sort of thing.

232
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm going to be gone at MAGFest in two weeks, which I'm not really prepared for how early

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,780
MAGFest is this year, although everybody tells me, well, this is the normal time that they

234
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
do it.

235
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,000
And I'm kind of like, you know, I kind of liked that February day.

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,240
It worked out a lot better, but all right, this is the way they party in DC.

237
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,560
But I'm going to be MAGFest on January 8th, so we'll be off that week.

238
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,360
So we're not going to be back live until January 15th.

239
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
You have to see Tiara while you're there.

240
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Hmm?

241
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
You have to see Tiara while you're there.

242
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Is she going to be in MAGFest?

243
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,400
No, but she lives in Arlington.

244
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,980
The thing is, I'm going to be kind of on an island in National Harbor.

245
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,140
It's really separated over there.

246
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,460
She want to come do dinner some night or something.

247
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,460
I'd totally love to see her.

248
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,460
You should tell her that.

249
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Yeah.

250
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,460
I'll have to hit her up on Facebook or something.

251
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,540
Anyway, Tiara hasn't been on the show in like 10 years.

252
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Yeah.

253
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,140
Hands up and chat if you remember Tiara.

254
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,200
No, but she was fabulous.

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,320
She ran the Geek Dash life, right?

256
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
When that was still going.

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Yeah.

258
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,540
She did the Monday Comic Insanity with her.

259
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
That other podcast she did.

260
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Monday Comic Insanity.

261
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Is that what it was?

262
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Monday Comic Insanity.

263
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
That was a while ago.

264
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Yeah.

265
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
That was a while back.

266
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
That was a while back.

267
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Anyway.

268
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
And I'm planning to start that again.

269
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Wink, wink.

270
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
Spike.

271
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Nudge, nudge.

272
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
No subtlety here.

273
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
We've been talking about it.

274
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
All right.

275
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,140
And Spike only does this to...

276
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,140
What's the word?

277
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,760
Spike only does this to spite me because I'm the biggest podcaster, but no, Spike always

278
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,340
has to one up me with all the podcasts he has.

279
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,140
So you know, but Spike's amazing.

280
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,340
So I can't even joke about hating because I just can't.

281
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,340
I have one and I need more.

282
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
Don't we all?

283
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Don't we all need more podcasts?

284
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
All right.

285
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
Good.

286
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,660
SSU 100 Matt is saying, so far the weather is showing it will be in the 50s that weekend.

287
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,020
That's warmer than it is here.

288
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,200
I'll take it.

289
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,980
It's 42 right now.

290
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,300
So the 50s?

291
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Warmer than that.

292
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Love it.

293
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
All right.

294
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Anyway.

295
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
I'm ready because I've had rum and Stroopwafel.

296
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I know right?

297
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,160
Like I'm already feeling this Stroopwafel.

298
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
You're buzzy.

299
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Buzzy beetle with a penguin hat.

300
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,600
This is going to be one of those shows tonight.

301
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,120
I got Rob a penguin hat everybody.

302
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,680
And if you're on Facebook, you can look at it.

303
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
So did you put it on Facebook?

304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
I did.

305
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
When did you take a picture of me with a hat on?

306
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Like you were talking to Bobby and you're like, Rob's like, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,

307
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
bah, bah, bah, bah.

308
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Wait a minute.

309
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
That's one nice CD.

310
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
She's, she's, she ninja'd a picture of me and didn't tell anybody.

311
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
It's a good picture.

312
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,540
It's just kind of.

313
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,540
Was I holding booze in my hand because my mother's on Facebook now.

314
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
No, it was before you poured our wine.

315
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,540
All right, good.

316
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
All right.

317
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
So, uh, let's see.

318
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,540
Where was I?

319
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,540
Oh yes.

320
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,220
No show over the next two weeks because this show will have killed the show effectively

321
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,220
for a few weeks.

322
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
No, but we'll be out.

323
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,540
We are looking though, however, we'll try to do like a pre tape thing, but I don't want

324
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
to promise anything.

325
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
That's all with it.

326
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Tape before you tape.

327
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
I don't want to over promise.

328
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,700
I hear you like tape, so I'm going to tape before you tape.

329
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,560
So don't expect us to be back until the 15th, but you may get pleasantly surprised.

330
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
Sounds good?

331
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,220
Nobody expects the OLR Inquisition.

332
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
But it was weird.

333
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,520
It's weird to be thinking that by the time we're back, the switch will be, I can't say

334
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,680
the switch will be out.

335
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
That's not true.

336
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,920
But the switch information, all these mysteries, all the, did Zelda get pushed back or not?

337
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,880
Is the switch coming out of March or not?

338
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,500
All these questions are going to be answered by the time we're back on OLR and new ones

339
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,100
will be posed.

340
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,740
Why does it look like that?

341
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,700
You for a moment, I thought you said posed because your hand was out like you were posing

342
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,880
and I was like, Ooh, Rob, here's a quick, there's a question to pose.

343
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,700
Why isn't OLR on video yet?

344
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,900
Because reasons.

345
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,060
Because dark Sakura doesn't want y'all to see her pretty face.

346
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,320
No, you know what I was thinking though, you know, I was thinking though, um, there's that

347
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,540
software that, um, I think Tiger Claw or somebody showed it to me.

348
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,940
I don't mind my face.

349
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,260
Well, and you have a, you, you're a very pretty lady.

350
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,340
You should, you should, uh, embrace it for, but I was thinking, well, there's those programs

351
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,720
that will like turn you into a furry on your stream so you can actually sit there.

352
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,940
You could be a penguin or something that talks during the show.

353
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
We could do that.

354
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
I have a kigurumi now.

355
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,620
Do you, so wear that to the show and just have a different, I have a Pikachu kigurumi.

356
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,620
That could be your thing.

357
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,520
I have a different kigurumi every week to the show.

358
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,640
I can't afford that many.

359
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,280
Ask the listeners nicely to donate.

360
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,000
If we move over to Twitch, we can start collecting bits.

361
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,480
I want a red panda kigurumi and I wear the regular size from kigurumi-shop.com.

362
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,960
Tiger Claw says face rig.

363
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,120
Yeah, I think that's the name of it.

364
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,360
I think it is.

365
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,080
So I think that was the name of the software.

366
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,220
So anyway, the video question I will be tackling in 2017, I would expect something's going

367
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,220
to change with that because I'm realizing more and more each day, there's a huge untapped

368
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,340
audience out there on those streaming sites that we really need to get our faces in front

369
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
of.

370
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,340
Can we tap them?

371
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
So what's that?

372
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,340
Can we tap them?

373
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
Can we tap them?

374
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Tap the faces?

375
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Tap all the faces.

376
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,620
So we're going to figure out what to do about that in the coming, coming year.

377
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Anyway.

378
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,060
I need to stop eating these things because they're amazing.

379
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
These truffle things?

380
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
Uh-huh.

381
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
These are really good.

382
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:48,240
This is the quintessential Christmas thing that shows up because let's say your aunt,

383
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,180
your aunt didn't want to buy you a big gift, but she had to get you something.

384
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,160
So she gets you these truffles.

385
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
That's what this gift is.

386
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
They're the Ferrero Rocher, isn't it?

387
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Don't talk with your mouth full.

388
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
That's rude.

389
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Fuck.

390
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
All right.

391
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I can do what I want.

392
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm a liberated woman.

393
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,560
Uh, let's talk.

394
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,320
Let's try to get into video games a little bit tonight.

395
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Let's talk a little.

396
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,340
It is, by the way, we do have a, we're going to just run through the show and I have a

397
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,340
break tonight.

398
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,400
We're going to run through the show straight and we'll find, we're going to run through

399
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,260
the show Gailey and then, uh, then we're going to start this off with some gay.

400
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,340
Well, we're not getting into news yet.

401
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
I am.

402
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Okay.

403
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,340
I don't care tonight.

404
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,160
Our soccer does what she wants.

405
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,580
She looks the show, roll heads and sees that there's a kickoff topic and how is your gaming

406
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
week?

407
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
I don't know.

408
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,280
I don't want to, I want to talk about, I want to talk about lesbians are fine.

409
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Fine.

410
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
You know what?

411
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I don't care.

412
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Jamie do what you want.

413
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Talk up.

414
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Fine.

415
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Start with this.

416
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
I've decided to do the kickoff topic.

417
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
Then what's tonight's kickoff topic?

418
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,720
Um, I have no idea.

419
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,840
Holiday gaming.

420
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,000
Did you get any presents?

421
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I did.

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,480
You better say yes cause I bought you some.

423
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,280
My, my, my bestest friend in the whole wide world, dark Sakura bought me final fantasy

424
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,160
games on steam because she saw them on my wishlist by old games and so she bought me

425
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,780
the final fantasy 10 and 10 to remaster, which by the way, do you know why that's on my steam

426
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
wishlist?

427
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Why?

428
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,820
Because it's the whole mass effect three thing.

429
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,040
What can I do for you?

430
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,520
So now I own the 10 and 10 to remaster on PlayStation three, PlayStation four and thanks

431
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,120
to friend, buddy, pal, Sakura, I own it on PC as well.

432
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,640
So I own the final fantasy and I have it on PlayStation two.

433
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,920
So I think I own final fantasy 10 on as many systems as I own mass effect three.

434
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Yay.

435
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Yay.

436
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I got, I got Alan thingies.

437
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,560
What'd you get Alan?

438
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,040
The tales of symphonia and tales of zestria and undertale.

439
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,120
Oh, he'll like, Oh, you finally got him undertale.

440
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Good.

441
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
Maybe he'll finally play that.

442
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Undertale.

443
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Oh, you got Loki undertale.

444
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,320
You bought, I got him some other game, but I need to find something else because I didn't

445
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
spend enough money.

446
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,040
You're buying, you're buying everybody, uh, undertale already have it.

447
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,980
I bought, I bought your undertale.

448
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
You did.

449
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Fuck.

450
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm a dealer and I haven't even finished it yet.

451
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,640
And then I bought you games and I bet you haven't touched him yet.

452
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,900
Do you remember what I bought you?

453
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Disgaea.

454
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,060
I did buy you Disgaea PC.

455
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,480
Orrery in the blind forest.

456
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
That's right.

457
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,000
And I bought it on your list too, isn't it?

458
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,820
It is, but I own it on Xbox one.

459
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Okay.

460
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,240
So it's another one of those things where it's like, well, I just kind of wanted it

461
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
on PC as well.

462
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Finish Duncan Rompa too.

463
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,820
You, but at some point you really need to play or in the blind forest because or in

464
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,620
the blind forest is like super Metroid, but like cute and sad.

465
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,780
All right, I'll start it.

466
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,460
I wanted to play Disgaea and I'm glad it was on PC finally, but if Ultra Despair Girls

467
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,580
comes out on PC soon, then I'm going to be all over that.

468
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,100
Cause I've been playing on a Vita TV.

469
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,180
I love Duncan Rompa.

470
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:52,500
I almost bought a Monokuma, uh, uh, Kigurumi, except I don't wear white things cause I can

471
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
help it.

472
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Okay.

473
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Okay.

474
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
That begs a whole nother question.

475
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Question number one.

476
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
What is with the Kigurumi thing lately?

477
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Like this came out of nowhere.

478
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
It's warm.

479
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
And comfortable.

480
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
And uncomfortable.

481
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
Okay.

482
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,020
What is the difference between a Kigurumi and a Snuggie?

483
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Cartoon characters.

484
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,020
That's it.

485
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,620
Because when I was, when I was doing a Snuggie thing on OLR, I got teased relentlessly.

486
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,620
There's kind of pants.

487
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,380
No, there's no pants on a Snuggie unless you put your legs through the arm holes and then

488
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,420
find another Snuggie and then you're like, then you look like the biggest shit ever.

489
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,140
You look like a blind quilters creation.

490
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
That is not the same thing.

491
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,180
Kigurumi, first of all, Snuggies are also made out of the worst material ever to exist.

492
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,740
They're not, they don't stay cozy.

493
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,420
They're soft for like a day and then you wash it and then suddenly it's cardboard.

494
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,340
They are made out of that material that like grandma bought at Walmart in the crafting

495
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
section.

496
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,080
Kigurumi are nice and soft and fluffy and fleecy and it feels like you're, it does feel

497
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,300
like you're wearing a whole blanket if you get a good one.

498
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,400
You know, I have my Pikachu kigurumi, well it's Alan's Pikachu kigurumi, but what's his

499
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
is mine.

500
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Right?

501
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
So I can steal it.

502
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Should I wear that to magfest?

503
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Yes.

504
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,080
Not just yes, but yes, yes, queen.

505
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
All right.

506
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Let's see.

507
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,600
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

508
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,280
Act Def says the booze got to Jamie hard.

509
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Just Jamie?

510
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
No.

511
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
I haven't even finished the Stroopwafel and I'm already feeling it.

512
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,880
I am only vaguely buzzy right now, but it makes me more talky and, and yes, that's what

513
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,320
kigurumi means.

514
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,600
Like I said, if this is your first OLR, the other episodes of OLR are not quite this unorganized

515
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,360
or random, but it's the holidays.

516
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,080
So fuck it.

517
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Kombai.

518
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,760
Uh, let's see.

519
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,220
Rageinator in chat says dark Sakura, wouldn't the worst material be a blend of sandpaper

520
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,600
and poison ivy and corn and corn.

521
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Corn is awful.

522
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Corn is terrible.

523
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
And corn gives me hives.

524
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,760
No, you know what would be, what would be worse if it was like, if it had a, um, uh,

525
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:07,760
a habanero glaze on it, that would make it the worst.

526
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
The worst.

527
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,180
Now I like mayonnaise, Rob.

528
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,880
And I will say that if you've accidentally burned yourself, mayonnaise is oddly comfortable.

529
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Okay.

530
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,160
Why are we talking about wearing mayonnaise?

531
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,680
This doesn't make any sense.

532
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,600
You dismissed the greatest of all condiments, sir.

533
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,520
Uh, you can stop right there.

534
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,640
First off, ketchup, far more versatile of a condiment than mayonnaise.

535
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
Ketchup is nasty as fuck.

536
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,280
Yeah, but you can put it on hash browns.

537
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,120
The only thing ketchup is good for is meatloaf when you bake it into the meatloaf.

538
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,600
And I prefer to use tomato paste.

539
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,500
I don't even like ketchup that much.

540
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
You know what I like?

541
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,600
And some people hate this.

542
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
So trigger warning.

543
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
You ready?

544
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
You know what I love?

545
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Mustard.

546
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,360
I could do French fries and mustard, but the best thing ever is the soft, soft baked pretzel.

547
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,280
You are doing your hand like you're squeezing someone's nuts.

548
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,480
No, it's a pretzel.

549
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,740
It's a pretzel you fucking pervert.

550
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,760
It's a pretzel that you dip in mustard.

551
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,560
You invited me into your home, sir.

552
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
I know.

553
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
And sometimes I ask myself why.

554
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,200
I am now two shots of rum, a bottle of Stroopwafel and a glass of wine in.

555
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,920
And I've had half the Stroopwafel, which this is so good.

556
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Right.

557
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I got to find more.

558
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm going to have more wine.

559
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Where does this come from?

560
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Do my story for me.

561
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Bye.

562
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
It's got a freaking Dutch name on it.

563
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Product of Holland.

564
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,040
Oh, this is the product of my people.

565
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,680
I married a Dutch guy.

566
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,080
I am a Dutch guy.

567
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
I'm Dutch by marriage.

568
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
I need to call Cyl and see if she's got Stroopwafel.

569
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,240
I had a dream about Cyl.

570
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Oh my God.

571
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Okay.

572
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Okay.

573
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,560
Cyl from the Geek Card, formerly Girls Gone Wow.

574
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,040
What's her other show she has now?

575
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Battle Chat show.

576
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Okay.

577
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,680
I had a dream that I was working somewhere and my current boss was my boss there, but

578
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,800
it was like a different place with like our computers laid out on like folding tables.

579
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Excuse me.

580
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,000
And Cyl was my desk mate.

581
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,640
And we looked at each other and it's like, let's go, let's just go.

582
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,320
So we got up and called in sick from our desks and we went out in my little roller skate

583
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,160
Fiat and also the town kind of looks like Mobile, but a really weird version of it.

584
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,480
Like if Mobile had turned into Silent Hill-ish and we found an Indian buffet, like a hole

585
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,760
in the wall Indian buffet and we got, we got our fucking curry on and then the next thing

586
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,920
I know I hear, hello, which is the sound.

587
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,600
It's Vanellope saying hello from your iPhone, my iPhone.

588
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,760
It was my sister saying, uh, you want to talk to dad?

589
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,880
I guess.

590
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,160
And then I woke up all the way cause, but that, that, that dream could have happened

591
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,760
like, and I've never even, I've never even met Cyl, but this just sounds like something

592
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,080
that would happen if Cyl and Jamie got together like, Hey, we're podcasting.

593
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
You know what?

594
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Fuck this.

595
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Let's go get some curry.

596
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
It could happen tonight.

597
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
Fucking curry.

598
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
Yeah.

599
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
All right.

600
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Anyway, look, before you leave, uh, I want to ask some questions here at the top of the

601
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
show.

602
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,960
So holiday gaming, great memories about holiday gaming presence.

603
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,720
And I opened this up to chat as well.

604
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,480
So I know I've told this story on the show previously, but I'm gonna tell it again cause

605
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm a little do it.

606
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Okay.

607
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,320
So when I got the super Nintendo, right?

608
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,000
I got a super Nintendo for Christmas when I was 12, I think.

609
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,680
So, um, it's the one thing I really wanted more than anything.

610
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,420
And I opened all the presence under the tree and it wasn't there.

611
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,220
And so I got sad, but it's like, what is, it's one of those things where it's like,

612
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,800
you want to be grateful for the stuff you did get, but you're still kind of, you're

613
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,680
still that like stupid spoiled horse, sad, you know, like, but I wanted it.

614
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,800
It's so bad, you know, type of thing.

615
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,960
So I'm, I'm trying to walk that fine line of not showing that I'm sad because I don't

616
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,080
want to be that ungrateful asshole, but I actually deep down inside, I'm sad because

617
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:57,040
I'm a nerd and I wanted the super Nintendo, but then miraculously a Christmas miracle.

618
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,400
My sister shows up who's 16 years older than I am.

619
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
My sister shows up.

620
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
She's really cool.

621
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Have you met my sister?

622
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Yes.

623
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
She's hilarious.

624
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Your sister looks like Lori Petty in the tank girl era.

625
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Yes, she kind of does.

626
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,940
Uh, anyway, so not, not the orange is the new black era.

627
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,180
Very important distinction.

628
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:16,460
Um, so, um, my sister shows up and she has just a tiny little envelope and she gives

629
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,020
it to me and the envelope says, go check in the closet and you go check in that.

630
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,220
There's another envelope in the closet.

631
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,260
Go check in the backyard.

632
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,420
So it's one of those fucking wild goose chase things that ends under the bed.

633
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,660
There's my super Nintendo.

634
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Yay.

635
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Christmas is saved.

636
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,940
So I get the super Nintendo and a super Mario world comes with it, right?

637
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,660
And my parents got Dracken on the super Nintendo, which I was like, the fuck is this?

638
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
I mean, you know, I'm still happy.

639
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
I got some new.

640
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
So I don't, I don't give a fuck.

641
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I'm just like happy.

642
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
And I'm like, oh cool.

643
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Another game.

644
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,700
I've never heard of this game, but whatever.

645
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,900
Super Nintendo, you know, I'm really excited.

646
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,920
But apparently the guy at Montgomery ward told my parents that it was like the game

647
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,180
everybody was buying.

648
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,660
Although I think he lied because I don't know anybody else that owned Dracken.

649
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,900
But any, but anyway, uh, I did, I didn't appreciate Dracken at first, but like it was one of those

650
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,100
games like a year later, I kind of went back and I said, why did I never play this game?

651
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,260
And I went back and I played Dracken.

652
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,180
It actually is really cool.

653
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,340
Um, it was like one of the, it was the, the overworld was in that nineties virtual reality

654
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
style.

655
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,380
Did you ever play Dracken?

656
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,220
It's kind of, I know of it, but the battles were all automated.

657
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,780
And that was the weird thing about it is that when you would run into a monster, your little

658
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,820
army of people would just, and they just start fighting on screen.

659
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,040
It was kind of like, you couldn't really control them very well.

660
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,300
So that was the weird part of it is it was very like not final fantasy, which is what

661
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,020
I was used to, but I came to appreciate that game a lot later.

662
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,140
And you know, it was really awesome was dragon's view, which was Dracken 2.

663
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,660
And what they did is they took out the auto battling and they put in more like Actraiser

664
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,700
style side scrolling things into it.

665
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,820
And that is like a really underrated gem on Super Nintendo.

666
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,640
Kind of like wonders from East.

667
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
I think so.

668
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,980
I haven't played wonders from East in years, but wonders from East was more, wasn't that

669
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,980
the more of the top down Zelda style top down, but when you went into caves or dungeons and

670
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,100
things, that's right.

671
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
That is right.

672
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,780
That is right.

673
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,340
So yeah.

674
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,000
Classic RPGs that I came to love.

675
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,580
So that was, that was a holiday gaming memory that I have.

676
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,140
I know I told this story just like a month ago on the show, but there was the time that

677
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,820
I got $200 for Christmas and I went and bought a PlayStation when my mom was pissed because

678
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,460
that's like the thing she didn't want me to have, but it's like, you give me money.

679
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
What'd you think was going to happen?

680
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Yeah.

681
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
So anyway, uh, what about you?

682
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,260
And then I'll open it up to chatters over at live.

683
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,500
I got my Nintendo as a kid, my NES, and then my mom would like play it more the fuck than

684
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
me.

685
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,300
And every time she tried to put me on a restriction and hide it, I'd go get it and say, you didn't

686
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
buy this for me.

687
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Daddy bought this for me.

688
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
So I own it.

689
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,340
I was that kid, but you're that adult.

690
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,340
Fuck.

691
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Yeah.

692
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,340
I grew up that way.

693
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:56,300
Um, but the fun thing is that my mom pulls me aside and was like, okay, so I'm going

694
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,780
to get your brothers a gaming system.

695
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,060
You have to tell me which one to get them.

696
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,540
Do I get him a Genesis or super Nintendo?

697
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,700
And I was like, get him a super Nintendo.

698
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,420
Why better graphics?

699
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,900
He's got a better sound processor and dark soccer gets out like this, the whole table

700
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:16,500
that shows the pros and the cons is now you see here where Ninten does what Genesis don't,

701
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,300
I got that backwards, but you know, she, she has her whole charts and grass.

702
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,340
Plus you have to get them the legend of Zelda, a link to the past, cause that's the game

703
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
you want.

704
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
That is the asset.

705
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,500
That is the best game.

706
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,420
I've seen so many good reviews about it and you've played the first legend of Zelda with

707
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
me, right?

708
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,540
That's how good it was.

709
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,540
This was supposed to be going back to that.

710
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,980
Oh, that's a good idea.

711
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,200
So my mom buys it.

712
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,420
My brother's like, and then she got them home alone, which was awful.

713
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
Super Nintendo.

714
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,660
There's a home alone game on super Nintendo or several.

715
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
I remember one on NES.

716
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,020
I don't remember it on super Nintendo and then, and then, and then she got a super scope

717
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
six.

718
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
Yes.

719
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,300
And of course the game that came with it, I played a lot of blasters now.

720
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Here's the kicker.

721
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,740
My brothers didn't have a TV in their room.

722
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,740
You know who had the TV in her room?

723
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
Me.

724
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
How did that work?

725
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
How did you get that?

726
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,740
My dad bought me a TV.

727
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,140
Well, he kept trying to bribe me for my love.

728
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,540
Somebody spoiled raw and no, he just was guilty and would buy me stuff to cover his guilt.

729
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
All right.

730
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
All right.

731
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
We're not going to go to a dark place.

732
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,180
It is fucking Christmas.

733
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,560
I can say it cause he admitted it when I was an adult.

734
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
So whatever.

735
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
All right.

736
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
And plus I was actually smart.

737
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,860
So anyway, I was like, okay, keep bribing me.

738
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
I don't care.

739
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,980
I'm not a statistic.

740
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,940
So anyway, so we hooked it up in my room and of course my brothers would be like, can we

741
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
play?

742
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
No.

743
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
I am almost unbeaten.

744
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,860
And I would scream at whatever, what was that thing that was the big round lizard that kept

745
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,860
knocking you off the platform and you had to keep either hitting it in the head and

746
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,860
it would turn purple.

747
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,700
The thing that was like a series of circles, like a centipede, I forgot what it's called,

748
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,380
but it was like one of the early levels and it was the only boss in there that was actually

749
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,900
hard and I would just yell at it and my brothers would say, they're going, Oh my God, can we

750
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,860
watch some more?

751
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,540
And then they'd go off to their dads and I was left with the super Nintendo.

752
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,940
So I was like, Oh, it's fine.

753
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,140
And then when they moved, they took it with them.

754
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:23,780
So but by then, then your strategy backfired, but by then I went to the pawn store and I

755
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,420
bought myself one for 30 fucking bucks.

756
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:33,980
And dated a guy who gave me super street fighter two and Kirby's avalanche.

757
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,180
You want to prove you love me?

758
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Street fighting.

759
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Seriously.

760
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
I was the only way to do it.

761
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,580
There was one night that when my brothers were visiting and we stayed up all night trying

762
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,040
to see if the 250 fight thing was immortal combat two and it wasn't.

763
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,660
And you're still scarred to this day.

764
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
No pong, no pong.

765
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Okay.

766
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,660
I'm gonna have more wine.

767
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
You still have half the glass.

768
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm getting more wine.

769
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,640
Because I've only drink in the Stroopwafel, but I finally finished it.

770
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,360
But I want to go to the chatters and here's some of your stories.

771
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,640
So vidpower in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says my most memorable gaming present was

772
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,740
me and my brother getting our super Nintendo and playing super Mario world all night long.

773
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,500
Fifth Dream in chat says my favorite Christmas was dreaming about getting donkey Kong and

774
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,860
Ms. Pac-Man on 2,600 on Christmas Eve and waking up and they were under the tree.

775
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
Let's see.

776
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,020
Dark Tetsuya says there was the year I got Chrono Trigger.

777
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,900
They hid it in a bigger box so I didn't suspect what it was.

778
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,940
Stoppy says getting an NES is my earliest Christmas gift memory.

779
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,460
Ragenator says I bought the Super Nintendo on my own.

780
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,500
The NES, the one that came with Rob the Robot was the only system that my parents got for

781
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,300
me, which I got 29 years ago today.

782
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,820
Dungeon Buster saying Draken was an interesting RPG and the Montgomery Ward guy was definitely

783
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
exaggerating.

784
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
Well, that's why they wouldn't.

785
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
Holy shit.

786
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
I remembered something else.

787
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
What?

788
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,500
When Dan owned a video game store, I forgot he owned a video game store at some point.

789
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Yeah, Game On.

790
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,820
I created the name for that, you know.

791
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Did you really?

792
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,820
I did.

793
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
I didn't know that.

794
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,740
So anyway, he gives me this huge box and I'm like, the fuck is this?

795
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
And I'm like, I thought it was a vacuum cleaner.

796
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
It was that big.

797
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,100
So open it up and open, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, and you know what was inside?

798
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,980
Popful mail for the Sega CD.

799
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
Nice.

800
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,340
So it was a gigantic box with a tiny CD in it.

801
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
Yeah.

802
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
Perfect.

803
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,860
Good on you marrying him.

804
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,860
I married well.

805
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
Let's see.

806
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,860
Why?

807
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,620
I'm going to chat as well.

808
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,980
Tars ZXF is in chat saying, I remember hours of Uncle Fester's quest on Rob's NES.

809
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,260
Yes, that was the Christmas I ruined because...

810
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,820
Okay, talk about the ruined Christmas.

811
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,740
Well, that's because, well, my parents to this day don't know it unless they're listening

812
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,140
tonight, which I doubt.

813
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:53,380
But my parents had gone to the store, like Bel Air or something, it was a local grocery

814
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,380
store.

815
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,260
And the big Bel Air bags were sitting on my mom's bed.

816
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,780
Well, me being the nosy kid I was, I went to go see like what candy did she buy because

817
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
I'm going to take it.

818
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,940
So I'm looking in the bags and I noticed in one of the bags was Uncle Fester's quest for

819
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,940
the NES.

820
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,100
And I'm like, oh shit, I put two and two together.

821
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,760
I'm like, wow, you just spoiled one of your Christmas presents.

822
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,940
So I didn't say anything about it.

823
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,460
So I just, I quickly left the room, went somewhere else.

824
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,300
And sure enough, what showed up under the tree that Christmas?

825
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,300
Uncle Fester.

826
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
But do you know what I did?

827
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Okay.

828
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
So how old would I have been at this time?

829
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Probably about 11.

830
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,140
This probably would have been like the year before the Super Nintendo.

831
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:33,100
So even from a young age, I like to fuck with my mother in a, you know, joking sort of way.

832
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,460
So what we did, you know how like you used to go out and rent games?

833
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,480
So I remember one time we were at the video store.

834
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,620
This was between the time I knew what I was getting and before Christmas, and we were

835
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,620
looking at games to rent and I saw Uncle Fester's quest on the shelf and I actually pulled it

836
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,100
down and I said, doesn't this game look really good?

837
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,300
I think we should rent this one.

838
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,940
I should rent this game and I should beat it this weekend.

839
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,060
Shouldn't we do that?

840
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,700
And my mom was just kind of like doing like that shifty-eyed thing.

841
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,820
Like she's just like, she's not even going to say anything because if she says anything,

842
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
she'll give it away.

843
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,700
She's like, I'm going to go look at new releases or something.

844
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,320
So I didn't end up renting that game and like you could beat that game in a weekend anyway.

845
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,580
But that's my story about how I was a little asshole on Christmas.

846
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
So there you go.

847
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,580
Or at least in the season.

848
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,340
That doesn't exactly ruin Christmas, Rob.

849
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
So yeah.

850
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Only for yourself.

851
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Uncle Fester's Quest was kind of an underrated NES game.

852
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,400
First off, the Addams Family movies were awesome that that game was based off of.

853
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,040
And second off, it was just, it was Blaster Master without the blast part.

854
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,020
It was just the overworld parts was all that Fester's Quest was.

855
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,980
So it was still a fun game, even though it was really, really hard.

856
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,240
Was it kooky?

857
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,880
It was mysterious and spooky.

858
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,560
Tarzy XF is one of my oldest friends.

859
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,840
I've known him since I was 12 years old.

860
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,220
I've known him for a very, very long time, since junior high school.

861
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,560
So I remember going to his house and this wasn't necessarily during the holidays, but

862
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,880
just whenever, and we would play Atari 2600 because him and his brother own like at least

863
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,160
what felt like at the time, every Atari 2600 game under the sun.

864
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,840
So I remember we would stay up till ungodly hours playing adventure Pitfall 2.

865
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,800
I think that's where I probably played more Pitfall 2 on the try to 800 than anywhere

866
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
else.

867
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
It's probably over there.

868
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,940
So do you have friends that you'd go over to their house and just play their games till

869
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
you beat them?

870
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,980
Like all night?

871
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,300
We did that with just about every Magnavox Odyssey 2 because my friend had that.

872
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,400
And then we had a Cliquavision though.

873
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,200
We had a Cliquavision before we had any Atari system at home.

874
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,800
RZXF in chat says, God world, we rated Denios regularly for cheap games.

875
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Denios is like the flea market out in Roseville.

876
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,120
And we still do that today, or at least I do.

877
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm pretty sure Neil does too.

878
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,400
Like I still like to go out there today and look for games.

879
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,600
Granted, most of the people there kind of that are selling them kind of know what they're

880
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
worth.

881
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,320
So you don't always really get a good bargain out there.

882
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,520
But I got, I got Goonies 2 for like eight bucks last time I was out there.

883
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,240
So, and that's a great NES game that I didn't own as a kid.

884
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,720
So good times, good times.

885
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
All right.

886
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Anyway, that was a good trip down memory lane.

887
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

888
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

889
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Dark Saga.

890
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,160
I haven't really had a lot of chance to play much of anything.

891
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,360
Just World of Warcraft.

892
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:23,400
But I am now 30 lingering soul fragments in on my quest to save space demon husband elf

893
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,400
boyfriend.

894
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,620
In the game story, this fucking weird story.

895
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,540
And then I finally bought a chopper.

896
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,440
So I have the motorcycle and I have the sands of time.

897
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,620
So that's pretty cool.

898
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
That's really about it.

899
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

900
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
What did we play?

901
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,020
Oh, yeah, I'm playing Pokemon Go.

902
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,460
I finally got a Clefairy.

903
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,460
So yay.

904
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
That's it.

905
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,460
Me too.

906
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
Of course.

907
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,460
But that's it.

908
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Really.

909
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,020
I'm still eating.

910
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,780
You got to make your gaming week longer.

911
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:13,920
I also played chase Midna all over the house and hiccup and OK, OK, I'm done.

912
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,620
Let's see my gaming week.

913
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,180
I played a lot of the same stuff as previous weeks.

914
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,380
I've been continuing with endgame and Final Fantasy 15, which is going back and doing

915
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,720
all the side quests I didn't do in the beginning.

916
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,340
So I'm making my way through that a little bit.

917
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,700
I've been playing other random stuff.

918
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,660
I was playing Crypt of the Necrodancer very randomly last night.

919
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,180
Played a little bit of Overwatch, even though I'm still terrible at that game, but it doesn't

920
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,740
stop me from being bad.

921
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,300
But I did play one new game.

922
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,620
So Alan bought me some games in the Steam sale for Christmas, and one of the games he

923
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,140
bought me is something that's been sitting on my list for the longest time.

924
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,100
It's a game called Grim Dawn is the name of it.

925
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,740
And it was on my wish list because it's a Diablo-esque kind of game.

926
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,980
And so Click Party, one of those types of games, click all the things and get the loot.

927
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,100
So I've been playing that a little bit.

928
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,180
I've always spent maybe like an hour in it, but it's pretty good so far, except for the

929
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,500
fact that it doesn't really handhold you very much, which I understand.

930
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,720
I think it's supposed to be more of a hardcore type of one of those games.

931
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,120
There's a lot of like veteran mode and difficult modes and stuff like that.

932
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,900
So I don't think the game is really meant to handhold you very much, but I would have

933
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,340
just liked a little more explanation to some of the stuff because I guess it's this thing

934
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,860
with those games, and this is true of Diablo as well, is that I want to spec my character

935
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,180
really well from the get-go, but you know you're going to fuck up your first character

936
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,220
really bad, and you're just going to have to play everything over again.

937
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,900
And I feel like that's what I'm doing right now with the current character that I'm running.

938
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,140
But that's okay.

939
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm still having fun with it, and that's the important thing.

940
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,220
And sometimes you just want to pick skills because they're cool.

941
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,540
And I think that's important in a game too, is that you don't necessarily have to min-max everything.

942
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,780
You just want to sometimes play things because they're cool.

943
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:59,020
So like my character, I have a shaman, and my move is throwing bugs at people.

944
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,220
And that's cool.

945
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,300
So I kill people by throwing bugs at them.

946
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,540
And I don't even know, like when I try to look up builds for shaman, I don't see that

947
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,820
move listed anywhere, so it must not be a very efficient move.

948
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,500
But it's fun, and that's what's important.

949
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,820
So I'm throwing a lot of bugs at people in Grim Dawn and finding lots of loot to click on.

950
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,460
So I think that's really about it.

951
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:28,340
Probably Grim Dawn, and I feel like there's some other game I got into randomly this week,

952
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,100
and I can't think of it off the top of my head, and it's probably the alcohol kicking

953
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,420
in a little bit that's doing that to me.

954
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,600
But I feel like I was playing more classic games as well.

955
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
You know what it was?

956
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
What I also played?

957
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,180
Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 I played.

958
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,340
Which for some reason people give a lot of shit compared to the original and the DX Plus

959
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,520
and all that stuff.

960
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,720
Which I understand, because DX Plus is like modern day Pac-Man perfection.

961
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,720
It's frickin' amazing, and it's really hard to improve on that formula.

962
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,700
But I think there's a lot of flashiness, and music is really good in part two, and there's

963
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,800
a lot of stuff to really enjoy about too.

964
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,960
The one flaw is the part where you have to chase the ghosts around the board when the

965
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,200
ghosts are running on rails, and everything amps up at nitro speed, and it can be very

966
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,620
difficult to actually chase the ghosts.

967
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,120
But it looks really cool when you get them.

968
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,560
But that's the only thing, it does throw the rhythm of the game off, and I think that's

969
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,640
where a lot of people have a problem with it.

970
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,720
But otherwise, I like it.

971
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Good stuff.

972
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Alright.

973
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
So that's it for our Game of Weeks.

974
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Yes?

975
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Yes.

976
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Nothing else to mention.

977
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
For now.

978
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Alright.

979
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,600
So I will mention, of course, Twitter.

980
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Follow us on Twitter.

981
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Twitter.com.

982
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Slash O-L-R.

983
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
We're also on Facebook.

984
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Facebook.com.

985
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Slash Orange Lounge Radio.

986
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,400
And as I mentioned earlier in the show, we are here tonight on December 25th doing a

987
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,960
live show for fun for y'all, but we will not be here for the next two weeks live, because

988
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,120
next week is New Year's, there's other stuff going on, and in two weeks, I will be at MAGFest.

989
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,920
So if you're gonna be at MAGFest in the DC area, I highly encourage you to pay attention

990
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,120
to our forums over at vognetwork.com, where SSU100Matt has already started a thread to

991
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,160
try to organize people.

992
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,300
Because I'm not, I don't have like a panel or anything like that, like I'm not, like,

993
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,300
nobody cares.

994
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,300
You're not doing a thing.

995
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,300
No, I'm not doing a thing.

996
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,340
So, but I would like to do some type of like unofficial meetup, or just, just kick back

997
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,360
and play old school video games.

998
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
You know what?

999
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,420
We need to just, we need to find a place to play the Guardian Legend and play it.

1000
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
And cry.

1001
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,420
And cry.

1002
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
And cry.

1003
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,820
Because that's what, the last PAX I ever went to, that's what happened, is that Bobby Blackwolf

1004
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,180
made the mistake of saying, you know, I've never played the Guardian Legend.

1005
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Yes.

1006
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,960
So I said, no, and I said, I looked him right in the eye and I said, we are fucking fixing

1007
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
this right now.

1008
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
And so we went to the classic game room because, you know, it was still early in the day.

1009
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,920
So a lot of people hadn't opened yet.

1010
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,000
And I was like, you know, one car, you have to trade your driver's license, one copy of

1011
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,660
Guardian Legend, please.

1012
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,000
And we went and I made him play it.

1013
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,600
And a good time was had by all.

1014
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Yes.

1015
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,840
And then I played Kid Icarus as far as I could, which I think I got to like the first dungeon

1016
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,400
before I had to kind of give up my seat.

1017
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,520
So we need to do that at MagFest.

1018
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,040
I want to play some old school NES games because Lord knows I can't play the new ones.

1019
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,120
We can try to play the new ones, but I'm trying to sing this song and I'm like losing my place.

1020
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
That's all right.

1021
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Sorry.

1022
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
You've had a little bit to drink.

1023
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
A little?

1024
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
Just a little.

1025
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
Just a little.

1026
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Here, catch.

1027
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
What are you throwing at me?

1028
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Balls.

1029
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
More candy.

1030
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Eat it.

1031
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
I'm into a story now.

1032
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
All right.

1033
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
Yes.

1034
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
Let's get into some news.

1035
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Well, I was just going to see if our chat had anything to say.

1036
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Too bad.

1037
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Our turn.

1038
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Over at live.vognetwork.com.

1039
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
You know what the story is about?

1040
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Pay attention.

1041
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Listen up.

1042
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,720
If you play Overwatch UK.

1043
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Okay.

1044
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm sure everyone knows it by now.

1045
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Tracer's a lesbian.

1046
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,720
She likes to munch carpet.

1047
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Jamie.

1048
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,720
She likes fish tacos.

1049
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Jamie.

1050
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
You're not supposed to say those things.

1051
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,720
She's had a bit to drink.

1052
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
I'm not.

1053
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
I don't think so.

1054
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
I think.

1055
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Well, we live in that culture where everybody gets offended really easy.

1056
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
So you got to watch what you say.

1057
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,320
Well, yeah, but I do too.

1058
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,880
My favorite, my favorite thing I've heard from all this is cheers, love the Calvary

1059
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
is queer.

1060
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,000
That's, that's my favorite thing I've heard from all this.

1061
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,480
And for the record, absolutely no problem with lesbians or anybody, the people I have

1062
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,240
a problem with are assholes.

1063
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Assholes.

1064
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,240
Well, Reaper's kind of an asshole, so does it balance itself out?

1065
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Okay.

1066
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,000
And by the way, didn't we just have a big discussion at the end of last week's show

1067
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,920
that was nothing but cunt.

1068
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,240
I think that was after the show was done recording, but yes.

1069
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
Oops.

1070
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,880
Uh, anyway, uh, I would have mentioned this in chat cause I, I don't, I think this is

1071
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,600
being said very tongue in cheek, but I'm going to address it anyway.

1072
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,200
Santa and Chad over at live.vog network.com says, I read the comic.

1073
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,400
I'm not convinced Tracer is a lesbian.

1074
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,200
British people kiss each other all the time.

1075
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Wasn't that on a forum?

1076
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,000
I think, I think it's tongue in cheek cause I think that was one of those forum posts.

1077
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,040
Did you see the screenshot of the forum posts?

1078
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,520
No, but I don't care because...

1079
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
My favorite.

1080
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,840
I'm a top 500 straight male Overwatch player and all the responses were like, how do you

1081
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
measure that?

1082
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Cause what the guy meant to say was that he was a top 500 player and happened to be a

1083
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,040
straight male.

1084
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,000
But like all the responses were like, how do you prove that you're one of the top 500

1085
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,440
straight males of the planet earth?

1086
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,840
How do you, how do you prove that?

1087
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,040
Is there a, is there a measurement system?

1088
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
A dick litmus test.

1089
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,280
Nope, no gay on this dick.

1090
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,520
This dick has never been in a butt.

1091
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
Wow.

1092
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,200
Jamie cut back on the liquor.

1093
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Jesus.

1094
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
We're going to get emails tonight.

1095
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,880
This show is going to end up on tumblr and I'm going to be embarrassed.

1096
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
All right.

1097
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
Um, so let's see.

1098
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Okay.

1099
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
Again.

1100
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,920
Oh my God.

1101
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
What?

1102
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,320
First of all, you see now I'm sober again.

1103
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Okay.

1104
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,920
Because it's like a switch so you just turn on and off.

1105
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
It is pretty much.

1106
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,280
I have to drink some more.

1107
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,160
First of all, everyone who's listened to the show knows that I will say whatever I want

1108
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,200
whenever I want for whatever reason I want that are only known to me.

1109
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,840
That doesn't make it okay.

1110
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Number two.

1111
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
You're problematic.

1112
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,440
Number two, everyone who listens to this show knows that I am a very tolerant person that

1113
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,280
judges nobody unless they have earned my judgment.

1114
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
With bad grammar.

1115
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,800
With bad grammar or for being a dick.

1116
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:52,320
But there are certain things that people need to learn of intent.

1117
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,280
So now I'm going to go back and talk about the lesbian.

1118
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,200
Okay, wait, I have to address this comment in chat.

1119
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,120
Barb, my favorite character from Stranger Things in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com

1120
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,280
says Xtaphir is a top 500 gay, no T all shade.

1121
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,920
Barb, although I appreciate you being here, let's be real, Xtaphir is not a top anything.

1122
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,440
Oh, come on.

1123
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,720
That comment invited itself.

1124
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Come on.

1125
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Come on.

1126
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,280
By the way, if you want to edit all of that out.

1127
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,040
I'm not editing anything.

1128
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Come on.

1129
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Whatever.

1130
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,720
Anyway, let's talk about.

1131
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,720
Let's talk about.

1132
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Tracer.

1133
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Yes, she's gay.

1134
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
The comment from Santa.

1136
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,720
The foreign post.

1137
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,720
Important.

1138
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,000
But it's wrong.

1139
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
One of the right.

1140
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
No, it's not.

1141
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It's absolutely right.

1142
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,600
One of the writers came out and said, Tracer identifies as lesbian.

1143
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,800
Michael Chu said it.

1144
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
There.

1145
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,800
Thank you.

1146
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
The senior game designer.

1147
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
That's it.

1148
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Thank you.

1149
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
He is her God.

1150
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,240
And he made her gay.

1151
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,960
She didn't choose to be gay.

1152
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,040
She was born that way.

1153
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,080
So fuck off.

1154
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,080
Top 500 straight males of the world.

1155
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,320
Top 500 straight.

1156
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Dick lit.

1157
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Miss test.

1158
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,320
It's the Dick.

1159
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,660
Well, this is okay.

1160
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:18,480
So this is a big deal because Tracer is kind of the poster child for Overwatch.

1161
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,160
I mean, there's a few things you can say about this.

1162
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,440
I mean, one of my favorite comments I've seen on this is, well, isn't everybody in

1163
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,440
Overwatch gay?

1164
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,560
And, you know, that's probably true.

1165
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,040
But the fact that Tracer is the one that's on the box and Tracer's, you know, was the

1166
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,200
very first hero in one of the trailers, right?

1167
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,200
Maybe Winston.

1168
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Maybe Winston.

1169
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,760
But she's the poster girl for Overwatch.

1170
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,720
And you know, Overwatch is the biggest game of 2016 in many different ways.

1171
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,500
And for them to come out and be like, oh, by the way, Tracer just happens to be gay.

1172
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:56,620
You know, I think was, was a great thing for, and people always want to have this fucking

1173
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,740
argument about, does it matter?

1174
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,740
You know, it doesn't matter.

1175
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,900
Why can't she just stay in the closet and all this stuff?

1176
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,900
No.

1177
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,580
No one should have to fucking stay in the fucking closet, which is why I am being as

1178
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,140
fucking crude as I can be.

1179
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,060
Doesn't everybody like to see themselves a little bit?

1180
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,620
Why don't you go back to your little closet?

1181
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,660
Doesn't everybody like to see themselves a little bit in a game somewhere?

1182
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,420
Do straight people have a basement maybe?

1183
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,220
There are top 500 straights in almost every single video game.

1184
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:32,520
So let the lesbian gamers out there, and believe me, there are some lesbian gamers out there

1185
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
that will kick your ass.

1186
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,720
Hey, we finally have ace representation.

1187
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,720
Do we?

1188
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
Maya.

1189
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,060
In, um, uh, uh, Borderlands.

1190
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,460
Oh, that's right.

1191
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,220
I asked at gamer X.

1192
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,220
Yeah.

1193
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,220
And her God said.

1194
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,220
Yeah.

1195
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,680
Do you talk to, do you talk to gods often in your thoughts, um, created these worlds

1196
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
there.

1197
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
Let me finish my thought.

1198
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,680
Well, fine.

1199
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,700
My thought was seeing yourself reflected in video games.

1200
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,700
Yes.

1201
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
That's important.

1202
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,860
Why do people have the whole create your character mode and why do people razz those, create

1203
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,940
your character modes when it's missing obvious things like, you know, the ability to change

1204
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,980
your skin color and things like that, because people want to be able to see themselves in

1205
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,980
games.

1206
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,980
Representation of sexuality is, is really a great thing.

1207
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,100
Representation of different skin colors, men and women and gender and all that stuff.

1208
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,420
These are all great things.

1209
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:28,380
And again, and I can't stress this enough because people always think like, Oh my God,

1210
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,580
they're taking over and there's not going to be any top 500 straight characters left.

1211
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,980
And that's not the case.

1212
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,980
Nobody is saying to take away characters.

1213
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,340
You don't need to take away anything.

1214
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,500
Just add a little bit of rainbow.

1215
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,580
I like this one person's quote on Twitter.

1216
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,060
I love Tracer's new voice line.

1217
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,860
I am gay and playing as me makes you gay.

1218
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,860
And how her alt sends an email to your dad that reads, dad I'm gay.

1219
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:00,260
Well, and that's the other side of it is that, you know, if there's that whole perception

1220
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,820
of, well, she doesn't need to announce to the world that she's gay or whatever, well

1221
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:08,180
then by that same fucking matter, then by that same token, playing as her in the game

1222
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:14,020
means nothing except you're a cheap motherfucker because I always get killed by fucking Tracer.

1223
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,860
I can't stand her, but has nothing to do with the fact that she's a lesbian that just has

1224
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,700
everything to do with the fact that she's cheap.

1225
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:26,820
Well, and I mean, it's just, and this is the thing.

1226
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,180
It's everyone needs to have something that's going to tie them to the world of the game.

1227
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,740
Something that makes the characters live for them.

1228
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,740
You know?

1229
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,420
True, true facts.

1230
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,860
The first time I played Mass Effect, I wasn't into it.

1231
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,940
Like somebody, it must have been somebody driving the Mako in Mass Effect 1 or something

1232
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,340
where I, you know, one of the like not so great parts of Mass Effect 1 where I must

1233
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,740
have been like, eh, I'm not really into this game.

1234
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:59,260
It wasn't until somebody said, did you know that in this game you can have like a male

1235
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:05,260
male relationship and it's really well done and it's thought out and it's not like ridiculous

1236
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,700
or you know, like totally like token or whatever.

1237
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,340
It's just, it's something that feels very natural to the plot and all that stuff.

1238
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,500
That made me interested in playing the game because yes, I wanted to see that represented

1239
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
in a game somewhere.

1240
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:24,020
I wanted to, I was like, wow, that's a story that I would like to hear more about, right?

1241
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:30,380
So that got me to play Mass Effect and now I love Mass Effect and that's one of many

1242
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,660
reasons why I love Mass Effect.

1243
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,820
Mass Effect is a great fucking game for a variety of reasons.

1244
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,420
That is one of them.

1245
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:47,900
I also think that apart from just the representation factor, you know, the one thing that is going

1246
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:53,100
to attract a person to the game or make someone go, Hey, this game has someone like me in

1247
00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:04,380
it is the fact that it's also acknowledgement that it's not abnormal, that it shouldn't

1248
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,380
matter.

1249
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,900
Now, Tiger Claw on Chat says, let's not forget, Tracer was the one who was in the middle of

1250
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,020
controversy because of her butt pose.

1251
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,620
You remember that a few weeks or a few weeks ago, a few months ago, it was actually before

1252
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,340
Overwatch was out, but there was a pose that somebody had made a post and kind of complained

1253
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,420
about it a little bit.

1254
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,420
And Blizzard said, you know, we were kind of thinking about changing it anyway.

1255
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,980
And they changed it back.

1256
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:31,100
And then everybody, all of a sudden, everybody piped up out of, out of, out of all the different

1257
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,660
ends of Twitter and stuff saying, you shouldn't change it.

1258
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,020
Stick to your vision, stick to what you had planned and all this stuff.

1259
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,900
And now Tracer comes out of the closet and it's like, well, maybe you shouldn't stick

1260
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,900
to your vision.

1261
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,900
And you know what?

1262
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:48,260
People are going to be offended.

1263
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,260
It happens.

1264
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,780
And the things that you shouldn't, that you should take to heart for offense are when

1265
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,260
people truly intend to be fucking offensive.

1266
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,380
When people are trying to repress your rights.

1267
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:07,500
When people are trying to tear down the programs that help us and keep us alive.

1268
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,980
When people are trying to ruin the world that we live in and make it only safe for people

1269
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,420
who fit one mold.

1270
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,740
Those are the people that you should offend the ever living fuck out of.

1271
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,860
So do it.

1272
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,140
And you know what?

1273
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:30,740
If they get offended by a lady in a fictional environment who loves other women and likes

1274
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:37,460
to smooch and do other things in bed, put it, rub it in their fucking face.

1275
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,900
Blizzard is never going to go into detail about that because it's, it's just not important.

1276
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,380
But I can picture it and it's kind of hot.

1277
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:48,820
So anyway, you take that and you rub it in their fucking face.

1278
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,660
This is your reality.

1279
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:56,040
You cannot live in your little closed bubble, closets don't exist dream.

1280
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,340
Fuck you.

1281
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,860
That's how I feel.

1282
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:01,860
I was going to say something.

1283
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,580
I was just going to rile you up even more.

1284
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,580
Do it.

1285
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,580
Rile me.

1286
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,580
Here, I'll drink some more.

1287
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:13,900
But Dark Sakura, in my America now, I get to build a wall and I get to wall off those

1288
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,180
images.

1289
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,620
And make Mexico pay for it.

1290
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,620
Moving on.

1291
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:26,620
Havoc978 in chat says, if only people cared about the payload this much, amen.

1292
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,060
Amen.

1293
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,060
You know what?

1294
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,060
Two glasses in.

1295
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,400
All right, let's move on to another story.

1296
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,640
Let's move on to something else that talks about, hey, the Legend of Zelda, Link to the

1297
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,640
Past.

1298
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,640
That's right.

1299
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,640
This hot new game.

1300
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,440
This hot new game that all the kids are getting under the trees this Christmas.

1301
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,220
All right.

1302
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,940
So here's the thing.

1303
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,880
This I don't know why this is making the rounds this week on the blogs, but it is because

1304
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,840
it comes from an interview from January 1992.

1305
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:03,160
But people unearth things and it is kind of cool and it's worth talking about because

1306
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,520
this is a legendary game.

1307
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,520
So here it is.

1308
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:12,600
This was a Famicom Soushin interview with Shigeru Miyamoto.

1309
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,000
And they were talking about what other ideas for Link to the Past had to be cut because

1310
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,080
of the eight megabyte limitation.

1311
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,760
Miyamoto says a lot.

1312
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,260
You can't just throw every good idea you have in a game.

1313
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,720
The idea has to connect up with something else in the game and there needs to be consistency

1314
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,720
between the ideas.

1315
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,920
There was a ton more we wanted to do.

1316
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,640
And when pressed, Miyamoto said, one idea was with the lantern.

1317
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,400
If you used it on a grassy area, it would cause a huge brush fire.

1318
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,440
If you cut a little circle of grass around you, you could safely stand there in the middle

1319
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,440
of it.

1320
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,600
That sounds kind of cool.

1321
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:51,060
I'm all for starting fire in games.

1322
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:56,120
And then when pressed further, anything else, Miyamoto said in swamp areas, you could use

1323
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,240
a shovel to dig a ditch.

1324
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,480
And then if you bombed the swamp breakwater, it would cause the water to rush in the hole

1325
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,600
you dug.

1326
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,720
The idea was actually half complete.

1327
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,360
If we had another six months, we might have been able to make it a reality.

1328
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:16,720
So kind of neat, and I just like these sorts of tidbits because I like to hear about what

1329
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,200
really went into these games.

1330
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,920
This reminds me of a story a couple weeks ago about how Super Mario Brothers 3 was originally,

1331
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,440
they were designing it as overhead.

1332
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,000
You remember we talked about that on the show?

1333
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,920
So I like these little tidbits about old games and hearing how things transformed and things

1334
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,580
that had to get cut and all that stuff.

1335
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:38,220
It's the type of stories I'd like to hear also about Final Fantasy 15, because we all

1336
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,120
know stuff got cut in Final Fantasy 15.

1337
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,840
So I'd kind of like to hear about some of the decisions they made and why they did it.

1338
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:49,240
So anyway, just kind of a cool, like, this is something that could have been, but it's

1339
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,880
not type of story.

1340
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,880
That's it.

1341
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Dr. Sakura.

1342
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,040
Valve owes some money.

1343
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,040
Money.

1344
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,400
Valve owes us any game starting with the number three.

1345
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:09,840
Valve owes us a freaking Half-Life 3 already, but they have actually been found guilty by

1346
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:16,680
the Australian Federal Court by the, well, at the Australian Federal, I can't make words

1347
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:22,280
happen, Rob, by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC.

1348
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,600
They were guilty of violating consumer law in Australia.

1349
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:38,400
And so now they, last month, they said that Valve's fine for the breaches should reach

1350
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,280
around three million Australian dollars, which is about two point fifteen million United

1351
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,000
States dollars.

1352
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,680
And the judge basically is like, yep, we think that's right.

1353
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:59,640
So now they have, have to make that payment for it.

1354
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:07,400
So it's like, basically what happened is that if a game or a product is deemed effective,

1355
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,720
defective or not acceptable quality or unfit, then the consumer is entitled a refund.

1356
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:20,380
And so there were many refunds that Valve did not allow through or did not process.

1357
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,980
And so that's where all that money has to go.

1358
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:31,760
So and then along with the fine, Valve actually has to put up a link on the Steam homepage

1359
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,580
in a typeface of at least 14 points, times New Roman.

1360
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,420
Who the fuck uses time to New Roman?

1361
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,420
Seriously?

1362
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,420
Romans.

1363
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,420
They're dead.

1364
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,420
New ones.

1365
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,420
Oh, New Romans.

1366
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,420
Okay.

1367
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,460
You know, you know where that font came from?

1368
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,460
Rome?

1369
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,940
Supposed to be for the New York Times.

1370
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,940
Oh, okay.

1371
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Anyway.

1372
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,500
True story.

1373
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,100
So anyway, they have to make that visible to anyone who opens that page within Australia.

1374
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:09,220
So but Valve hasn't been sentenced to any kind of death, booting, as they call it.

1375
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,780
So whatever.

1376
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:18,660
They are, but they have implemented a refund policy in August as of last year.

1377
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,100
You know, we were just talking about this a little bit last week on the show.

1378
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,860
The whole backlash against Valve, which I guess, I don't know if this really plays into

1379
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,940
that or not, but it's just very interesting to see how like Steam kind of, and especially

1380
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,180
with the sale just having happened on Steam, I mean, a lot of people are participating

1381
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,560
and involved, but I don't know, it hasn't felt like the big event that it used to.

1382
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,560
And I don't know if that's because of Humble Bundle or Good Old Games, the fact that there's

1383
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,860
other options now, or just the fact that, you know, I think people are starting to get

1384
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:52,820
a little irritated that Valve will not make a Half-Life 3, a Portal 3, a Left 4 Dead 3,

1385
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,260
or really anything at all that isn't Dota.

1386
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,580
Or the Vive stuff, which, you know, funny because now I'm naming all these things that

1387
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:07,340
are out there, but if you can't afford a Vive, then that stuff might as well not exist.

1388
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:13,740
And Dota is a very kind of specific sort of game that not everybody's into, so, you know,

1389
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:20,180
I just feel like Valve really needs to, needs to come back and do a game that everybody

1390
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,180
can get into.

1391
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,180
You know what I mean?

1392
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,180
Yes.

1393
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:28,100
Well, Valve has until February 20th to appeal.

1394
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,100
Whether or not they will.

1395
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,100
Which they probably will.

1396
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,100
Everybody appeals.

1397
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,100
Yeah.

1398
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,340
I will appeal to you for crackers if you have any.

1399
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,340
I don't, I don't know if we do it.

1400
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,340
You'll have to bug Allen.

1401
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,340
Why don't you have crackers?

1402
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,340
We might.

1403
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,340
There might be like-

1404
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,340
You knew this was happening.

1405
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,340
There might, go raid that little-

1406
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,340
Waffles!

1407
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,940
Stoop waffle?

1408
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,940
No I don't.

1409
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,940
Because that shit was good.

1410
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,940
Alright.

1411
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,940
I don't want to drink the rest of the wine bottle by myself.

1412
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:55,020
VXJ6V in chat says, everybody didn't get into Half Life, nor Portal, not Team Fortress 2,

1413
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,060
nor are they all into Dota 2 either.

1414
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:00,060
Was there nothing in the orange box?

1415
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,560
Nothing in the orange box to satiate you?

1416
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:07,220
But if, okay, maybe if that's the case though, then you're not also chomping at the bit for

1417
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,140
Valve to make something new.

1418
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,820
I mean, when was the last time Valve put out a console game?

1419
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:16,220
When was the last time Valve put out a console game?

1420
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,220
Portal 2, right?

1421
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,220
Yeah.

1422
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,220
Now how long ago was that?

1423
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:21,220
A while.

1424
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,220
A while.

1425
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,220
So, just saying.

1426
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,220
It's been a little while.

1427
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,220
It was first Xbox, wasn't it?

1428
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,580
Uh, Portal?

1429
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,580
Portal 1 was-

1430
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,580
The orange box.

1431
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,580
Oh, the orange box was first Xbox.

1432
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,580
Yeah.

1433
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,580
Well, and PC.

1434
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,580
And then Portal 2.

1435
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,580
PC.

1436
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,580
Obviously PC.

1437
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,580
But, yeah.

1438
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,580
Alright, anyway.

1439
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,580
Uh, let's see.

1440
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,020
Let's talk about.

1441
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,540
I want to talk about streaming software and websites and stuff.

1442
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,100
Because, you know, all the talk is always about Twitch.

1443
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,580
But there's other stuff out there.

1444
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,060
You know, YouTube gaming.

1445
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,020
And this other new site kind of caught my eye this week.

1446
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,940
Which I thought was interesting.

1447
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,740
And I'm curious what you guys think about this website.

1448
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,140
I want to talk about Beam.

1449
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,580
Have you heard about Beam?

1450
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:05,020
Beam is a newer video game streaming website.

1451
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,820
It's beam.pro is where you can find it.

1452
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:12,060
And Beam was bought by Microsoft not that long ago.

1453
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,700
So Beam is now a Microsoft property.

1454
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,660
And Beam did these big updates today.

1455
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,940
Or, not today, but in this past week, saying that they are readying their live streaming

1456
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,460
service for Xbox and Windows.

1457
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,940
And I guess that went out in beta.

1458
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,780
Although I haven't seen it yet.

1459
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:35,600
I've just seen what's on their website and on their iPhone app and all that stuff.

1460
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,200
But Beam's big thing, if you don't know, and this is why I'm kind of into it.

1461
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,200
They're really big on interaction.

1462
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,120
They want to really be about interactive streams.

1463
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:51,600
So they're testing this low latency thing where, you know, just within seconds, not

1464
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,920
even seconds, what you see on the video, you can respond to and chat and you can have more

1465
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
of a real...

1466
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,560
It's kind of like the way Twitch used to be back when it first started until they got

1467
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,560
really big.

1468
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,680
But then, as I understand it, Twitch kind of...

1469
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,800
You can enable a mode now on Twitch where you can kind of go back to that.

1470
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,840
But I think there is still a latency of probably like 10 seconds.

1471
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,580
Beam, I think, is trying to get it lower than that.

1472
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:17,800
And then, as you watch these streams on Beam, you get little credits, like little lightning

1473
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,360
bolt credits, that you can then use to interact with streams.

1474
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,760
You can play little sound clips, or I don't know what all goes into it.

1475
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,520
But you can do these little interactions.

1476
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:33,120
But then, as I understand it, they're also encouraging game designers to design games

1477
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,400
where people could make things spawn in the game.

1478
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,620
And you've seen a little bit of this already with stuff, and again, over on Twitch, with

1479
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:45,680
things like the Jackbox Party Pack, what, Tomb Raider had some of this as well, right?

1480
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,240
So you're seeing this already, but Beam really wants to kind of focus that and play it out

1481
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,000
in a very low latency environment.

1482
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So I just...

1483
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I think it's interesting.

1484
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,280
The competition stuff is very interesting.

1485
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,280
Beam is also talking about that the max bitrate is now 10 megabits per second and supports

1486
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:09,720
60 frames a second rendering speed up to 2,560 by 1440 resolution.

1487
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,360
So whoo.

1488
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:16,040
Also a new homepage and all this other stuff, HTML5 player that eliminates Flash, better

1489
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,280
video on demand playback, and all this stuff.

1490
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:23,040
They are saying that Xbox One and Windows support is coming sometime in the winter,

1491
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,160
and there will be new hybrid applications to mobile in 2017.

1492
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:35,520
Beam right now, 100,000 monthly users as of August, Twitch, 100 million.

1493
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,240
So there's quite a few more people on Twitch than Beam.

1494
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,180
But the competition stuff is always interesting.

1495
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,960
It's interesting to see what they might come up with.

1496
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,960
I've used the website.

1497
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,200
I actually signed up for an account over there just to check it out and poke around.

1498
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,680
It's a slick interface.

1499
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
It's very flashy.

1500
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,360
I like the interface over there.

1501
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,520
And I do like the gamification of the streams.

1502
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:00,240
I do think that's a neat concept, and I really want to see what they do with that more.

1503
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,560
Because I feel like, you know, yeah, Twitch supports it, but Beam feels like it's built

1504
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,560
around it.

1505
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,720
So I think that's kind of neat.

1506
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,320
I want to see what they do with that.

1507
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,320
Over in chat, everybody in chat is like, BLEAM?

1508
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,760
Are you talking about BLEAM?

1509
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,080
No, I'm not talking about a fucking emulator on the Dreamcast.

1510
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,080
It's something else.

1511
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,660
BLEAM was an up-rezzing thing.

1512
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,640
And Tekken 3 for BLEAMcast was pretty cool.

1513
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,640
So there you go.

1514
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,640
Let's see.

1515
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,080
AkumaJP in chat says, bought by Microsoft.

1516
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,560
Another great software going into the abyss.

1517
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:37,480
Look, you knew Microsoft was not going to sit by and watch Amazon run the show.

1518
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,600
Amazon and Google, I guess, because YouTube gave me.

1519
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,960
They're not going to sit by and watch those two run the show.

1520
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,800
And yes, I know there's other things like Hitbox, but I would bet the user numbers of

1521
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,640
those bases are probably similar to where Beam is at, right?

1522
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,400
So Dungeon Buster says, the delay is noticeably lower versus Twitch.

1523
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,200
VXJ6V says, I expect very little to come out of those features on BLEAM.

1524
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,480
And Kaijuto says, BLEAM sucks too.

1525
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,600
I'm assuming Kaijuto thinks they all suck.

1526
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,600
I'm just assuming.

1527
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
I don't know.

1528
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,800
You just can't please some people.

1529
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:14,280
Dungeon Buster says, a streamer I used to watch went over to BLEAM because of the community

1530
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,720
tools alone.

1531
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:21,640
See, that's going to be what's interesting, because if BLEAM can woo the big Twitch people

1532
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,700
over, at least enough of them, that's how you're going to really get competitive.

1533
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,620
Same thing with YouTube gaming, right?

1534
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:30,460
So I'm just, I'm curious to see how this plays out.

1535
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:35,800
You know, like back probably what, three years ago before YouTube got into this, I know I

1536
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,400
sat here on the show and went, why is nobody trying to compete against Twitch?

1537
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,280
Why does Twitch run this show all by themselves?

1538
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,000
What is, what's going on here?

1539
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,820
So I kind of think a lot of these people are showing up late to the party, but if you can

1540
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:56,180
woo people over with the right features, hey, MySpace, we all thought that was going

1541
01:04:56,180 --> 01:05:00,140
to be a thing forever at one point, and LiveJournal, we all thought that was going to be a thing

1542
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,140
forever.

1543
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,940
And well, LiveJournal still exists.

1544
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,460
Not that I'm saying Twitch is going to suffer the same fate.

1545
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,300
That's not what I'm saying, but I'm just saying none of this stuff is invincible, right?

1546
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,780
With the right features and all this stuff, it could be a different internet tomorrow.

1547
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,740
So I'm going to keep my eye on it.

1548
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,740
I'm just curious.

1549
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:21,900
I'm still, I don't know, I'm still into Twitch, but I like what I'm seeing at Beam.

1550
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,140
I'm just kind of curious what develops when they put out the Xbox app and all this other

1551
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,140
stuff.

1552
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,140
They'll grow up.

1553
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,140
We'll see.

1554
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,140
We'll see what happens as they, as they age and all of that.

1555
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,140
Oh.

1556
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,140
Let's move on.

1557
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,140
How about something that has nothing to do with aging?

1558
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,140
Dragon Quest.

1559
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,220
Well, that series is getting older.

1560
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,220
Well, yeah.

1561
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,220
So are we all.

1562
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:46,380
Anyway, Dragon Quest is actually going to be involved with the Universal Studios Nintendo

1563
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,380
thing that's going to happen.

1564
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:52,180
They're doing something called Real Battle Attraction that will involve getting weapons,

1565
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,380
going into dungeons and battling monsters.

1566
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:04,780
It's also going to be, I guess, overseen by Ryutaro Ichimura, who is the general producer

1567
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,320
of the series so that it's authentic.

1568
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,020
So it'll be great.

1569
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,580
It'll be fun.

1570
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,300
And I want to go.

1571
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,200
So someone send me a ticket right now.

1572
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,440
So you need kukurumis and a trip to Japan.

1573
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,440
I need.

1574
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,280
Oh, I'll just deal with the trip to Japan.

1575
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,160
And then we can have Orange Lounge video.

1576
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,160
Yeah.

1577
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,960
It'll be Orange Lounge Travelo.

1578
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,520
All right.

1579
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,720
Moving on to an article about the NES Mini, which obviously has been a big thing this

1580
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,020
holiday season.

1581
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:40,460
The NES Mini has sold in 30 days what the Wii U sold in six months.

1582
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,460
That's right.

1583
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:49,380
The NES Mini has sold 196,000 units were sold.

1584
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,640
That's just in November.

1585
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,260
That's not even counting December.

1586
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,140
And of course, I'm going to make the obvious reference here.

1587
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,740
Just imagine how many more of these they would have sold if they could have kept these fucking

1588
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:05,280
things on shelves and actually made the amount of NES Minis to match the demand for the Wii

1589
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:10,500
or to match the demand that was out there, basically.

1590
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:16,920
So yeah, by comparison, Nintendo shifted 220,000 of the Wii U's in a six-month period.

1591
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:21,480
So a little bit more of the Wii U, but honestly, that's pretty crazy.

1592
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:29,880
Also, by the way, 261,000 units of the Mini Famicom sold in Japan in one week.

1593
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,880
Crazy.

1594
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,960
Well, we'll see.

1595
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:38,880
I'm curious to see what this plays out in in January or in February or so forth.

1596
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,640
If they're able to keep these things on shelves, if people are still buying them, what it looks

1597
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,780
like.

1598
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:48,800
But it does have me thinking, you know, if Nintendo really wants to sell a lot of these

1599
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:55,840
Nintendo Switches, maybe they should consider, maybe not necessarily building in the classic

1600
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:02,260
NES Mini, but maybe they should just consider bundling in 30 classic games into the Switch

1601
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,260
by default.

1602
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:08,580
And yes, look, I understand Nintendo can make a lot of money off virtual console games because

1603
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:12,400
people are still going to buy Zelda Link to the Past no matter how many times you put

1604
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,400
it out there.

1605
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:19,800
But just imagine if Nintendo would just reach to their catalog, pull out 30 games from the

1606
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:26,860
NES and package it all into the Nintendo Switch and say, hey, and it's part of being an early

1607
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:31,000
adopter of the Nintendo Switch, you know, kind of like the 3DS Ambassador thing, I guess,

1608
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
even though the Ambassador program was to save that console from flopping.

1609
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,280
Imagine if they just said with the Nintendo Switch, hey, if you buy this console in the

1610
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:43,380
first year, you're going to get 30 games free, classic.

1611
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:48,180
I mean, I think the Switch would stand to sell very well, just like the NES Mini, because

1612
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:53,680
again, these strong games clearly are pushing the consoles.

1613
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,960
It's really just blow my mind that the classic NES Mini sold as well as it did.

1614
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,500
And I think a lot of that is probably, you know, 30 something parents who grew up with

1615
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,300
these systems buying this stuff so their kids could play the same games they did when

1616
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,300
they were their age.

1617
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,480
I think there's a lot of that going on.

1618
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:19,120
So actdeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Switch is $300 and for day one buyers

1619
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,780
you'll get 30 NES classics for virtual console.

1620
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:24,380
Honestly, that's the way for Nintendo to do it.

1621
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:29,340
Although I wouldn't do day one buyers, because you know they're not, that you know, you know

1622
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,040
there's going to be stock problems.

1623
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,660
Don't make the stock problems worse.

1624
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:41,860
But maybe like, for the rest of 2017 or something, through holiday 2017, all those people are

1625
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,340
going to get the classic games.

1626
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,620
But vidpower in chat brings up another good point.

1627
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,600
The NES Classic Mini is also attractive due to its price point, right?

1628
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,160
It's only 60 bucks.

1629
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,360
You know, the Switch is going to be like 250, $300.

1630
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,560
But again, I think at least if Nintendo, you know, can throw in some of their back catalog

1631
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:05,280
to really sweeten the pot, Nintendo really needs to stop this shit of one to two virtual

1632
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,280
console releases a week.

1633
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:10,600
I mean, they can continue to do that, but they need to launch their system.

1634
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:15,440
The Switch ought to fucking launch with 50 virtual console games in the pool.

1635
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,320
Even if they don't give them away, they ought to have like 50 games waiting to be picked

1636
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,320
up.

1637
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,000
Like, don't, and they did this on the Wii U, they waited way too fucking long on the

1638
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,440
Wii U for this.

1639
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:31,860
Switch needs to do this day one virtual console and a lot of games and some free games to

1640
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,600
sweeten the pot.

1641
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,480
And if that sells more hardware, then you know what?

1642
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,360
Nintendo's going to win in the long run.

1643
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,360
So.

1644
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,360
Nintendo already wins.

1645
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,360
In my heart.

1646
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:48,200
Tarsi XF in chat says, also appliance-like nature, instant play, no updates.

1647
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,460
Great point.

1648
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:55,140
If this Switch is at home and connected to Wi-Fi, it should download the fucking updates

1649
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,940
while it's sleeping and then update itself.

1650
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:02,100
I mean, the 3DS kind of does this, so we know Nintendo is capable.

1651
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:05,580
Except even with the 3DS, you have to wait.

1652
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,840
Like you have to acknowledge that the update's about to begin and you have to wait.

1653
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,180
And I'm assuming the reason they do this is because many people put their games right

1654
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,780
in the middle of the game and then sleep their 3DS.

1655
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,180
And if it were to do a system upgrade while you're right in the middle of a game, you'd

1656
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,880
lose your progress in that game.

1657
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:24,140
So I can kind of understand that, but I think the Switch should have something set up so

1658
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:28,780
that if you're not in the middle of a game or you're on the main menu or something, that

1659
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,100
it should update automatically.

1660
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,900
It should just do it.

1661
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:33,540
That would be very important.

1662
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,900
Dark Tetsuya says, I think the Wii U kind of does it too.

1663
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,540
It does, but not with the software.

1664
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:43,740
And I know this because I actually, I forgot to mention this earlier, I played Super Smash

1665
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:47,780
Brothers on Wii U for the first time in months this week.

1666
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:52,500
And we put in the disc, we were ready to play, and had to wait for it to update.

1667
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,940
Now granted, it didn't take very long for it to update, thank gosh, but it's no fun

1668
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:00,520
to sit there and wait for the fucking thing to update when you're ready to play.

1669
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,420
So yes, these things should do it while the device is asleep.

1670
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,420
I like that.

1671
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,420
Appliance-like nature.

1672
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,420
That is important.

1673
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,960
All right.

1674
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,960
You know what?

1675
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,960
We need to take a trip back.

1676
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,580
We need to go back to a time when it was simpler.

1677
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,700
And there was no updates.

1678
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,220
You got what you got with your system, and if you didn't like it, too bad.

1679
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:26,660
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

1680
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:29,900
you need to play this game, or I hate you.

1681
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,140
I hate everybody anyway, Rob.

1682
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,060
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1683
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,480
The game is Tapper.

1684
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,380
I figured it was appropriate for tonight, even though we have drunk no beer at all.

1685
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,500
No, this is a great choice.

1686
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,500
I love this.

1687
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,500
This is one of my favorite classic games, like ever.

1688
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,500
I'm surprised I haven't done it either, but I'm getting to that point, you know?

1689
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:51,180
I'm also very surprised that I recognize the name of this game when it's not Root Beer Tapper,

1690
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,260
because all I ever played was Root Beer Tapper.

1691
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,540
I don't think I ever played just Tapper.

1692
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:03,380
Well, the difference with the two, I mean, Tapper came out in 1983 by Bally Midway, and

1693
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:08,020
basically you play as a bartender, and you have to serve your patrons and collect the

1694
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:10,700
empty mugs and your tips.

1695
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:16,340
Tapper was called Tapper because it was associated with Budweiser.

1696
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:25,300
When the Budweiser branding expired in 1984, they did Root Beer Tapper, and it was developed

1697
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:32,220
specifically for arcades because the original version was considered advertising alcohol

1698
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,220
to minors.

1699
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:36,780
Yeah, I always thought that's why they did Root Beer Tapper in the first place.

1700
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,220
I never realized it was a licensed thing.

1701
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,780
I mean, I figured the licensing came into play later.

1702
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:43,940
It was apparently a licensed thing, but they also did it so that it would be able to be

1703
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:51,980
had in more arcades, or as Tapper was supposed to be more like four bars or adult-oriented

1704
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:54,420
locations, you know?

1705
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,060
Like titty bars.

1706
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:08,180
I guess, but it was, the patent for it was filed in 1984 covering the game and its variants.

1707
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:15,780
Tapper was also ported to the Atari 8-bit machines, the Atari 5200, Atari 2600, BBC

1708
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:24,740
Micro, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, and IBM PC and Amstrad CPC.

1709
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:32,820
Most of the home versions had a Mountain Dew logo, but had the bartender of the original

1710
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:37,840
arcade game instead of the soda jerk from Root Beer Tapper.

1711
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:45,440
It had four different bars that you would play in, and so patrons would basically arrive

1712
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,280
at the end of the bar and then want their drink, and then you have to serve their drink.

1713
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:56,000
They slide their mug back, and you refill the mug, and you go serve more booze, or root

1714
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
booze.

1715
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Root beer.

1716
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Root beer!

1717
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Did I say root booze?

1718
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Oh my god.

1719
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,680
So anyway, your goal is to push the customer completely off the screen, but if they are

1720
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,840
not they will stay and drink their drink where they are.

1721
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,720
And so when the customer finishes the drink, he slides the mug back, and you keep going.

1722
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:22,440
So you basically have to keep taking care of all of your customers.

1723
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:29,360
You have different settings, you have the western bar with a couple of cowboys, and

1724
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:34,920
you have a sports bar with athletes, a punk bar with punk rockers, and a space bar with

1725
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,920
aliens.

1726
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,600
It's like, really.

1727
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,720
I think I've seen the alien level one time on the 360 version of this game.

1728
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:48,040
Well and of course the first version of the game was sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, so they

1729
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:56,480
had the Budweiser logo in the back, and the machine was supposed to be sold to bars with

1730
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,160
the cabinets that looked like bars.

1731
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:04,060
And actually, if for anyone who's ever watched John's Arcade, he has a tapper behind him

1732
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:09,100
that has the classic side panel art that looks like the old school, or the old timey

1733
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,100
bartender.

1734
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:15,500
You know, like a saloon bartender.

1735
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:20,900
And they also, some of the machines were designed to look like bars with brass rail footrests

1736
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,860
and drink holders.

1737
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:29,180
And the first machines had controllers that looked like Budweiser beer tap handles, and

1738
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:35,740
then they were replaced by cheaper beer taps with the Budweiser logo on them.

1739
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:46,260
The music, though, was created by Ricky Cardo, who was the sound designer, who also was supposed

1740
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:53,740
to be a pretty talented musician, and he used a proprietary sound synthesizer that was developed

1741
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,700
at Marvin Glass and Associates for all the sound effects and music, and it was called

1742
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:06,460
the Synclavier 2 Sound Synthesizer, which was pretty much a professional synth that

1743
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:10,500
contained a 16-bit computer and synthesizer keyboard in it.

1744
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:17,620
So it was pretty crazy, for its time, sound design that was with it.

1745
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:26,300
And this one was, instead of creating the music by a molten code, it was actually recorded

1746
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,180
on the keyboard first and then recorded directly into memory and burned directly into the ROM.

1747
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:42,620
So it had different versions of Oh Susanna and Buffalo Gals and The Can Can.

1748
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,700
So the music in that was fairly unique for its time.

1749
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:53,900
It had re-releases for the Midway Arcade Treasures for PlayStation 2, Xbox GameCube, and PC,

1750
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:57,100
and Midway Arcade Origins for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1751
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:04,100
Rootbeard Tapper was released on Xbox Live Arcade for Xbox 360 in 2007 and has since

1752
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,660
been delisted.

1753
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:10,660
And there's a modern interpretation for mobile devices called Tapper World Tour.

1754
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,180
They came out in 2011.

1755
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:19,220
And the style in the art was almost identical to an earlier game called Domino Man, and

1756
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:22,500
then another game after that called Timber.

1757
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,500
And in fact-

1758
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,500
I love Timber.

1759
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:32,700
The main character for Timber is a rework of the main character in Tapper.

1760
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,300
This whole era of Bally Midway Arcade games is some of my favorite stuff.

1761
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,300
Like for real.

1762
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:41,980
Like I love those Midway Treasure games that existed that have this and Timber and so like

1763
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,860
Satan's Hollow and some of the other games that are like around the same time.

1764
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,860
Yeah.

1765
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,060
This is a great era of gaming.

1766
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,940
This game was an inspiration for Plants vs. Zombies.

1767
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:51,940
Get out, really?

1768
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:52,940
Yeah.

1769
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:56,980
To having to defend against a constantly approaching thing in all these lines.

1770
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,300
Wait, is Tapper the reason we have tower defense games?

1771
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,340
Because if so, I'm a little upset.

1772
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,340
I'm just kidding.

1773
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:04,540
Well, and Tapper was also featured in Wreck-It Ralph.

1774
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,540
Yeah.

1775
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:10,980
But the world record for Tapper was set on December 5th, 2015 by Kelly Tharp of Louisville,

1776
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,980
Kentucky.

1777
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,380
Sorry, Louisville, Kentucky.

1778
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,300
Apologize to Brad from Pod Culture.

1779
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,300
Louisville.

1780
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:23,260
And it was set in Humboldt, Texas at Totally Amused.

1781
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:28,540
And it was a Twin Galaxies Golden Age Showdown event that this happened at.

1782
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,100
And then, there you go.

1783
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:35,500
There is a clone by the way called Brewmaster that came out on the TRS-80 color computer.

1784
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Cool.

1785
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,500
Now we're done.

1786
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,540
There it is, your classic game of the week, Tapper.

1787
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,740
Or as I remember it, Root Beer Tapper.

1788
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,220
But tonight, it's Tapper.

1789
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,780
Yeah, tonight it's Tapper.

1790
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,620
I would love to have a cabinet of this actually.

1791
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:53,740
You know, I kind of got that whole like itch like, I want to get a cabinet in the house.

1792
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:58,860
Like even though we totally don't have room for it, and Alan is going to judge me so harshly.

1793
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,100
But I'm thinking like, you know, if we were to arrange things a little bit and move like

1794
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,580
this little thing on the cart here, I know this is great, we don't have video, but with

1795
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:10,060
this thing on the cart here into the back room, I could put a cabinet right there.

1796
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:13,100
And you know, I want to baby pack my machine more than anything.

1797
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,300
Could have made that happen.

1798
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:20,340
I know there was one here locally, and I almost pulled the trigger on it, but it just, it

1799
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:23,300
just sometimes sometimes it's not right.

1800
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,780
I know you were trying to enable me so bad.

1801
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,780
I almost bought it.

1802
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,260
Because I told you that we would buy it if you decided you never wanted it again.

1803
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:29,260
I know.

1804
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,620
But then I was like, giving you an outro.

1805
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,780
But money and responsibility.

1806
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:34,900
Fuck money and responsibility.

1807
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:38,220
The purpose of money is to spend it.

1808
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:43,340
But 401ks and saving and retirement and adulting.

1809
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,340
It's really hard.

1810
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,380
I don't have stock options.

1811
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,300
I'm supposed to get stock options too?

1812
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,780
I don't like crackers.

1813
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:54,260
Alright, let's travel around the world and do some rapid fire news.

1814
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:57,580
Again, we're gonna do kind of a shorter, just one segment show tonight.

1815
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,220
I'm not used to this layout.

1816
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,220
What?

1817
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,140
The one, the one half show?

1818
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:06,740
No, to Loki's thing and now it's gone.

1819
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:07,740
What Loki's thing it's gone?

1820
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:08,740
No.

1821
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,740
What are you talking about over there?

1822
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,740
You're skipping things.

1823
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,740
No I'm not.

1824
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:13,300
You're skipping to release dates.

1825
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,300
I'm not doing release dates.

1826
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,300
I'm doing rapid fire news.

1827
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,300
Oh, whatever.

1828
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,300
Can you read Dark Sagra?

1829
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,300
No!

1830
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,300
Hey!

1831
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:23,140
Let's talk about Final Fantasy XV's latest patch.

1832
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,140
No.

1833
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:29,300
Yes, the 1.03 patch hit this past week which adds New Game Plus to the game.

1834
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,300
Why?

1835
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,300
I don't know.

1836
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,300
New Game Plus.

1837
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,580
You can go through and play it again at the level you left off at if that's what you want

1838
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,580
to do.

1839
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,900
I guess it would make it easier for you to hit level 99 if that's, you know, what you

1840
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,900
want to do.

1841
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:47,300
Anyway, it's a 3.2 gigabyte update and contains that as well as the holiday pack which I did

1842
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:52,360
also actually buy this week while I got the season pass so that you got the holiday plus

1843
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:56,380
and those are some really helpful items that you get with that to gain AP.

1844
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,800
So it is a little shitty that it's in a pack that's for sale, although I think one of the

1845
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,900
items is in the free pack so there's something in that.

1846
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:07,800
So anyway, let's see.

1847
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:18,840
So the other stuff that's in this patch, outfits, more photo borders and more photos, the ascension

1848
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,920
grid is all unlocked and all that, oh that's, I'm sorry, that's in New Game Plus.

1849
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,800
But you get all these little updates in the patch that came out this week.

1850
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,700
Also, more information on Final Fantasy's 30 year celebration.

1851
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,880
It will be kicking off on January 31st.

1852
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,360
That is Final Fantasy VII's 20th anniversary.

1853
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:44,200
We may already know the plans for that if we are to believe rumors and things that was

1854
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:49,360
talked about a couple weeks ago here on the show, but we'll get the official unveil of

1855
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,920
the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary plans on January 31st.

1856
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,120
That's not too far away.

1857
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,760
Anyway, they'll be holding this unveil at Toho Cinemas in Tokyo.

1858
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:04,500
They'll be guests and multiple talks and a raffle is being held for 200 Square Enix members

1859
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,840
to attend.

1860
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:11,260
So if you are in Japan and you want to go, nearby Tokyo, where this is being held, you

1861
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,260
should check that out.

1862
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,260
Dar Sakura, how about you for rapid fire news?

1863
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,260
Stuff.

1864
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:20,860
Well, H2 Interactive is bringing out a new Kunio game.

1865
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:28,060
We're getting River City Melee Battle Royal Special, which in Japan was downtown Rantou-kyo-

1866
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:34,820
I'm gonna mispronounce this- Kyoushin Kyoku Kachinuki Kakuto SP.

1867
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,820
I can't read.

1868
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,260
Actually, I can't.

1869
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,260
I'm blurry.

1870
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:46,860
Anyway, so they are- it's actually being localized by the developers for BlazBlue, so we're gonna

1871
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,420
see a fun little game come out.

1872
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:57,780
And in Japan, it's out actually probably today now, December 26th, as it likely is in Japan.

1873
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:00,620
And hopefully we'll be getting it out soon, over here in the US.

1874
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:06,540
Because if there's a game series my hub's like, it's the Kunio games.

1875
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:09,740
And Otada Hikaru, yay!

1876
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:13,300
Will be working on some Kingdom Hearts 3 music.

1877
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,300
Waaaaay!

1878
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,540
That's exciting.

1879
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:20,460
So that means that we will have her for Kingdom Hearts 3, because apparently Square can count

1880
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,180
to three and beyond.

1881
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:28,820
Well, nothing's confirmed until, you know, we get a game on the shelf.

1882
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:29,820
Yes.

1883
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,820
Anyway.

1884
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:35,980
VidPower in our chat over at live.vognetware.com, speaking on the Kunio game, saying Kunio games

1885
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,780
are so underappreciated.

1886
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,780
I agree with that.

1887
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:44,500
I think it'll be nice to have a modern Kunio game that still has that retro flair.

1888
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,500
Excited about that.

1889
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,580
Now let's travel around the world.

1890
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:50,180
I guess for some reason, it's probably because of liquor, I said travel around the world

1891
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:52,660
with rapid fire news, and that's what confused people.

1892
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:57,580
So now that we've traveled around the world once, let's do it again and talk about release

1893
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:58,580
dates.

1894
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,580
Are you able to do the US ones, StarSagra?

1895
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,540
I don't see jack shit coming out.

1896
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:04,380
Yeah, probably this week.

1897
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,780
There probably isn't a lot coming out.

1898
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,980
I kind of feel like this is going to be the theme this week, is, you know, there's, you

1899
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:13,540
know, we just had a major holiday, so I don't think there's a lot coming out.

1900
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,420
Let's look at Japan, though.

1901
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:22,220
Japan, no, there's some cables and peripherals that are out, but I don't see any games that

1902
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,660
are actually releasing this week.

1903
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,460
Checking the DS just to be sure.

1904
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:32,700
No, there's some new, like, peripherals and bags and cords and things like that, but as

1905
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:37,200
far as games go, it's also dry in Japan this week.

1906
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:41,060
And honestly, for the next couple weeks into January, probably going to be the same thing.

1907
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:42,500
We have one in Europe.

1908
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43,500
One game in Europe.

1909
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:48,580
December 31st, Dovetail Gamers Eurofishing for Xbox One.

1910
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,580
So nothing exciting.

1911
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:51,980
Well, hooray for you fishing game fans out there.

1912
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:52,980
Oh, good.

1913
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:53,980
Feesh!

1914
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,420
My least favorite thing to do in Final Fantasy XV.

1915
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:01,580
The reason why I won't Platinum XV, because it's going to make me fucking fish.

1916
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,900
All right, how about the mailbag then?

1917
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,580
Fuck me, there's a bunch in here.

1918
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,900
Yeah, we got a lot of emails this week.

1919
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,860
Well, I begged people to email us last week, and I think it happened this week.

1920
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:12,220
Well, why did you do a dumb thing like that?

1921
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:16,900
Because I love you.

1922
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,620
Every week you email us, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1923
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:25,700
DarkSakura very happily and appreciatively dives in the mailbag and reads her favorite

1924
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,620
emails here on the show.

1925
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:29,620
One from Fifth Dream.

1926
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:31,100
I exist or something.

1927
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,100
Oh, yes.

1928
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:36,020
Do you remember last week I said people should email us and just tell us they exist?

1929
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:39,300
So you probably have a lot of those emails tonight.

1930
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,820
Thank you for existing, Fifth Dream.

1931
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,820
We appreciate you.

1932
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,900
Next question comes from Jose.

1933
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,740
Merry Christmas, OLR, or whatever holiday you celebrate.

1934
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,540
I am glad DarkSakura is feeling well.

1935
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:53,820
My question this week is, do you think free-to-play freemium games need to end quick?

1936
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:59,380
And do you think those types of games are bittering the perspective on mobile gaming

1937
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,380
in general?

1938
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,740
Thanks again for being awesome, guys.

1939
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,340
Keep on working on your game, Loki.

1940
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,860
I'll try to write soon if I'm not busy with the holidays.

1941
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:06,860
Take care.

1942
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,860
Signed, Jose.

1943
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,620
Um, complicated question.

1944
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:11,980
I don't think these games are going anywhere.

1945
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:15,500
They're, you know, free is too good of a deal to pass up.

1946
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:20,020
And I think it's really weaved itself into the mobile marketplace for better or for worse.

1947
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:24,620
And there's going to be free games that are engrossing for a very long time for some people.

1948
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:29,060
Some people like to play like what I caught Alan playing Bejeweled Stars or whatever that

1949
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,060
is that's out.

1950
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,060
I caught him playing that.

1951
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,940
I know DarkSakura plays some of these games.

1952
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,820
I play Ingress and Pokemon Go.

1953
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:38,140
Those are free-to-play games, essentially.

1954
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,900
So I think there is a marketplace for them.

1955
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:44,460
I mean, I've played a lot of those games that I just named, Ingress and Pokemon Go, and

1956
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,580
those are just two of several mobile games I've tried over the years that were free-to-play

1957
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:51,940
that weren't necessarily bad.

1958
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:54,660
Did it skew things too much on the mobile platform?

1959
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:55,660
Maybe.

1960
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:58,420
Especially when we talk about something like Super Mario Run.

1961
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:01,500
But it's part of the reason why I said, you know what, Super Mario Run, they should have

1962
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,780
just charged $10 in the store.

1963
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,620
I understand why they didn't do that.

1964
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,780
They wouldn't be able to brag about 40 million downloads or whatever they're saying this

1965
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,620
week if they hadn't set that price as free in the store.

1966
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:18,540
But I think it sets some people's expectations in a weird place.

1967
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,320
And I kind of think they should have just charged $10 out the gate.

1968
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,820
But I don't think free-to-play games is going to go anywhere, and I don't think free-to-play

1969
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:26,180
means necessarily bad.

1970
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:31,060
It just depends on how much are you going to nickel and dime your audience.

1971
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:32,060
You know, a game...

1972
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:33,060
Go ahead.

1973
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:36,700
The crap thing about it, though, is that it prevents people who have a family sharing

1974
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:40,620
plan to use said family sharing.

1975
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,820
Yeah.

1976
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:45,880
And I know that's kind of a thing about Super Mario Run as well.

1977
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:52,260
But a game like Ingress, for example, you can play very well and very thoroughly without

1978
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,980
ever spending a dime.

1979
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:54,980
You know what I mean?

1980
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:55,980
I don't think I did.

1981
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:58,500
You don't think you ever did spend a dime, or you don't think you played well?

1982
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,500
It was funny.

1983
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,500
Come on.

1984
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,500
It was funny.

1985
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,500
Drop the phone.

1986
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,940
I'm trying to catch this Nidoran.

1987
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:07,100
Oh, there's always a million Nidorans here.

1988
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,660
But I need a couple more to get a Nidoqueen.

1989
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:14,140
I think our Pikachu spawns here got replaced with stupid Nidorans, so that's all I ever

1990
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,140
see here at the house anymore.

1991
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,140
I don't mind right now.

1992
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:18,820
Alright, well, but we gotta get to the next email, so...

1993
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,820
We'll find...

1994
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,820
Put your balls down, DarkSaka.

1995
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:21,820
I'll read the next email.

1996
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:22,820
I just fed you my balls.

1997
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:23,820
Oh, sorry.

1998
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,820
Wrong balls.

1999
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:28,420
Anyway, the next email comes from Robert M.

2000
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:38,300
Felizan Cristinacón, sorry, and it is Esperanto, so thank you, because I had asked for some

2001
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,300
Esperanto.

2002
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:42,340
Oh, look at you with your Esperanto.

2003
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:45,220
Just wondering about a prominent iOS app.

2004
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:50,220
Super Mario Run has its unlock through an in-app purchase, but I can't find a restore

2005
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,740
purchases button.

2006
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:56,580
If heavens forbid my iPod were to be reformatted again, or I want to download my game on iPad

2007
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:03,380
or iPhone on my Apple ID, would I need to have set up a My Nintendo account specifically

2008
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:04,380
for the unlock?

2009
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,540
I haven't really contacted any developer or forum about this yet.

2010
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:13,100
I'm generally enjoying the game, but more Wi-Fi time is going to other apps, admittedly,

2011
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:20,200
Robert M. I will tell you that Hubby tried to...

2012
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:27,600
He did link his My Nintendo account to it, and as it turned out, it did have a restore

2013
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:35,680
purchase on there, but I don't think it restored his progress.

2014
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,680
It's just the purchase.

2015
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,400
Yeah, just the purchase.

2016
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:43,320
You have to have the Nintendo account linked, and by the way, it tells you that in the very

2017
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,320
beginning.

2018
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:47,540
You might have clicked through it, as a lot of people do in the very opening screens,

2019
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:52,020
but I did think that was curious, that it actually said, if you want to be able to restore

2020
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,840
your purchase later, you need to have this on a My Nintendo account.

2021
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,540
They did the same thing with Miitomo, actually.

2022
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:02,560
So now my question is, and I don't know the answer to this, I'm sorry, can Robert M. was

2023
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,560
the emailer, right?

2024
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,560
Yeah.

2025
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,560
Can Robert M. do this after the fact?

2026
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,740
Now that he's bought the game, can he now assign a My Nintendo to it?

2027
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:12,720
Will it work, or now is he screwed because he bought the game without that association?

2028
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:15,700
That I don't know, sir, I'm sorry to say.

2029
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:22,600
So I would try associating it with a My Nintendo account at this point, just to save yourself

2030
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,780
if something does happen to your phone.

2031
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:25,880
Let's hope not.

2032
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:31,260
But hopefully, cross fingers, knock on wood, by the time your phone breaks, you won't care

2033
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:35,980
if you lose the game, hopefully.

2034
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:36,980
That's it.

2035
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:37,980
Okay.

2036
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,180
Hey gang, first a song, and there's a link.

2037
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:42,140
It's Loss of Me from Final Fantasy IX.

2038
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:44,860
We're not going to play it, sorry.

2039
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:49,120
In the hype surrounding Final Fantasy XV, you guys compared it to other mainline Final

2040
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,120
Fantasy titles.

2041
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,660
I mentioned all of them, except for one of the titles I hold most dear, Final Fantasy

2042
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:58,820
IX, which for me is my second place game in the series, the first being X.

2043
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:04,060
It is an amazing game, not only for the music and battles, but for the story the game tells,

2044
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,500
and the antagonists that conspire against you.

2045
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:13,100
No, really, I've never been more upset at a villain in any other game, in any game than

2046
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:17,140
the horrific acts committed by Kuja and those that follow him.

2047
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,740
The story does a crazy good job building up hope and affection toward the characters of

2048
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:24,980
the world before you watch their tales quickly become tragic.

2049
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:29,340
It's not all doom and gloom as you watch the main cast come into their roles quite nicely.

2050
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:33,060
Even Steiner, who I couldn't stand at the start of the game, really grew on me.

2051
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,060
Thoughts?

2052
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:35,180
Sincerely, Osfer.

2053
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,460
I appreciate Final Fantasy IX.

2054
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:42,960
I wouldn't say I love it the way I love IV and VI and some of the other games.

2055
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:48,080
But again, and I even said this last week, the only Final Fantasy game I can't play and

2056
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,040
I don't like playing is VIII, and I know that's a controversial statement and some of you

2057
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,800
hate me for it, but sit on that and deal with it for a minute, because I just cannot stand

2058
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,320
that junction system and the draw and all that stuff.

2059
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,500
Otherwise, the story in VIII is even fine.

2060
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,240
I'll watch somebody else play VIII maybe.

2061
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,240
There's a PS.

2062
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,240
Oh, what's that?

2063
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,240
Rob, please finish Undertale.

2064
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,320
I really want to hear your thoughts on the game.

2065
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,320
Frown.

2066
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,320
I'll do my...

2067
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,480
There's so many games to play, so many.

2068
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,480
I contributed.

2069
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,480
So many.

2070
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,480
Yeah, I know you did.

2071
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,920
But anyway, as far as Final Fantasy IX goes, it's a good game.

2072
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:23,440
And you know why IX was important is because people were a little turned off by the sci-fi-ness

2073
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,720
of VII and even VIII a little bit.

2074
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:29,200
So IX, I remember when it came out, was kind of like a return to form for Final Fantasy.

2075
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:33,360
Like you had a black mage who looked like the black mage from Final Fantasy I, right?

2076
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,820
That was a big thing in Final Fantasy IX.

2077
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:38,720
So I would actually love to see, and I think I even tweeted something about this, I would

2078
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:45,000
love to see that Final Fantasy XVI is something like Final Fantasy IX in XV's engine.

2079
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I would love that.

2080
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
But we'll see.

2081
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,240
I'm not going to hold my breath.

2082
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:52,400
Here's the other thing, though, I wanted to say to Osfer, the emailer.

2083
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,640
I would be curious, how old were you when Final Fantasy IX came out?

2084
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,040
You know why?

2085
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,580
Because I think it was Bobby who said this, and I don't know if he stole it from somewhere

2086
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,800
else or if he came up with it on his own.

2087
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:08,100
But he once said that your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that came out when

2088
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,940
you were 12.

2089
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:14,180
And so I'm wondering if Final Fantasy IX came out, because I know Osfer is a little younger

2090
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:21,460
than me, who was 12 when Final Fantasy II and III America, IV and VI for everybody else,

2091
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,540
came out.

2092
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:28,740
Because that's, I was 12 when Final Fantasy II, IV, whatever you want to call it, when

2093
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:31,900
that game came out, and that's probably why it's one of my favorites.

2094
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,340
I remember having such an emotional connection to that game.

2095
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:40,820
I think that for me, it was the first U.S. Final Fantasy, but it's not my favorite.

2096
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,220
Well, it's not your favorite.

2097
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:43,220
It's not my favorite.

2098
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,180
I love the Japanese III a lot.

2099
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:51,660
I love V, but VI was the one, actually, I really have a hard time comparing them because

2100
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:54,180
each of them are their own contained stories.

2101
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:58,500
And it's hard for me to like one more than the other, but I did sink more time into VI.

2102
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:03,080
So well, and some of the chatters are saying it's not exactly right.

2103
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,400
And I'll also say that I like Chrono Trigger better than the whole series.

2104
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,400
Which would be wrong.

2105
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,400
I'm just kidding.

2106
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,400
But here's the thing.

2107
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:13,800
Even if it's not exactly 12, it's around 12.

2108
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,800
You know what I mean?

2109
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,760
You still picked one of the earlier games, you know what I mean?

2110
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,280
So I was in high school.

2111
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:24,520
Anyway, anyway, this is, I would just be curious, was Osfer 12 years old when Final Fantasy IX

2112
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,520
came out?

2113
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,520
Well, you didn't say so.

2114
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,520
How old is Osfer?

2115
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,160
I don't even know if I know off the top of my head, but I pretended to have the flu for

2116
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,480
a whole week so I could play it.

2117
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,720
I think Osfer is in his mid to low 20s.

2118
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,960
So I'm trying to do the math in my head.

2119
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:36,960
That'd be about the...

2120
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,960
So next email.

2121
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:38,960
Oh yeah.

2122
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:39,960
Next email.

2123
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,200
Comes from Claire and it's just smile, hugs, smile.

2124
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,440
And a picture of a dragon with an ornament, a star on top.

2125
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,800
Oh, I saw that picture in the email.

2126
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,040
Now my question is, did the emailer draw that?

2127
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,040
I don't know.

2128
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,240
But if he did, nice talent.

2129
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:54,240
Yeah.

2130
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,920
If you drew that and you were just emailing it to us to show off, then kudos to you.

2131
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:58,920
You're a good artist.

2132
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,920
All right.

2133
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,880
If you drew that from DeviantArt, then all right.

2134
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:02,880
That's cool.

2135
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:03,880
Thanks for the wishes.

2136
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,880
If nothing else.

2137
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,880
Hello Sky, Dark Sakura and Loki.

2138
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,880
Hi.

2139
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:07,880
Merry Christmas.

2140
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:08,880
Happy Hanukkah.

2141
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,520
All of the season's greetings.

2142
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,640
Martin the Belgian here.

2143
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:14,480
I love that you're Martin the Belgian.

2144
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,020
Thanks so much for doing a show on Christmas.

2145
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:21,280
This will give me something to listen to while recovering from my food coma tomorrow and

2146
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:26,360
spending the holidays playing games and trying to resist the sales on Steam and GOG.

2147
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,320
I am trying not to buy games I will never play, but it is hard.

2148
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:35,360
I am home in Belgium for the holidays, the home of wonderful chocolate and stroopwafels.

2149
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,960
A long time ago, I promised to send you some Belgian chocolate, but you never sent me an

2150
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,760
address I can send it to.

2151
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:44,480
Being home now, I am stocking up, so I would love to thank you for the wonderful show you

2152
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,320
do each week with some chocolate.

2153
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,640
If you send me address, I will.

2154
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,880
Hope you're all enjoying a nice break with some great games.

2155
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,400
Hugs from Belgium, Martin.

2156
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,900
I will send you my address right now.

2157
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:55,900
I'm happy to do that.

2158
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:02,220
I'm happy to do that, however, if I remember right, he relocated to Atlanta.

2159
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,940
If I remember an early email, I'll correct.

2160
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:10,400
As a reminder, I will be in Atlanta again in 2017 over Labor Day weekend for Dragon

2161
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,220
Con 2017.

2162
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:18,540
I would like to enjoy these fine chocolates in person while I'm drinking stroopwafel,

2163
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:21,180
which by the way, this is fucking happening at Dragon Con.

2164
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:22,180
But I want some too.

2165
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:23,820
Brad from Pod Culture, are you listening?

2166
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,860
Then you need to fucking come to Dragon Con.

2167
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:28,900
Bitch, I don't have money.

2168
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:29,900
You got money for stroopwafel.

2169
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,460
They were a dollar.

2170
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,460
Put the stroopwafel money away every week until Labor Day and then you can do.

2171
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:37,420
I also can't get off work.

2172
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:38,660
Stroopwafel.

2173
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:39,660
Brad from Pod Culture.

2174
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:40,660
Send me my address.

2175
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,860
Stroopwafel, the new official drink at Dragon Con.

2176
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:45,940
Although, I don't know, Brad from Pod Culture is a big fan of Fireball.

2177
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:46,940
Maybe we can mix them.

2178
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:51,540
Do you think stroopball, stroop, stroop, stroopball, fire, fire, firewaffle?

2179
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:52,980
I don't like Fireball.

2180
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:53,980
I like Fireball.

2181
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:54,980
Firewaffle.

2182
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,980
I'm sitting in my address right now.

2183
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:57,980
Okay.

2184
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:58,980
All right.

2185
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:00,980
Is that it for emails?

2186
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:01,980
I think.

2187
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:03,980
I'm just sitting in my address right now.

2188
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:04,980
You can't.

2189
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:05,980
Make up some time.

2190
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:06,980
Talk about stroopwafel some more.

2191
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:07,980
I don't know.

2192
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:08,980
I don't have time.

2193
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:09,980
All right.

2194
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:11,980
Going to our chat over at live.fucknetwork.com.

2195
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,980
Brad from Pod Culture says cinnamon and waffles.

2196
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,980
See, it sounds pretty good, doesn't it, when I mention it like that?

2197
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:20,980
Some folks talking about age and Final Fantasy.

2198
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:25,340
RageNator in chat says, I got Final Fantasy one on the NES when it first came out and

2199
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:26,900
I was 13 at the time.

2200
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:27,900
Not my favorite.

2201
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,460
Seven, I got day one and loved it.

2202
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,300
I was 20 when seven came out.

2203
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:33,300
Okay.

2204
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,500
Everybody wants to break the fucking theory.

2205
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,500
All right.

2206
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,500
Fine.

2207
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:40,360
The theory does not, like most theories, it doesn't hold true 100% of the time.

2208
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,380
So I don't know what to tell you.

2209
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:43,380
All right.

2210
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,380
Anyway.

2211
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,380
Let's see.

2212
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:47,380
Other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2213
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:48,780
Um.

2214
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,780
That was the last email, by the way.

2215
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:54,380
Robis's Final Fantasy nine was a complete throwback to Final Fantasy one.

2216
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:55,380
Yeah.

2217
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,380
That's probably why it was popular.

2218
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:00,340
And then everybody's complaining that the stream died, which it does look like we had

2219
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:05,420
a little server hiccup, uh, which another Christmas thing out of my control.

2220
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:08,000
What can I do?

2221
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
You know what, Rob?

2222
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
What?

2223
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,820
An important thing happened ages ago.

2224
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:12,820
What's that?

2225
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:17,660
The person who was born that would change the world for the better.

2226
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,660
Freddie Mercury?

2227
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:19,660
Isaac Newton.

2228
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,660
Oh, okay.

2229
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:27,580
I had to quote Neil deGrasse Tyson on this day.

2230
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:30,860
Long ago, a child was born who by age 30 would transform the world.

2231
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:34,580
Happy birthday, Isaac Newton, born December 25th, 1642.

2232
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:35,580
No.

2233
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:36,580
You know what?

2234
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,580
You know what?

2235
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:41,620
That whole gravity thing, that kind of the gravity sucks sometimes just want you to know.

2236
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:46,840
Gravity is what gives plastic surgeons a job.

2237
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:51,180
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vognetwork.com.

2238
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:54,340
Use the passphrase arrow.

2239
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,440
That's it for the mailbag.

2240
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,200
We are going to take calls here in just a moment.

2241
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:02,740
We're going to open up the holiday Skype line at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2242
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:08,540
So get ready, but hold your calls for just a moment because we've got two more stories

2243
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:09,540
for you.

2244
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:13,100
Our girls in the eighties.

2245
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,100
Darsyra?

2246
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,100
Fake plastic trees are stuck in my head.

2247
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,100
Oh yeah.

2248
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,100
Yeah.

2249
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,100
That's a good song.

2250
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,100
Pokemon go.

2251
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,100
It's doing some shit.

2252
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,740
Um, it's a fun little holiday adventure.

2253
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:26,780
Did you hack your pokey stop and get your incubator for the day?

2254
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,780
No.

2255
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:29,260
That, that's a thing.

2256
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:31,940
If you hack a pokey stop now you get an incubator.

2257
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:34,180
I did hack it, but I didn't get an incubator.

2258
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:35,380
Did you do it this today?

2259
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,380
Yeah.

2260
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,380
25th.

2261
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:38,500
Well then you need to write, you probably got one.

2262
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:41,660
I used to realize it after I already bought one.

2263
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,660
Oops.

2264
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:47,340
Um, anyway, um, it'll be a lot easier to get the gen two Pokemon and the Kanto starters.

2265
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:53,220
Um, so for the morning of December 25th to January 3rd, pokey stops will award one single

2266
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,220
use incubator.

2267
01:40:54,220 --> 01:41:01,540
Like you said, um, each day after your first photo disc spin, photo disc spin.

2268
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:06,300
Does that mean maybe it doesn't work through the Pogo plus maybe you have to actually have

2269
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,300
the app open.

2270
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,300
Oh yeah.

2271
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:10,420
Well, I, I'm only using the app anyway.

2272
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:15,540
Um, and there's also a higher chance of earning eggs that will hatch into the new gold and

2273
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:18,500
silver babies like Pichu and Togepi.

2274
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:22,700
And uh, of course you get the Santa, uh, Pikachu and I caught a Santa Raichu.

2275
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,700
Congrats.

2276
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,180
Yeah, I heard the Santa Raichu's are out there in the wild too.

2277
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:30,660
Um, and then from the afternoon of December 30th through the afternoon of January 8th,

2278
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:36,300
lure modules will last a full hour, which is twice as long as normal and the Kanto region

2279
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:39,620
uh, starters and their evolved forms will be made more common.

2280
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:46,140
Adding Charizard, Blastoise and Venusaur, um, should be a lot easier.

2281
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:47,340
When does the second half of that start?

2282
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,340
The 28th you said?

2283
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:49,340
Or now?

2284
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:51,100
December 30th through January 8th.

2285
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,500
So we still got some time.

2286
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,900
I'm going to get a Venusaur.

2287
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,460
Yeah, I know.

2288
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:57,460
I need those starters.

2289
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:58,460
That's a great event.

2290
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:00,780
I'm going to get a Charizard.

2291
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:04,540
Even though those incubators are single use only, it's, it really needed it.

2292
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:08,140
The game really needed them with the way they're rolling out these new Pokemon.

2293
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,580
So I think that was a great little incentive for people.

2294
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:11,580
So good job.

2295
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:12,580
Yes.

2296
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:13,580
Yes.

2297
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:16,900
Um, can I, we go get more.

2298
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:17,900
There's still some of the bottle.

2299
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:21,780
Uh, the other thing I want to ask you about the dark soccer, did you know the app for

2300
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,660
Apple watch came out a couple of days ago?

2301
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:24,660
Yes, I did.

2302
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:28,080
And I kept hearing that it wasn't going to work on the first gen watches and I couldn't

2303
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,100
get it to run really.

2304
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:34,340
And then, um, I don't know what happened, but I got a notification and suddenly it was

2305
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:35,340
working.

2306
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:36,580
Oh, well that's good.

2307
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:37,580
Right?

2308
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:38,580
Yeah.

2309
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:41,740
But there's some people with the first gen Apple watches that's just not working for.

2310
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:47,000
And so, um, I just been, you know, trying to leave feedback and whatnot to see, but

2311
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,340
it finally came through on mine, but it wasn't working fully properly.

2312
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:55,020
I like that it's more of an exercise tracker and you'll get the egg credit at least if

2313
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,020
nothing else.

2314
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:57,020
That's the best part about the plus.

2315
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:58,020
Yeah.

2316
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:02,140
But the big, the big bad thing though is that it will drain both batteries.

2317
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:07,460
So I only have it on when I know I'm going to be doing some walking.

2318
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:10,580
And usually if I've got the walking, I've got the app open on my phone anyway.

2319
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,580
So yeah.

2320
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,940
Well, it's the same thing with the plus, you still have to have the app running on your

2321
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:17,540
phone and it will drain your phone a little bit, but not nearly as bad as like running

2322
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:18,540
the entire app.

2323
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:19,540
Yeah.

2324
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:20,540
So there is that anyway.

2325
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:21,540
Uh, all right.

2326
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:25,980
Well, speaking of Pokemon, I have one more story for you guys that has to do with Pokemon.

2327
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:33,140
Uh, it has to do with, uh, a ROM hack that got shut down by Nintendo, the Grinches that

2328
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,140
stole Christmas.

2329
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,140
Uh, that's right.

2330
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:37,820
There was a fan made Pokemon ROM hack in the work.

2331
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:39,620
It has been in the works for eight years.

2332
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:45,380
It was called Pokemon prism and it was being made off of Pokemon gold.

2333
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:49,020
So it was a ROM hack to do an entirely new adventure.

2334
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:55,520
And apparently though, uh, a, uh, Nintendo, uh, law firm in Australia, uh, because I guess

2335
01:43:55,560 --> 01:44:00,560
that's where this was being hosted or whatever, sent the cease and desist and the guy put

2336
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:07,560
the letter up on Google drive and said that basically Nintendo is shutting this down as

2337
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:13,280
they did with Metroid to return of Samus as they did with other Nintendo fan, Pokemon

2338
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,400
uranium and all this stuff this year.

2339
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,080
So a yep.

2340
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,440
No news if this will ever come out.

2341
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:25,840
I don't know if he's going to turn to the dark side or what have you of, um, uh, Torrance

2342
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,520
and all that to get that out there.

2343
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,400
But, uh, for right now it doesn't sound like this is ever going to come out.

2344
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,580
So that's sad.

2345
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:36,600
At least the guy made the game for himself.

2346
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,600
Nothing else.

2347
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,600
Hmm.

2348
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,600
Yeah.

2349
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:44,640
Tiger call and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm sure downloads of this are out in

2350
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,640
the wild.

2351
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:46,640
Yes.

2352
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,720
Uh, I'm sure that is a very true.

2353
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:51,600
And once it's on the internet, always on the internet.

2354
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,960
You know how that goes.

2355
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,200
Speaking of on the internet, it's time for you guys to give us a call.

2356
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,960
If you'd like orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2357
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:03,000
I know it's a little early tonight, but we are doing a little bit of a shorter show.

2358
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,760
So that way, uh, dark soccer and myself can enjoy what we thought would be Chinese food

2359
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,620
on Christmas, but it turns out it's going to be sushi on Christmas because the sushi

2360
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:13,840
joint nearby last night too.

2361
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,840
That was funny.

2362
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,440
Oh, do you want to try to find something else we can do?

2363
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,440
We could do that.

2364
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,160
Oh, the Korean barbecue open.

2365
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,160
Oh, the big one.

2366
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,160
Not Oz.

2367
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:27,200
There's the YD Tofu house and another Tofu house down the, down the way, but we can do,

2368
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,200
we can do either.

2369
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,200
I'm fine with it.

2370
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,200
We'll see.

2371
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,200
We'll see.

2372
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,200
All right.

2373
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,200
Our phone lines are lighting up at orange lounge radio on Skype.

2374
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,200
So let's get to it.

2375
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,200
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.

2376
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:36,200
Who's this?

2377
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,200
Hey everyone.

2378
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,200
It's Rama.

2379
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,200
Hey Rama.

2380
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,200
How you doing?

2381
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,200
Pretty good.

2382
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,200
If it makes you feel any better, I'm eating Chinese food here.

2383
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,200
I'll eat on your behalf.

2384
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,200
Thank you.

2385
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,200
I appreciate that.

2386
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,200
We'll drink on your behalf.

2387
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,200
Well, that's okay.

2388
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,640
I have a nice can of beer right here too.

2389
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,640
You know what you don't have?

2390
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,640
What?

2391
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,640
Stroopwafel.

2392
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:59,400
Well, you know, but you know what I will have in two weeks?

2393
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,400
Me.

2394
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,400
Stroopwafel.

2395
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:04,800
I think Skye's a little bit better than Stroopwafel.

2396
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:05,800
Oh, that's right.

2397
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,520
I keep forgetting that you're actually going to Stroopwafel with you.

2398
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:09,520
I know, right?

2399
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,320
I keep forgetting that you're actually going to Magfest this year.

2400
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,320
I'm so excited.

2401
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,320
So we get to hang.

2402
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,320
Hang, drink.

2403
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,640
What's the difference?

2404
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,640
I know.

2405
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:18,640
I'm excited.

2406
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,520
We're going to have a good time.

2407
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,520
That makes two of us.

2408
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,840
I'm still putting together my list of cosplays I'm going to do.

2409
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,240
Any hints for us?

2410
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:31,120
Well, I will say this much.

2411
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:37,040
One of the characters I am cosplaying from is a character from a fighting game that was

2412
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:40,480
covered by Dark Sakura.

2413
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,480
What?

2414
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,480
All right.

2415
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,480
All right.

2416
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,280
A little show trivia with that.

2417
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,280
I like that.

2418
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,280
Mm-hmm.

2419
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,360
All right.

2420
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,360
So what's on your mind tonight?

2421
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,360
What did you call us for?

2422
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:53,480
Did you just call to talk about Magfest or something else on your mind?

2423
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,480
That too.

2424
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,080
And also I just spent the last six hours putting together my Christmas gift.

2425
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,000
I rebuilt and redid my entire computer.

2426
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Wow.

2427
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Okay.

2428
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Yeah.

2429
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I saw you doing some of this stuff on Facebook.

2430
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Yeah.

2431
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,440
I was doing a live stream because I couldn't get it to work on Twitch and I was like, you

2432
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,440
know what?

2433
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,840
I'm just going to do the stream and do this.

2434
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,200
You know, I got it up and running finally.

2435
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,920
So everything is working great.

2436
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:16,920
Congratulations.

2437
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:17,920
Thank you.

2438
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,920
Thank you.

2439
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:19,920
What are you going to do with this new computer?

2440
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,720
Is it something for like more streaming stuff?

2441
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:25,680
Like, I know you guys took over the feed yesterday and we're doing the holiday music, which thanks

2442
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,680
for that.

2443
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:27,680
Got a lot of love on Facebook.

2444
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:34,080
Are you going to do more things like that or no, this is just a game.

2445
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:38,720
The funny thing is everyone asks me games and stuff like that, but no.

2446
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,720
Multimedia.

2447
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:45,600
I just rebuilt my machine so that I can do better audio podcasting and video editing

2448
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:52,920
and get stuff up onto our sites and then play some games because steam took 21 bucks from

2449
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:55,400
me the other day.

2450
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,800
I know how that goes.

2451
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,800
Yes.

2452
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,160
But also I think when you talk about the whole like more oomph in video editing and audio

2453
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:07,600
editing, like that was actually a big incentive in updating my own computer is that when the

2454
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,120
show's done here on the studio computer, I usually I'll drop the files in Dropbox,

2455
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:16,720
which is harder now that Dropbox doesn't support XP, but I just do it through the website.

2456
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:21,640
And then I take them to my other computer and you know, cause editing three hours of

2457
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:25,640
MP3s, those can, I mean, and you know this from anime jam session, those files can get

2458
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:29,560
pretty big, so they can be really slow to convert and save sometimes.

2459
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:35,400
But on the newer computer I have blazing fast, exactly.

2460
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:40,400
Maybe like seven minutes to convert the whole show, which is fast for like a three hour

2461
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,400
show.

2462
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,400
That's fast.

2463
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:47,920
Well, let's see our drunken podcast show, which was a little bit over two hours.

2464
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,800
I re edited and rendered it in under two minutes.

2465
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,800
Nice.

2466
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:52,800
Wow.

2467
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,800
That's really good.

2468
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,480
Keep in mind, I save in multiple formats and I think that's part of the reason why it takes

2469
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,080
me a little longer.

2470
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,400
Probably so better safe than sorry.

2471
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:00,400
Yeah.

2472
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:04,920
I save one for VOG and I save one for the podcast feed cause I figure, uh, it's, it's

2473
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:11,520
a lot of space on some of these iPhone cause one episode of OLR is like what, 80 megabytes

2474
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,640
I think podcast sized.

2475
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,440
So maybe less, maybe less, maybe it's like 60.

2476
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:17,760
I don't remember now.

2477
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,440
Um, but it's like a hundred megs on VOG so, but now everybody streams them like I shouldn't

2478
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,480
have to worry about that anymore cause everybody streams it now.

2479
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,520
That's the big thing people do.

2480
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,120
So I only do one.

2481
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:36,280
I do the save for VOG upload and did I just go back and just drop in edit for RSS feed

2482
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:37,480
and call it a day?

2483
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,480
You know?

2484
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:44,200
I think a lot of our shows do that, but it's one of those things where the particular quality

2485
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:48,920
of OLR I kind of set a long time ago before they were even VOG, before there was even

2486
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:49,920
all games.

2487
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,680
So it's kind of one of those I've just never really deviated from that.

2488
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:56,720
Not to say I never will, but I haven't been convinced otherwise by anybody.

2489
01:49:56,720 --> 01:50:00,600
None of the listeners have complained about the quality or the file size of the format

2490
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,600
of the show.

2491
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:05,560
So par for the course for now.

2492
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,560
Sounds like a plan.

2493
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,560
Yep.

2494
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:08,560
All right.

2495
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:09,560
Anything else on your mind, my friend?

2496
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,560
Oh yeah.

2497
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,240
I was trying to call it about last week about MAGFest, you were complaining about food places

2498
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:16,240
and stuff.

2499
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:17,240
Yeah.

2500
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,920
Um, did you hear the news?

2501
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:20,920
No.

2502
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,600
There's a casino right up the street.

2503
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,600
Really?

2504
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,400
They built a casino out there now?

2505
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:26,400
Yes.

2506
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,280
It opened up about a week and a half ago.

2507
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,280
Oh shoot.

2508
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,920
So there's probably a ton of food options in there, huh?

2509
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:35,160
An MGM Grand Casino.

2510
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,160
Holy crap.

2511
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,160
That's going to be a pretty big deal.

2512
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:38,160
Well, that's great.

2513
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:42,480
So they'll have food options and that'll, I hope they're ready for all those people.

2514
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:43,800
I hope so too.

2515
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:44,800
Yeah.

2516
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,640
It would still be great if they could just get oodles and oodles of food trucks come

2517
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:48,640
out there.

2518
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,600
And especially if it's not going to be like horrific snow and all this stuff, it's going

2519
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:52,780
to be 50 degrees out there.

2520
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:53,780
That sounds awesome.

2521
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,840
I'm very, very happy to hear that.

2522
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,240
Hopefully the weather stays the same, knock on wood.

2523
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:03,640
So I was saying yesterday, this time last year, yesterday, it was 66 degrees and I'm

2524
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,640
walking around.

2525
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:05,640
It's like 52.

2526
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:06,640
Hmm.

2527
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:09,840
Well, that's, I mean, again, that's warmer than it is in California right now.

2528
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:14,000
So uh, I'll take it by all means.

2529
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
You can have it.

2530
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
All right.

2531
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,640
It snowed in SoCal today, if you can believe it.

2532
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:23,480
Granted on the grapevine where it's a higher elevation, but still you don't hear about

2533
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:24,480
that every day.

2534
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:25,480
Anyway.

2535
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,520
There you go.

2536
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,520
To get more calls.

2537
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,520
All right.

2538
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,520
Take care.

2539
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,520
Take care of my friends.

2540
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:31,520
See you in a couple of weeks.

2541
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,520
You got it.

2542
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,520
Bye.

2543
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,520
Bye Ron.

2544
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:35,520
Jon and Stroopwafel.

2545
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,520
Stroopwafel.

2546
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,520
You know what?

2547
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,640
The Stroopwafel people need to pay us in Stroopwafel.

2548
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:42,000
Well, at least the Stroopwafel booze.

2549
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,480
I mean, I like the actual waffles though.

2550
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,720
It's like free advertising for them left and right today.

2551
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:46,720
Just like Pinkberry.

2552
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,720
How come we never got free Pinkberry out of this show?

2553
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:49,720
Pinkberry.

2554
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,720
Do it.

2555
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,720
Hi.

2556
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:52,720
You're on Orange Dots Radio.

2557
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:53,720
Who's this?

2558
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:54,720
Hi.

2559
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,960
Not a whole lot.

2560
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:09,160
Well, since this is the last show of the year, I kind of figure, I ask the two of you, what

2561
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:12,160
is your favorite game that you got this year?

2562
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:17,480
It doesn't necessarily have to come out this year so long as you buy it this year and play

2563
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,480
it this year.

2564
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:24,520
Oh, Ray Jeter, you might be dipping into a topic if we do do a show in the next week.

2565
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:28,320
This is something that would be a prime topic for that show would be what is the game of

2566
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:35,440
the year, but taking Ray Jeter's little twist on it, what is the best game that you got

2567
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,080
this year?

2568
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,760
Do you think you have an answer for that?

2569
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:39,760
Dark Soccer.

2570
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,840
What's the best game that you got this year?

2571
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:47,120
Well, I haven't played them yet because then it doesn't count.

2572
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,120
No.

2573
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:52,320
I actually really liked the new wow expansion and I'm still playing it.

2574
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,320
Okay.

2575
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:55,640
I got it for myself, so I got it for me.

2576
01:52:55,640 --> 01:53:01,200
And I've been playing Danganronpa and Danganronpa 2, which I just started this year, so both

2577
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,200
of them are great.

2578
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,200
All of them are great.

2579
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:07,680
I don't think I've played anything that sucks balls this year.

2580
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:12,440
Don't confuse this with my game of the year, but I would actually probably answer Final

2581
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:18,480
Fantasy 15 just because you guys know what crazy gamer ADD I have and the fact that I

2582
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:22,960
actually played that game start to finish, I think says a lot and that was a game I knew

2583
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:25,160
I was going to buy and bought.

2584
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:29,600
And so, yeah, I think to answer your question the way you asked it, I think I would say

2585
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,600
Final Fantasy 15.

2586
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,600
Oh, cool.

2587
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,600
What about you?

2588
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:40,200
Well, it's kind of hard to answer if only because I just started playing the game, but

2589
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:50,920
I just recently got myself Transformers Devastation, which is pretty much just as a refresher to

2590
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,280
everyone that's listening.

2591
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:59,720
It's basically a love letter to all those that grew up watching the Generation 1 cartoon

2592
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:06,120
from the 80s and, oh my God, is it amazing.

2593
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:12,720
I practically had a nerdgasm as soon as I loaded the game up.

2594
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:17,400
I swear to God, I probably like this game more than I like Magic 2014.

2595
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,400
What?

2596
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,520
Well, that's quite an endorsement.

2597
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,520
Don't go overboard.

2598
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:25,320
I know, shock and awe, what the hell happened to Reginald?

2599
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,680
What did you do with him?

2600
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:30,960
But yeah, it's pretty good.

2601
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:40,400
Now, normally it's a $40 game, but in fact, I picked it up when it was on CL.

2602
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,720
I paid $10 for it.

2603
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:45,400
I can't figure what the hell, I can't pass that up.

2604
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:50,920
It might still be on CL now that the Christmas sale is going on.

2605
01:54:51,760 --> 01:55:01,800
If you're a fan of the Transformers franchise, do yourself a favor and pick it up, especially

2606
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,280
if it's on CL for cheap.

2607
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:07,280
Well, guys, you're just pointing out it was free on PlayStation Network, so if you didn't

2608
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:11,240
get it there, I mean, free's a pretty good deal.

2609
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,960
Oh, definitely, definitely.

2610
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,320
Well, I'll probably let you go.

2611
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:23,280
We're imagining a lot of other people calling for this show, so have a nice night.

2612
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,280
Thank you, you too.

2613
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:25,280
Have a good holiday.

2614
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:26,280
Take care.

2615
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:27,280
Yep, you too.

2616
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,280
All right, bye.

2617
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,280
I'm getting you to think about it.

2618
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,560
All these people that are calling us tonight and participating with the show, they're here

2619
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:36,360
on what is traditionally a pretty busy day for a lot of people, so thank you for being

2620
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:37,360
here tonight, everybody.

2621
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,360
Hearts.

2622
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,360
Hearts and love and love and hearts.

2623
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:42,280
And those of you on the podcast feed as well, don't get me wrong, I still have a lot of

2624
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,000
love for you guys as well, but anyway, we got another call coming in.

2625
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Let's get to it.

2626
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,840
Hey, everybody, you're on Orange

2627
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:49,840
Haunted Radio.

2628
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,840
Who's this?

2629
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:51,840
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

2630
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:52,840
Hey, my friend.

2631
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:53,840
How are you?

2632
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,840
Not Stroopwaffling, that's for sure.

2633
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:55,840
Well, that's unfortunate.

2634
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:56,840
We'll have to fix that.

2635
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:01,840
Did you know, by the way, Brad from Pod Culture, that your Skype icon is a lesbian?

2636
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,840
Yeah.

2637
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:03,840
Okay, just checking.

2638
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,640
Still doesn't change the fact that she's my favorite player in the game.

2639
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:08,640
Amen to that.

2640
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:09,640
Amen to that.

2641
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:10,640
Doesn't change a goddamn thing.

2642
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:11,640
That is absolutely right.

2643
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,640
There's the one that does the snow.

2644
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:15,600
She's my favorite character in the game.

2645
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,680
Tracer is the icon for Brad.

2646
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:19,960
May is the one you're thinking of.

2647
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,720
That's who I was using and really liked.

2648
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:22,720
Yeah, May's cool.

2649
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,680
I actually play Pharah a lot.

2650
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:26,080
Yeah, I love Pharah.

2651
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,800
Pharah's the one I play pretty much because it's just rocket launchers everywhere.

2652
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,800
I like D.Va.

2653
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,720
But I really like Symmetra as well.

2654
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:35,800
And I like Junkrat since I know we're naming a lot of ladies, but there's some love for

2655
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:36,800
some of the boys too.

2656
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:37,800
I like Junkrat as well.

2657
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,800
I just found something wonderful.

2658
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:42,480
You gotta know Junkrat and Roadhog are a couple.

2659
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,040
That seems to be the next thing.

2660
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,640
Yeah, that Junkrat and Roadhog are gonna end up being a couple.

2661
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,640
We'll see.

2662
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:48,640
We'll see.

2663
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:50,080
Anyway, Brad, what'd you call in for tonight?

2664
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:55,800
Oh, just gonna end that, you know, tying into what Rageinator was saying, I gotta be surprised.

2665
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:00,280
My favorite game of the year that I got was Overwatch.

2666
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:02,080
Yeah, yeah.

2667
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,680
There's a lot of love out there for Overwatch.

2668
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:08,960
And again, I want to stress, the way I answered Rageinator's question is not the same way

2669
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,440
I would answer what is the best game of 2016, but we'll get into that possibly later.

2670
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:16,040
But anyway, what made you say Overwatch?

2671
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:19,240
It's just a lot of fun.

2672
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:25,120
It appealed to my gamer ADD to jump in, play for a while, jump back out.

2673
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:28,600
The only frustrating thing is those damn loot boxes.

2674
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,880
Did you get the five free ones for the holiday, which by the way, Overwatch players, if you

2675
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:36,560
didn't already check that out, they gave out five free loot boxes for the holiday.

2676
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:41,360
I opened up five on PlayStation 4 and five on PC, and you know what I got?

2677
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,880
Jack shit.

2678
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,240
I didn't get anything useful.

2679
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:49,040
I got sprays, voice lines I don't like, like nothing.

2680
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,040
I didn't get any skins.

2681
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:53,040
Yeah, I get all kinds of shit from characters I don't care about.

2682
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,040
Exactly.

2683
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:57,560
All I want, I wanted just like a Christmas skin for somebody.

2684
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:03,240
At least during the Summer Games event, at least I got Lucio's Summer Games outfit, which

2685
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:06,760
was awesome because I actually play Lucio quite a bit, so that was really cool to have.

2686
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:11,600
I actually had a lot of luck with Lucio skins because I have his gold frog DJ thing too,

2687
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:12,600
which is awesome.

2688
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:15,600
I got Yeti Winston.

2689
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:18,080
Oh, that's cool.

2690
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:19,840
I just don't play Winston a lot.

2691
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,520
I guess if I play any tank, I usually play Winston, but I'm starting to get used to Reinhardt

2692
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:30,680
a little more too, and Reinhardt's a really effective tank, so it's hard to not play Reinhardt.

2693
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:38,920
Yeah, I've been playing that, and then I've been trying the new update to No Man's Sky

2694
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:39,920
on PS4.

2695
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:43,640
Oh yeah, what do you think of No Man's Sky, especially post-update and the whole base

2696
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,400
building and all that now?

2697
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,400
It's still a very zen game.

2698
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,400
Yeah, it is.

2699
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,640
It's a good one to chill out too.

2700
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:53,760
But it's nice that you can build the base on your planet so now you can go back and

2701
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:59,400
stuff and do all that, so I'd like to hear more about what they have planned for the

2702
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,520
future, but I guess this is the way it is now.

2703
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,920
We're just going to get the updates when they come out, and they're not going to talk on

2704
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:08,560
Twitter because people on Twitter are mean.

2705
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:12,560
I think you can get it for like 20 bucks now, so it's definitely a 20-buck game.

2706
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:14,920
Yeah, I was just telling somebody else this earlier today.

2707
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,140
We were talking about it because he mentioned that he's getting a PlayStation 4 soon and

2708
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:22,280
finally catching up and getting on that band, or at least like he says, finally catching

2709
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:26,200
up, but I'm kind of like, there's a lot of people that are still on PS3, and not everybody

2710
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,460
can afford to get the newest gaming tech.

2711
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:31,780
But anyway, he said he's getting it, and I said, he was kind of asking about No Man's

2712
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:32,780
Sky.

2713
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:35,760
We were talking about the controversy a little bit, and I talked about how the controversy

2714
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:39,900
didn't really bug me with No Man's Sky because my expectations were low.

2715
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:43,120
I didn't buy into all the hype about the game in the first place, so when I played the game

2716
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:44,120
I was fine.

2717
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:48,460
And I said, you know what, now that it's a 20-dollar game especially, it's a great deal

2718
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:49,460
at 20 bucks.

2719
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,460
Oh yeah.

2720
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:51,460
Yeah.

2721
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:52,460
Very definitely.

2722
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:57,780
So just don't expect to actually do multiplayer or anything like that, and you'll be fine.

2723
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,100
Yeah.

2724
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:00,100
Yep.

2725
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,100
All right.

2726
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:03,100
Well, Brad, anything else you want to share with us before we let you go?

2727
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:04,100
No.

2728
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:08,660
If I had some Fireball in the studio, I'd do a shot with you, but unfortunately I'm tapped

2729
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:09,660
at the moment.

2730
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:10,660
Well, I appreciate that.

2731
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:14,500
Have you been tappered?

2732
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:15,500
Only if you ask nicely.

2733
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:19,180
A happy holidays to you and everybody over there helping you out with pod culture.

2734
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,180
All right.

2735
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:21,180
Same to you guys.

2736
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:22,180
All right.

2737
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:23,180
Take care, my friend.

2738
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:24,180
Thank you.

2739
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:25,180
Bye-bye.

2740
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:26,180
All right.

2741
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:27,180
Let's see if anybody else tries to call in.

2742
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:30,180
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2743
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:34,920
If you want to do it the old-fashioned way, you can as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR, but I don't

2744
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:37,740
think we've had a call on that line in a very long time.

2745
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:40,900
But Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2746
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:45,740
We'll give it a few minutes, but if nobody else calls in, then that will be a show.

2747
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:49,140
Dark Sakura, any last-minute stories or things you want to bring up with our audience before

2748
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:52,980
we pull the plug on tonight's show if we don't get any calls here?

2749
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:54,900
Christmas is really a pagan holiday.

2750
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,700
You're going to edumacate the listeners tonight?

2751
02:00:58,700 --> 02:00:59,700
It's true.

2752
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:00,700
Yeah.

2753
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:05,340
Basically, if you don't already know, and I've explained it a bajillion times, all of

2754
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:12,920
these traditions, with the exception of the Jesus stuff, all came from pagan winter holidays.

2755
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:19,060
They did not have decorated fir trees in Bethlehem.

2756
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:22,540
So just saying, know your history.

2757
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:25,100
I feel like you're a living Tumblr post right now.

2758
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:28,700
Well, yeah, Tumblr was made for people like me.

2759
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:32,580
And dick.

2760
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:38,980
One last call, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR, some folks in chat, Bob

2761
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:42,300
Coffey just stumbled into chat saying, oh, I forgot OLR was on tonight.

2762
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:43,300
Yep.

2763
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:45,020
Well, the good news is, this will be on the podcast feed.

2764
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:49,380
You came in time to hear me talk about dick.

2765
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:50,380
So there you go.

2766
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:52,020
And you're not even as drunk as you were at the beginning of the show.

2767
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:54,900
And I never did finish this glass of wine.

2768
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:55,900
Frickin' Stroopwafel.

2769
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:56,900
Oh my God.

2770
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:57,900
Rob.

2771
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:58,900
Rob.

2772
02:01:58,900 --> 02:01:59,900
What?

2773
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:00,900
Rob.

2774
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:01,900
Rob.

2775
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:05,740
You sound like a broken car or something.

2776
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:06,740
But what?

2777
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:07,740
You need more.

2778
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:11,740
I'm finishing off this one.

2779
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,740
Hold on.

2780
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:15,980
Please understand that there will be silence for a moment here.

2781
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:18,100
Not really, because I'm going to sing.

2782
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:19,100
We need to do-

2783
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:20,100
No, no singing.

2784
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:21,100
I will mute the mics for their singing.

2785
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:31,260
We need to do the Careless Whisper saxophone line on repeat in honor of our departed.

2786
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:34,540
Can we do the sax line from Carly Rae Jepsen's Runaway with Me?

2787
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:35,540
No.

2788
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:36,540
Why not?

2789
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:37,540
Because?

2790
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:38,540
Carly Slay?

2791
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:39,540
Because George Michael.

2792
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:42,480
This is the day of our Lord Carly Slay Jesus Epson.

2793
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,480
Come on.

2794
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:44,480
Anyway.

2795
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,580
I quit for the year.

2796
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:47,580
All right.

2797
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:50,660
Nobody's calling in, so I guess we are definitely done.

2798
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:52,020
And I chugged the rest of the wine.

2799
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:53,020
Thank you very much.

2800
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:55,580
And I'm sorry for my poor taste earlier.

2801
02:02:55,580 --> 02:03:00,340
Actually, I'm only vaguely sorry for it, because it was pretty funny.

2802
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:01,340
All right.

2803
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:03,280
So anyway, there it is.

2804
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:07,340
And she did have a little bit to drink, so she was a little unhinged, y'all.

2805
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:10,300
But thank you for tolerating us for two hours tonight.

2806
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:14,140
I told you all at the very beginning, I said, if this is your first OLR, maybe you should

2807
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:17,340
go listen to a different episode to start, because tonight's going to be a little crazy.

2808
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:21,980
But I hope you guys in our chat and the fans that have been listening for over 670 episodes,

2809
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:27,260
I hope you enjoyed our show full of holiday cheer, shall we say.

2810
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:28,940
Liquid holiday cheer.

2811
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:33,280
I hope you all enjoyed that in our chat and out there in podcast world.

2812
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:39,620
We're going to wrap up, but we will be back in three weeks live with an all new Orange

2813
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:40,620
Laundry Radio.

2814
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:43,260
January 15th will be the next live Orange Laundry Radio.

2815
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:48,540
But you guys, 670 back episodes that you can catch up on.

2816
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:51,620
We'll see if we can put out something that is taped and advanced as well.

2817
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,660
That's still going to try to do that.

2818
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:57,020
But again, I try very hard not to over promise and under deliver.

2819
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:59,100
So expect no show.

2820
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:03,180
And if there's a show that pops in on the podcast feed, then hooray, right?

2821
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:04,180
That's how we work.

2822
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:05,180
Right, DartSakura?

2823
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,180
Yes.

2824
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:07,180
Expect nothing.

2825
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:08,500
You know what, though?

2826
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:09,500
Maybe it will surprise you.

2827
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:13,740
I wish everyone warmth and love and kitty kisses.

2828
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:16,140
Yes, lots of kitty kisses.

2829
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:17,140
Your final thought.

2830
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:19,740
Well, let me just quickly do my line about plugging the show.

2831
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:20,740
Do it.

2832
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:22,140
So thank you for listening to Orange Laundry Radio.

2833
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:25,660
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show tonight, please tell a friend or five

2834
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:28,500
or 25 about the show or 12 apostles.

2835
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:33,260
Tell them about the show and help spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

2836
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,420
has a voice.

2837
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:36,860
But if the voices aren't here, we can't share them.

2838
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:37,860
So we don't ask for your money.

2839
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:38,860
We don't have them in our head.

2840
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:43,860
We just ask for word of mouth and a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, Google

2841
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:46,140
Play Podcast or wherever you found this goes a long way.

2842
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:48,060
Unless you have 10 available, then do 10.

2843
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:49,060
Then do 10 out of 10.

2844
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:50,060
A pluses.

2845
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:51,060
Maximums.

2846
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,060
Yes.

2847
02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:53,060
Maximum.

2848
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:54,060
Maximum ratings.

2849
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:55,420
Now let's do everybody's final thought.

2850
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:58,100
I'll do my sappy final thought first, then you can do yours.

2851
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:02,980
My final thought is that, you know, Christmas is a time that you spend with family a lot

2852
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:04,020
of times, right?

2853
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:07,080
So I just really appreciate you guys showing up.

2854
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:08,080
You guys are like a family.

2855
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:09,300
Aww.

2856
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:14,520
But no, I mean, part of what motivates us to do this show every Sunday when we know

2857
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:18,200
we know there's not 5000 people listening to this show.

2858
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:23,220
We know we're not some huge podcast that matters out there, even though we are the oldest.

2859
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:24,980
We know that all that stuff.

2860
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:30,360
But we still do this show because even though we have a small audience, y'all are a faithful

2861
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:31,360
audience.

2862
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:32,360
You're a loyal audience.

2863
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:33,660
You have family here.

2864
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:38,440
And that's why we love you guys and why we're crazy enough to do a show on Christmas.

2865
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:39,860
So thank you very much.

2866
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:41,400
And I hope you do have a great holiday.

2867
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:45,580
When I say holiday, that not just encompasses everything that whatever it is you celebrate

2868
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:48,360
this time of year, but also New Year's.

2869
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:49,820
Be safe.

2870
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:52,100
Have a safe New Year's celebration.

2871
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,100
Don't do anything stupid like drink and drive.

2872
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,300
Don't be fucking stupid.

2873
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:57,300
Be safe.

2874
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:58,300
Have fun.

2875
02:05:58,300 --> 02:06:02,340
And let us all hope that 2017 fucking stops killing people.

2876
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:04,940
Except like Kirk Douglas.

2877
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:06,620
That's, you know, again, he's 100, you guys.

2878
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:07,620
He's 100.

2879
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:13,300
But 2017 needs to not kill celebrities at the rate that 2016 has been doing.

2880
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:15,260
And a lot of great games.

2881
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:18,420
And let's hope the Nintendo Switch, you guys, you guys, you know what would be the awesome

2882
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:20,900
way to start 2017?

2883
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:25,940
For Loki to walk in here on January 15th and go, I preordered a Switch.

2884
02:06:25,940 --> 02:06:26,940
Y'all know you want to hear it.

2885
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:27,940
Y'all know you want to hear it.

2886
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:33,080
So let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that that happens in a couple weeks.

2887
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,480
DarkSakura, any final thoughts?

2888
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:35,480
Thank you.

2889
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:37,880
I am reading chat, by the way, and thank you very much for the very kind words.

2890
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:39,880
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2891
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:44,680
I love you guys, but not in that way.

2892
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:48,640
I think that you are all mostly wonderful people.

2893
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:51,160
And thank you for listening to us.

2894
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:54,560
And thank you for putting up with me.

2895
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:59,880
And thank you for all of the wonderful things that you have sent us.

2896
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:01,280
Folks who have sent us stuff.

2897
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,680
The rest of you, we're waiting.

2898
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,680
Stop it.

2899
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:05,680
I'm kidding.

2900
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:07,280
You can send us a five star review.

2901
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,280
That will be plenty fun.

2902
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:11,960
You can send me a gift certificate to Sephora.

2903
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,720
Actually Dan got me a gift certificate for Sephora.

2904
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:15,640
Then the listeners don't need to.

2905
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:16,640
You can send us Stroopwafel.

2906
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:17,640
Stroopwafel.

2907
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:19,440
Send us Stroopwafel.

2908
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,440
The liquor and the real things.

2909
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,440
Crunch, crunch.

2910
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:26,640
But no seriously, without you guys, we would not have been, well I don't know, we might

2911
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:30,040
be stubborn, but we don't know that because of you guys.

2912
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:34,880
So thank you for being encouragement and sometimes Devafit.

2913
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,680
Hey now.

2914
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:37,680
Reactionary.

2915
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:38,680
It's Christmas.

2916
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,680
Be nice.

2917
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:40,680
I am being nice.

2918
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:41,680
I'm always nice.

2919
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,240
I am nice.

2920
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:45,640
I was born ready.

2921
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:46,640
Action.

2922
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:49,680
Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

2923
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:50,680
Don't think I don't know.

2924
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,680
Don't think I don't know.

2925
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:54,440
My cousin-in-law got a new bike.

2926
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:58,480
And Dan's response, say that's a nice bike.

2927
02:07:58,920 --> 02:07:59,920
Anyway.

2928
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,080
It's not a Christmas movie, but it ought to be.

2929
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:04,080
Anyway.

2930
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:09,840
All of you are rad in your own individual unique way.

2931
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:15,460
Sometimes I come across, I think, a little bit harsh, but it's all out of love and getting

2932
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:17,600
people to fucking think for themselves.

2933
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:20,160
You guys are all free thinkers.

2934
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:21,780
Continue to be free thinkers.

2935
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:24,840
Continue to resist through the next year.

2936
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,520
And talk to you then.

2937
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,320
Or enlighten if you play Ingress.

2938
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:29,640
Please don't resist.

2939
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:30,640
Enlighten.

2940
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:33,640
Just saying.

2941
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:37,960
There are certain boundaries I have to draw with that line.

2942
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:38,960
Little boundaries.

2943
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:39,960
That's all.

2944
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:42,720
All right.

2945
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:46,320
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2946
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:47,320
Thank you guys so much.

2947
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:48,320
Oh my God.

2948
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:49,320
What?

2949
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:50,320
Oh my God.

2950
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:51,320
What?

2951
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,320
You.

2952
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:53,320
Me?

2953
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,320
What?

2954
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:55,320
What do you do?

2955
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:56,320
Why?

2956
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,320
Because.

2957
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:58,800
This is awesome.

2958
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:01,960
And this is why you've put up with me for going on 15 years.

2959
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:07,320
Rob, I will put up with you for another 15 and then it will expire and I'm done.

2960
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,480
You're kidding.

2961
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:09,480
Kid, kid.

2962
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:12,120
I will put up with you when you're old and gray.

2963
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:13,120
We will.

2964
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:14,120
I'm already old and gray.

2965
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:15,120
Next year.

2966
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:16,120
All right.

2967
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:17,120
We will see you at the Quiceniera.

2968
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:21,040
I will put up with you when you're older and grayer.

2969
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:22,040
Thank you.

2970
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:23,040
And gayer, hopefully.

2971
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,040
All right.

2972
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:25,040
Gayer and grayer.

2973
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:32,840
That's the Orange Lounge Radio 2017, gayer and grayer, but not to be confused.

2974
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:34,800
I can just, I can just see Loki in the background.

2975
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,280
Hey, but not to be confused with clear, which is a cheat.

2976
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:40,280
That's it.

2977
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:41,280
We're definitely done.

2978
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:42,280
Have a great holiday, everybody.

2979
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:43,280
Good night.

2980
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:44,280
Thanks for listening.

2981
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:45,280
Bye.
