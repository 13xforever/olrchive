7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	This week, Capcom says quitters never win and winners never quit by turning to player identification to shame rage quitters into changing their habits. Fighters beware of the scarlet letter Q.
22000	27000	And that's just one story we have on the last pre-holiday episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight. Episode 670 for this, December the 18th of 2016.
44000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts, and she is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
49000	50000	Sup?
50000	51000	How you doing?
51000	53000	Uh, I'm okay.
53000	54000	Yeah, it's alright.
54000	56000	It's okay.
56000	61000	Now wait a minute. You've been in a pretty good mood all night. We've been eating and talking and gossiping.
61000	62000	I'm out of food.
62000	63000	Yeah?
63000	64000	I'm out of coffee.
64000	65000	Oh, you're out of food. Do you want more coffee?
65000	66000	No.
66000	68000	We can do more coffee. I've got plenty of K-Cups for the machine.
68000	70000	I couldn't make words happen, that's all.
70000	71000	Alright.
71000	73000	Also say hello over there to Techmaster Loki.
73000	74000	Hello.
74000	75000	Hi, Loki. How are you doing?
75000	76000	Fine.
76000	83000	Good. And so, we had a little scare before the show. Your burger may have had the wrong toppings, but it's all is well? We're okay now?
83000	86000	Yeah, I was just thinking their cheese was oddly colored.
86000	87000	Well, it's-
87000	88000	Cheese, quotey fingers.
88000	90000	Yeah, it's Burger King. I don't know.
90000	92000	Normally it's pretty good.
92000	94000	It's okay. It's alright. Anyway.
94000	99000	Hi, guys. You guys are in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
99000	104000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
104000	109000	And you guys can participate live with our show, where Fifth Dream in chat says,
109000	111000	It's been a while since she was here live.
111000	116000	Actually, Dark Soccer's return was last week, Fifth Dream. Where were you? You might have just not been here.
116000	117000	Yeah.
117000	120000	But Dark Soccer will be here for the foreseeable future.
120000	121000	Future, future.
121000	126000	Including next week, if you guys didn't know, we will be doing a live Orange Lawns Radio-
126000	128000	On the first day of Hanukkah.
128000	129000	Holiday Spectacular.
129000	131000	And Daddy's gonna drink.
131000	132000	So, just like-
132000	134000	Mama might be drinking too.
134000	136000	So, yes. Look forward to that. Please look forward to it.
137000	142000	Unfortunately, Uncle Loki will not be able to make it. But, I mean, it is kind of a major holiday.
142000	148000	So, but, you guys hopefully will be here too. If you guys are bored on the night of the 25th, you can come join us.
148000	150000	Bobby Black Wolf will be here too with his show.
150000	153000	Or, you can always use the podcast feed.
153000	157000	We're on iTunes. What? Google Play Store.
157000	161000	Pretty much all the big places you can find podcasts except for one.
161000	163000	You can find us almost anywhere else.
163000	165000	So, TuneIn is the one that I certainly recommend.
165000	168000	So, all the great places you can find podcasts.
168000	172000	They're available and you can find our Christmas episode if you can't be here live.
172000	175000	ActDeftInChat says, I'll be here.
175000	179000	Well, good. I'm glad. I'm glad at least one person can be here next week.
179000	184000	Before we get into the kickoff topic tonight, I need to address something right at the top of the show.
184000	188000	Okay? And I'm gonna admit, this has absolutely nothing to do with video games.
188000	192000	But, in the past like four hours, I've been called a witch.
192000	195000	I've been called a prophet. I've been called the Oracle.
195000	200000	I want to play a clip from our last show. This was seven days ago, okay?
200000	203000	This is a minute long clip from the last episode, 669.
203000	205000	A little bit of throwback music, please.
205000	208000	I just want people to get the fuck over it.
208000	210000	And, Betty White to stay alive.
210000	211000	Oh, yeah.
211000	215000	No celebrity deaths in 2017. None. Well, maybe a couple. Maybe a couple.
215000	219000	I don't know. Who do you think will die first?
219000	222000	Betty White or Kirk Douglas?
222000	224000	Oh, well, let's...
224000	225000	He's a hundred now.
225000	229000	I know. And I hate to say this. I hate to say this, but can I say Zsa Zsa Gabor?
229000	230000	Okay, Zsa Zsa.
230000	232000	She's one of those people where you go, how?
232000	233000	Right?
233000	234000	How?
234000	235000	Preservatives.
235000	238000	I'm fine with her being one of the three and, you know, the potential.
238000	243000	If there's certain sacrificial lambs we have to offer 2017, then it's like, okay.
243000	246000	If she has to die so Betty White can live, then I'm by all means.
246000	252000	Kirk Douglas. I mean, this is horrible. We're horrible people. We should, no, just, you know, but...
252000	255000	Betty White seems to be in the best health of them all.
255000	257000	Yeah, because she's probably still having sex.
257000	263000	Who wouldn't want to sleep with Betty White? I'm serious.
263000	266000	The blood sacrifice has been made.
266000	273000	So, I want to apologize to the Gabor family. I didn't mean it like that.
273000	275000	But yes, in case you hadn't heard...
275000	276000	I did.
276000	282000	Zsa Zsa Gabor died today. And look, look, look, I don't mean to make light of this. It sucks when people die and so forth.
282000	291000	However, the whole reason why I went there in the first place on the show was the fact that the poor lady has had how many surgeries in the past five years.
291000	299000	Does she have any limbs left? I don't even know. And, you know, it's one of those things where her husband's been keeping her alive for I don't know how long.
299000	307000	So, that's why I was kind of joking earlier in the year. How are all these celebrities dying but Zsa Zsa Gabor is still alive?
307000	312000	Well, thank you God for, you know, that little joke. But there you go.
312000	315000	Ironically, they're going to turn her into Robocop.
315000	316000	Stop it right now.
316000	329000	Well, one of my friends, though, being the person he is, posted the clip from one of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies where she was on an interview show and it turns out she's being interviewed by Freddy Krueger and he slashes her across the face.
329000	336000	Well, that's back when the 80s movies were, like, super cheese tat. That's when we had, like, Sleepaway Camp and all those amazing 80s movies.
336000	337000	Toxic Avenger.
338000	345000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Stoppy says, what was she even famous for outside for being married, like, six times?
345000	346000	Green Acres?
346000	348000	Wasn't that her sister?
348000	350000	I don't think that was Ava. I think that was Zsa Zsa.
350000	358000	I'm pretty sure it was. Well, then, she also slapped the siren on the, because she slapped a cop. So, she was in those Naked Gun movies, right?
358000	365000	She was the original Kardashian. That's what it is. That's what it boils down to is, like, why is Kim Kardashian famous? Anybody? Anybody? Yeah, exactly.
365000	368000	So, like, Zsa Zsa Gabor was kind of like the original Kardashian.
368000	370000	Is it because her parents own a line of hotels? Oh, wait.
370000	373000	No, you're thinking of the wrong, wrong, spoiled kid.
373000	376000	That was the previous line of people that were famous for no reason.
376000	377000	Yes.
377000	382000	Alan Alchemy points out she was in 60s Batman. Oh, that's right. That is right.
382000	390000	Let's see. So, anyway, so, I'm getting yelled at by chatters, but you know what? I said what I said.
390000	393000	But, again, you know, apologies to the Gabor family.
393000	394000	It was Ava.
394000	403000	I thought it was Ava and the Greenagers. Apologies to the Gabor family. However, Betty White should now be okay for this year.
403000	408000	So, let's just all breathe a sigh of relief.
408000	413000	Don't jinx it, Rob. I can't utter celebrity names. Apparently, I have the death whisper. What?
413000	414000	She's the Highlander.
414000	415000	Yeah.
415000	416000	There can be only one.
416000	421000	Let's hope. All right. We need to move on. Thank you, Tiger Claw, a very important movie credit. I should do this.
421000	429000	The 1952 version of Moulin Rouge. So, the one you probably didn't see because it's from 1952, but if you haven't, you should.
429000	432000	This was the pre-Nicole Kidman, you know, that one.
432000	433000	Baz Luhrmann.
433000	439000	Yes, that whole thing. So, anyway, let's move on. We got to get into video game stuff.
439000	443000	I love that the chatters want to keep talking about Jacques Gabor's career. However, we do.
443000	450000	For what is traditionally like the part of the year where the video game news just like dries up significantly and we're left to stretch for time.
450000	454000	I feel like there's still a lot going on this week. So, we're going to start with this.
454000	459000	Some big news that came out earlier this week about the partnership between Nintendo and Universal.
459000	467000	So, we talked about this on prior episodes that the two were teaming up, but now we have some more information about what exactly is planned.
467000	475000	Super Nintendo World is coming to Universal Studios Japan. It is going to be coming in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
475000	484000	That's what they're timing it for. So, Japan, I guess, foresees that 2020 will be a huge tourist year, probably thanks in large part to the Olympics.
484000	492000	So, they're trying to get Super Nintendo World open before then. However, Nintendo themed areas are also going to come to Orlando and Hollywood.
492000	502000	I don't know where they're going to put them because they had to bulldoze the Gibson Amphitheater to put the Harry Potter thing in Hollywood.
502000	507000	I would assume they're going to cut something on the tour. Something on the tour is going to go.
507000	508000	Are they going to take out the mall?
508000	517000	No, they would never take out the mall. The mall makes too much money, I'm sure. Something on the tour will probably give that's on the Universal tour and that'll probably be it.
517000	523000	The last time I was there, they still had the whole set for Desperate Housewives back there. I mean, there's stuff that can go.
523000	524000	Well, that's used for a bunch of stuff.
524000	527000	Yeah, I know. That's true. But they'll think of something.
527000	532000	They can make more money from that stuff than they do the backlot stuff anyway.
532000	541000	Yeah, we'll see. Because they can always move that set somewhere else, like an actual studio. But we'll see. Who knows?
541000	545000	Orlando, I'm sure, has plenty of space. So that probably won't be an issue there.
545000	555000	Anyway, what is Super Nintendo World going to be? Expansive, multi-level environments, unprecedented state-of-the-art rides, interactive areas, shops, and restaurants.
555000	562000	All featuring Nintendo's popular characters and games. Does this mean they will continue to ignore Samus?
562000	565000	That's my question, like they did Metroid's 30th anniversary.
565000	573000	I demand something Samus in this park area, theme area. Needs to happen, right, Logie?
573000	581000	We need something Samus. Look, we know there's going to be Link, Zelda, Mario, Luigi, and that.
582000	585000	And probably like the characters from Animal Crossing, whatever else is mobile at the time.
585000	588000	Which is weird because there was not an Animal Crossing game on the Super Nintendo.
588000	594000	I know, I know. But I don't think this is supposed to literally be Super Nintendo. It's just that's what they're calling the world.
594000	595000	I would go to Super Nintendo Land.
595000	602000	Keep in mind, in Japan it would have been Super Famicom World. So, it's a little different.
602000	610000	Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking, is there a booth where I can romance Waluigi? One can hope.
610000	611000	Why?
611000	620000	Why not? Let's see, anyway, they're saying economic benefits following the opening. 6.2 trillion yen for the Kansai region.
620000	628000	11.7 trillion yen for Japan as a whole. Creating 1.1 million jobs in Japan within a decade after opening.
628000	634000	That's what they're forecasting anyway. So yeah, we don't have any specifics on what the rides will be.
635000	643000	But there is like a mock-up art that you can take a look at. It looks really cute. I want to go, that's for sure.
643000	648000	Well, you better get those pre-orders in because they're probably not going to sell enough tickets for all the people that want to go.
648000	655000	Fuck off. The accuracy of that read is way too good. Thank you.
655000	661000	Well, I mean, it's funny enough, although you can make the parallels about Nintendo's supply and demand issues,
661000	673000	that actually probably will be the case because Japan is going to be getting all these people visiting it for the Olympics and other stuff that's going on in 2020.
673000	679000	So, it's going to be a big year for Japan. So, in a way, you kid, but there's some truth to that.
679000	684000	I wonder how long it will be, though, before it opens up in Hollywood and Orlando.
684000	689000	Because what the Harry Potter thing was about a one or two year difference between Orlando and Hollywood, right?
689000	694000	It was about a two year difference, I think. So, I haven't even been to the one in Hollywood yet. I really want to go.
694000	695000	I haven't either.
695000	702000	I really want to go. I just haven't. I've been to Universal there. Xtifer and I, my pal from Guys Will Show, Xtifer and I went to Universal Studios and we had a great time.
702000	712000	We rode the Mummy ride, which I really hope doesn't go away, seeing as I hear that they're doing a Mummy reboot, which that franchise is not even.
712000	713000	It's terrible.
713000	715000	Tom Cruise? What?
715000	719000	I'm fine. Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise can really be in anything because I love watching Tom Cruise's movies run away from things.
719000	724000	I mean, honestly, I love Tom Cruise as an actor. I don't care about his personal stuff.
724000	725000	He was really good at Magnolia.
725000	729000	He's fantastic. Put him in any action movie, it's fine. I mean, they're all great.
729000	733000	Things I did not expect Loki to say on there.
733000	738000	I just don't think that that movie franchise needs to be rebooted because they drove it into the ground.
738000	744000	Do you know why they're doing it? Universal wants its own Avengers. That's what it boils down to.
744000	753000	Universal is rebooting all these classic horror franchises because they want to do their own version of the Avengers with classic movie characters.
753000	756000	This is completely serious. I read about it on Wikipedia. It is true.
756000	766000	I fully expect then after they reboot everything to culminate in the reboot of the monster squad because that's really where it's all going to is the monster squad at the end.
766000	772000	So anyway, X4 and I rode the Mummy ride and we had no idea what the ride was.
772000	776000	We just knew it was like a roller coaster and it used to be the E.T. ride years ago.
776000	778000	So we're like, whatever, let's do the Mummy ride.
778000	783000	So we went on it and it's like, it starts off and it's very casual, like going through these different rooms.
783000	785000	It's like, oh, spooky. It's like a black light ride to Disneyland.
785000	791000	And then all of a sudden, like 70 miles an hour, like all through this thing.
791000	795000	And then it like stops at some point and they make it seem like bugs are attacking your feet.
795000	800000	And then the whole thing goes backward and X4 and I were screaming our heads off.
800000	808000	I really wish we had video of it because we would be a viral sensation on YouTube with how big we were screaming on that ride because we had no idea what it was going to be or what to expect.
808000	815000	So like, you know, getting thrown backwards at 70 miles an hour, not exactly a sensation you are, you know, expecting.
815000	820000	So yes, that was our adventure at Universal Studios.
820000	829000	So I'm hoping, my point with this is, I'm hoping even though Nintendo is seen by a lot of people as a kid thing, I do hope there's a really good thrill ride in it.
829000	832000	I really hope Universal does a good thrill ride out of this.
833000	842000	So, that being said, chatters, hosts, what Nintendo property do you want to see them make a thrill ride out of?
842000	844000	Dark Sakura.
844000	845000	Super Metroid.
845000	847000	Super Metroid. So you say Samus-
847000	848000	It could totally happen.
848000	852000	Yeah, it could. It could be so, it could be, they could do it with like the escape sequence at the end of the game or something.
852000	857000	Like Samus has to escape from Zeb's or something. That would be really cool.
857000	859000	Loki?
859000	860000	Uh oh.
860000	863000	If you want a thrill ride, there's only one property that could possibly-
863000	865000	You're gonna take my answer, I know it.
865000	867000	It's gonna be Pokemon Snap.
867000	870000	What?
870000	872000	Oh my god though, they really could-
872000	873000	But it could be a ride.
873000	876000	It could be like a Toy Story at Disneyland type thing.
876000	882000	They could do, like, but instead of shooting the Pokemon, you're throwing berries at it or something.
882000	887000	But they could totally do like a Pokemon Snap type thing. Oh my god, I would actually love that.
887000	892000	However, the tricky thing with Pokemon, Pokemon Company is a separate company from Nintendo.
892000	900000	So I'm not sure you can bank on- I mean, it's a technicality, but still, I'm not sure you can bank on Pokemon showing up at this thing.
900000	910000	I would think it would be ridiculous for them to not partner up to sell oodles and oodles of stuffed Pokemon exclusive to the parks and this shit, but it's not a given.
911000	918000	Okay, my answer for that, I thought you were gonna say this when you said there's only one thrill ride that could possibly do.
918000	921000	F-Zero. Thank you.
921000	922000	That could do it.
922000	927000	Thank you. F-Zero. I wanna see an F-Zero ride. So bad, but I just, I know it's not gonna happen.
927000	936000	It's gotta have, though, I would imagine something like that being in a series of projection tubes, where you've got the scenery projected through 60 around you.
936000	941000	Like, they used to do the people mover in the 70s at Disneyland, for serious.
941000	943000	But until someone fell off of it in a drunken super.
943000	945000	Yeah, but that was their fault, they were drunk.
945000	947000	Yeah. Well, they had that Tron section.
947000	949000	Yeah, yeah, that's what-
949000	954000	Imagine a whole thing like that, you know, and it would look more seamless in, like, a tube.
954000	958000	I'm here for this, yes. But I just, I know it's not gonna happen, and you know why?
958000	969000	Because how frickin' obvious would it be to have bumper cars and be Super Mario Kart, and they'll have big inflatable shells you can throw at other people or something ridiculous.
969000	970000	I'm telling you, it's happening.
970000	971000	I think I-
971000	976000	That's like, if anything is a given at this, a Super Mario Kart bumper car has to be.
976000	983000	I think I just hurt my entire series of ocular muscles with how hard I just rolled my eyes.
984000	990000	Alright, let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, Legend of Zelda.
990000	995000	JD says, Pokemon Snap already feels like it's a small world.
997000	1002000	Let's see, oh, VidPower in chat suggests, Kirby Air Ride for people moving.
1002000	1006000	So, there you go, some suggestions for thrill rides at the park.
1006000	1010000	So, what do you guys think? Let's see, how many years of OLR will we be doing at this point?
1010000	1018000	That would be our 18th year. We'll be 18 and legal, so I think we should celebrate in Japan. What do you say? Let's go.
1018000	1019000	Who wants to pay for it?
1019000	1023000	I don't know. We'll do a GoFundMe. No, I would never ask the listeners to pay for something so silly.
1023000	1024000	Actually?
1024000	1029000	I would not want the listeners to pay for something so silly. We'll save up the money and do it.
1029000	1035000	If we sell shirts and put the money from the shirt sales into a Japan fund, I'm okay with that.
1035000	1042000	I was just thinking if we did a GoFundMe and had enough, we'd say like, and if we reach a certain amount, one lucky listener gets to come with us.
1042000	1051000	Then you get into weird lottery laws, legal, you know, but I'm fine. Maybe if we want to, okay, Jamie, you've been talking about doing a book for how long, like an OLR keepsake.
1051000	1052000	I plan on doing the book.
1052000	1054000	So, we'll sell the book and then that's okay.
1054000	1056000	But people haven't fucking sent me pictures.
1056000	1061000	That's different. Like if with the product and you're selling it and we put the money away, that's different.
1061000	1069000	I want OLR listeners to send me pictures of hanging out with other listeners if you have them.
1069000	1078000	And even maybe a little, a little blurb about yourself, you know, so we can have like the yearbook in the back.
1078000	1085000	Maybe we'll look into one of those things where like we get an app or something and we do like bonus episodes, but only if you pay the money to do the app.
1085000	1087000	Patreon, here we come.
1087000	1093000	I don't know. I don't know. I'm more of the type of, I'm just old school like that.
1093000	1097000	Like I've got to give some type of tangible product that you're paying money for and that's, that's it.
1097000	1100000	You know, and then we put the profits away, right?
1100000	1103000	Put them away into donuts. Yum.
1103000	1109000	And okay, if we don't, you know what, if we don't raise enough money to go to Japan, Malasada is on every episode.
1109000	1110000	There you go.
1110000	1112000	Wait, what are those?
1112000	1114000	You haven't had a Malasada?
1114000	1115000	What are those?
1115000	1120000	Number one, play Pokemon Sun and Moon. Number two, there are the like Portuguese donuts, but they're really big in Hawaii.
1120000	1123000	And they're, they're hard to find here.
1123000	1126000	The only place I know of that sells them is L&L's Hawaiian barbecue.
1126000	1129000	And they're not, I mean, it's, it's kind of basic.
1129000	1130000	It's just,
1130000	1132000	Forget that. Let's just go to,
1132000	1134000	Let's just go to Hawaii.
1134000	1137000	Oh, you can go to Hawaii. Let's go to Vancouver.
1137000	1138000	All right, the OLR.
1138000	1140000	Let's go to somewhere that isn't America.
1140000	1142000	The OLR travel fund.
1142000	1148000	Kuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com suggests OLR listener porn collection.
1148000	1151000	Hey, look, if you,
1151000	1156000	if you guys are willing to help us raise money at our bake sale by baking something else, then,
1156000	1161000	If someone says me $500, I'll moon loudly into the, into the mic.
1161000	1165000	You want to go up on fiverr.com or whatever that site is? Or do you pay?
1165000	1167000	No, I just want someone to send me money.
1167000	1168000	Really?
1168000	1170000	All right.
1170000	1173000	Anyway, we'll think about what we can do over the next two years.
1173000	1177000	I'd do it for a copy of Radiant Silver Gun for Saturn.
1177000	1181000	All right, we definitely need to get into our gaming weeks so we can get into the news as well.
1181000	1185000	Because this is, this has gone way off the rails with this Universal Studios thing.
1185000	1186000	The show's gone off the rails.
1186000	1190000	Yeah, I know. It's, it's, it's not the last show of the year, but it kind of feels like it.
1190000	1192000	Because seriously, I don't know what news there's going to be next week.
1192000	1196000	So if you think this show is random, just come back next week for the holiday spectacular.
1196000	1198000	Because I don't know what's going to happen.
1198000	1199000	The holiday drunk-tacular.
1199000	1202000	All right. Anyway, but we do have some gaming news to get into. We'll get there in a minute.
1202000	1204000	But we do have to talk about our gaming weeks.
1204000	1206000	I don't know about you guys, but I've actually played a lot this week.
1206000	1208000	So, Dark Sakura, starting with you. How was your gaming week?
1208000	1209000	You're going to laugh.
1209000	1211000	Because I got Arkanoid for iOS.
1211000	1215000	And I've been playing a lot of bink, bink, bink, bink, bink.
1215000	1219000	Yeah, but as far as breakout clones go, like that's the one to play.
1219000	1223000	I've been going on like this Taito kick, so I also have like Darius Burst.
1223000	1229000	And I haven't actually played it on my phone yet, but I found out that I can airplay it on my Apple TV.
1229000	1235000	So that's fun. I also got Pac-Man Championship DX for Apple TV.
1235000	1238000	And with my SteelSeries controller, it's pretty cool.
1238000	1241000	So I've actually found that controller to be super responsive with my Apple TV.
1241000	1244000	So it's sort of like become another gaming console.
1244000	1251000	So I also have been playing World of Warcraft.
1251000	1259000	Because now that we've got new content from the last patch, I mean, it's gated, which is really annoying.
1259000	1263000	But I've enjoyed the whole Suramar storyline a whole lot.
1263000	1267000	And I've got one more achievement left, and then I think I get flying.
1267000	1274000	So you have no idea how much gold I've saved up just thinking I was going to pay for my account that way.
1274000	1277000	I'm like at $275,000.
1277000	1282000	I may, I don't want to tease you too much, I may re-up for another month in WoW.
1282000	1286000	Just because as far as 14 goes, I've kind of hit a wall in 14.
1286000	1288000	I've done everything there is to do.
1288000	1293000	And I'm still doing Deep Dungeon, which is kind of like I got into that when I should have done it last patch.
1293000	1300000	But a lot of my guildies aren't on a lot, and there's not a lot of content that we really do as a group.
1300000	1303000	So I kind of miss that whole getting together to do stuff.
1303000	1309000	So like if you're actually on and playing, and our pals from Game Buoy are still, do they still play?
1309000	1315000	I've been trying to get Slidekick to come back sometimes.
1315000	1320000	Maybe if I offer Slidekick Malasadas, he'll come back and play. So we'll do something.
1320000	1322000	But Grandpa's been on a few times.
1322000	1325000	Oh, that's good. I never see his ass anymore. That'd be great to play with him.
1325000	1329000	So I think I may re-up just for a month to hold me over, because I'm really excited.
1329000	1333000	14 is finally getting that cross-server shit in 3.5, and that's going to help a lot.
1333000	1335000	But anyway, I don't need to take away from the week.
1335000	1337000	But you should come do classic runs with me in VRT.
1337000	1338000	Yeah, sure, I'd be down for that.
1338000	1339000	Because that's pretty fun.
1339000	1347000	Which was what I've been doing when I couldn't sleep, is I was doing 25-man Black Temple by myself.
1347000	1350000	There's a lot of achievements in old mounts and things.
1350000	1356000	For people especially that are just getting into WoW, there's a lot of back content to just Zen out and go through.
1356000	1359000	So I've been going back and getting mounts that I was missing.
1359000	1364000	There's a snow globe in Dalaran that turns you into a gnome.
1364000	1368000	And Final Fantasy XIV, as much as I love it, it doesn't have that same backlog of content yet.
1368000	1375000	So maybe when Stormblood comes out and I'm level 70, maybe I can do Bahamut's Coil by myself and things like that.
1375000	1378000	It'll be a little more like that, but you can't really do that in XIV right now.
1378000	1382000	I've just been having a good time looking at all the content that I missed.
1382000	1387000	And it's sort of neat, though. The only things that I can't go back and do is old Karazhan.
1387000	1389000	Because that's now a new raid.
1389000	1392000	Oh, they closed off old Karazhan completely?
1392000	1394000	I think they closed off the old Karazhan. I have to double check.
1394000	1396000	That's shitty if they did. Sorry.
1396000	1402000	But I'll have to go back and double check, but I know that they were completely revamping Karazhan and now there's a new raid out.
1402000	1404000	One of our people in chat has got to be a WoW player, right?
1404000	1416000	Yeah. But I'm still playing Pokemon Go. I just hit 21. Yeah, 21. I got my Santa Pikachu.
1416000	1424000	And I have been... I actually didn't play any more Animal Crossing, I hate to say.
1424000	1427000	Because I was going to go back and get my island tan.
1427000	1432000	I was playing something else and I can't remember what I was playing.
1432000	1437000	Sonic CD with a Japanese soundtrack. Because it's better.
1437000	1440000	I think that's it.
1440000	1442000	Alright, we'll move on to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1442000	1450000	I didn't play anything. I mean, honestly, I played just cell phone games.
1450000	1454000	Ingress and Pokemon Go. I tried a little bit of Pokemon Go.
1454000	1462000	Mainly what I've been trying to do is on my drive home from picking up the kids, there's a long section where there's not any Ingress play there.
1462000	1466000	So I just flip it over to Pokemon Go during that time.
1466000	1469000	And then my kids want me to drive them around the neighborhood to look at lights.
1469000	1472000	So I usually play Pokemon Go while that's going on.
1472000	1478000	With my neighborhood, apparently there's such frequent spawns that it makes it really easy to just keep catching Pokemon.
1478000	1485000	But with that, it seems like they've tweaked what you get from those Poke Stops.
1485000	1489000	Because I'm hardly getting any gear from that stuff anymore, which is annoying.
1489000	1499000	Well, when a lot of people went back in November or October, I think it was the event right after the Halloween thing, they did double output on Poke Stops.
1499000	1503000	So people kind of got used to that as the norm. And that's actually not the norm.
1504000	1510000	I found something that you hit the same one and it's like every certain number of hits are double.
1510000	1516000	I used to get at least five, four items per spin, and now it's like three.
1516000	1520000	And two of those, or maybe one of those will be a Poke Ball.
1520000	1525000	It's just ridiculous. They're really trying to get you to buy Poke Balls and I'm like, no.
1525000	1528000	Alan and I have taken to driving through downtown slowly.
1529000	1534000	Obviously I don't want to use my phone and drive, but I can use the little Pogo app.
1534000	1539000	Plus, that's what it's called, Pogo Plus. You can set that to Poke Stops only.
1539000	1545000	So I'll just kind of have that as I drive slowly through downtown and just hit every Poke Stop.
1545000	1547000	You're cruising for stops.
1547000	1553000	Yeah, we're cruising. That's the funny thing about Ingress and Pokemon Go is that they kind of brought cruising back.
1553000	1555000	It's nerd cruising.
1555000	1559000	But I did get a Ditto, so I've got that now.
1559000	1563000	I don't know. It's alright. I do like that there's different things spawning.
1563000	1567000	It seems like they're spawning all over the place, but it's just not anything new for me.
1567000	1570000	But I mean, it's alright I guess.
1570000	1573000	And then it did a little bit of Ingress as well.
1573000	1576000	I don't know. That's pretty much it.
1576000	1581000	I haven't really been playing any console games. I've been trying to work on programming stuff and doing all that.
1581000	1585000	I've kind of taken a break from coding because I needed to build for what I was working on.
1585000	1588000	Because it was an Excite truck type game.
1588000	1592000	So I need to build a test track-ish area that I can actually...
1592000	1597000	I need something with enough room where I can build in the rest of the stuff for driving.
1597000	1599000	Because you can't really do it without a track.
1599000	1601000	So that's what I'm working on right now.
1601000	1604000	Alright. My gaming week. My turn.
1604000	1606000	Okay, so unpopular opinion time.
1606000	1610000	I know Loki really gets all the hate mail on this show, but it's going to be me this week.
1610000	1615000	Because I think I have an unpopular opinion on something that a lot of people are playing this week.
1615000	1617000	So here we go.
1617000	1621000	I downloaded Super Mario Run, and I think it sucks.
1621000	1622000	I don't...
1622000	1623000	Woohoo!
1623000	1625000	Why are you cheering?
1625000	1628000	Because it's just a runner game and everyone is super hyped.
1628000	1630000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1630000	1632000	That's how I can tell you haven't played.
1632000	1633000	Dan likes it.
1633000	1637000	Anybody who's calling Super Mario Run an endless runner, it's not endless.
1637000	1639000	Yes, it's not an endless runner. Okay, I'm sorry.
1639000	1644000	It's not an endless runner. It's a Mario game that they've simplified the controls down to nothing.
1644000	1646000	It's just not fun.
1646000	1649000	I'm sorry. I don't know what it is.
1649000	1652000	Well, actually, I think I do know what it is.
1652000	1655000	The way they did the pay thing is weird.
1655000	1659000	And I am not being one of those people that doesn't think you should pay $10 for a game.
1659000	1661000	I get that. I understand that.
1661000	1667000	But it is a little weird how once you pay the $10, then it says,
1667000	1670000	oh, but you get these 20 Toad Rally tickets.
1670000	1672000	You get these 3,000 coins.
1672000	1674000	You get this special item.
1674000	1679000	To me, it felt like they were giving you all these things that you would expect to see in a free-to-play game,
1679000	1683000	like the Toad tickets, which I understand you don't buy them for money.
1683000	1685000	You earn them through the little bonus houses and all this stuff.
1685000	1687000	But that whole thing is a really weird mechanic.
1687000	1690000	And I do not like those Toad rallies.
1690000	1692000	I don't like it. I mean, sorry.
1692000	1696000	But I just, and yes, I did drop the $10 on the whole thing,
1696000	1698000	so I've seen more than just one map on the Toad rally.
1698000	1703000	I just don't, like, it's weird because you're not actually competing against somebody live,
1703000	1708000	and you're kind of unsure what it is you can do to do better than the other person.
1708000	1711000	It's very, very vague in a lot of the descriptions.
1711000	1714000	And it's just, it's kind of same-sy boring to me.
1714000	1717000	Even if you were to say, well, Rob, you want to do this.
1717000	1720000	I'll be, I'm sorry, it's still very same-sy boring to me
1720000	1725000	and not as exciting as it would be to maybe actually compete against somebody live in the same room
1725000	1727000	or something might be a little more fun.
1727000	1732000	But at the end of the day, I just don't like the whole non-stop running thing.
1732000	1735000	I just don't like that direction for the Mario franchise.
1735000	1741000	And I understand they can't do a traditional control thing, you know,
1741000	1743000	because that would suck on the phone as well.
1743000	1746000	So I understand they came up with this creative solution,
1746000	1749000	but I don't like it, and that's my opinion. Sorry.
1749000	1750000	You tried there.
1750000	1753000	I tried. I paid the money. I tried. I don't like it.
1753000	1756000	So that's it for Super Mario Run.
1756000	1760000	And that's unfortunately, that's just the limitation of that platform.
1760000	1763000	That just doesn't, it doesn't work. I'm sorry.
1763000	1766000	Like, platform games don't work on that platform.
1766000	1770000	I'm really curious to see now something like Animal Crossing.
1770000	1773000	And dare I, okay, now I'm really going to get the hate mail.
1773000	1775000	Y'all ready? Get your email clients open.
1775000	1778000	Participate at orangehontrader.com.
1778000	1783000	I had more fun with Miitomo because I felt Miitomo was an experience
1783000	1786000	that's better built for the phone than probably Super Mario Run is
1786000	1787000	at the end of the day.
1787000	1791000	I think Super Mario Run is the game the investors forced Nintendo to make.
1791000	1793000	Okay, they made it.
1793000	1795000	Now don't ever listen to the investors again
1795000	1797000	because they don't know what the fuck to do to make a game.
1797000	1799000	That's very obvious.
1799000	1801000	But that's me. That's my perspective.
1801000	1803000	Okay, now I'm going to look at chat.
1803000	1806000	Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
1806000	1807000	Sky, you're not alone.
1807000	1809000	I've heard from others that felt the same way,
1809000	1811000	especially over the pricing.
1811000	1812000	Let's see.
1812000	1815000	Stoppy says, why has Sonic not had an endless runner?
1815000	1818000	That would seem to work really well with that franchise.
1818000	1820000	Let's see, also in chat.
1820000	1823000	Fifth Dream in chat says, no way, dude.
1823000	1825000	Mario is the next Pokemon Go, Kappa.
1825000	1828000	Alan Alchemy says, does Shane love it?
1828000	1830000	Because if you feel this strongly about it,
1830000	1833000	it really increases the odds he'll feel the opposite.
1833000	1835000	I don't know. Maybe Shane will text me.
1835000	1838000	Which, by the way, Shane texted about Karazhan, Dark Sakura.
1838000	1840000	Shane said, old Karazhan is accessible.
1840000	1843000	New Karazhan is not a raid. It's a mythic something.
1843000	1844000	Gotcha.
1844000	1845000	Whatever that whole thing is.
1845000	1847000	By the way, there was another game I forgot to say I've been playing.
1847000	1848000	Oh, yes?
1848000	1852000	In my Taito kick, I have Raystorm.
1852000	1853000	Okay.
1853000	1857000	As in, you know, Rayforce, Raycrisis, Raystorm.
1857000	1859000	Because a lot of those classics are on iOS now.
1859000	1862000	It's actually really fun to play just in iPhone mode.
1862000	1865000	So it's one of my favorite shooters.
1865000	1867000	But you haven't been playing Super Mario Run?
1867000	1869000	No, I haven't. I've been watching Dan play it.
1869000	1871000	And when I saw him play it, I was like, I'm not interested.
1871000	1872000	Okay. So, okay.
1872000	1874000	See, I was worried it was just going to be a me thing.
1874000	1876000	Well, I haven't played it, so I can't make a judgment on it.
1876000	1877000	Okay.
1877000	1881000	I mean, especially when I found out that the actual purchase of the game
1881000	1885000	is an in-game purchase, which is how they're going past family sharing.
1885000	1887000	That's kind of janky.
1887000	1889000	Oh, I didn't know that.
1889000	1892000	Yep. You download the game for free.
1892000	1895000	But to unlock it, you pay $10.
1895000	1901000	And so, and since family sharing does not encompass in-app purchases,
1901000	1905000	then that's how they're bypassing family sharing.
1905000	1908000	Okay, Allen, you ready for a twist?
1908000	1910000	Y'all wanted a twist, eh?
1910000	1913000	Shane just texted me, I do not care for Mario Run.
1913000	1915000	It's just not my type of game.
1915000	1917000	I've not liked Mario games in forever, though.
1917000	1919000	See, that's where I disagree with him.
1919000	1923000	Because I think, like, Mario 3D World on Wii U is fantastic.
1923000	1925000	I think there have been a lot of great Mario games lately.
1925000	1927000	Just not this one.
1927000	1928000	And that's just an opinion.
1928000	1929000	But you know what?
1929000	1932000	I'm not going to poo-poo on those that are playing it and having fun.
1932000	1933000	No, not at all.
1933000	1934000	Props to you. Have a great time.
1934000	1935000	Yeah, exactly.
1935000	1937000	And there's lots of games out there that people like that I don't get.
1937000	1939000	Like, half the games that they advertise on TV.
1939000	1940000	Like Mass Effect?
1940000	1943000	Yes, Mass Effect being one of them.
1943000	1947000	But, like, my thing was that, like, when they're hyping this shit up.
1947000	1949000	When they're putting it on fucking talk shows and shit.
1949000	1951000	Hyping it up like it's going to be the next Pokemon GO.
1951000	1954000	It was never going to be the next Pokemon GO.
1954000	1956000	See, here's the thing, though.
1956000	1959000	Well, first off, Nintendo wins in both situations.
1959000	1961000	So don't pit the games against each other.
1961000	1966000	But second off, like, I actually kind of like the whole video games on mainstream TV thing.
1966000	1969000	Like, it brings a lot more legitimacy to our hobby.
1969000	1971000	Not that we need it.
1971000	1973000	You know what I mean? But it's still, come on.
1973000	1976000	Even if you're very, like, anti-mainstream and all that stuff.
1976000	1982000	There's still something a little bit rewarding about seeing that on TV.
1982000	1987000	I think especially, like, if you kind of grew up where video game was always, like, a counterculture nerd thing.
1987000	1988000	That's fine.
1988000	1994000	But that little bit that they did on TV, though.
1994000	1995000	Jimmy Fallon?
1995000	1998000	Yeah, when Jimmy Fallon was not doing that game any favors.
1998000	2000000	I got it. I was excited to play it.
2000000	2004000	And I just, I realized it was one of those things that just sounded better than it played.
2004000	2008000	But anyway, all right, I'm going to stop taking a dump on Super Mario Run and let all of you that are enjoying it enjoy it.
2008000	2009000	Have fun.
2009000	2011000	Let's talk about good news.
2011000	2015000	I want to talk about a game I'm really enjoying and I think is really, really good.
2015000	2017000	And it took me way too long to get around to this game.
2017000	2020000	And I think this is one of the best games that's come out all year.
2020000	2022000	KC Munchkin.
2022000	2024000	This is not 1982, girl.
2024000	2026000	All right.
2026000	2027000	But here's the thing.
2027000	2031000	If you like racing at all in the slightest, you need to play Forza Horizon 3.
2031000	2033000	It is fantastic.
2033000	2036000	It is a step up from Forza Horizon 2 even.
2036000	2042000	I remember some of my complaints about Forza Horizon 2 is that it was, like, really trying to, like, shove the DLC down your throat.
2042000	2046000	I think they kind of took a step back with 3 because I know they just released the Blizzard Mountain.
2046000	2047000	That's nice.
2047000	2052000	And I just think the way they put the game together where now you kind of, you move the horizon spot.
2052000	2055000	You move the festival to, like, these different locations.
2055000	2058000	And I think the scenery is fantastic.
2058000	2060000	Like, does Australia really look like that?
2060000	2062000	Because it's gorgeous.
2062000	2063000	Where's our Australian list or is that?
2063000	2065000	It says the part that has animals that will kill you in your sleep.
2065000	2068000	Well, but you're in a car because you can take them on.
2068000	2072000	But, like, there's just really fucking fun stuff in Forza Horizon 3.
2072000	2078000	Like, one of the first things it has you do is you're going to go off this fucking jump and see how much feet you can get in midair.
2078000	2079000	Like, it just seems like a Loki thing.
2079000	2081000	Like, this just seems like something you would really get a kick out of.
2081000	2083000	I'm really surprised you're not into Forza.
2083000	2084000	But then again, you're not an Xbox One.
2084000	2086000	I don't have an Xbox One.
2086000	2091000	So, I see. But at some point, and whenever those come down in price, you really need to check out Forza.
2091000	2093000	Really fantastic job.
2093000	2097000	Well, yeah, that'd be like one of the games I'd pick up for sure, but I just don't have an Xbox One.
2097000	2102000	So, I'm loving Forza and I think if you like racing games in the slightest, you should try it.
2102000	2105000	Remember, Forza is more of an arcade style racer.
2105000	2111000	So, even if you don't like things like Gran Turismo and the mainline Forza series, which are more simulation,
2111000	2114000	if you like Mario Kart, you will like Forza, I think.
2114000	2121000	So, I mean, and the other cool thing about Forza is that if it's too complicated for you, if you're not taking your turns right,
2121000	2128000	if you're not, you can do so much stuff that's like auto, you can practically do it so that all you do is control the gas pedal.
2128000	2133000	I don't think it's as much fun that way, but that might be a great way for a kid to play the game.
2133000	2140000	So, you know, there's a lot of customization you can do with the difficulty in Forza and I think they did a great job with it.
2140000	2141000	So.
2141000	2142000	Oh my God.
2142000	2143000	That's my thought. What's that?
2143000	2145000	The what lady?
2145000	2147000	Does she die too?
2147000	2148000	Yeah.
2148000	2149000	Fuck this year. Fuck it.
2149000	2150000	She died yesterday.
2150000	2153000	What? How did they know? Did they find her? How did they know it was her?
2153000	2157000	I'm trying to make sure that it's true.
2157000	2158000	Fake news. It's fake news.
2158000	2159000	I'm trying to make sure that it's true.
2159000	2161000	Not fake news. Fake news.
2161000	2165000	That's what it is. Facebook, put a little red stamp on that.
2165000	2168000	She can't be dead. I love her.
2168000	2169000	All right.
2169000	2170000	I don't know her.
2170000	2171000	I feel like.
2171000	2172000	Yeah, she did die.
2172000	2175000	How do you know this? Proof. I want to see the receipts.
2175000	2178000	Someone put, I think, the obituary on Reddit.
2178000	2181000	Oh, Reddit. Come on. Reddit's a source now.
2181000	2187000	No, no disrespect to the Redditors out there. I lurk among you, but I want to see the receipts.
2187000	2189000	All right.
2189000	2191000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetware.com.
2191000	2197000	Stoppy says, wait, so auto mode is kind of like those old remote controlled cars that move on a track.
2197000	2199000	A slot car racing, I think you're thinking of.
2199000	2202000	It can be, but you can turn that on or off.
2202000	2205000	You can turn the braking, assisted braking on or off.
2205000	2207000	You can turn the guide on or off.
2207000	2210000	You can really tune the difficulty down to a very fine level in the game.
2210000	2214000	And I think that's part of what makes the game so powerful in a way.
2214000	2217000	So, yes, I'm loving Forza Horizon 3.
2217000	2219000	I give that a very strong recommendation.
2219000	2224000	Other than that, as far as games this week, I beat Final Fantasy 15.
2224000	2228000	So we talked about that and we've talked about Final Fantasy 15 ad nauseam the past couple of weeks.
2228000	2231000	I finally played and beat 15.
2231000	2235000	At the end of the day, I really enjoyed the game.
2235000	2238000	There are some big flaws with the game.
2238000	2240000	Chapter 13, again, I'm keeping it spoiler free.
2240000	2242000	I know, I see all the hate for Chapter 13.
2242000	2247000	If Chapter 13 was 25% as long and still told the same story, I would be fine with it.
2247000	2249000	And again, I'm going to keep this really vague because I won't spoil anything.
2249000	2257000	But those of you that have played through the whole game know there is very obviously more game that was cut.
2257000	2262000	Very obviously the potential for there to be this whole...
2262000	2266000	Oh, there's an analogy I want to make so badly, but I feel like it's a spoiler.
2266000	2272000	But have you ever had that moment in a game when it was like, what?
2272000	2277000	There's definitely, for me, one of those moments in Final Fantasy 15.
2277000	2280000	And I feel like that's not explored as well as it could have been.
2280000	2283000	Maybe that's the DLC. Womp womp. I don't know.
2283000	2287000	But you know, I've read some interesting theories on Reddit and NeoGaf.
2287000	2290000	So I brought my jug of Morton Salt with me.
2290000	2295000	But some very interesting theories about the fact that, yeah, dev time was cut really short.
2295000	2298000	And that this game was kind of rushed.
2298000	2302000	Which I know, wink wink, laugh, ha ha, because this game took 10 years to develop.
2302000	2307000	But kids, look at the trailer when they announced that Final Fantasy 13 versus was becoming 15.
2307000	2309000	Go back and look at that trailer.
2309000	2312000	Does that game even look like the game that we got?
2312000	2313000	No.
2313000	2320000	So it's very obvious, and that's part of these rumors, and I very much believe that that is the case.
2320000	2324000	Because it feels like it when I look at these old trailers and actually play the game.
2324000	2329000	The game has actually been in development closer to two to three years in its current form.
2329000	2333000	Which would make sense with some of the, you know, they changed the director and all this other stuff.
2333000	2338000	But anyway, we've talked about 15 and Ozzy in the past couple weeks. I don't want to revisit that too much.
2338000	2345000	I will just say, overall, I liked it, but the game did show some weakness in the story towards the end.
2345000	2350000	But I was satisfied with the ending. I was satisfied with a lot about it.
2350000	2353000	I'll be interested to see where the DLC goes.
2353000	2360000	But for me, I still also don't really think it's a Final Fantasy game, which I talked about in previous weeks.
2360000	2365000	But if I had to judge all 15 games, this one would be like in the middle for me.
2365000	2372000	This one would end up in the middle. For me, it's better than probably like 8, 1, 3, which I put towards the bottom of the pack.
2372000	2375000	I know 3 has its fans, I'm really sorry guys.
2375000	2386000	But it's not as strong as 6, 4, 14, 2.0. Probably not even as strong as 10 or 12, really.
2386000	2388000	But that's around where I'd put it.
2388000	2392000	So anyway, that was it, Final Fantasy XV.
2392000	2397000	And then randomly, I played Geometry Wars 3, which I know came out like two years ago.
2397000	2399000	But I was in the mood to do a twin-stick shooter.
2399000	2401000	And I almost bought Enter the Gungeon.
2401000	2407000	But then I was like, oh, you have all this stuff on Geometry Wars 3 you haven't done yet. All these trophies you can go get.
2407000	2409000	So I kind of got sucked back into that.
2409000	2410000	I really should have gotten Enter the Gungeon.
2410000	2411000	I really should have gotten Enter the Gungeon.
2411000	2417000	But it's on sale on PlayStation right now, so I still have a few hours to figure out if I want to get it.
2417000	2421000	Or do I wait for the Steam winner sale and get it on PC?
2421000	2423000	Get it on both like I did.
2423000	2426000	That good, huh? That good.
2426000	2430000	Alright, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2430000	2435000	Let's see, Fifth Dream kind of agrees with something I was saying there in chat.
2435000	2438000	Final Fantasy XV was really only developed for like two years.
2438000	2441000	AkumaJP says, the whole story was changed.
2441000	2445000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com for more comments.
2445000	2449000	Stoppy in chat says, I'll check it out when the price goes down enough.
2449000	2452000	I think it's the right direction for Final Fantasy.
2452000	2454000	So those are comments from our chat.
2455000	2458000	Okay, some housekeeping, then we'll get into some gaming news.
2458000	2461000	So we will be here next week, live on the 25th.
2461000	2463000	Otherwise we'll see you on the podcast feed.
2463000	2466000	There will be no show January 8th.
2466000	2469000	Because I will be at MAGFest.
2469000	2471000	And I hope to see you guys at MAGFest.
2471000	2475000	I don't know, I'm not scheduled to speak on any panels or anything.
2475000	2478000	So I don't have like a place I can guarantee I will be.
2478000	2482000	But if there's enough interest in meeting up at MAGFest, tweet me at Skye, S-K-I-E.
2482000	2485000	And we'll try to do like a dinner or something.
2485000	2488000	Or I don't know, because the food options out there are pretty limited.
2488000	2489000	But we'll try to figure something out.
2489000	2492000	So we can do like a little meet up at MAGFest for those of you that are going.
2492000	2493000	That would be a lot of fun.
2493000	2496000	Someone want to offer up their room for a room party?
2496000	2498000	That would be fun.
2498000	2501000	That's really it. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2501000	2504000	And also on Facebook and Google Plus at username Orange Lounge Radio.
2504000	2507000	Let's get into gaming news. Loki.
2507000	2511000	So Nintendo has filed multiple Nintendo Switch patents.
2511000	2515000	Which have a lot of nice little drawings of stuff.
2515000	2520000	And kind of reveals a few things, features of the Nintendo Switch based on it.
2520000	2523000	So one of the things we know is it does have a touch screen.
2523000	2524000	I mean if that wasn't obvious.
2524000	2526000	Some of the cool things that they were showing off.
2526000	2531000	The actual Joy-Cons or whatever they're calling those.
2531000	2534000	They have some alternate ones for the left Joy-Con.
2534000	2539000	They actually have one that has a D-Pad on it instead of an analog stick.
2539000	2546000	They have one that also replaces the sort of four button D-Pad that they have on the normal one with an actual D-Pad.
2546000	2552000	So there's a few alternate designs that may be made available or something if you want to do that.
2552000	2555000	What was the other stuff?
2555000	2563000	I think there was something regarding an IR admitter or sensor in the Joy-Cons as well.
2563000	2566000	Perhaps for the rumored Wii Virtual Console support.
2566000	2577000	Yeah, so I mean it looks neat and definitely worth checking out all the drawings and stuff to kind of get an idea of how everything will kind of work together.
2577000	2580000	And then finally there was some more news.
2580000	2583000	Not necessarily a patent but it was a trademark filed.
2583000	2588000	So Nintendo has filed a new trademark for Excite Truck.
2589000	2599000	So they're letting I guess their old trademark kind of just expire and they're filing a new trademark instead.
2599000	2603000	So what could that mean? New Excite Truck game? I hope so.
2603000	2607000	Is it just for the Virtual Console release? Who knows.
2607000	2612000	Did I hear correctly that the sequel to Excite Truck, which you were not a big fan of, but what was it called?
2612000	2613000	Excite Robot Excite?
2613000	2614000	Excite Bots.
2614000	2616000	Excite Bots. That hit Wii U Virtual Console.
2616000	2619000	I don't know if you know that but that came out on Wii U Virtual Console this week.
2619000	2622000	So it could be a lead-in?
2624000	2628000	It's not a good lead-in because Excite Bots was pretty terrible.
2628000	2635000	But I mean it was the only sequel who got to Excite Truck.
2635000	2636000	It's something.
2636000	2640000	It was fucking terrible. They just, you know, I don't know why.
2641000	2648000	The Switch is supposedly reimagining all these Wii U games. What about a reimagining of Excite Truck for the Switch?
2648000	2657000	Maybe they're not going to go back and do a whole new one but maybe they're going to take the old one and buff it up to HD and maybe try to revisit that game.
2657000	2662000	I find they add new tracks to the old game. That's really all they should have done for the sequel in the first place.
2662000	2669000	They didn't need to add all these weird transforming robots and nonsensical...
2669000	2670000	Playing poker while you race?
2670000	2677000	Yeah, playing poker, throwing darts, throwing a pie at a clown. It made no fucking sense. I mean, no sense whatsoever.
2677000	2683000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, that's my theory. As bad as Excite Bots was, at least Nintendo is remembering that was a thing.
2683000	2685000	So I'd be down for Excite Truck Remastered.
2685000	2690000	It was a great game. It was poorly advertised. It just poorly...
2690000	2698000	I think it just kind of got lost amongst a lot of the Wii launch titles. I mean, it kind of went up against Zelda and a lot of powerhouse games in the Wii launch.
2698000	2700000	So I think it just kind of got lost.
2700000	2701000	That's too bad.
2701000	2705000	But that would be cool if they at least, if nothing else, do a remaster revisited type of thing.
2705000	2712000	Anyway, we know that the Nintendo Switch will be given more information and a big reveal on January 12th.
2712000	2717000	That has now been timed. It will not be in the morning. It's going to be an evening presentation.
2717000	2723000	So it will be taking place at 8 o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern on January 12th.
2723000	2725000	Is that because of Japan, I'm guessing?
2725000	2729000	It probably is because of Japan because that will be more like morning time in Japan.
2729000	2736000	Because I think Akuma JP listens to this show around lunch hour in Japan. I don't know exactly how far behind they are.
2736000	2739000	So yeah, it's going to be like morning, afternoon in Japan.
2739000	2743000	So the only people that are going to get screwed in that is going to be Europe, I guess.
2743000	2747000	No, because Europe is 8 hours ahead. Well, ahead of us.
2747000	2749000	London is 8 hours ahead.
2749000	2751000	That's true. I'm talking one time.
2751000	2753000	Right now in Japan it's 11.46 am.
2753000	2757000	Okay, yeah. So that makes sense. So if this whole thing goes down at what, 8 o'clock?
2757000	2758000	In Tokyo anyway.
2758000	2762000	So at 8 o'clock Pacific, it will be like 1 or 2 o'clock their time.
2762000	2768000	So, but then 8 o'clock Pacific is going to translate to 4 in the morning in London.
2768000	2776000	So yeah, that's unfortunate. They will probably not get to really watch that live, but it makes sense.
2776000	2786000	So also, the Switch's price, the release date, games currently in development, all confirmed, will be announced at this event.
2786000	2791000	I would imagine this means pre-orders are happening this day too.
2791000	2794000	I said this last week and probably the week before and I can't stress this enough.
2794000	2798000	If you want to switch, you need to be prepared to do the pre-order on January 12th.
2798000	2805000	This is why I'm really excited it's in the evening now because now I don't have to worry about is it going to be too busy at work or what's that deal going to be.
2805000	2811000	I would also imagine there may be retailers who will announce when they start taking pre-orders.
2811000	2823000	For example, I think GameStop, correct me if I'm wrong, for these big, big releases they will do like, okay, this Friday when the stores open we will start taking pre-orders.
2823000	2825000	Like, they did that for Amiibo and stuff, didn't they?
2825000	2826000	I don't know.
2826000	2827000	I think they did.
2827000	2834000	I know they did that with PlayStation VR, that they're okay, our first batch of pre-orders will go out now.
2834000	2844000	I'm just honestly, if they're actually launching in March, I'm just surprised that window is so short. That is a very short pre-order window.
2844000	2850000	SSJ100Matt in chat says PAX South is going to have the Switch playable at the end of January. Oh, I hadn't heard that.
2850000	2861000	It makes sense though. I mean, if you thought, you know, Miyamoto ending up on Jimmy Fallon was a thing, just wait for how big Nintendo is going to push this thing fast.
2861000	2874000	And exactly because of what Loki said is, I think this is Nintendo's strategy to try and not have this huge hype-up window, but to just have a very short, concentrated, huge build-up leading into a March launch.
2874000	2883000	It's going to be very interesting. This is a very not-typical strategy, and I'm kind of excited to see how it plays out for Nintendo, except for the whole fact that hardware is a challenge.
2883000	2889000	Nintendo, they don't understand, like, there isn't a lack of hype for their stuff. It's just, they don't sell enough of their stuff.
2889000	2901000	I mean, like, there's, like, no one is, like, un-hyped about the NES Classic. Everybody wants to pick it up, but it's not fucking available. That's the problem.
2901000	2904000	You don't need to generate more hype. You've got the hype.
2904000	2915000	My hope is, with it not being the holidays, you're not going to have all this talk of, oh, the must-have holiday toy is the NES Classic Mini, and all this stuff that's causing those things to be in shortages as well.
2915000	2925000	At least we don't have to compete with the freaking holidays in March. So, that is a good sign, but, I don't know, it didn't really stop any of the other systems, so, I don't know.
2925000	2928000	The 3DS has the same problem in it, launched in March, so...
2928000	2940000	Yeah. So, anyway, that is something to look forward to on January 12th. Also, kind of interesting, some of my Nintendo members are getting Switch invites.
2940000	2951000	There's some emails going out that say Eventbrite will send out more details, and they have to register right away. So, yeah, some fans are apparently getting emails, random users, to actually go to the event.
2951000	2953000	It's supposed to be, I think, in the New York area.
2953000	2961000	Yeah, so, that's why we haven't... Our invites were clearly lost in the mail, but maybe some of our New York City area people, if they're my Nintendo members...
2961000	2963000	I would laugh if I got an invite.
2963000	2965000	Maybe I would laugh, too. That would be great.
2965000	2968000	So, alright.
2968000	2971000	SSG100matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2971000	2976000	SkyBreakingNews, the PAX South Switch line is already capped.
2976000	2982000	Sad, but true. Sad, but absolutely true.
2982000	2985000	Alright, moving on. DarkSaga.
2985000	2991000	Well, it's kind of surprising, but not really surprising, because Konami don't fucked up.
2991000	2995000	I mean, we all know what they've all fucked up on. We don't have to go into detail.
2995000	2998000	It's more like, what haven't they fucked up in the past couple years?
2998000	3001000	We don't have to go into detail on the level of having fucked up-ness.
3001000	3007000	So, in light of all that, as we all know, Kojima Productions is now a thing.
3007000	3014000	And the new president of Kojima Productions is a former Konami president.
3015000	3028000	Hirano Shinji, who once was the head of Konami Europe, is now the main top executive head honcho of Kojima Productions.
3030000	3035000	And I think that this is also a really, really fun little middle finger to Konami.
3035000	3039000	Well, this sort of thing happens, though, no matter what the industry is.
3039000	3044000	I mean, we kind of are looking at this because it's a big video game, high profile stuff going on.
3044000	3052000	But sometimes, if a particular company is a sinking ship, so to speak, and somebody finds an opportunity somewhere else,
3052000	3057000	they're going to try to take the best people they know from that sinking ship and take them to that other place.
3057000	3060000	Like, that happens in other places, too.
3060000	3065000	I mean, in y'all's professional lives, you've probably seen something like that. I know I have.
3065000	3069000	So, yeah, I'm not terribly surprised to hear about this.
3069000	3077000	I mean, Kojima, even though he probably strongly dislikes Konami, to put it lightly,
3077000	3081000	I'm sure that applies only to very specific people very high up in management.
3081000	3085000	So there's probably other people that he really enjoyed that he's probably been wooing to come work with him.
3085000	3090000	I like what Stoppy says. At this point, Konami is like that in-law that keeps getting busted for meth.
3091000	3094000	Happy holidays, everybody.
3094000	3105000	Yeah. But the other talk, too, is that they had done some, of course, plenty of work together when both were still with Konami.
3105000	3117000	And so it is official that Hirano is going to be working on, or at least assisting Kojima Pro with Death Stranding.
3119000	3120000	Yay.
3120000	3121000	Cool.
3121000	3127000	All right. Maybe somebody will be hired to help us all understand the plot. That would be wonderful.
3129000	3131000	Of course, they don't want to give it away this early.
3131000	3138000	Well, I will know the plot soon enough when the game's out, so.
3138000	3142000	I don't know if I'd use the word soon in discussing Death Stranding's release.
3142000	3143000	Well, you know what I mean.
3143000	3145000	I know what you mean. I know what you mean. Of course I do.
3145000	3146000	Soon is relative.
3146000	3147000	Yeah.
3147000	3149000	This is Blizzard soon type of scale.
3149000	3151000	This is eventually.
3151000	3153000	All right. Moving on. Loki.
3153000	3160000	So apparently Capcom is going to be tweaking their rules for rage-quitting on Street Fighter V.
3160000	3172000	If you are a person that rage-quits quite a bit in Street Fighter V, you're going to actually get branded with a profile icon and also something in your profile that says,
3172000	3177000	Hey, this guy, you know, rage-quits a lot or something to that effect, you know.
3178000	3179000	You're going to get a Scarlet Letter.
3179000	3181000	Yeah, it's basically like a Scarlet Letter.
3181000	3184000	That's Scarlet R for rage-quitting.
3186000	3187000	Uh, yeah.
3187000	3191000	So that's good because rage-quitters suck.
3192000	3196000	Yeah. I'm curious what you all think about this, especially in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
3197000	3203000	Is this deserved or is there maybe fear that this could get misapplied to somebody with like a bad internet connection or something like that?
3203000	3212000	No. You know what? I think this is fine as long as they do it like the same way as like they do like Grand Theft Auto 5 through Grand Theft Auto Online.
3212000	3220000	Like if you're cheating or exploiting stuff, you'll get put into this like special, you know, place where you only play with cheaters.
3220000	3221000	Quitter Island.
3221000	3226000	Yeah, Quitter Island or whatever. So, but then after some time you get put back into the normal pool of players.
3226000	3237000	So I'm hoping that that's kind of the same thing here that after, you know, in case if there's an issue where maybe you had some internet connection problems and you accidentally got put into that, that's not permanent.
3238000	3242000	Uh, Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says people are still playing Street Fighter 5.
3242000	3249000	I get the feeling it's probably not quite the machine that Star Trek Street Fighter 4 was.
3249000	3261000	But, you know, there was that whole Capcom Cup that happened at the PlayStation experience and, you know, I even caught the tail end of it and I was like, okay, this is, you know, I'm feeling this. This is fun.
3261000	3269000	But then again, I haven't exactly ran out and bought the game either. I think they screwed the launch of that game so hard. It just kind of, it's fallen off my radar. What can I say?
3269000	3274000	Kaijito in chat says don't troll the rage quitters. Take down their rank.
3274000	3279000	Stoppy in chat says I have terrible internet so yes, I would be worried about this.
3279000	3288000	Let's see. YYR says Street Fighter 5 was just on deeply discounted sale for the holidays. So I figure a bunch of people just grabbed it for $20.
3288000	3296000	Yeah, I saw that. It was on whatever that sale was on PlayStation recently or the ongoing holiday sale. I think it was a part of that sale.
3297000	3307000	And yeah, I guess Capcom's thinking they'll make the money with all the, you know, seasoned characters and the additional stuff they're going to throw out there that maybe they only get $20 off you now.
3307000	3312000	But maybe you'll be enticed to buy the season 2 pack which will be another $20 or whatever it is.
3312000	3323000	Yeah, you might be enticed or you can just wait for the goddamn game of the year edition or whatever, you know, collector's edition, alpha arcade, blah blah blah. Just wait. Just wait. It'll come out.
3324000	3333000	Sj100matt in chat says Quitter Island where there is no tribal council because everyone gave up during the immunity challenge. Yes. It's just like everybody just gave up.
3333000	3346000	Alright, moving on to a game that I'm very excited about that is coming out next year, hopefully, if nothing gets delayed. Dragon Quest XI. Some of the first details were revealed about Dragon Quest XI.
3346000	3354000	So part of the reason I'm excited about this is, you know, Dragon Quest X was an MMO which never even came out here so it may as well not exist as far as I'm concerned.
3354000	3362000	Dragon Quest IX was handheld which is cool but, hmm, so I feel like we haven't had like a console game since Dragon Quest VIII.
3362000	3371000	So this is fun. I'm excited for Dragon Quest XI which, as a reminder, is coming out for PlayStation 4 and 3DS. So interesting that it's both.
3371000	3384000	Also in development for the Nintendo Switch. But the Jump Festa event happened in Japan. I believe that is some type of like big, like it's like a Comic Con in Japan for like manga and anime and that type of stuff.
3384000	3396000	So Jump Festa just happened this week in Japan and there was a new Dragon Quest XI trailer that showed up. There's some more characters that you can see in there and there is a new character called Camus which is a blue haired thief.
3396000	3404000	That sounds like that, like, wasn't that actually, I'm gonna get a text, wasn't that one of the characters in Suikoden, Shane?
3404000	3410000	And now this guy has blue hair? I would think Shane's very excited about the release of Dragon Quest XI. We'll see.
3410000	3419000	Anyway, you can check out the trailer. It's out there. It has some of the sweet music in the game that you've grown to expect and all that good stuff. So I'm excited.
3419000	3429000	And Shane says it's Camus is how you say it. Oh, bummer. That's not how it's written like, though. C-A-M-U-S. But all those funky pronunciations.
3429000	3441000	Fifth Dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm excited for Dragon Quest Heroes 2. So, alright. Excited for Dragon Quest XI. More details soon, I hope.
3442000	3454000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Stuff. Well, you all saw that during the whole winter event in Overwatch everyone got these legendary skins, right?
3454000	3459000	Not everyone got them. They're available, yes.
3459000	3470000	Okay. Well, but a lot of people were bitching about Mei. Because a lot of, pretty much almost everyone else had completely different skins. They were different.
3470000	3478000	Hers, though, really looked like a reskinning of her normal outfit. I mean, down to everything. Just kind of Santa trimmed.
3478000	3483000	Just a palette swap like they do for some of the non-legendary colors.
3483000	3494000	A few different textures, but yeah. And apparently people were so pissed over it that Blizzard actually apologized.
3494000	3506000	The game director, Jeff Kaplan, said on the forums, sorry you were disappointed with Mei's winter skin. We just sort of make a gut call based on what we think is cool.
3507000	3522000	We thought it was pretty special and we had done it specifically based on community suggestions from months ago when people were speculating that we might have a winter event. Apologies that our cool meter was off from yours on this one.
3522000	3529000	Doesn't she? Oh, actually Shane just texted. Mei has a snowman. Why didn't he just come to the show tonight?
3529000	3530000	She turns into a snowman.
3530000	3531000	Yeah, she turns into a snowman.
3531000	3532000	With her ice block.
3532000	3533000	Yeah, which is what people think is cute.
3533000	3537000	But her outfit is just a reskin.
3537000	3553000	There's a part of me that's like, this is a gamershateeverything.com situation. But at the same time, the problem is that Overwatch's system of the loot boxes and charging money for them.
3553000	3558000	Yes, you can unlock them in game, but we all know there's people that are dropping a lot of money on loot boxes.
3558000	3573000	So there's also a part of me that says, well, some of the feedback and irritation is kind of justified now that money is involved that people are paying on top of the game fee of $60, $50, whatever it is you bought it on sale at that price.
3573000	3582000	So I don't know. I don't know. I kind of think the snowman thing is sort of like, okay, well, that's really cool and different. And I think people will use the skin for that, if nothing else.
3582000	3589000	But at the same time, if Blizzard's going to charge for this, then eh. If you don't like it, go give them the feedback. Why not?
3589000	3597000	It's more the fact that the other characters were so wildly different and hers pretty much just looked the same. Just a different color.
3597000	3599000	Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.
3599000	3605000	Alright, just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
3605000	3623000	So this is pretty awesome. Right now, until the 31st of December, you can go download Lost Odyssey for free. That's right. On Xbox 360 or Xbox One with backwards compatibility, there is no reason whatsoever that you shouldn't go just mark this for download.
3623000	3627000	I did it today. You don't even need Xbox Live Gold to do it. Go do it right now.
3627000	3629000	Oh, you don't even need gold?
3629000	3630000	You don't even need gold.
3630000	3631000	Wow.
3631000	3632000	Because my gold's expired.
3633000	3645000	Seriously? Open a new browser window, go sign into your Microsoft account and get this game because you'll kick yourself if you don't. It's a fantastic JRPG. Worth your time.
3645000	3650000	Seriously, and it's free. I mean, it's hours worth of entertainment.
3650000	3653000	I can't believe that they're just giving it away for free.
3653000	3658000	Yeah, because they added Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey and they're giving it away for free until the end of the year.
3658000	3664000	I guess they just figure there's no money left to be made off it. Man, I really wish there'd be a Lost Odyssey 2, though.
3664000	3668000	I'm hoping. Maybe with this offering for free we can get an announcement next year.
3668000	3679000	I don't know. I kind of think... I don't know what Mistwalker's doing these days. Didn't they move into the mobile space finally? I don't know, but I just feel like that's probably not going to happen.
3679000	3695000	Honestly, though, a mobile version of Lost Odyssey wouldn't be all that bad. It's a turn-based RPG, so it's not like you need a lot of precision in the controls and everything. I think mobile would be fine, especially just navigating the map and stuff.
3696000	3703000	YYR points out, even if you own the disc, do it. You will then own a digital copy. Yeah, who knows how long the disc will last.
3703000	3713000	YYR continues on to saying they didn't just add them to backwards compatibility. They are now digital copies available. Yeah, that was one of the things. When Lost Odyssey first went backwards compatible, people couldn't buy it on the store.
3713000	3726000	Yeah, and I think I must have sold my discs at one time because I can't find them anymore, so yes, absolutely, we'll have to play this at some point, either on my 360 or on an Xbox One whenever I get one.
3726000	3740000	Alright, go get it. You'll kick yourself if you don't. And I need to install Blue Dragon now, too. I keep forgetting they added that one, and I have the disc for that. That one's not free, but...
3741000	3744000	I think it's like 20 bucks if you want to pick it up.
3745000	3756000	Alright, moving on to stories about Pokemon Go, which a lot of our hosts are still playing. I left it out of my gaming week, but I hit level 23 this week in Pokemon Go, so yes, even I'm still playing this a little bit.
3756000	3767000	Yeah, I'm not playing it that hardcore, but I'm playing it a little bit. What's nice though is now, I think they mixed up where stuff spawns, so usually if I boot up the app, there's at least one or two Pokemon sitting there, so it's kind of nice.
3767000	3782000	Yeah, same thing here. It was a Pikachu nest, but now the things have rotated. I think we're like a Nidoran male nest or something, not very exciting. Even though I've caught two Jigglypuffs, so it could be a Jigglypuff nest, and I'm just... I don't know.
3782000	3791000	But anyway, here's the thing, is that there was a lot of changes to Pokemon Go this week, including the addition of Generation 2 Pokemon, sort of. Sort of.
3791000	3792000	The babies.
3792000	3800000	Just, what, six or seven babymon are available now, and they only hatch in eggs.
3800000	3804000	And they're kind of useless, because if you evolve them, they just go back to...
3804000	3816000	Yeah, they're really just for Dex people, people that really want Gen 2 Pokemon. Like, I'm not gonna lie, I've been trying to hatch a crazy ton of eggs, because I want an Igglybuff. Like, crazy. A Smoochum would be fucking rad, too.
3816000	3828000	But there really isn't like... I don't think you're gonna get a lot of value off putting these in a gym. I don't see people evolving these into the forums that are more easily catchable other places.
3828000	3843000	Except for maybe Togepi. Togepi would be the one difference, which apparently somebody on Reddit, because it's always somebody on Reddit, did collect enough Togepi where they were able to evolve it into Togek, or Togekic, sorry, I can never remember the pronunciation.
3843000	3849000	But they evolved it into the next forum. So that is something you can do, but, you know, very hard to do.
3850000	3858000	So, yeah, a lot of people are saying this is a really cheap fucking way for Niantic to sell incubators on all this hype.
3858000	3859000	Uh-huh.
3859000	3878000	Yeah, I think it would be nice if maybe Niantic would think about giving away some incubators or incentivizing that, or, like, if you visit 10 PokeStops in a day during the holiday event, you'll get an incubator, so you can try to get the Gen 2 Pokemon. Like, I just think...
3878000	3892000	Or, here's an idea, because you just, you know, you, you know, sealed out those, you know, wonderful retail deals and brand deals and stuff like that. How about if you visit, like, a Starbucks or something like that, you get an incubator, you know.
3892000	3894000	Yeah, it ties into something like that.
3894000	3896000	You know, first two times, or one time.
3896000	3912000	Yeah. So, also, if you haven't been keeping track, the Starbucks thing went live, the Sprint thing went live. So, there's a lot more PokeStops out there now if you have Starbucks in your neighborhood, which doesn't everybody... In the U.S. Sorry, this is limited to the U.S. Doesn't everybody in the U.S. have a Starbucks nearby?
3912000	3913000	Four or five.
3914000	3927000	I guess, I guess, you know, I take that back there, and before chat, chatters jump down my throat. There are some parts of the country that I guess don't, don't have them. Like, I remember when I was taking all those trips for work out to Pennsylvania. I spent a lot of time out in Allentown.
3927000	3938000	There was, like, no Starbucks anywhere there except for, like, one at a Barnes and Noble, I think. I don't know if that's changed. I haven't been there for, like, eight years, so I don't know if that's changed since then.
3938000	3947000	But I guess there are still some parts of the country that don't have a lot of Starbucks, but maybe they have Sprint stores. I don't know. So, anyway.
3947000	3958000	Wow, Fifth Dream in chat says, no idea where the nearest one is. I don't have one here. Wow. I guess I just take it for granted being in California that they're, like, everywhere.
3958000	3968000	Maya in chat points out Dunkin Donuts has the Northeast on lockdown. See, maybe, but when I was in New York City, I still felt like I saw Starbucks everywhere. So, I don't know. Anyway.
3968000	3981000	There you go. That's some of the changes to Pokemon Go. There's also a holiday event, if you haven't already heard. You can now catch Pikachu wearing a Santa hat. The Santa hat will stay with Pikachu after the event is over.
3982000	3986000	If you evolve a Pikachu with a Santa hat, it will become a Raichu with a Santa hat.
3986000	3989000	I've seen wild Raichus as well with Santa hats.
3989000	3990000	Oh, really? No, I haven't seen those yet.
3990000	3991000	Catch, yeah.
3991000	4001000	Oh, cool. So, yeah. Both of those will stay in your inventory permanently, so if you want to celebrate Christmas all the time with your Pokemon, you can do that. So, check that out.
4002000	4014000	All right. Let's move on. We're going to get to our classic game of the week. Before we do our classic game of the week, though, Dark Sakura, I suppose we should tell the listeners what we were talking about before the show.
4014000	4020000	So, we're going to do some twists to the show in 2017, right? What a twist.
4020000	4022000	We'll be twisting things.
4022000	4025000	After 15 years, we need to shake some things up, right?
4025000	4034000	That's going to be 52 games, practically. Maybe less if we skip a week. And I'm running out of good ones.
4037000	4040000	Now, now. There is a major franchise that's unrepresented.
4040000	4041000	No.
4041000	4046000	Be quiet. All of you. So, what? No, we're not getting rid of the segment.
4046000	4056000	No, we're not getting rid of it, but we're going to change things up. So, next year, on the last, or, you know, I'll probably just do it the second Sunday of the month.
4056000	4058000	At some point during the month, once a month.
4058000	4064000	Because there's not always, the last Sunday's going to change depending, so I'll just always do the second Sunday.
4064000	4065000	Okay.
4065000	4071000	I am going to be doing a classic game system of the month.
4071000	4083000	And I'm going for semi-obscurity, because there are other systems out there that, at least in America, that we haven't heard of.
4083000	4091000	You know, I've mentioned some, you know, like, I mean, I'm sure people know that there were a series of Atari computers,
4091000	4096000	but didn't know that there were games specific to them, or what their capabilities were.
4096000	4101000	You know, I've mentioned the ZX Spectrum, I've mentioned the Amstrad CPC, I've mentioned.
4101000	4106000	The Xbox. I'm just kidding. The Xbox will not be in the list.
4106000	4112000	But, I mean, like, you know, there was, Sega had the Pico back in the day for kids.
4112000	4116000	You know, there's all kinds of, you know, CDI, you know, you name it.
4116000	4121000	You know, and then regional specific ones. Especially in the handheld market, oh my god.
4121000	4136000	But I figured that we would introduce y'all to a few of the kind of obscure, maybe some not so obscure that you might not be familiar with.
4136000	4141000	But some of them are like, oh yeah, I've heard of this, but, like, my rich friend owned one.
4141000	4143000	Or, like.
4143000	4144000	Or my friend overseas owned one.
4144000	4146000	I've seen this in a YouTube video once.
4146000	4147000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4147000	4161000	You know. So, I've, you know, I've just decided that it would be something that would, you know, throw a little bit of difference in there and introduce y'all to what some of the features of the systems were.
4161000	4167000	And if you think, oh, that's neat. I think I'll try to find one. Good luck.
4167000	4168000	So.
4168000	4170000	Thank you very much, good luck.
4170000	4173000	Classic console of the month, coming to you in 2017.
4173000	4174000	Yep.
4174000	4179000	Except I'm just realizing, do you realize the second Sunday in January? We have no show. So.
4179000	4181000	Well, I'll do it whenever I feel like it.
4181000	4187000	Thank you. Dark Soccer, don't set a date. Just, it'll be a surprise show once a month. The classic console of the month.
4187000	4190000	Like, let's see. Oh, it's that time of the month again.
4190000	4192000	Alright.
4192000	4197000	I like that. That should be, that should be the intro. And guess what? It's that time of the month. Alright.
4197000	4201000	That means I'd have to, like, watch the month cycle and everything, and that just gets annoying.
4201000	4205000	Alright. For now, though, it's that time of the week. We still have lots of games to cover.
4205000	4210000	Despite what Dark Soccer says, if she can't think of 52 games, I'll help.
4210000	4213000	Because there's still lots of Commodore 64 shit she haven't touched. So.
4213000	4214000	Hey, now.
4214000	4215000	I'll help. And.
4215000	4216000	I've touched some of it.
4216000	4218000	And there's lots of Xbox games you haven't touched.
4218000	4219000	And then I needed a shot after I touched it.
4219000	4222000	Alright. Here it is, the classic game of the week.
4222000	4234000	The classic game of the week is Viewpoint, which is an isometric shooter that came out, of course, in arcades.
4234000	4244000	It was developed by ICOM, but it was released by Sammy and SNK together for the Neo Geo MVS.
4245000	4255000	It came out in 1992, and it is fairly unique that it is Sammy's only game for the Neo Geo MVS.
4255000	4265000	It had one player and two player modes that you play one after each other, although there was simultaneous play and service mode.
4265000	4275000	And you also had, basically it is a shooter, kind of zaxxon-like. On a diagonal plane, though, the way that it did.
4275000	4283000	And the ship had its primary weapons, but it also had bombs, ones that make like a wave of fire.
4283000	4290000	And then another one that's like a circular nova blast, and another one that does mini missiles.
4290000	4292000	And the game itself has six stages.
4292000	4304000	The game itself, I mean, it had a home release that came out on the Genesis or Master System.
4304000	4311000	But the Master System version wasn't even really all that great. It had a lot of slowdown.
4311000	4320000	The company that did the release for it, now For the Life of Me, I can't remember what the company that did the conversion was.
4320000	4329000	But they are notorious for having done bad conversions, and so it didn't have any other kind of release.
4329000	4338000	Now, stop distracting me, stop being in chat. At any rate-
4338000	4340000	Stop reading chat, Darzagra.
4341000	4359000	Anyway, there's really not a lot to say about it. Basically, with its isometric viewpoint, it makes it interesting because you have on-screen obstacles to dodge as well as the shooting factors.
4359000	4363000	There's places where spiked walls will come out and you have to dodge them.
4363000	4369000	And you get different shields as the game progresses and other options with it as you go through.
4369000	4376000	It is a pretty, though, standard shooter. However, it's got really excellent music.
4376000	4381000	And the graphics are really sharp, especially for the Neo Geo version.
4381000	4388000	But there were other versions that actually looked better. And it's not necessarily a super easy game on top of that.
4388000	4396000	As far as those other versions that came out, and this is sort of actually what inspired me to do the Classic Console of the Week.
4396000	4397000	Is it-
4397000	4398000	Month.
4398000	4402000	Month, whatever. It's the Classic Console of whenever the fuck that I want to do it.
4402000	4403000	Whenever I feel like it.
4403000	4410000	Right? So, anyway, there was, like I said, the Genesis slash Mega Drive version.
4410000	4418000	There was a Sharp X68000 version. They planned a Saturn version, but it was cancelled.
4418000	4430000	The PlayStation version. It pretty much is just like the Neo Geo version, but it was redeveloped by visual concepts.
4430000	4433000	And so all of the visuals were redone.
4433000	4436000	You know, the layouts and everything are the same. It is the same game.
4436000	4445000	But they did that re-skinning where everything was re-textured.
4446000	4451000	But it's pre-rendered graphics. It wasn't live 3D.
4451000	4456000	So it was one of those weird, you know, PlayStation era remake works.
4456000	4457000	Like Sonic 3D kind of looked?
4457000	4459000	Yeah, kind of.
4459000	4465000	Sonic 3D, as cool of a game as it was, it kind of looked junky. Like, in retrospect, it looks kind of junky.
4465000	4477000	Well, Sonic 3D Blast was, in my opinion, I think a precursor to what was being developed as Sonic Adventure, if I recall correctly, for its development cycle.
4477000	4485000	But anyway, the best version of this was on a system that I had only heard of in passing.
4485000	4493000	And it's called the FM Towns, and it was a Hijitsu computer system.
4493000	4498000	In fact, the Towns itself had a console version called the Marty.
4498000	4504000	And trust me, you guys, you'll be hearing about this, because I was digging deep into this when it was in school.
4504000	4505000	Spoiler alert.
4505000	4510000	Well, I'm not going to go any further than that, because I'm going to be talking about it soon.
4510000	4521000	Anyway, it's the truest arcade version, and that system actually had graphic upscaling, so it was a higher resolution game, and the music was better quality.
4521000	4529000	So it actually was one of the few console ports of that era that improved on the arcade version, so that's pretty notable.
4529000	4538000	Now, the Genesis version, it was pretty similar to the Neo Geo arcade one, but had fewer enemies, a lower color palette, and had a lot of slowdown.
4538000	4549000	And the X68000 version was fairly like the Genesis one, although as I recall, I think it had even worse slowdown. It was pretty bad.
4549000	4557000	But, I mean, it all stayed faithful to the graphic style. The only one that's really different graphically is the PlayStation one.
4557000	4571000	So, the game itself got really, really good reviews. In fact, it was awarded Best Graphics and Best Music in a Video Game for EGM's 1992 Video Game Awards.
4572000	4583000	For Famicom 2 Shin, it got a 30 out of 40. The Neo Geo arcade version had really good reviews from computer and video games. It had a 95%.
4585000	4593000	It just really was well received, and of course there were plenty of comparisons to Zaxxon.
4593000	4599000	Yeah, that's the vibe I totally get from this. It's like a Zaxxon type of game. I like it. I like that a lot.
4599000	4601000	I've never heard of this before, by the way.
4601000	4609000	The big thing about it is just that the music itself was really interesting. It was one of the big things that stood out. Can we play a little bit?
4609000	4614000	Yeah, let me turn it up a little bit. Looks like our YouTuber has made it to the second stage of the game.
4614000	4626000	The first level had a little bit more of a hip-hop vibe to it, but this one's a bit dancier.
4626000	4634000	But it was one of the big things that stuck out. That and it's just very striking visuals and animated backgrounds.
4635000	4645000	But the thing that really does stick out for me is just sort of how this did fall into obscurity.
4645000	4652000	We remember Zaxxon, but I'll be perfectly honest, this game to me seems a little bit more fun than Zaxxon.
4652000	4658000	It's definitely one that actually is not in our Genesis collection that I would like to add.
4658000	4665000	Although, to be perfectly honest, I would rather find an MVS cart conversion for it and play it on my Neo Geo.
4665000	4677000	There was a sequel played for it for Nintendo 64 called Viewpoint 2064, but Sammy was having problems, so it got cancelled.
4677000	4685000	However, a prototype for it surfaced on October 2015 on an online auction. And that's the last that we've heard of Viewpoint.
4686000	4687000	Sad.
4687000	4688000	Sad.
4688000	4689000	Alright.
4689000	4690000	Neat game.
4690000	4692000	Well, if that's all you've got, then there it is.
4692000	4693000	That's all I've got.
4693000	4701000	Our classic game of the week, Viewpoint, spotlighted on the Neo Geo. Although, as StarSucker said, it was on a lot of different systems.
4701000	4702000	So, check it out.
4702000	4703000	Yep.
4703000	4707000	Alright, we're going to take a break, but when we come back, we've got plenty more show to come.
4707000	4714000	Rapid Fire News, Mailbag, what's in stores this week, some stuff on Twitch, some stuff on Mega Man, some stuff on Shenmue 3.
4714000	4722000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your calls as well at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, right after this break.
4728000	4737000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 670 in progress for this December the 18th of 2016.
4737000	4745000	Part B is beginning right now with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com or those of you that are listening on our magic podcast feed.
4745000	4751000	And I hope you're subscribed to us on iTunes or Google Play podcast or wherever it is that you found our little show.
4751000	4754000	Please consider leaving us a nice review while you're there.
4754000	4757000	That word of mouth goes an awful long way.
4757000	4760000	Before we get into Rapid Fire News, I thought I'd ask this question.
4760000	4765000	Before the theme park thing came up, I thought this would be kind of an appropriate time to talk about this for a kickoff topic.
4765000	4769000	But, you know, I was thinking about this since I beat Final Fantasy XV this past week.
4769000	4774000	That was kind of like, you know, like the big game that I had to finish this year that I wanted to finish.
4774000	4778000	But now that I have a couple weeks left and, you know, there's going to be a few days off of work because of the holidays.
4778000	4784000	Are there any video games that you feel like you need, like in your backlog, like you really need to finish them this year?
4784000	4787000	Like there's games you really got to get around to this year.
4787000	4790000	And I open this up to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
4790000	4792000	What do you need to play right now before the year's over?
4793000	4798000	There's a lot of games that I've just bought that I have to play that I feel that I'm obligated to play because I purchased them.
4798000	4801000	Like Watch Dogs 2, I started that and I never really did anything.
4801000	4803000	I mean, I kind of stopped playing it for a while.
4803000	4809000	But I have this bad habit, like I keep buying games because they're great deals on PlayStation Network.
4809000	4814000	And then I'm like, but I really should work on my game and making that stuff.
4814000	4816000	Like I've been purchasing a ton of VR stuff.
4816000	4820000	Like I've got a ton of VR games now that I haven't touched at all.
4820000	4823000	Because I just haven't gotten around to doing that.
4823000	4827000	And I even looked at my stuff and I'm like, dude, I can't really leave this VR stuff just sitting here.
4827000	4829000	Because that's what I did at the Rift.
4829000	4833000	You know, I bought a bunch of stuff and I did stuff and then I kind of like let it sit in the box.
4833000	4836000	So I need to go back in and play some of that some more.
4836000	4838000	And I do want to.
4838000	4841000	I've been kind of just picking up stuff as it's cheap.
4841000	4844000	But is there any games I really need to finish this year?
4844000	4846000	Probably not.
4846000	4849000	I would like to finish Final Fantasy 15.
4849000	4852000	But then I'd have to actually start playing Final Fantasy 15.
4852000	4855000	Hell, even Just Cause 3, which I picked up last year.
4855000	4858000	I played a little bit and it was buggy shit.
4858000	4860000	And I really wanted to go finish it.
4860000	4863000	But I don't know. Some of those games are just very tedious.
4863000	4865000	Well, Watch Dogs 2 had kind of an interesting story.
4865000	4867000	So I may have to go back to that.
4867000	4870000	This seems like a lot of people are really enjoying Watch Dogs 2 more than the first one too.
4870000	4872000	Yeah, absolutely. I think so.
4872000	4874000	And it had like a pretty interesting story.
4874000	4877000	It was kind of fun to grind to get all your abilities and stuff.
4877000	4879000	It's just kind of grindy.
4879000	4881000	But even the multiplayer stuff is pretty fun.
4881000	4883000	So it would be kind of fun to go back to that.
4883000	4888000	But then again, it's like if I want to have a dumb, just fun experience.
4888000	4890000	Like Fallout 4, I need to go back to play.
4890000	4893000	Because I have all the DLC for it and I haven't touched any of it.
4893000	4895000	That's on my list too.
4895000	4897000	And I haven't touched any of the mods yet.
4897000	4899000	I haven't been able to touch it on PlayStation 4 yet.
4899000	4903000	That's something that I want to go back to Grand Theft Auto 5 online at some point.
4903000	4907000	There's just so many features that they've added since I played last.
4907000	4909000	It's just ridiculous.
4909000	4911000	We should have some story DLC.
4911000	4913000	I guess it's never going to happen.
4913000	4915000	And in Skyrim.
4915000	4920000	I'm still playing Skyrim even though I've played the same section of Skyrim like 80 times probably.
4920000	4922000	And it's still fun.
4922000	4927000	That's why when they were saying that game's coming out on the Switch, I was like, well it's so old.
4927000	4932000	That's a game you can play over and over because it's so extensive that you forget half the stuff that happens.
4932000	4934000	And it's like new again.
4934000	4936000	You know what Alan's been playing a lot lately is Morrowind.
4936000	4938000	Yes, I see him playing Morrowind all the time.
4938000	4940000	He's playing it all the time.
4940000	4942000	That's a game I've never played.
4942000	4944000	I bet I have it in my Steam library if I check.
4944000	4946000	Oh, I'm sure everybody does.
4946000	4948000	I think the one Elder Scrolls game I haven't seen him play.
4948000	4952000	Well, I don't think a lot of people play Arena or the really old ones anymore.
4952000	4954000	But I don't think I've seen him play Oblivion.
4954000	4956000	That's the only one I haven't seen him play.
4956000	4958000	He'll probably play that eventually.
4959000	4961000	I would love a remaster of Oblivion.
4961000	4963000	Or even Morrowind. Let's do Morrowind too.
4963000	4965000	Because I've never really touched Morrowind.
4967000	4969000	So games you want to finish before the year is over.
4969000	4971000	I'll get to Dark Soccer in a minute and I'll tell my own.
4971000	4974000	But I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4974000	4977000	Fifth Dream says Telltale Batman.
4977000	4980000	And that's one that I definitely want to get to as well.
4980000	4982000	Fifth Dream says Pokemon Moon.
4982000	4984000	That's on my list for sure.
4984000	4986000	I have the team to do it.
4986000	4988000	Let's sit down and grind that out.
4988000	4991000	Let's see. Stoppy says Killzone Shadow Fall.
4991000	4993000	I have too many first person shooter games in the backlog.
4993000	4996000	Maya says I'm on a race to finish.
4996000	4998000	In parentheses, start.
4998000	5001000	The Mass Effect series before Andromeda releases.
5001000	5003000	Get on that.
5003000	5007000	Let's see. Alan Alchemy says they're rebuilding Morrowind and Oblivion in Skyrim.
5007000	5009000	Akin to Black Mesa and Half-Life.
5009000	5011000	Oh, that's pretty cool.
5011000	5013000	They being officially Bethesda?
5014000	5016000	Okay, that makes sense.
5016000	5018000	That makes a lot of sense.
5018000	5020000	For me, one game that everybody's talking about
5020000	5022000	that I think I can finish pretty quickly
5022000	5024000	because I hear it's only three or four hours long.
5024000	5026000	I want to play Inside.
5026000	5028000	Because a lot of people are telling me, seriously, do you need to play that?
5028000	5030000	I may have that.
5030000	5032000	I don't remember if I have that or not.
5032000	5034000	Was it one of those free games?
5034000	5037000	There's a lot of games that I have on my PlayStation account
5037000	5039000	that I have no idea what they are.
5039000	5041000	If they did do it, I neglected to get it.
5041000	5043000	Which, you know, my bad on that.
5043000	5045000	But that's something I definitely want to get to as well.
5045000	5048000	So that's pretty high on my list.
5048000	5052000	Otherwise, like Fallout 4, I think, as well,
5052000	5054000	and Pokemon Sun and Moon, I really want to finish.
5054000	5057000	Because a lot of people that have played through it say the story gets pretty good
5057000	5059000	in the third and fourth islands.
5059000	5061000	So I'm wanting to get there.
5061000	5064000	And now, Shane just gave me all the Pokemon I wanted.
5064000	5066000	So I don't even have to worry about the collection part of it.
5066000	5068000	It's just vroom, just get through the game.
5068000	5073000	Or if you know Earth Defense Force 4.1, it would be nice to go through as well.
5073000	5075000	Dark Soccer, anything on your list?
5075000	5077000	Like, games you have to do before the year's over?
5077000	5079000	I'm going to finish Dankenronpa 2, maybe.
5079000	5082000	Nothing really on my half-two list.
5082000	5087000	I've just been, you know, I'm kind of digging the not being married to a game.
5087000	5090000	Or my games in general.
5090000	5095000	I've just been enjoying playing what I want to, when I want to, the way I want to.
5095000	5097000	I do what I want.
5097000	5099000	That's right.
5099000	5103000	But I mean, the only one that I would feel like a major obligation to when to get done
5103000	5108000	is Dankenronpa 2, even though I already know how the whole game goes.
5108000	5111000	Because V3 will be out before too long.
5111000	5114000	Right. And even though sometimes you might know the ending to a game,
5114000	5116000	you still need to play it.
5116000	5120000	I think a lot of people know how Final Fantasy IV and VI probably end up.
5120000	5122000	But if you've never played them, you need to play them.
5122000	5124000	They're such good games.
5124000	5126000	But not the mobile phone versions.
5127000	5132000	I think maybe the whole thing is that I know how, what happens to one of the characters I like a whole lot.
5132000	5139000	And I don't want to get to that point, but at the same time, I'll get there.
5139000	5143000	And I think SSJ100Matt in our chat really sums up a lot of this nicely in our chat room, saying,
5143000	5148000	My backlog will be worse in the next week because of the sale on Steam.
5148000	5150000	Uh-huh. Yep.
5150000	5154000	Thankfully though, we're getting to a point, I mean, not much of a point,
5154000	5159000	but we're getting to a point where a lot of the games that are on sale, I probably already own.
5159000	5164000	And so that list every year just keeps getting more and more in your library, in your library.
5164000	5167000	I'm like, oh, well, I don't remember purchasing that, but there it is.
5167000	5171000	This might, I don't mean to keep pushing our rapid news back,
5171000	5173000	but this is just something that occurs to me as we're talking about Steam.
5173000	5177000	And I think this is something I want to discuss and get the listeners' input on this as well.
5177000	5181000	Does it feel like the bubble might be starting to burst with Steam?
5181000	5191000	Like, I feel like this year especially, there's been a lot more negative stuff on Steam than there has been in any other year.
5191000	5195000	And a lot of it's the fact that their store is filled with shovelware at this point.
5195000	5201000	Like, wasn't there some article this week or last week about how like 40% of the games on Steam were released in this past year?
5201000	5202000	Yeah.
5202000	5206000	And I think a lot of people are starting to get, like, Valve was the company that could do no wrong.
5206000	5212000	Like, good guy Gabe Newell, right? Like, there's all this, the Steam sale and the Hallelujah Choir and all that stuff.
5212000	5215000	But I feel like there's starting to be a lot more pushback towards Steam.
5215000	5222000	And some of that, I honestly feel like some of that is resentment because Valve hasn't made a fucking game in a long time.
5222000	5232000	Note, yes, I completely understand the HTC Vive and they've done all that stuff, but there hasn't been a Portal, there hasn't been a Half-Life, there hasn't been Left 4 Dead.
5232000	5233000	What game has Valve done recently?
5233000	5234000	Dota.
5235000	5239000	Okay, so Dota. But again, Dota, that's a few years old now.
5239000	5245000	People will, yeah, A, it's a few years old and people are going to strongly disagree with me, but that's kind of a niche game.
5245000	5246000	It's a very popular niche game.
5246000	5253000	Are we still waiting for the new source engine? Because I thought that that's being worked on and once that gets out, then I'm sure there's going to be a game or two with that.
5253000	5254000	I just, I don't know.
5254000	5263000	The only attention that Steam's had for me lately, I'm looking at the sale now, I just haven't looked at it, is that Hive Swap, the Homestuck game, is now in Greenlight.
5263000	5269000	So I would appreciate it if friends would also just say yes on it so that it gets more trust.
5269000	5271000	I'm sure that it's going to get through, I mean, come on.
5271000	5273000	But I would still appreciate it.
5273000	5276000	And there's a lot of garbage that gets through.
5276000	5280000	But here's the thing, it's like, not all that stuff is being voted on Greenlight.
5280000	5285000	Somehow some of that stuff is getting just published and, I don't know.
5286000	5294000	I think though, with the sales, I'm not that hyped on their sales anymore because there's so many deals throughout the year, it's like, you know, big deal.
5294000	5302000	And I think that now that everything's on sale once, you kind of hit the store and you're like, okay, I've seen everything, now I don't have to come back.
5302000	5304000	They're not as events as they used to be.
5304000	5312000	Yeah, because before it was an event and there'd be different things each day and that keeps having you go back to the store, which I think is a good thing.
5312000	5319000	But now it's like, you see what's on there, you see the list and you're like, well, not anything I really want.
5319000	5322000	I'm going to go check the other sites that have them be doing the sales at the same time.
5322000	5324000	Or like, you know, the PlayStation Network.
5324000	5331000	And I'm sure the same with Live because I haven't really been purchasing on Live because I don't count on there anymore that I use.
5331000	5334000	But, you know, they do Flash sales all the time.
5334000	5337000	There's always a sale going on, like PlayStation Network stuff.
5337000	5340000	And that's why I'm touching more than I am my Steam library.
5342000	5348000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase TOY.
5348000	5358000	Stoppy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, if by bubble you mean it's not as special as it used to be, then yes, you no longer get good discounts and the quality control is non-existent now.
5358000	5362000	Kaijuto following up saying Early Access is hurting Steam too.
5362000	5366000	Lots of unfinished games in Early Access, like the dev just gives up on the game and leaves.
5366000	5368000	They rage quit.
5368000	5373000	And then, let's see, s2100matt saying, where's Ragenator for this conversation?
5373000	5375000	Yeah, lol, I'm doing it when he's not here.
5375000	5384000	No, but I mean, the whole fact that, you know, maybe Steam isn't as special as it used to be either because of things like good old games, itch.io, you know, these other storefronts.
5384000	5385000	Origin, shit.
5385000	5387000	You know, Origin's come a long way.
5387000	5389000	I remember when Origin was the thing we all pointed and laughed at.
5389000	5391000	But, you know, it's come a long way.
5391000	5393000	It has its perks.
5393000	5396000	I still think there's not enough variety on Origin for me.
5396000	5398000	It's very much the EA and Friends store.
5398000	5400000	But, you know, it's come a long way.
5400000	5405000	So, maybe, maybe that's why I kind of feel like Valve needs to, like, make a game.
5405000	5406000	I don't know.
5406000	5407000	I don't know what it is.
5407000	5410000	Anyway, Fifth Dream says Valve can't 3.
5410000	5414000	YYR says Valve can't release a game with 3 in its title.
5414000	5415000	The world might end.
5415000	5419000	And Act Def says, if Leo won an Oscar, Valve can release a game with a 3 on it.
5419000	5422000	And YYR concludes with this.
5422000	5425000	Don't worry, super multitasking is coming out next year.
5425000	5426000	Things are going to turn around.
5426000	5427000	Woo!
5427000	5428000	That's true.
5428000	5432000	At least we have something to look forward to on Steam and possibly other stores.
5432000	5436000	I really wish, though, like, I don't know how hard it is to publish, like, on the PlayStation platforms anymore.
5436000	5443000	But I really wish there was something like, you know, XNA or even, like, the PlayStation Mobile stuff that they had before.
5443000	5446000	Because that was, like, really cool to see all that on there.
5446000	5448000	And I know that there's a lot of garbage on Steam.
5448000	5454000	But I think if they just had some way to better review everything, like, a lot of that would be kind of pointed out.
5454000	5460000	And a lot of the stuff that comes out nowadays you assume is working, and it's just, like, it's straight up broken.
5460000	5467000	Like, if there's some sort of moderation to get that shit off the storefront, if it's literally not working, then that should be taken down.
5467000	5472000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, I haven't gotten a booster pack in over a year.
5472000	5474000	I know it's RNG, but that seems ridiculous to me.
5474000	5477000	I maybe get one every two or three months.
5477000	5479000	Yeah, I rarely see them pop up either.
5479000	5482000	Remember, though, if you're not logging into Steam once a week, you're not eligible.
5482000	5490000	But with all the, you know, Elder Scrolls games that Alan's been playing, I'm sure he's refreshing his eligibility.
5490000	5492000	So that's interesting.
5492000	5498000	Let's see, YYR says, supposedly anyone can publish on PlayStation Network, but you have to have a dev kit.
5498000	5502000	Same thing on Nintendo platforms. Xbox One requires approval.
5502000	5506000	Anyway, thank you for the side discussion. Unscripted. Unlisted.
5506000	5509000	Let's get into some rapid-fire news. Loki.
5509000	5519000	Alright. So, remember when the last Assassin's Creed game, or, I'm sorry, the kind of update to Assassin's Creed?
5519000	5523000	They did, like, the remaster during the Ezio collection.
5523000	5529000	And one of the, there's a video out there with some of the strange NPCs, because they kind of randomly generate.
5529000	5534000	And there's, it just like, you know, like, they had a whole problem with rendering faces, you know.
5534000	5540000	So one of the things they did this week is they actually patched out the weird NPC face.
5540000	5544000	So that's patch 1.02.
5544000	5549000	Good, I guess. It's a start.
5549000	5560000	The other thing that's kind of interesting, the new Call of Duty remaster, Modern Warfare remaster, they're going to be getting more maps into the game.
5560000	5564000	So that's kind of cool, because when it released, the multiplayer maps weren't all there.
5564000	5571000	So now they're adding some new stuff, including the variety map packs, so you're going to get all the DLC there.
5571000	5578000	Also some new game modes, hardpoint, capture point, and gun game.
5578000	5581000	This is going to be pretty awesome.
5582000	5591000	And then they're adding the holiday-themed crash, and some more, yeah, six throwback multiplayer maps, they said.
5591000	5593000	So now it should have all of them.
5593000	5601000	The other thing, though, that they're adding, which probably isn't exactly welcome, is customization items.
5601000	5606000	So that means, you know, weapons, reticles, uniforms, camos, and all that stuff.
5606000	5613000	But they're also adding, basically, DLC loot crates with that stuff.
5613000	5616000	So a game that didn't have that before, now they're adding it to it.
5616000	5621000	In fact, one of the things that they're adding to the game as well is also female skins, player skins.
5621000	5624000	But you can only unlock them in a loot crate.
5624000	5627000	Ooh. That's not a good idea.
5627000	5630000	Well, they weren't in the original game, but yeah, I think that's stupid.
5631000	5633000	Alright, well, moving on.
5633000	5638000	The NES Classic Edition has apparently become the must-have Christmas thing this year.
5638000	5642000	Not just for gamers, but for a lot of casual people who grew up in that era.
5642000	5645000	So it's making these NES Classic Editions impossible to find.
5645000	5649000	Doesn't help that Nintendo can't do hardware inventories.
5649000	5653000	But anyhow, apparently there's going to be one more chance to get an NES Classic Edition.
5653000	5658000	It will be in stock at various Best Buys on December 20th.
5658000	5661000	At over 1,000 stores across the United States.
5661000	5664000	But we don't know how many per store or anything like that.
5664000	5668000	But they are saying that the NES Classic Edition will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.
5668000	5673000	And the Best Buy stores will have a ticketing process for customers waiting in line.
5673000	5676000	This is coming from, by the way, Best Buy's corporate site.
5676000	5678000	So this is coming from them.
5678000	5680000	This is not a rumor or anything like that.
5680000	5686000	Best Buy is saying, yes, we will have them on December 20th, limited to one per customer.
5686000	5688000	So good luck if you're going to go do that.
5688000	5692000	You know, Alan asked me, he's like, do you want me to go wait for an NES Classic thing?
5692000	5695000	And I thought it was really sweet that he offered to do that, but I'm just, I have to be honest.
5695000	5700000	I was kind of like, I just don't, I mean, if we get one, cool.
5700000	5703000	I'll play it. I'll stream with it. It'll be fun, neat.
5703000	5705000	They're cool little devices, I guess.
5705000	5709000	But I'm not feeling the hype that a lot of people are.
5709000	5710000	I'm just not.
5710000	5715000	And actually, this whole limited inventory thing kind of makes me resent it a little bit.
5715000	5716000	You know what I mean?
5716000	5718000	Like, I just, it makes me want one less.
5718000	5723000	Because I'm like, I don't want to buy into all this fucking craziness type of thing.
5723000	5730000	But anyway, Yooka-Laylee has a release date.
5730000	5733000	You know, Yooka-Laylee that was crowdfunded, right?
5733000	5739000	Banjo Kazooie is basically spiritual successor from X Rare Devs, now with a company called Playtonic.
5739000	5746000	Apparently a release date has been announced. It's April 11th for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5746000	5749000	But guess what? Not happening on the Wii U.
5749000	5750000	That's right.
5750000	5751000	I'm not surprised.
5751000	5753000	Unforeseen technical issues preventing the release on the Wii U.
5753000	5758000	So if you back the game for the Wii U version, you can change your pledge to any of the other versions for free.
5758000	5761000	Also, you can wait for the Switch port.
5761000	5764000	So they are looking into doing a Switch port instead.
5764000	5769000	You could switch your Wii U over to a Switch version in 2017.
5769000	5773000	Wii U backers for the game will be messaged on how to change the pledges.
5773000	5777000	You can also get a straight up refund if you're that mad about the cancellation on Wii U.
5777000	5785000	But it seems logical that, you know, getting cancelled in favor of the Switch, not too surprising.
5785000	5791000	By the way, rumors going around that same thing is about to happen to Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night.
5791000	5799000	So that game on track, excuse me, sneezes are horrible when you're doing radio. Sorry about that.
5799000	5806000	The game is still supposed to be coming out in 2018, but will the Wii U still be connected to your TV in 2018?
5806000	5808000	No, that will not be coming out on the Wii U, I guarantee it.
5808000	5813000	So yeah, rumor is that that is going to be the next one that's going to jump ship over to the Switch.
5813000	5818000	But again, if you're a Nintendo loyalist, I'm sure you're going to be getting a Switch anyway.
5818000	5827000	So it's probably not too hard to get upset, because hey, at least that means you'll get the desktop, the console, and the portable version on the Switch.
5827000	5829000	So there is that.
5829000	5831000	A couple more from Dark Sakura.
5831000	5841000	Well, for our people who are still playing Minecraft, there's going to be a Fallout themed area with costumes and everything coming.
5841000	5850000	That will come soon on PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U for $5.99.
5850000	5857000	Oh, they're actually charging for this. It's kind of weird, because a lot of those paid DLCs that they had on other platforms, like on the Wii U, they were like free.
5857000	5860000	Yeah, but like the Mass Effect one wasn't free.
5860000	5861000	Yeah, it was.
5861000	5862000	What?
5862000	5864000	On the Wii U. Yeah, that's weird.
5864000	5865000	Oh, on the Wii U.
5865000	5869000	Yeah, because on the Wii U one, my son was playing that, and I was like, wait, I didn't buy any of those.
5869000	5871000	Your son did it when you weren't like that.
5871000	5874000	No, he didn't buy any of those either, but it was just offered.
5874000	5881000	But it'll also have a different sandbox area with different objectives to complete, like a mini-campaign.
5881000	5898000	And also, there is a Kickstarter that is, it looks like they've got 26 days to go, called In the Line of Fire, which is a 3D first person shooter for the Dreamcast, yes, for the Dreamcast.
5898000	5908000	And it looks like their goal is to raise $45,000. They are at $6,191 as of this moment.
5908000	5912000	And it's being developed by Militia Studios.
5912000	5920000	So, if you want a new Dreamcast game, well, if you do 20 bucks, you get your name in the credits.
5920000	5922000	If you pay 50, you get the game.
5923000	5928000	So, yay. It looks like a Dreamcast game.
5928000	5934000	But that's not necessary. I get a kick out of these whole, like, we're going to develop for an old system type of thing.
5934000	5936000	It seems like the Dreamcast still has a lot of love, you know?
5936000	5941000	It does, but at the same time, you know, sometimes you just gotta let it go.
5941000	5944000	Let it go, let it go.
5944000	5947000	I should go, I should go.
5947000	5952000	Things I can't wait to leave behind in 2016. I actually should have been left behind in 2015.
5952000	5956000	Anyhow, how about what's in stores this week, Loki?
5956000	5958000	As if probably not a lot, right?
5958000	5960000	Not a whole ton. There is actually some stuff.
5960000	5963000	So, this will be pretty much the last releases you get for this year.
5963000	5968000	So, starting off, HTC Vive is getting their version of Eagle Flight.
5968000	5973000	Halo Wars Definitive Edition coming to PC and Xbox One.
5973000	5979000	Shantae Half-G Hero on PC, PlayStation 4, Vita, Wii U, and Xbox One.
5979000	5985000	The Walking Dead Season 3 Episode 1 and 2, The Ties That Bind.
5985000	5992000	That's going to be coming out on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and mobile.
5992000	5996000	Wild Guns Reloaded on PlayStation 4.
5996000	6001000	Don Bradman Cricket 17 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6001000	6006000	And finally, Roller Coaster Dreams on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR.
6006000	6010000	Over in Japan, things don't seem to be slowing down this week.
6010000	6012000	There's still quite a few releases on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6012000	6016000	Steep gets its Japanese release. That's the extreme skiing game.
6016000	6018000	Skiing, snowboarding.
6018000	6021000	Yeah, extreme winter weather type sports.
6021000	6023000	Extreme jumping off a mountain.
6023000	6026000	Steep Mountains, get it? So, Steep is coming out in Japan.
6026000	6027000	It's not about making tea.
6027000	6029000	No, it is not about making tea.
6029000	6031000	Steep is coming out in Japan this week.
6031000	6036000	Also a game called Fushigi no Gensokuyo T.O.D Reloaded.
6036000	6038000	It comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.
6038000	6040000	A Sherlock Holmes game on the PlayStation 4.
6040000	6044000	The Devil's Daughter comes out this week in Japan as well.
6044000	6052000	And I think an accessory here, this is a real arcade pro 5, like an arcade fighting stick,
6052000	6054000	which looks like it's pretty heavy duty quality.
6054000	6056000	That is out on the PlayStation 4 this week as well.
6056000	6058000	The Vita isn't slowing down.
6058000	6062000	That same Fushigi no Gensokuyo game is out there as well.
6062000	6067000	Also, Hatsuru Kotonaki Miriyori comes out this week.
6067000	6072000	Kenkakimi Momoyo Tsuzuri comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.
6072000	6081000	And Haru Kannaru Toki no Naka Day 6 Gensou Rondo comes out this week on the Vita as well.
6081000	6083000	Because the Vita in Japan ain't dead.
6083000	6086000	In fact, there's still lots of releases every week.
6086000	6091000	And in Japan this week, I'm excited for this, the Sega 3D Collection.
6091000	6096000	There's a 3D Collection Part 3 coming out this week in Japan.
6096000	6098000	That looks like, I'm trying to see what it has.
6098000	6101000	It looks like it has Outrun, or at least one of the Outrun games.
6101000	6103000	I can't tell which one, I thought Outrun was in a previous one.
6103000	6105000	One of the After Burner games, Sonic the Hedgehog.
6105000	6110000	So there's quite a few of these more, oh actually there they are, it's on the box.
6110000	6120000	After Burner 2, Alien Syndrome, Sonic 2, Super Hang-On, Gunstar Heroes, Bare Knuckle 2, Thunder Force 3, Columns, and Turbo Outrun.
6120000	6123000	All getting the 3D treatment in this latest collection.
6123000	6126000	And if you need to catch up, there's a triple pack coming out in Japan.
6126000	6127000	So check that out.
6127000	6135000	Also on the 3DS this week, Osomatsu-san Matsumatsuri comes out in a regular and limited edition.
6135000	6143000	And last but not least, Momotaru Densetsu 2017 Tachigare Nippon.
6143000	6146000	It's a train game from Nintendo on the 3DS.
6146000	6150000	But we don't ever get those train games over here for whatever reason.
6150000	6152000	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
6152000	6157000	From the UK we have only a handful of things.
6157000	6162000	We have Halo Wars Definitive Edition for Xbox One and PC.
6162000	6164000	And perfect for Playstation 4.
6164000	6165000	That's it.
6165000	6167000	Alright, how about the mailbag?
6167000	6170000	Oh shit, I didn't open the mailbag, hold on.
6170000	6172000	Way to go Dark Sakura.
6172000	6181000	Alright, well every week Dark Sakura prepares well in advance to open up our mailbag.
6181000	6183000	Which you can participate with by sending an email.
6183000	6186000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com
6186000	6192000	And Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag, dive in head first and read some emails that she deems worthy of her presence.
6192000	6194000	One of them is in Farsi, I'm deleting it.
6194000	6196000	It's probably spam if it's in India.
6196000	6197000	It is.
6197000	6201000	Okay, that's- Farsi is not India.
6201000	6202000	What?
6202000	6203000	Farsi is in India.
6203000	6204000	I said it's spam.
6204000	6206000	But you said if it's from India.
6206000	6208000	Oh, I don't- whatever.
6208000	6209000	Did I say that?
6209000	6211000	I said if it's spam.
6211000	6212000	Okay.
6212000	6215000	Dear OrangeloungeRadio, thanks for the anime recommendations.
6215000	6221000	I have seen a good amount of anime like Trigun, Sonic X, does that count?
6221000	6230000	The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Detective Conan Bleach, Rurouni Kenshin and Naruto.
6230000	6234000	I like anime that don't have too much fan service or too much violence.
6234000	6236000	Anyway, I would like to ask this.
6236000	6240000	Do you have any characters you want to see in the new Marvel vs. Capcom game?
6240000	6244000	Also, which two companies do you think should do a crossover fighting game?
6244000	6247000	Thanks for the anime recommendations and I hope Dark Sakura gets well.
6247000	6248000	Oh, thank you.
6248000	6250000	Sincerely, Jose.
6251000	6256000	I want Sakura in all the games and Morse Tritor hear you.
6256000	6258000	I mean, that always makes me happy.
6258000	6261000	Oh, so characters you want in Marvel vs. Capcom.
6261000	6262000	I want Devalot.
6262000	6265000	I'm still hung up on the new cross game.
6265000	6268000	Which I just want another Capcom vs. N2K.
6268000	6269000	Is that too much to ask?
6269000	6271000	I mean, that's what I really want.
6271000	6273000	I mean, yes, I know we've already had it, but I want another one.
6273000	6279000	How about a straight up- and I guess this would really be just Smash Brothers,
6279000	6281000	but how about a straight up Nintendo vs. Sega?
6281000	6283000	Come on, make all our dreams come true.
6283000	6286000	Fighting, well, we kind of had that with Smash.
6286000	6289000	Or put some of the TurboGrafx characters in there too,
6289000	6293000	like Keith Courage and Bonk and a pinball table.
6293000	6295000	How about Hudson vs. Sammy?
6295000	6296000	Well, here's the thing.
6296000	6297000	Who owns all that shit now?
6297000	6298000	Konami.
6298000	6303000	So the fighting game could be everybody kills Konami.
6303000	6304000	Whatevs.
6304000	6305000	How about that?
6305000	6307000	Come on, everybody kills Konami.
6307000	6308000	Alright.
6308000	6309000	Including Konami.
6309000	6311000	Everybody vs. Konami.
6313000	6315000	Come on, tell me you wouldn't play that.
6315000	6316000	I would play it.
6316000	6317000	Everybody vs. Konami.
6317000	6324000	But, I think though, there's plenty of Marvel characters that I would love to see.
6324000	6328000	I just want Jessica Jones to show up in the fighting game.
6328000	6330000	She probably will, to be honest.
6330000	6332000	I could see them doing that.
6332000	6334000	Well, especially since the Netflix series was so successful,
6334000	6339000	I think that people need to actually go in and read the comics.
6339000	6341000	Because I want a comic version of her.
6341000	6344000	You know, with husband Luke Cage and everything.
6344000	6345000	I think they still might.
6345000	6347000	Especially since they're going to have the hole because of the X-Men.
6347000	6349000	And then Defenders coming up.
6349000	6353000	It would make a lot of sense to have Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, X-Men.
6353000	6354000	Punisher.
6354000	6356000	Let's get Punisher in there.
6356000	6360000	How about we just have a Defenders beat him up.
6361000	6365000	And like, sarcasm can be one of her side powers.
6366000	6368000	Ant-Man would be pretty awesome.
6368000	6369000	What?
6369000	6370000	Ant-Man.
6370000	6372000	What about from the Capcom side?
6373000	6375000	I feel like a lot of that's already been represented.
6375000	6377000	Because my brain kind of goes, Frank West.
6377000	6378000	Oh wait, he was in the last one.
6378000	6380000	Well, clearly my first pick is going to be Bad Box Mega Man.
6380000	6383000	Because that was totally what I was looking forward to in the last game.
6383000	6385000	That was like, hey, you know what?
6385000	6388000	When I said I want Mega Man, that's exactly what I meant.
6389000	6392000	Exactly. Thank you, Capcom. You're awesome.
6392000	6394000	I want Devilot.
6394000	6396000	How about the dude from Bionic Commando?
6396000	6398000	He was already in there.
6398000	6399000	Was he in there?
6399000	6400000	He was in the last one.
6400000	6401000	I am playing FMVC3.
6401000	6402000	But you know who Devilot is?
6402000	6403000	Yeah.
6403000	6406000	I want her in there with Super 8.
6408000	6411000	And, uh, fuck, there was, uh...
6414000	6417000	Tabasa from Red Earth.
6418000	6422000	Fifth Dream in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com suggests Dead or Alive vs Soul Calibur.
6422000	6423000	It's been a while since we've had a...
6423000	6425000	That would be fun.
6425000	6427000	It's been a while since we've had a Soul Calibur game, hasn't it?
6428000	6429000	That would be fun.
6429000	6434000	Well, we've had Soul Calibur characters show up in...
6434000	6437000	Well, I mean, there's just Yoshimitsu showed up in Tekken.
6437000	6441000	No, Yoshimitsu showed up in the Soul Calibur series.
6441000	6442000	He was from Tekken.
6442000	6445000	But we've had that level of crossover.
6445000	6447000	But I would want to see...
6447000	6452000	I mean, I would just like to see Mugen released public with DLC packs.
6452000	6454000	Oh, my God.
6454000	6456000	I mean, it would be, though, fun, don't you think?
6456000	6460000	And have it be, you know, have it be balanced?
6460000	6461000	Yeah, you know what?
6461000	6464000	Soul Calibur 5 in 2012 was the last Soul Calibur game.
6464000	6465000	That's what I thought.
6465000	6467000	I was like, I don't think they ever did a Soul Calibur 6.
6467000	6474000	And that was the one with Ezio from Assassin's Creed was the little character that was a bonus in that game.
6474000	6475000	But here's the thing.
6475000	6480000	They did do the Soul Calibur Lost Swords, that PlayStation Network free-to-play game.
6480000	6482000	There was that in 2014.
6482000	6483000	That was fucking terrible.
6483000	6484000	Yeah.
6484000	6485000	That was a fucking terrible game.
6485000	6488000	I want to see a new Soul Calibur game with Travis Touchdown as the guest character.
6488000	6490000	Because that would be awesome.
6490000	6492000	So, yeah, I'm all for a new Soul Calibur game.
6492000	6493000	How about that?
6493000	6495000	Soul Calibur versus Soul Calibur.
6495000	6499000	My brain just had like a weird image that popped up into it.
6499000	6500000	What was that?
6500000	6502000	And it has nothing to do with fighting games, but it does have to do with Konami.
6503000	6505000	The 2DX DJ dating sim.
6507000	6511000	Didn't they have a dating sim like Brooktown or something like that was called on PSP?
6511000	6513000	They tried to put it out here.
6513000	6514000	It just didn't really...
6514000	6516000	I remember when we were hyping that and I was like, I don't give a shit.
6516000	6520000	I was just thinking like maybe have like some of the DJs from 2DX's fighting characters.
6520000	6523000	And I was like, no, that'd be more a dating sim.
6523000	6524000	But they can be in Everybody Kills Konami.
6524000	6525000	Yeah.
6525000	6527000	They could show up as an assist or something.
6527000	6528000	Yeah.
6528000	6530000	Or they're just playing the sweet beats in the background.
6530000	6531000	Could be.
6531000	6532000	Could be.
6532000	6534000	But they would have to get killed because everybody kills Konami.
6534000	6535000	So.
6535000	6536000	Alright.
6536000	6537000	Anyway.
6537000	6540000	Maybe just be everyone rolls over the Konami headquarters in a tank.
6540000	6541000	Alright.
6541000	6542000	That's it for our emails.
6542000	6544000	But you can email us as well.
6544000	6545000	Sorry.
6545000	6546000	5th Dream in chat.
6546000	6547000	Winner with this comment.
6547000	6550000	Beat Mani.
6550000	6551000	Beat Mania.
6551000	6552000	It is.
6552000	6553000	Alright.
6553000	6554000	A whole new version.
6554000	6555000	Anyway.
6555000	6556000	That's it for the emails this week.
6556000	6559000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6559000	6560000	Remember.
6560000	6562000	Next week is the holiday spectacular.
6562000	6565000	So I would like to get some season's greetings from y'all.
6565000	6568000	Especially if you have never emailed the show before.
6568000	6569000	It's time.
6569000	6570000	This is time.
6570000	6572000	Just send an email that says I exist.
6572000	6573000	Or something.
6573000	6576000	Just so we hear from some people that I know are out there listening.
6576000	6578000	I want a letter in Esperanto so I can read it.
6578000	6579000	Allowed.
6579000	6580000	In Esperanto.
6580000	6582000	Oh you want people to email you in Esperanto.
6582000	6584000	Don't make it too complicated or nobody's going to email.
6584000	6588000	Because Esperanto sounds interesting but I don't really know how to pronounce much of anything.
6588000	6589000	You can email.
6589000	6591000	That doesn't stop me from doing Japanese release dates.
6591000	6593000	You can email us in whatever language you like.
6593000	6598000	But it has to be romanized because I can't necessarily read it.
6598000	6599000	Alright.
6599000	6600000	Let's get back into some news.
6600000	6601000	Loki.
6601000	6602000	Alright.
6602000	6607000	So they're doing some enhancements to Twitch live streaming.
6607000	6612000	One of the things that they're doing is automating moderation in chat rooms.
6612000	6613000	So it's this automod thing.
6614000	6620000	It's supposed to allow for I guess nicer chat rooms if you will.
6620000	6623000	Or more positive chat rooms is the way they're going about it.
6623000	6633000	So it's a new tool for Twitch streamers that employs machine learning and natural language processing to identify and block inappropriate content from appearing in chat.
6633000	6637000	Which really needs to be in all of...
6637000	6639000	What if I like inappropriate content?
6639000	6641000	And I'm sure you can turn it off.
6641000	6643000	Because it is an option that you can set on your page.
6643000	6644000	You don't have to.
6644000	6645000	You can opt into it.
6645000	6650000	So if you don't want to opt into it then by all means you don't have to opt into it.
6650000	6651000	I would like the opposite.
6651000	6654000	It just filters out all positive comment.
6654000	6656000	I want it just to be nasty.
6656000	6658000	Nasty stuff.
6661000	6663000	Yeah it seems like Twitch has been doing a lot of changes.
6663000	6665000	There isn't just that.
6665000	6668000	I suppose we should mention they launched the whole IRL category this week.
6668000	6670000	Did you hear about that?
6670000	6672000	There's a new category they call IRL.
6672000	6677000	Which made me think, oh this Justin TV thing has gone full circle, hasn't it?
6677000	6682000	But apparently they don't want it to be like cameras while you're sleeping and just like live casting.
6682000	6685000	But they want it to be like if you want to interact with your audience.
6685000	6688000	Like you're just like, hi I want to do a question and answer with my audience.
6688000	6692000	Basically playroom streams is what it sounds like to me.
6692000	6694000	Which I thought that they had banned.
6694000	6701000	But I'm assuming then they want to do playroom streams without the nudity and the truth or dare and all that stuff that was happening.
6701000	6703000	Without all the interesting stuff.
6703000	6704000	Exactly.
6704000	6707000	Just you know, people answering questions and stuff like that.
6707000	6709000	I don't know.
6709000	6711000	Have you guys checked that out?
6711000	6713000	Tigerclaw is even talking about that in our chat room.
6713000	6715000	I was going to ask if you guys have checked that out.
6715000	6717000	Tigerclaw says non-gamers can broadcast on it.
6717000	6719000	Basically what they used to do when they were Justin TV.
6719000	6722000	What's funny though is that they actually have an FAQ and one of the FAQs is.
6722000	6727000	So is Twitch just going back to being Justin TV and they said no because you know.
6727000	6731000	Or they didn't really say like no but they said that's not the intent.
6731000	6734000	Like it was a different intent and that this is really about interactive.
6734000	6736000	Interactive is the key thing.
6736000	6738000	And I remember in the early days of Justin TV.
6738000	6743000	Because we used to stream this show on Justin TV before there was a Twitch.
6743000	6748000	And I remember at the time we were with All Games Radio and Scott from All Games got really into this.
6749000	6752000	I think he did a live cast at E3 and all this stuff I remember.
6752000	6756000	But it was very much like watch me walk around.
6756000	6759000	And Scott was always very good about doing the interaction.
6759000	6762000	He totally got that.
6762000	6766000	The way we really like it here and the way Bobby's done it with his show for years.
6766000	6771000	So I think if you wanted him to go to a certain booth at E3 or something you'd do it.
6771000	6773000	And that was kind of like the interaction.
6773000	6776000	But there was a lot of people on Justin TV that would just point the camera at themselves.
6776000	6779000	They're sleeping and like very mundane stuff.
6779000	6784000	But I guess like Big Brother and that type of stuff is popular so there's people that watch it.
6784000	6786000	Who knows.
6786000	6792000	And at Tigerclaw also pointing out Twitch will let people broadcast live from their phones too.
6792000	6795000	And that's going to be a big part of the IRL thing.
6795000	6798000	So I think it's kind of like taking on Periscope is what it sounds like to me.
6798000	6801000	It really sounds like it's trying to take on Periscope in that regard.
6801000	6803000	But we'll see.
6803000	6805000	Anyhow moving on.
6805000	6808000	Let's talk about Mega Man.
6808000	6811000	Oh my god a new Mega Man came? I am so excited.
6811000	6815000	Well no temper those expectations significantly.
6815000	6825000	Apparently a recent article in Famitsu Magazine states that all six NES original games are being re-released on January 6th.
6825000	6826000	Woo that's awesome.
6826000	6828000	For iOS and Android.
6828000	6830000	That's not awesome.
6830000	6834000	It's not a bundle. They're going to be sold one at a time.
6834000	6837000	Cheat codes though, auto fire, auto charge and all that stuff are in.
6837000	6843000	And there will be some type of Rockman Unity app where you can get rewards like wallpaper and like silly things.
6843000	6847000	And so yeah that is all coming out in Japan on mobile phones.
6847000	6853000	And I really can't see how this is going to be any fun at all because there's no controllers on phones.
6853000	6858000	But I feel like didn't they already have Mega Man games here in the states?
6858000	6861000	Like I thought they released some already and they weren't very good.
6862000	6870000	I don't know but yeah I could totally see a game that requires such precision to be released on mobile and have totally nothing wrong with it.
6870000	6877000	Now what is this all leading up to? Apparently a new Mega Man mobile game to tie into the new TV show being released next year.
6877000	6880000	Wow those are two things I really don't care about.
6880000	6883000	That's right I keep forgetting that that new TV show is coming out.
6883000	6885000	And god it looks terrible just from the screenshots.
6885000	6893000	And god a game based on that on mobile. Man they totally understand the Mega Man franchise and all the key components that make a great Mega Man game.
6893000	6894000	Not the way to do it.
6894000	6895000	Not the way to do it.
6895000	6901000	Crappy design, crappy interface, crappy gameplay. I'm on board.
6901000	6902000	And by the way.
6902000	6906000	You know what? I think it's going to be greater than Pokemon Go. You watch.
6906000	6912000	Sure. By the way there was a Mega Man 2 mobile in 2009 and it was pretty bad.
6912000	6915000	And they patched it a bunch and it's still pretty bad.
6915000	6920000	So there you go. Take it or leave it. Apparently I've left it all these years.
6920000	6924000	Dark Sakura maybe you have a game we can get more excited about?
6924000	6933000	Maybe. It's been a while. Shenmue 3 is actually in its end of development cycle.
6933000	6937000	Pre-orders actually already went into effect on the 15th.
6937000	6949000	But Sezuk-san said that they're at the final stages of development and they're going to have new videos and such after New Year.
6949000	6957000	And it should be, well, pretty spectacular. So goes the theory.
6957000	6965000	I mean, I would think with today's graphics, it's going to definitely take a lot more realism into the story.
6965000	6971000	So maybe we'll get more gachapon machines and, you know, space area.
6971000	6979000	YYR in a chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says Shenmue 3 hype with like 17 Y's in it.
6979000	6980000	Yeah.
6980000	6985000	Yeah. I guess I'm kind of surprised that this game is already, they're talking about it's being close to done.
6985000	6991000	That's a pleasant surprise because a lot of these things that Sony announces at E3, we get to wait years and years and years to play.
6991000	6997000	Such as, you know, Final Fantasy 15, Last Guardian, although granted we finally got those games this year.
6997000	7002000	But I don't think anyone's holding their breath too much about, you know, Final Fantasy 7 Remake or Kingdom Hearts 3.
7002000	7008000	Although again, rumors say that the 7 Remake Part 1 is happening next year.
7008000	7012000	And if it's in 15's engine, I guess it's possible. We'll see.
7013000	7015000	There's an iOS game coming out that I'm interested in.
7015000	7016000	What's that?
7016000	7019000	It's the Bible Girl 666 New York Adventure.
7019000	7020000	Oh Lord.
7021000	7023000	I'm sure it'll be as awesome as Dragopolis.
7023000	7026000	All right. Just a few more stories for you guys.
7026000	7030000	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
7030000	7033000	But, oh boy, we have some good stories for our last two stories tonight, don't we, Loki?
7033000	7038000	Well, everyone's got to get in on the last place, you know, action.
7038000	7045000	And so, who best to do that than Brazzers, the purveyors of such fine porn parodies.
7045000	7050000	Like, they had a new Final Fantasy 15 when they had literally nothing to do with Final Fantasy 15.
7050000	7054000	Yeah, it's called something like getting the car repaired.
7054000	7058000	They don't even call it, like, Final Fuck 15 or something that ties into it.
7058000	7060000	It's something about, like, stopping for repairs.
7060000	7064000	It has, like, yeah, like, a Sydney...
7064000	7067000	Of course, Rama knows. Gas station special.
7067000	7071000	Thank you, Rama, who is the first chatterer to chime in with that.
7071000	7073000	Guess what that makes you, Rama?
7074000	7075000	Just kidding.
7075000	7076000	The winner.
7076000	7077000	That's right, the winner.
7077000	7086000	Yeah, so they have, like, that with a Sydney knockoff and she fights some random, like, monster looking thing, which is stupid.
7086000	7089000	But, yeah, so they're purveyors of such wonderful things.
7089000	7092000	But they're also going to be doing a Let's Play channel.
7092000	7095000	So they've got, I guess, their C4 channel.
7095000	7098000	Sorry, Dark Tetsuya says it's full service station.
7098000	7099000	Full service station.
7099000	7102000	That sounds... Oh, I think Rama got it wrong.
7102000	7104000	So, Dark Tetsuya, you know what that makes you?
7105000	7106000	The winner.
7106000	7108000	Who wants some full service?
7108000	7112000	So they have a YouTube channel called Trends with two Zs.
7112000	7117000	And they have adult film stars also doing Let's Plays on games.
7117000	7120000	So one of the first games that they played on there was Mafia III.
7120000	7125000	And, yeah, you can go check it out and watch them play a game.
7125000	7131000	Apparently, one of the porn stars, Nikki Benz, is actually quite...
7131000	7133000	Or, I'm sorry, actually not...
7133000	7136000	Missy Martinez is actually quite a gamer.
7136000	7140000	She even has, was it her gamer name?
7140000	7143000	Bones and Silicone is her gamer tag.
7145000	7146000	So, I don't know.
7146000	7149000	Do you think we could get somebody on the show?
7150000	7151000	No, probably not.
7151000	7153000	Do you think we could get one of the girls on the show?
7153000	7155000	Why not? It's to promote their channel.
7155000	7156000	I doubt it.
7156000	7158000	What do you guys think? Should I send an email?
7158000	7161000	Like, that's like saying, like, you can.
7161000	7164000	But, I mean, I don't think that they need much promotion.
7164000	7166000	People know who they are.
7166000	7168000	So, I'm sorry, I've never seen your work before.
7168000	7169000	Who are you?
7169000	7172000	To be fair, I have no idea who they are.
7172000	7175000	If that's, you know, and we all know why.
7175000	7176000	I have no idea who they are.
7176000	7180000	Maybe I'd like to, you know, talk about being a gamer with her.
7180000	7181000	Why not?
7181000	7184000	It's just like any other occupation.
7184000	7186000	So, they play games.
7186000	7187000	Thank you. Thank you, chatters.
7187000	7188000	Make it happen. Why the hell not?
7188000	7190000	Do it. Take a chance.
7190000	7194000	Fifth Dream says, I don't know who they are and I watch tons of porn.
7194000	7196000	I've heard of Nikki Benz.
7196000	7199000	I just couldn't say, like, you couldn't show me a video, like,
7199000	7201000	random video of a bunch of different actresses and then be like,
7201000	7203000	oh, yeah, that's Nikki Benz.
7203000	7204000	I don't know who she is.
7204000	7206000	You wouldn't be able to identify her in a lineup.
7206000	7207000	I just recognize the name.
7207000	7210000	DarkSakura, would you be down for interviewing a streamer,
7210000	7212000	a let's player here on the show?
7212000	7213000	Sure.
7213000	7214000	Why not?
7214000	7215000	Why not?
7215000	7217000	All right, I'm going to send an email.
7217000	7218000	We'll see what happens.
7218000	7223000	We have one more story to talk about tonight and I thought we could end on a local note.
7223000	7228000	And I thought to end on a local note, we could talk about the Florida of Sacramento.
7228000	7229000	I'm talking about Rocklin.
7229000	7230000	You all know Rocklin.
7230000	7232000	You locals know Rocklin.
7232000	7236000	It's somewhere between here and Tahoe.
7236000	7239000	We're going to talk about Rocklin, which, by the way, in 2013,
7239000	7241000	why do we call Rocklin the Florida of Sacramento?
7241000	7245000	This is the same place where – what was this in 2013?
7245000	7251000	The teenager, her parents wouldn't let her access the Internet after 10 p.m.
7251000	7256000	So, she drugged them with sleeping medicine so that she could get on the Internet.
7256000	7258000	That was all over social media.
7258000	7260000	That came out of Rocklin.
7260000	7263000	Well, guess what happened this week, y'all, in Rocklin?
7263000	7273000	Kevin Lee Coe went on a spending spree after stealing $4.8 million from his employers.
7273000	7277000	So, I guess he was busted this week.
7277000	7280000	And here's the thing that makes this gaming related.
7280000	7287000	$1 million of that $4.8 million he spent on Game of War.
7287000	7290000	That's right, the smartphone game, Game of War.
7290000	7297000	Federal prosecutors are saying that Kevin Lee Coe, the alleged perpetrator in this incident,
7297000	7302000	spent $1 million back on that mobile phone game, Game of War.
7302000	7309000	On Thursday this week, the 45-year-old Rocklin resident pleaded guilty to money laundering
7309000	7317000	and wire fraud after being accused of embezzling the funds from his employer, Holt of California.
7317000	7322000	So, you got to think, Game of War made a million dollars off this one individual.
7322000	7323000	And that was –
7323000	7324000	That's quite a whale.
7324000	7325000	That was dirty money.
7325000	7328000	That was dirty money.
7328000	7333000	My pal Alan is walking into the studio who brought this news to my attention this week
7333000	7337000	and actually suggested the name that Rocklin is the Florida of Sacramento, right?
7337000	7338000	Yes.
7338000	7339000	So, what did you want to say on this?
7339000	7343000	I'm just wondering what skin was he going for where he was opening up the random box.
7343000	7346000	He's like, fucking give me the legendary skin for the character.
7346000	7349000	And he just spent – he did that to the tune of a million dollars.
7349000	7352000	I'm surprised.
7352000	7358000	I think I know people that did that with Overwatch this past week who may or may not have embezzled the money.
7358000	7359000	No, I'm kidding.
7359000	7360000	Shush.
7360000	7361000	Yeah, but anyway.
7361000	7363000	Did you spend money on Overwatch?
7363000	7365000	I may have given it $10.
7365000	7366000	Oh, my God.
7367000	7369000	Alan 2?
7369000	7371000	And you think you know people.
7371000	7373000	You think you know people.
7373000	7377000	Did you get the skin you wanted at least?
7377000	7378000	One of them.
7378000	7379000	One of them.
7379000	7380000	Which one?
7380000	7382000	Alan, which one?
7382000	7383000	He's thinking.
7383000	7384000	The Pharah one.
7384000	7385000	The Pharah one.
7385000	7386000	Congratulate.
7386000	7387000	I don't even know what the Pharah skin is.
7387000	7390000	She's one of my favorite people.
7390000	7391000	All right.
7391000	7392000	There you go.
7392000	7395000	So, we'll see what happens in a future week coming out of Rocklin.
7395000	7397000	But isn't it always fun to end on a local story?
7397000	7399000	These things are happening right in our backyard.
7399000	7401000	Anyway, I need to open up the Skype line.
7401000	7405000	I still don't have Skype even up here in studio, but I'm opening it up right now.
7405000	7409000	And once it's up, you can give us a call at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
7409000	7414000	In the meantime, let me check with my co-hosts and see if anyone has a last minute story they want to go over.
7414000	7415000	No.
7415000	7416000	No.
7416000	7417000	No?
7417000	7418000	No.
7418000	7419000	I have donuts that I want to go over.
7419000	7420000	Donuts?
7420000	7421000	You brought donuts?
7421000	7422000	No, but I want one.
7422000	7424000	Oh, well that helps me right now.
7424000	7425000	Or Pinkberry.
7425000	7427000	I haven't had Pinkberry in a while.
7427000	7430000	Somebody needs to fill time because I haven't logged into the Skype account yet.
7430000	7432000	Well, whose fault is that, Rob?
7432000	7437000	Then again, I guess it's fair since I didn't have the mailbag open, so whatevs.
7437000	7439000	Yeah, this is the night where nothing's open.
7439000	7442000	Well, it's because of the holiday season you're not supposed to open things until Christmas.
7442000	7444000	You've been hitting the eggnog already.
7444000	7445000	No, I haven't.
7445000	7446000	That's the problem.
7446000	7448000	Okay, now the Skype line is open.
7448000	7449000	I'm logged in.
7449000	7450000	So, there it is.
7450000	7452000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7452000	7457000	Alright, well if you guys don't have last minute stories, then I actually think I have a couple here I can go over.
7457000	7464000	One of them has to do with Final Fantasy XV and some information about some of the DLC that's coming out for Final Fantasy XV.
7464000	7469000	You can, of course, get the season pass that's available now to get all of this DLC.
7469000	7472000	This is not about the holiday update.
7472000	7475000	They did release some information about that and I was kind of like, eh.
7475000	7477000	But this is something different, actually.
7477000	7482000	Apparently, they're bringing back Gilgamesh, which is a classic Final Fantasy villain.
7482000	7483000	I think it goes back to V.
7483000	7484000	Yay, Gilgamesh.
7484000	7485000	I don't know if it goes back.
7485000	7489000	It has a hilarious cameo in Final Fantasy XIV, one of the better stories in XIV.
7489000	7493000	But anyway, Gilgamesh is going to be in the Final Fantasy XV DLC.
7493000	7498000	He will be in specifically episode Gladiolus, which is, of course, going to be about Gladio.
7498000	7506000	And I'm assuming, again, it's spoilery, but how do I word this without being a spoiler?
7506000	7508000	I'm going to choose my words carefully.
7508000	7513000	There's a segment of the game where this DLC would make sense.
7513000	7514000	I'll say that. That's it.
7514000	7524000	So that's apparently what's going to fill in here where there is a conflict with the popular Final Fantasy antagonist, Gilgamesh.
7524000	7527000	And Gilgamesh will only be seen in this episode.
7527000	7529000	There will be areas that you otherwise can't get to.
7529000	7534000	And this is going to be the first season pass episode, so check that out.
7535000	7543000	Let's see, Gilgamesh not just in Final Fantasy V, but also in VIII, IX, XI, XII, and XIV, and also a lot of the side games.
7543000	7547000	I did not realize Gilgamesh was in Final Fantasy VI Advance.
7547000	7549000	Huh. Go figure.
7549000	7552000	So anyway, we'll see what he looks like in Final Fantasy XV.
7552000	7554000	Let's put out another call for calls.
7554000	7556000	Oh, did Skype lock up?
7556000	7560000	Skype may have locked up on me, and that way explains why no calls are coming in right now.
7560000	7562000	Okay.
7562000	7563000	Thank you, Skype.
7563000	7565000	Awkward.
7565000	7571000	Yeah, Skype is not responding. I'm going to hope that this doesn't kill the show when I do this.
7573000	7576000	Let's not kill the show, because we like being alive.
7576000	7578000	Yeah, I know. I'm a little worried.
7578000	7580000	That's the joy of live radio.
7580000	7586000	Okay, shows were still streaming, and I was more worried about the recording getting stopped midway.
7586000	7588000	Okay, I'm going to try Skype one more time.
7588000	7591000	Okay, YYR says he's trying to call in and it's coming up as busy.
7591000	7596000	Sorry, I launched Skype and it decided to promptly freeze, so I'm going to try this one more time.
7596000	7601000	Well, I'll leave everyone with some wisdom.
7601000	7604000	Do you know what society needs more of?
7604000	7607000	Bathing in the blood of your enemies.
7607000	7608000	It's good protein.
7608000	7609000	What is wrong with you?
7609000	7611000	And it's good exfoliating.
7611000	7614000	What is actually wrong with you?
7614000	7616000	You're just now asking this?
7616000	7620000	Skype is showing up again, so give it another try. We'll see what happens.
7621000	7627000	Okay, it just lit up and then it went away, but I know people are trying to call in at least.
7627000	7630000	Alright, let's get to a call.
7630000	7633000	Hi, you're on Orange Town Radio. Who's this?
7633000	7636000	Hi, it's Aaron, YYR.
7636000	7639000	Hi, Aaron. You got through. We fixed Skype. What's up, buddy?
7639000	7640000	Yes, I did.
7640000	7650000	Well, speaking of bathing in the blood of your enemies and the last story, it's just like I was saying, I mean, it's just like Satan was saying a few weeks ago.
7650000	7654000	It's really easy to go through a million dollars in Game of War. It really is.
7654000	7667000	I have never played Game of War, and I'm very happy to say that, although perhaps I should not judge, because I have probably spent $40 on Pokemon Go.
7667000	7674000	Yeah, but here's the thing. The buy button in Game of War can spend $100 at one time.
7674000	7677000	Oh my god, that's just too much.
7677000	7679000	And Pikachu's not even in it!
7679000	7683000	Yeah, right? You can't get that skin. What's the point, right?
7683000	7685000	Have you played it?
7687000	7696000	Actually, the main reason I called, honestly, I think this Super Mario Run business is one of the most interesting gaming stories of the year.
7696000	7698000	How so?
7698000	7708000	Well, you look at how Nintendo launched this game and how they were really trying to be all, well, we're not gonna stoop to their level.
7708000	7715000	We're not gonna take the predatory stance and look for whales and, you know, suck as much money out of people as possible.
7715000	7722000	We're gonna do it with this one $10 purchase, and you have the whole game, and you're good.
7722000	7729000	But, you know what, it's like, sometimes it doesn't matter what you're saying as much as how you're saying it.
7729000	7736000	Because we've all seen those things where they show you two different ways to ask a survey question and how the results differed.
7736000	7745000	And so, here's the thing. The language of the App Store is, if you see a price, that's what the app costs.
7745000	7751000	If you see free, it costs nothing. If you see get, it's probably free to play, right?
7751000	7758000	Right, because I was gonna say that Apple changed that language, God, probably like four years ago just because of that stuff.
7758000	7763000	So that if it doesn't say free on Super Mario Run, it says get.
7763000	7774000	Exactly. And over the last couple of years especially, we've pretty much been trained to understand that get means it's free to play with optional in-app purchases.
7775000	7781000	So, now here's the thing. They did explain in the description what the deal was, but nobody reads.
7781000	7782000	No.
7782000	7791000	So, everyone goes and downloads this thing, and they play the first three courses, and then they hit the paywall.
7791000	7800000	And they're like, what is this? This is a bait and switch. This is anti-consumer. One star, uninstall, I'm out.
7800000	7812000	And that has led to the two and a half average star rating on iTunes with more people voting one star than any other rating because...
7812000	7817000	That happens to a lot of apps, though, to be fair. Pokemon Go probably had the same thing when they turned off the tracker.
7817000	7818000	I don't think so.
7818000	7827000	It's crazy. I do kind of think Nintendo should have just put a $10 charge on the game. Done. I would have supported if they just didn't have a free demo.
7827000	7829000	And a free demo in addition. A separate app.
7830000	7836000	Yeah. I mean, it used to be done. You would see so-and-so and so-and-so Lite.
7836000	7843000	Maybe a so-and-so Lite 30 days later or something. I think they could have just made a ton of money if they just sold a $10 app day one.
7843000	7854000	Exactly. But the other thing I think is wrong with Super Mario Run as far as execution is the fact that they made a score attack game.
7854000	7866000	And not like a game where you go and complete courses, which is by and large in 2016, I don't think there are as many people playing games for score as they are for completion.
7868000	7875000	Right. Oh, so you're talking about the Toad Run, which is my biggest issue with Super Mario Run is the Toad mode is ridiculous.
7875000	7879000	Well, even just the normal mode because the courses are like, what, one, two minutes long?
7879000	7880000	True.
7880000	7889000	But that's not the point of the game. The point of the game is to get the coins, to improve your score, to get all the secret coins. But so many people don't care about that.
7889000	7890000	Yeah.
7890000	7904000	I really feel like they just completely missed the mark on what mobile gamers, not even mobile gamers, but I mean every Mario game ever released is like, hey, here's some obstacle courses. Can you get through them? Why such a difference now?
7905000	7916000	Kind of following up and piggybacking a little bit on what you said about, you know, the way that the game is being received and all that. Sometimes it's not about, you know, what you say or what you do. It's how it's perceived.
7916000	7930000	That is, that is so much of what happens just, God, anywhere on the internet. I mean, how does fake news spread the way it does is becomes such a buzzword in our society because people perceive it one way and want it to be true or don't want it to be true.
7930000	7936000	So it suddenly becomes fact and perception becomes fact. The reason why we all know the internet is terrible.
7936000	7955000	The reason why I say all that is because, and I know people are not going to agree with me and that's fine, but when you pay the $10 for a game and then it says, and you're going to get these 20 extra tickets for the toad run mode and you're going to get these coins and you're going to get this special question mark block for your village and stuff.
7955000	7959000	That's all the type of shit I would expect to see in a free to play game.
7959000	7961000	Yeah, it does look a little weird.
7961000	7974000	Now I'm left to wonder, am I going to get nickeled and dimed after this $10 thing? And I bet that's what a lot of people are, where a lot of people are really getting mad because they feel like they're going to get nickeled and dimed, even though they're not.
7974000	7987000	They're not, they're not selling those toad tickets or whatever, but just the way they did. And even the way like you have the mine Nintendo coins and you can trade in what, 300 mine Nintendo coins for what? A fucking gold statue.
7987000	7994000	And like these really silly things, right? It's like, it's like the worst parts of the free to play stuff are still there. Does that make sense?
7994000	8011000	I know what's also a problem. Nowhere on that purchase screen does it actually explain that that's the whole game. It says it's six worlds, but I mean, yeah, Candy Crush's map, it shows you like the next 50 levels, but it doesn't show you that there's a thousand more behind it.
8011000	8019000	So you could have people thinking, oh, well, I hit the paywall before the end of world one. Who's to say there won't be another paywall next world?
8019000	8048000	Right, right. So the perception is, is pretty huge with this. And I think, yeah, I think, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head, even where I kind of get an issue with it. And you know, obviously, I understand what the rules are. And I, you know, but I just something feels just off in the whole design of that currency and everything. And it kind of just, it kind of just snowballs into why I don't like the game. But at the end of the day, I also I just find I don't like the constant run mechanic. I just don't like it as a Mario game.
8048000	8065000	I mean, it's it's it's different. I did manage to play a couple of levels. And then I went back and got like the special the second set of coins in the first course. It's cute. It's interesting. I can see where it would be strategic, but it's just the game is just so fundamentally flawed.
8065000	8082640	Yeah, I just, I like it, but I don't understand what what the developer was going for here. I don't think it was actually who is a DNA that did it. I just I'm not quite sure what their target audience was and how they felt that they would sell it to the target.
8082640	8093080	I think there was too much outside influence on this game, I think is what it boils down to. I think too many non gamers had had a say in how this game was going to play out. And I think it shot this game in the foot. I really did.
8093080	8096240	It almost makes me wonder if this was designed at Nintendo in a boardroom.
8096640	8108080	Um, possibly. And it kind of sucks for Miyamoto having to be the face of that. You know what I mean? Because I would bet he probably isn't really to blame for hardly any of this.
8108320	8121320	You know what, though, as long as he's still eating, I mean, I think that's pretty sweet. You know, like the there were those pictures where he was eating while playing right? Yeah. As long as he's eating something delicious, I think it'll all turn out okay for him.
8121320	8151280	He'll be fine. Miyamoto is still a gaming legend, and nothing's ever going to take that away. You know what, there's going to be people out there that say, Rob, yyr, you guys are wrong. I'm loving Super Mario Run. And I play well, I'm not saying it's a bad, you know, unpolished, not a quality game. I think it's definitely quality and polished. I just think it's, you know, one of those things where, you know, we don't know who it's for. And, you know, the target, maybe it wasn't quite marketed the right way to the right people kind of thing.
8151640	8154560	Like this would have gone over better as a 3DS game, I think.
8155400	8158000	I'm not sure I would have still enjoyed it as 3DS game.
8158320	8162360	We also probably would have been able to run, you know, not automatically.
8162360	8175480	Then it's just a Mario game, which isn't a bad thing necessarily. But I think I think I would just rather play Mario Maker at the end of the day. Still a million levels to explore there. Alright, yyr, I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in more calls. But thank you for the call, buddy.
8175880	8177560	Hope you guys have a great week. Take care.
8177560	8179520	Thank you. Have a great holiday if we don't hear from you again.
8179720	8181920	Enjoy. Yes. Happy holidays.
8181960	8182440	Take care.
8182720	8183080	Yep.
8183920	8197600	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you'd like to call into the show and have your say, you could also try the phone line if you want to try that. 1-877-GAME-OLR is another way to get in on the show as well.
8199240	8200600	Wait for those calls to come in.
8202080	8204720	Which Skype, I know Skype's still working.
8204720	8210000	Any other last minute stories? Anyone dig something up?
8210400	8218800	Um, I, no, I don't really, I can't really think of anything. News is just kind of slow and not very interesting right now.
8218800	8226000	Alright, they're doing a thing on the Humble Bundle with YODcast where they're doing 30 games for 30 bucks. It's all going to charity.
8226720	8230000	Alright, we got it. We got a call coming in. It came in. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8230400	8237360	How dare you, like, make fun of people for buying loot boxes on Overwatch. Like, that's so rude.
8238240	8243840	You know, did you hear the part where I followed it up with, but I'm not one to judge because I spent 40 bucks on Pokemon Go?
8244400	8247440	No, because it didn't matter. Your damage was already done.
8247760	8251520	Whatever, Shane. Whatever. Is that all you called in to tell me what a rude ass I am?
8252240	8258000	Well, I do that regularly anyway, so it's not, like, an important topic to cover on your show.
8258560	8262560	But I did want to say... When's the next episode of Pokestop Podcast, Shane?
8262560	8265600	When I feel like it. I'm shiny hunting right now. Don't bother me.
8266160	8270480	Now who's ringing? I got shinies today, so I was happy. I got, like, two so far.
8272000	8279040	No, I was calling in to say that I don't have the internet right now, so I've been
8280000	8286000	playing games that aren't online. Like, I can't play Overwatch, which kills me right now since
8286000	8291520	it's the holiday event. But it's okay because I opened 82 loot boxes this weekend, so it's fine.
8292160	8295920	82? How much money for 82 loot boxes?
8295920	8298080	Well, some of it. I won myself.
8298080	8300000	Okay, so the two. So what was the 80?
8300640	8306560	Me? No, no, no. There was more than that that I got myself. Thank you. Me and Jim had, like,
8306560	8311760	an Overwatch Wi-Fi party at his house, so we just played, like, in the same room on different
8311760	8318560	screens. How come when Jim plays with you, you win loot boxes? Every time I play, we don't win.
8319280	8321040	Because we're better.
8322080	8324000	My feelings are hurt. I'm gonna go cry.
8326000	8334000	No, I was talking to my dad and complaining about how I can't do this Overwatch event. So
8334000	8339200	he is sending me $50 for Christmas that I could spend on Overwatch. So I was like,
8339200	8345280	okay, we'll just do that now. So I bought, I technically bought $60 worth of boxes.
8346000	8349440	I knew it. I knew it. So you did dip into your own funds a little bit.
8349440	8356240	Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Because it was better to do a $20 one versus a $10 one.
8356240	8360240	What's the paper noise in the background? Are you eating Taco Bell while you're on the call?
8360240	8363600	No, I'm laying in bed. I don't know what paper noise you're talking about.
8363680	8367840	Do you guys hear it? It sounds like a paper crinkling noise. Maybe it's just your phone.
8367840	8370880	Maybe it's your horrible lack of internet phone connection or something like that.
8370880	8371520	Probably.
8371520	8371920	I don't know.
8372640	8376320	Anyway, that's not why I called. And I am excited about those loot boxes, though,
8376320	8378800	because I only need two more skins. And I've got all the holiday ones.
8380560	8385120	No, I was calling in because, like I said, I've been playing other games that aren't
8385120	8391760	internet connected. And so I went back through finally and beat Res Infinite and unlocked Area X,
8391760	8400400	which I've had this game since it launched. And I played in VR. And Area X is the most amazing
8400400	8406080	thing ever. It actually bumped to Res Infinite, which I did not want on a top five list for the
8406080	8411520	year for me because it's the 700th time it's been re-released with a couple new features.
8411520	8417360	But I did bump it up to my top five somewhere in there. But I was trying to show it off to
8418320	8423040	Annie and Jim. And I didn't have my VR hooked up. So I was like, I'll just play with the normal
8423040	8429840	controller. Had I not played it in VR, I think I hate this game. I do not think it's nearly as good.
8429840	8433760	But didn't you play non-VR, Loki? Didn't you do that?
8433760	8434320	I did VR.
8434320	8436960	Oh, you did? Oh, I haven't done Area X yet.
8436960	8443360	Area X is amazing in VR. I hate the way it controls outside of VR, though. Because in VR,
8443680	8450000	you use the stick and your head, you know, in tandem to move around and target things.
8450000	8457120	You just have the analog stick when you don't have VR. And it's just not as good in any sense.
8458560	8463040	It feels like it was specifically made for VR. And they tried to find a way to work it
8463680	8466160	outside of VR. I don't think it works.
8466160	8471120	I can kind of cut him some slack for that because it is, I mean, Res is really,
8471120	8473920	this version of Res, anyway, is really designed to be a VR game.
8475360	8478960	Especially the fourth boss in the regular game. Oh, my God.
8478960	8483280	You would think that the rest of it would still translate as well as like the original version
8483280	8485920	or the remastered 360 version or whatever.
8485920	8490960	And it may, but it's been so long since I've played a regular Res game without having the VR
8490960	8497760	that maybe this is the definitive way to play Res now. And it's like, I can't go back because
8497760	8503440	it feels like I don't have all the control I should have. I don't know.
8504000	8509840	But that Area X is amazing. In fact, because I'm just playing Pokemon and listening to your
8509840	8517120	dumb show, I put Res on traveling and it's just playing on my TV, just like in the one area that
8517120	8521760	I really like the music for. Just sitting there doing nothing like a screensaver.
8524000	8527120	Well, how are you going to survive? For how much longer do you have to survive without internet?
8527760	8532080	Two weeks. I don't know, because I just also...
8532080	8536800	Target had an error on the Legend of Korra Blu-ray set. It was 15 instead of 50.
8536800	8540720	And I just already went through that. Like, I've gone through all four seasons already,
8540720	8545840	and I guess I can go through all four again. That's only eight discs, so it's not that much.
8546400	8550560	Well, I would try to give you ideas, but you called this show dumb, so I don't want to help you.
8551760	8555920	Whatever. I do that to everything. And I'm usually right, so it's fine.
8556720	8560800	Uh, ActDeft in chat says, uh, Darcicar, you're not on.
8560800	8563520	Now I am. There you go. And it's awesome because I'm here.
8564640	8569200	Oh, that's true. Welcome back to the show. Thank you. And I'll still buy your game.
8569200	8572640	Um, I forgot that. It's like sitting over there near the...
8572640	8576640	Just let me borrow it first. ActDeft says in chat,
8576640	8579600	Shane, you lucky bastard. I wanted to take advantage of that. Talking about the, uh,
8579600	8584080	Korra, I guess, target error thing. Yeah, they're really good at errors. Oh,
8584320	8588560	here's a good story video game too, because you've got like an hour to kill basically still.
8588560	8595920	Um, so my friend Danny, like he works out of school and his student was like, I guess,
8595920	8600240	on his phone or something during class and they were on Amazon and there was this like,
8600240	8605680	you know how Amazon has, you know, different sellers have storefronts. So it's like you buy
8605680	8611280	from them, but Amazon fulfills or whatever. I don't know how Amazon works really. But anyway,
8611280	8617840	so this one storefront had all these different things up for sale, but they were all a penny.
8618480	8624400	Like probably a price error. Probably shouldn't have been live. His student bought like five
8624400	8630480	Chromebooks for a penny each. And then Danny was like, let me jump on this. And they were selling
8630480	8637120	regular 3DS too. 3DS XL is not the new version, but the old one for a penny. So he ordered five.
8637120	8642880	So he paid a nickel there. Apparently he has a tracking number. They debited his account,
8642880	8649680	you know, a nickel. So that's ridiculous if this really happened. Where it's gone now. Yeah. It's
8649680	8654880	gone now. Yeah. There's a storefront. Better hope those weren't stolen off the back of a truck or
8654880	8658880	something. That's what it sounds like. They were actually, they seem to be like a reputable place.
8658880	8663200	I think made, well, what he thinks, I think, I don't know. Again, I don't know how Amazon works,
8663200	8669040	but he thinks maybe they were putting inventory in the system, but accidentally set it to live
8669040	8673040	and just had those placeholder prices before they were actually going through and doing everything.
8673600	8679840	But there was like Chromebooks. There were like a kitchen appliances, 3DSs. I don't know if there
8679840	8684880	are any other systems, but I hope he gets his five 3DSs because he's going to give me one.
8685840	8691680	What a nice Christmas present. I need a new rice cooker. I'm sad that show or that stores down.
8691680	8696800	What's up with that? I need kitchenware. Well, maybe you should work at a school with
8696800	8700400	terrible students that are on their phones during your class and then you would get it.
8700400	8704800	I'll get right on that. Yep, you should. All right. Anything else you want to share with us
8704800	8709280	tonight, Shane? No, everybody should also go play Let It Die if you have a PS4 because that game is
8709280	8712800	awesome. I didn't like that game. Well, you're wrong. So it doesn't matter.
8712800	8715360	Shane tried to make me play it. I didn't think it was that good.
8715360	8719200	It's pretty freaking fun. You didn't even do anything in the game. That's why.
8719440	8722720	That was ridiculous. I didn't like it. And it sounds like Silent Hill because
8722720	8726320	the Kiriyamaoka does the music. The music was okay. The music was okay.
8728000	8732000	I'll give it that. Okay, bye. Bye.
8732000	8738160	All right. 1877 Game OLR or of course on Skype, we are Orange Lounge Radio. I'm sure we can
8739280	8744080	squeeze in another call if you want to give us a call. Let's see. Looking at chat over
8744080	8750160	at live.fognetwork.com. Kossen says new egg has sales on rice cooker sometimes. I just named a
8750160	8755040	random kitchen appliance. We don't really need one. I legit need a new one. Although, I was
8755040	8760880	gonna say that Alan's had that one like forever. We've been dating for seven years. So I would,
8760880	8766400	maybe it is time to get a new one. I don't know. Let's see. Dark Tetsuya in chat talking about
8766400	8771200	Let It Die says I watched some streams of it. It definitely looks like a Suda 51 joint.
8771920	8779280	So. All right. Well, Skype is going crazy on me and having these weird errors. So unfortunately,
8779280	8783040	I think I'm gonna go ahead and close it down for tonight. I'm sorry for those of you that couldn't
8783040	8787680	get through, but please consider emailing us or tweeting us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8787680	8792800	I will make sure Skype gets upgraded before the next show. Although, this computer is still
8792800	8799040	running on Windows XP. So I don't know how much longer that's gonna work. However, I am looking
8799040	8807040	into the big upgrade for 2017. So while we're gone during MAGFest, very possibly giving the
8807040	8811520	studio some renovations. I just have to see how much it's gonna cost me and all that other stuff.
8811520	8822160	So hopefully, we'll get that all fixed. And new and improved Skype line. And maybe if we can,
8822160	8826640	maybe we can set up some type of video thing. Although, I know not everybody wants to be on
8826640	8830320	cam. But maybe some type of limited video or something we could figure out as well.
8831120	8836720	Yeah. Actf says, Studio N 7.1. Rama says, I sent you a Windows 10 key. You're golden. Yeah,
8836720	8841520	I know. I know. I will be golden. Just probably not on this computer. This computer's, you know,
8841520	8848480	this is the computer that the listeners graciously bought for us after I had my diva meltdown. But
8848480	8853200	you guys might remember, that was like eight years ago. So this computer kind of needs a little bit
8853200	8857440	of a kick in the pants as well. So that's all stuff that I'm looking into doing. A little
8857440	8863680	studio upgrade here. So yeah. Actf, the diva computer. Anyway, that is about gonna do it for
8863680	8867440	another episode of Orange Lawn Radio. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking
8867440	8872160	us out. You know, all we ask, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.
8872160	8876000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.
8877520	8882800	That's all we want for the holidays. If you're feeling so generous, a nice five-star review would
8882800	8887920	go a long way on whatever website you found this show on, be it iTunes or Google Play,
8888480	8892400	wherever. Before we wrap things up tonight, we're gonna go around and get everybody's
8892400	8902000	final thought for the night. My final thought tonight is, I think I'm going to probably re-up
8902000	8906000	wow tonight and I'll play some wow, as I mentioned earlier in the show. I think that would be fun.
8906000	8907600	Nicky Minaj If I'm on tonight, I'll play with you.
8907680	8913360	Yeah. It is Sunday night. Got to work tomorrow. But, you know, that's all right. Short week.
8913360	8915840	Thank you, holidays. Nicky Minaj Short week. Oh, for you.
8915840	8918480	Nicky Minaj Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.
8919120	8922880	Loki, your final thought. Loki Maybe I guess I'll have to join
8922880	8927440	up. Wow. Said me never. Nicky Minaj
8927440	8932000	And last but not least, somebody who's not quite a hater. Sometimes, Dark Sakura.
8932560	8935920	I'm not full of hatred. I am full of disappointment,
8936480	8940880	but I am not full of hatred. Well, yet. Wait until next year.
8940880	8944160	Nicky Minaj All right. Hey, everybody. Have a great holiday
8944160	8948480	because I'm sure many of you will be doing holiday things next week and will not be here live.
8948480	8953840	But if you are going to be around, come join our holiday special in seven days with Dark Sakura
8953840	8959200	and myself. Unfortunately, Uncle Loki's got real world stuff to tend to, but we'll be here.
8959200	8963120	Who knows? You always know during a holiday special, some special guests show up. So who
8963120	8968960	knows who will join us here in studio on Christmas or first day of Hanukkah or whatever it is you're
8968960	8973840	celebrating in seven days. We'll see you then. Have a great week, everybody. Happy gaming. Bye.
