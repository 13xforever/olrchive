This week, 7 Days of Awesome Games Done Quick results in over 1 million dollars raised for

00:17.520 --> 00:21.000
the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Congratulations to the organizers, runners, and thank you

00:21.000 --> 00:24.400
to all the donors. Tonight, ready your shots with this week's VR news and join us for the

00:24.400 --> 00:27.400
show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.400 --> 00:35.360
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.360 --> 00:42.340
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 627

00:42.340 --> 00:49.640
for this January the 10th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts, coming to you live from Sacramento,

00:49.640 --> 00:56.220
California in Studio N7. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and sadly not

00:56.220 --> 01:00.140
joining me tonight in Studio DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. DarkSakura, if you were listening

01:00.140 --> 01:06.180
to last week's show, her and the husband went to Disneyland to bid a final farewell to some

01:06.180 --> 01:10.580
parts of the park where today is actually, today actually is the last day that they're

01:10.580 --> 01:14.940
going to be open because the construction for Star Wars Land starts I guess tomorrow

01:14.940 --> 01:20.260
or whenever Disney's ready for that. So they are doing one last goodbye to the Bucket of

01:20.260 --> 01:23.580
Meat restaurant and the Petting Zoo and some of those places there. I've been looking at

01:23.580 --> 01:26.900
some pictures on her Facebook and I'm sure she'll be back next week to tell us about

01:26.900 --> 01:32.500
Hyperspace Mountain and any games she might have ran into there because I know they have

01:32.500 --> 01:37.980
some of the old Flynn's Arcade from Electronica they have by Space Mountain now so I'm not

01:37.980 --> 01:41.420
sure if any of that's changed. We'll check in with her because I'm sure her and Dan were

01:41.420 --> 01:45.180
keeping an eye out for that. If there was a Tron pinball machine to be played, you can

01:45.180 --> 01:50.060
guarantee they played it. So we'll be saying hi to her next week. In the meantime, we are

01:50.060 --> 01:56.700
joined in studio by Techmaster Loki! Hello! Who is not sadly at Disneyland. It's not sad,

01:56.700 --> 02:00.220
I don't really care for Disneyland too much. Oh that's right, you're not as big, you never

02:00.220 --> 02:06.140
got into the Disney thing like the rest of us did. You don't like fun. No, I just don't

02:06.140 --> 02:10.580
like roller coasters to be honest. That's right, you were never a big fan of us. I have

02:10.580 --> 02:17.980
a fear of heights and I don't like, I don't like the feeling of like, dying and uh. But

02:17.980 --> 02:21.020
then I could see why you wouldn't want to go to like Magic Mountain or somewhere where

02:21.020 --> 02:26.620
more of the thrill rides are. Well yeah, I mean and even like I, like there was a short

02:26.620 --> 02:31.500
period of time that actually was psyched up and I got myself over my whole like kind of

02:31.500 --> 02:35.420
fear of roller coasters. And I don't actually fear them, like I know personally like that

02:35.420 --> 02:41.820
I'm not, I'm completely safe on them and everything, so like I know that, but my body doesn't know

02:41.820 --> 02:46.780
that and it's just like oh my god oh my god oh my god! And like, like even on stupid shit

02:46.780 --> 02:53.380
like on um, like you have it in over California Adventure or whatever the fuck it is, it's

02:53.380 --> 02:59.300
like that stupid ride that they have it like um, even just like a midway ride or whatever

02:59.300 --> 03:03.180
it's like where you get in the swings or whatever and it goes up a little bit like, like it

03:03.180 --> 03:07.180
spins you around. Oh yeah, it used to be a big orange, I think they changed it, the silly

03:07.180 --> 03:12.300
symphony swings I think it is now. Like even that like, I just like, having like a mild

03:12.300 --> 03:16.140
panic attack with. I can actually see that, so the California Adventure has more of the

03:16.140 --> 03:19.940
thrill stuff, you know, they have the roller coaster that actually goes upside down. Tower

03:19.940 --> 03:23.340
of Terror is not for everybody and if you're not a heights person you're not going to enjoy

03:23.340 --> 03:25.940
that. But I get it, Loki, not every fear is necessarily rational. No, but like there's

03:25.940 --> 03:30.780
seriously the one trip though that I got over it and it was like, you know, big, you know,

03:30.780 --> 03:34.020
big mountain or thunder mountain railroad like over and over and over and over and over

03:34.020 --> 03:37.340
again and then like matter over and over and over and over again and like I was completely

03:37.340 --> 03:42.460
fine with it and stuff. Did you get over it with the help of our friend Xanax or what?

03:42.460 --> 03:46.100
No, like I just went on it like a few times and like I was like oh this isn't that bad

03:46.100 --> 03:50.260
and I had a lot of fun with it and then finally, you know, that was like when I was like a

03:50.260 --> 03:53.560
teenager and stuff and then I came back later as an adult and it's like oh look I'm scared

03:53.560 --> 03:57.900
of it again. It's like what the fuck happened there? So I don't... Will you do the virtual

03:57.900 --> 04:01.040
reality coasters? You know we got a lot of VR news this week. Will you do the coasters

04:01.040 --> 04:05.380
of virtual reality? Or is that going to... No, I'll do those just fine and yeah I still

04:05.380 --> 04:08.820
get that vertigo feeling and stuff but it's not like I'm like oh my goodness I'm going

04:08.820 --> 04:13.940
to die. Because I know it's just a headset I have on. Even though we do not have Dark

04:13.940 --> 04:17.380
Soccer here tonight, we are expected a little later in the show. Alan's going to join us

04:17.380 --> 04:21.260
here in studio. He's wrapping up some stuff for his job. He'll be joining us a little

04:21.260 --> 04:25.420
later to do like a classic game of the week and some of the Jamie stuff in her absence.

04:25.420 --> 04:31.200
But in the meantime we are joined every week by you guys live. We do tape live every Sunday

04:31.200 --> 04:36.620
night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

04:36.620 --> 04:41.140
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, our pal Bobby. You want to talk VR? We're going

04:41.140 --> 04:44.620
to get into that tonight. And Bobby's really been following that VR scene for a very long

04:44.620 --> 04:48.820
time so you know he had some words about the news this week. So check out his show this

04:48.820 --> 04:53.380
week if you missed it live. But if you are listening live of course head on over to our

04:53.380 --> 04:58.340
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and we do read comments from chat throughout the

04:58.340 --> 05:02.500
night where we can fit them in. And then of course we'll take calls later on on our Skype

05:02.500 --> 05:08.020
line username Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. And actually some folks in

05:08.020 --> 05:13.540
chat were talking about the thrill rides. Dungeon Buster starting us off tonight saying

05:13.540 --> 05:22.060
I love coasters, those spinny rides not so much. And I can kind of see that because I

05:22.060 --> 05:25.500
love coasters. I really do. And I'll even do the Magic Mountain coasters but you know

05:25.500 --> 05:31.740
what I won't do which is weird because I used to do it as a kid but now that I'm an adult

05:31.740 --> 05:36.980
I can't do it is the Gravitron. You know what that is? The fair? I don't know if this is

05:36.980 --> 05:40.780
a national thing. I'm kind of assuming it is but if you don't know what the Gravitron

05:40.780 --> 05:46.340
is it looks like a big spaceship and it spins around really fast so that in the inside basically

05:46.340 --> 05:52.620
you kind of lose gravity. I don't even thinking about it is making me ill. Like the sensation

05:52.620 --> 05:57.500
in that ride. Like it's just I can't do it. So I think there is a big difference between

05:57.500 --> 06:03.500
the spinning and the coasters. It's weird but I can't explain it. I guess the spin of

06:03.500 --> 06:07.740
a loop on the roller coaster is one time and it's not as fast as the Gravitron. So

06:07.740 --> 06:14.660
let's see. Bobby Blackwolf says so Sky wouldn't do mission space at Epcot. Probably not if

06:14.660 --> 06:18.140
that's what it involves is the spinning around thing which I know a lot of space training

06:18.140 --> 06:23.700
is so that would make sense. Don't they have a special version though? Like they have one

06:23.700 --> 06:28.500
side for people that can do it and one side that can't. I'll do the side that can't. That's

06:28.500 --> 06:33.940
how we have to do and I swear it's a video game show but people, theme parks, who doesn't

06:33.940 --> 06:42.700
love theme parks besides Loki? Finding Nemo, my friend that I usually go to Disneyland

06:42.700 --> 06:47.060
with, Lady Victoria, she was on the show like a million years ago. She's claustrophobic

06:47.060 --> 06:51.940
and will not do those subs because even though the sub is not a thrill ride it really goes

06:51.940 --> 06:55.340
around. They're very claustrophobic. Very claustrophobic and you're underwater so it's

06:55.340 --> 07:00.820
not for everybody. So whenever I go to the park with her I have to do that handicap accessible

07:00.820 --> 07:05.580
version of the ride which is basically you go in a little room and they project what

07:05.580 --> 07:12.660
you would be seeing on the wall with the same narration and everything else. I make it sound

07:12.660 --> 07:18.020
really lame but Disneyland has a certain way of making, they use lights and things to really

07:18.020 --> 07:21.800
give you a similar sensation. They do a decent job of it considering you're not actually

07:21.800 --> 07:25.200
going underwater but I always have to do that version of the ride. If they have that

07:25.200 --> 07:30.280
for Mission at Mars I would do that. I can only hope that the version of Hall of Presidents

07:30.280 --> 07:35.600
that I've been seeing has been like the handicap accessible one and like the real one. Abraham

07:35.600 --> 07:39.700
Lincoln comes out as a giant robot and starts attacking people with laser vision. That would

07:39.700 --> 07:46.120
be awesome. Bobby Blackwell says there is a green team side that doesn't do the 2.5G's.

07:46.120 --> 07:51.200
It's more like Star Tours. Star Tours is fine. Star Tours is cake. I love Star Tours. That's

07:51.240 --> 07:56.560
a lot of fun. I hear they enhanced that with something from the new movie so I'm excited

07:56.560 --> 08:00.240
to see that at some point. One of these days I'll get back to Disneyland. It's super expensive

08:00.240 --> 08:04.400
now. Five years ago when you would hear me talk about it on the show all the time, back

08:04.400 --> 08:09.000
when I had an annual pass and I was going every few weeks, it wasn't nearly as expensive

08:09.000 --> 08:15.280
but because of the success of California Adventures Remodel and Cars Land, those passes are really

08:15.280 --> 08:21.180
expensive. A little bit of greed too but I get it. I think in a way they want to price

08:21.180 --> 08:27.340
people out because they don't want the insane crowds for special events that they usually

08:27.340 --> 08:33.180
have. Or they're just saying, how high can we make this before people stop coming? Maybe.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.960
It's a video game show. We could talk about Adventures in the Magic Kingdom on the Nintendo

08:36.960 --> 08:40.340
Entertainment System. Did you ever play that? Adventures in the Magic Kingdom on NES? It

08:40.340 --> 08:47.020
was actually kind of bad. Maybe. I don't remember. It was one of those early Capcom games and

08:47.020 --> 08:52.540
it actually had a replica map of Disneyland that for an 8-bit game is pretty accurate.

08:52.540 --> 08:59.340
But the whole deal is that you go around to these rides, the big rides of the park, the

08:59.340 --> 09:04.140
e-ticket rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, and each one was just basically

09:04.140 --> 09:10.100
mini games. Throwing out the terminology that most people are going to miss. E-ticket means

09:10.100 --> 09:16.640
the big budget rides. The big stuff. The stuff I named. Pirates of the Caribbean. Not like,

09:16.640 --> 09:21.080
I hate to say it because I love the teacups, but the teacups is not an e-ticket ride. That's

09:21.080 --> 09:30.040
kind of a lower budget ride. Anyway. Let's see. Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.960
Let's see. DarkTetsuya is saying, we could also talk about Kingdom Hearts 3. If we were

09:33.960 --> 09:38.220
talking about Kingdom Hearts 3, then that would also be, I suppose, acceptable to keeping

09:38.220 --> 09:44.120
it Disney related. I guess that's a good point. I'm just sorry. Some of these rides, I can

09:44.120 --> 09:48.360
understand if you're strapped into the roller coaster. Cool. Okay. That makes sense. You're

09:48.360 --> 09:52.360
not going to fall out and stuff. But like, how's anybody not dying on Pirates of the

09:52.360 --> 09:59.980
Caribbean? That's all I have. Alright. Let's see. BobbyBlackWolf in chat

09:59.980 --> 10:05.040
reminding me, Rob made me ride Small World after making him almost puke on the teacups.

10:05.040 --> 10:10.520
Me and Jason. Yeah, I think I do remember it spinning really fast, those teacups though

10:10.520 --> 10:15.120
so we were all in it. Anyway. Alright. Let's get into games. Kickoff topic tonight. So,

10:15.120 --> 10:20.260
I know many of you were watching this past week the awesome Games Done Quick marathon

10:20.260 --> 10:24.480
that happened on Twitch is how most of us were watching it. I know it was also a live

10:24.480 --> 10:30.240
event that they did, I think in DC is where they have it at a hotel out there. And you

10:30.240 --> 10:36.560
know, many people throughout the speedrunning community playing games as fast as they can

10:36.560 --> 10:40.840
for charity. And I don't know about you, Loki, but I find that I've been watching this

10:40.840 --> 10:45.720
more and more with each marathon. And they do, part of what I really have enjoyed about

10:45.720 --> 10:53.660
it is seeing them glitch games that I grew up with. Like Final Fantasy IV was the very

10:53.660 --> 10:57.840
last thing they did last night. And I watched a bit of that run. And there's all these glitches

10:57.840 --> 11:03.360
they did for like duping items and stuff that I just didn't even realize you could do in

11:03.360 --> 11:08.560
the game when I played through it when I was 12. And yeah, I was almost like inspired

11:08.560 --> 11:12.920
in a way by it. I took a game that I thought, well, if I were to speedrun any game, what

11:12.920 --> 11:16.200
would I want to learn how to speedrun? And we actually talked about this a few weeks

11:16.200 --> 11:19.320
on the show. And I think the game I kind of settled on that I want to try to get better

11:19.320 --> 11:25.080
at is Super Mario Brothers 2. Just because that's just a platformer I just loved as a

11:25.080 --> 11:30.600
kid and I still love today, even if I have to play stupid Toad to really be as fast as

11:30.600 --> 11:35.120
possible because Toad can pick the grass just slightly more. But I swear, I swear some

11:35.120 --> 11:39.520
of those worlds, I've seen some of the speedrunners do it. And I swear Princess is better than

11:39.520 --> 11:43.040
Toad at some of the stuff they're trying to do. So we'll see. We'll see. I'm going to

11:43.040 --> 11:49.200
give it a go. Try to work on it. It's hard. It is not as easy as it looks. You have to

11:49.200 --> 11:55.200
really time things perfectly in order to be able to do that. So yeah. Dar Tetsuya in chat

11:55.240 --> 12:01.360
says hey Toad is not stupid. I'm sorry. I can't stand playing him in Mario 2. He feels

12:01.360 --> 12:09.960
so gimp to me in Mario 2. I used to like Toad. The Princess float is so OP. But maybe that's

12:09.960 --> 12:14.640
just what I remember when I was a kid is I would play Luigi and the Princess because

12:14.640 --> 12:19.760
they both kind of floated. Luigi did a different sort of thing but he was really effective.

12:19.760 --> 12:24.480
He can jump higher than anyone and that power jump can really skip entire sections of the

12:24.480 --> 12:30.320
game. Let's see Tech 2030 talking about Awesome Games Done Quick saying my favorite thing

12:30.320 --> 12:35.680
I watched was the Fez speedrun. Very informative. I'm watching a lot more but not live. I've

12:35.680 --> 12:40.160
been binging them as they've been adding them to YouTube all this week. A lot more convenient.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.280
I love binging a bunch of them through my Apple TV so I can watch on the big screen.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.320
Yeah I used the Twitch app on PlayStation 4 and I watched a lot of it on the big screen.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.640
Shane was over last night. We were working on an unrelated thing on his computer and

12:52.640 --> 12:56.160
watching Awesome Games Done Quick a little bit and just watching some of the dupe. I

12:56.160 --> 12:59.640
don't know if you get a chance to watch a lot of that. Loki I know you with the kids

12:59.640 --> 13:02.280
and everything don't always get TV time but did you see anything else?

13:02.280 --> 13:09.840
I didn't really watch any. I do like watching them though. I kind of glanced over the schedule

13:09.840 --> 13:12.240
and I didn't know what I wanted to watch.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.480
Well there was some other stuff I watched too. A little bit of like the Velocity 2X.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.020
They had a whole Indie Games block which I thought was really cool because it's kind

13:18.020 --> 13:22.400
of bringing awareness to maybe games that people may not know about otherwise. I thought

13:22.400 --> 13:27.360
that was pretty cool. Okay here's the crazy part. So Orange Launch Radio started as a

13:27.360 --> 13:31.720
music game show which I'm sure you guys all know. We focused on things like Dance Dance

13:31.720 --> 13:35.520
Revolution was the big one at the time because that's how Loki, Dar Saka and I all met was

13:35.520 --> 13:38.520
at the arcade playing that game. And then we would do things like you know Parappa the

13:38.520 --> 13:43.080
Rappa and all this stuff. So over the years when we were more exclusively music games

13:43.080 --> 13:48.720
this program that allowed you to play DER on your computer showed up and it was called

13:48.720 --> 13:53.720
StepMania was this program. And for the longest time we were kind of sitting here going when

13:53.720 --> 13:59.640
StepMania going to get shut down by Konami because basically it's kind of better than

13:59.640 --> 14:06.560
DDR PC actually turned out. It does more than what DDR even on the PC did. And I'm thinking

14:06.560 --> 14:11.200
StepMania never really got the book thrown at it because I don't think they ever sold

14:11.200 --> 14:16.500
it. But if I'm not mistaken and I'm having to go old age memory here but wasn't in the

14:16.500 --> 14:22.500
groove adapted from StepMania. Yeah it's basically StepMania. And so that's when Konami

14:22.500 --> 14:27.520
got him and that was when In the Groove released on PlayStation 2 is when finally Konami was

14:27.520 --> 14:31.820
like throw the book at him basically. And you know we talked extensively about Kyle

14:31.820 --> 14:37.180
Ward about this almost a year ago now and talked about that whole thing. So the reason

14:37.180 --> 14:40.460
why I bring that up is that obviously what a lot of people were talking about from Awesome

14:40.460 --> 14:46.100
Games Done Quick was this guy that was playing actually was it two of them? That was playing

14:46.100 --> 14:50.580
I didn't get to see the whole thing but that was playing StepMania and was playing some

14:50.580 --> 14:56.980
just really crazy stuff in StepMania that's not meant for actual dancing. Let's be real

14:56.980 --> 15:03.740
it's not meant for DDR because you had stuff where it was like hitting all four arrows

15:03.740 --> 15:07.940
in between mines where you're not even supposed to be standing on the pad. Like there's stuff

15:07.940 --> 15:14.020
you're not going to be able to do with your feet. So it was kind of controversial. Like

15:14.020 --> 15:19.460
some people were very much like what the hell is this? This is really cool because

15:19.460 --> 15:25.500
this guy is you know banging on the keyboard so hard and so fast that the camera is actually

15:25.500 --> 15:29.880
shaking that's you know I guess on the table or whatever like it's just it's just so much

15:29.880 --> 15:33.900
it's intense right if you try to play. We always called it finger finger revolution

15:33.900 --> 15:39.420
and which leads to all the jokes you can imagine. But StepMania is basically finger finger revolution.

15:39.420 --> 15:44.020
And so it goes so fast that you know it's causing things to shake and other people were

15:44.020 --> 15:50.180
like what the hell is this doing in awesome games done quick? It's a game like this you

15:50.180 --> 15:56.140
don't really run quick there's nothing to do but play the song. And you know there's

15:56.140 --> 16:00.940
that technicality that I don't believe this was actually meant to be a speed run it was

16:00.940 --> 16:05.300
more of an exhibition what they were doing with Stepania. But still it was it was so

16:05.300 --> 16:13.260
weird to see like holy crap topic from 10 years ago is all of a sudden new again in

16:13.260 --> 16:16.860
awesome games done quick. But I suppose and there was a part of me that was like I don't

16:16.860 --> 16:21.360
know how I feel about that that's so weird but then I think you know they do a lot of

16:21.360 --> 16:26.160
obscure games during awesome games done quick. I watched them do this game on the Super Nintendo

16:26.160 --> 16:30.980
that was like I don't even know what it was it looked really really garbage and it was

16:30.980 --> 16:37.420
only like six levels long and it was really it was really not a great looking game but

16:37.420 --> 16:41.100
I was like alright I guess if they can run really obscure stuff like this is StepMania

16:41.100 --> 16:46.820
really out of place? Probably not. So I just thought that was that was interesting to observe

16:46.820 --> 16:51.220
that whole thing that it was more like it was trending on Facebook right StepMania is

16:51.220 --> 16:54.500
like I don't know if you saw on Facebook it was actually in the bar it says here's what's

16:54.500 --> 16:58.780
trending on Facebook and like it's like you know dude plays StepMania and it's crazy.

16:58.780 --> 17:03.460
And I was just like in a way I'm kind of like I just I don't want to sound hipster

17:03.460 --> 17:05.620
but I kind of knew about that six or seven years ago.

17:05.620 --> 17:08.740
Well it's a good thing he wasn't playing on the pad because you know as soon as someone

17:08.740 --> 17:13.860
starts playing on the pad there's going to be a little kid that runs across so they just

17:13.860 --> 17:15.580
that wouldn't have been good for the live stream.

17:15.580 --> 17:20.180
Oh my god Dark Tetsuya you you read my mind Lester the Unlikely that was the game I know

17:20.180 --> 17:24.480
there was an awful games done quick block yeah that was it and that was the game I saw

17:24.480 --> 17:30.400
wow I can't believe you guessed that based off what little I said. Let's see Dungeon

17:30.400 --> 17:35.680
Buster says the Crypt of the Necrodancer Coda run was insane. The Lester run was neat it

17:35.680 --> 17:41.560
was scheduled super late though not if you're west coast time. Let's see other comments

17:41.560 --> 17:48.560
in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. TigerClaws say did you see the Super Metroid two players

17:48.560 --> 17:53.520
one controller run that was amazing. I didn't see that I actually missed all the Super Metroid

17:53.560 --> 17:57.920
stuff I just wasn't around when it was on I'm sure it'll be on YouTube later and I'll

17:57.920 --> 18:02.320
catch it there but two players one controller I know right like you know all those jokes

18:02.320 --> 18:08.460
write themselves about that that's pretty crazy but cool so props to Awesome Games Done

18:08.460 --> 18:13.620
Quick they raised what like 1.2 million dollars I think for charity and I'm told that it's

18:13.620 --> 18:18.920
not as much as they raised last year I think they did 1.5 last year but you know A it's

18:18.920 --> 18:23.480
still money for a good cause and B you know the economy is just going to vary year after

18:23.480 --> 18:27.720
year and what people can give and just there's so many factors that play into it I still

18:27.720 --> 18:31.980
think you know it's only a million dollars I mean that's still an impressive amount of

18:31.980 --> 18:37.160
money for and I'm using my quotey fingers here a bunch of gamers to be collecting for

18:37.160 --> 18:42.880
a great charity so you know what that's that's 1.2 million dollars well spent fuck cancer

18:42.880 --> 18:47.520
right so yeah good on you guys with Awesome Games Done Quick and everybody who donated

18:47.520 --> 18:53.720
and all that stuff one more thing before I move on on the step mania Awesome Games

18:53.720 --> 18:57.760
Done Quick stuff somebody else is bringing up in the Awesome Games Done Quick there was

18:57.760 --> 19:02.920
also the Super Nintendo game Lagoon which is really funny to me that that was in the

19:02.920 --> 19:08.760
awful games done quick statement because Lagoon I remember that game vividly from when I was

19:08.760 --> 19:13.520
younger and the Super Nintendo was out and that was I really think Lagoon was the first

19:13.520 --> 19:18.880
video game I ever rented and it was a game that I rented more than once I actually really

19:18.880 --> 19:25.480
enjoyed it but again I was what 12 years old so you forgive a lot of the things that you

19:25.480 --> 19:30.680
look back on and are really dopey now you know video games have come a long way and

19:30.680 --> 19:35.760
bad translations were just it's something that was part of the charm in the Super Nintendo

19:35.760 --> 19:41.680
era you know like Final Fantasy 4 and you spoonie bard you know just some of the some

19:41.720 --> 19:45.400
of the funny little things that happen in translation I think were always you know kind

19:45.400 --> 19:49.880
of epic and so obviously Lagoon has a lot of those issues but I got to admit as a 12

19:49.880 --> 19:53.480
year old I didn't really notice them as much as people do now so it's kind of I don't know

19:53.480 --> 19:58.880
it's the whole thing's funny to me for some reason so alright before we get into our gaming

19:58.880 --> 20:03.860
week I actually had a second topic to bring up here because I just thought you know it's

20:03.860 --> 20:09.400
the beginning of the year here we are 2016 we're past our predictions and all that stuff

20:09.600 --> 20:15.600
but there's a lot of gaming anniversaries to be celebrated this year you know we saw

20:15.600 --> 20:20.080
as we saw a lot of them last year right Super Mario Brothers turned 30 and we had Super

20:20.080 --> 20:25.280
Mario Maker as a result of that right so I would like to present for you right now some

20:25.280 --> 20:31.800
anniversaries coming up this year and I'm gonna listen carefully for the pain it's gonna

20:31.800 --> 20:38.800
cause you when you go oh my god I'm old oh god I'm so old so let's take a moment to write

20:39.640 --> 20:46.640
really feel old everybody you ready and I want all caps in chat as you guys feel old

20:46.720 --> 20:53.720
so here we go on January 29th Duke Nukem 3D turns 20 that's awesome Duke Nukem 3D not

20:57.640 --> 21:04.040
the original but the 3D one that was you know the multiplayer and all that probably still

21:04.040 --> 21:09.280
better than Duke Nukem Forever the best game they probably ever did in that series 20 years

21:09.680 --> 21:16.680
old this month I remember playing that game in college in the dorms I'm feeling really

21:17.600 --> 21:24.600
old right now February 21st the Legend of Zelda turns 30 30 years old for Zelda which

21:27.000 --> 21:32.600
makes sense cause Super Mario turned 30 last year but do you know what turns 20 in February

21:32.600 --> 21:39.600
20 years old you ready Pokemon red and green or as it was here in the states blue Pokemon

21:42.040 --> 21:49.040
red and blue turn 20 years old in February that broke somebody guess what else turns

21:52.040 --> 21:59.040
20 in March Resident Evil Resident Evil came out 20 years ago this year it does feel that

21:59.040 --> 22:06.040
old too going from the chat I think Resident Evil out of any of the game series it really

22:08.080 --> 22:15.080
needs a tomb raider-esque reboot like something Tech 2030 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

22:16.080 --> 22:23.080
says Rob why stop it no because this is what I have to go through every day when somebody

22:23.080 --> 22:28.080
tells me about how old they were when something comes out and it's just for fun come on let's

22:28.080 --> 22:35.080
see also Tiger Claw in chat says you know what turns 43 in February me well happy early

22:36.280 --> 22:41.280
birthday Tiger Claw and the Bobby Black Wolf keeps saying oh that came out when I was 9

22:41.280 --> 22:47.080
that came out when I was 9 because you know the 29 joke yes I understand all right let's

22:47.080 --> 22:54.080
see oh also celebrating 30 years in May Dragon Quest turns 30 in May which again a game of

22:56.080 --> 23:02.080
the NES era makes sense for some reason I was sick thinking Dragon Age I'm like that

23:02.080 --> 23:09.080
isn't that old yes I'm a little slow today all right and in June Quake turns 20 20 years

23:09.080 --> 23:15.080
old is the original Quake with the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack which made it so cool for

23:15.080 --> 23:22.080
kids my age at the teenagers my age when that first came out let's see and then turning

23:22.080 --> 23:26.080
25 of course talk about this last week on the show and this no surprise Sonic the Hedgehog

23:26.080 --> 23:33.080
is 25 in June I can't wait to see what awesome game they put out to celebrate the 25th anniversary

23:33.080 --> 23:39.080
here's one that surprised me do you know what else turns 20 in June 20 years ago the

23:39.080 --> 23:45.080
Nintendo 64 and Super Mario 64 20 years old in June and then let's see in September 30

23:48.080 --> 23:54.080
years of Castlevania and I don't care anymore about that in October and September

23:54.080 --> 24:00.080
30 years of Castlevania and I don't care anymore about that in October 20 years of

24:03.080 --> 24:09.080
Tomb Raider doesn't feel 20 years old probably because the new one it almost it feels

24:09.080 --> 24:12.080
just like a new series like you don't even remember the old series at least I don't I'd

24:12.080 --> 24:18.080
still vaguely I just remember topless Lara mods that's all I remember from the old games

24:19.080 --> 24:25.080
slush colored triangles and pyramids in December civilization turns 25 that's one of my

24:30.080 --> 24:34.080
favorite civilizations they ever did was the original and I remember going to the computer

24:34.080 --> 24:38.080
store that's not even there I think that I think it's like a hairdressing place now not

24:38.080 --> 24:44.080
even there that plays or that game is 25 years old all right only a couple more don't turn

24:45.080 --> 24:51.080
the show off don't turn show off I've got three more three more here's one for Loki in

24:51.080 --> 24:56.080
October command and conquer red alert turns 20 yeah I probably I remember picking that up

24:56.080 --> 25:02.080
when it first came all right and two more for you in December the end of the year 20

25:04.080 --> 25:10.080
years of Diablo Diablo gonna be 20 years old it it doesn't feel that way it doesn't feel

25:14.080 --> 25:18.080
that old until you look at a screenshot of Diablo and then remember oh wow this game

25:18.080 --> 25:24.080
really is super old all right one more you ready for this 35 years old 35 the oldest one

25:27.080 --> 25:33.080
of the list 35 years of Donkey Kong this year the original oh god does that mean we're in

25:33.080 --> 25:39.080
another Donkey Kong game maybe yeah that could be something in store for the Nintendo NX

25:39.080 --> 25:45.080
who knows thank god it's a Frogger anniversary year well Konami is not really making games

25:45.080 --> 25:50.080
anymore maybe a mobile thing who knows there it is there you go there's I'm sorry to make

25:50.080 --> 25:55.080
you guys break down in tears I think tech 2030 has said he will be boycotting next year

25:55.080 --> 26:00.080
this week this the episode this week but there you go a little trip down memory lane and

26:00.080 --> 26:04.080
we'll probably be bringing up a little more memories of those franchises as we get closer

26:04.080 --> 26:09.080
to those anniversaries throughout the year the stuff that gets me and I'm glad none of

26:09.080 --> 26:15.080
it was on the list the stuff that gets me is 10 years old or and pretty soon it's gonna

26:15.080 --> 26:20.080
be 15 years old because especially next year when we start looking back at games that are

26:20.080 --> 26:24.080
15 years old you know what that's gonna mean those are games they're as old as this show

26:27.080 --> 26:33.080
because 2017 will be 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio if we make it if I am not killed by

26:34.080 --> 26:38.080
an angry mob for the segment we just did on the show so we'll we'll have to hope for that

26:38.080 --> 26:42.080
dark tatsuyu in chat suggesting a Frogger pachinko machine for Frogger's anniversary

26:42.080 --> 26:49.080
you never know anything anything's possible there let's see also going to a chat over

26:49.080 --> 26:54.080
at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says so what you're saying is that everything in

26:54.080 --> 26:59.080
the world came out in 1995 no it's uh it's uh 1996 it's 20 years from this year and yeah

26:59.080 --> 27:03.080
actually that was a really big year for games I remember that was the year I went off to

27:03.080 --> 27:08.080
college and those those are pretty big year for games so not surprised all a lot of this

27:08.080 --> 27:15.080
stuff is is coming up on that anniversary so all right um let's get into how was your

27:15.080 --> 27:18.080
gaming week every week here on the show we like to talk about the types of video games

27:18.080 --> 27:23.080
that we have been playing this week sort of to establish our frame of reference that we

27:23.080 --> 27:26.080
come to the show with tonight Loki would you care to start us off how was your gaming week

27:26.080 --> 27:31.080
yeah I mainly just played Fallout 4 so that's god I don't even know how many days into

27:31.080 --> 27:37.080
that game I am but basically played every day so you know for a few hours every day I think

27:37.080 --> 27:43.080
last I remember because I only see that when I actually save my game and I think it's like

27:43.080 --> 27:50.080
four or five days worth of game so somewhere in there and then let's see what else have I

27:50.080 --> 27:55.080
been playing I played a little bit Disney 3.0 because you know my son wants me to level

27:55.080 --> 27:58.080
up his characters and stuff and I'm trying to convince him like to actually fight something

27:58.080 --> 28:03.080
or you know to play the game so instead of just the toy box mode I'm like dude you've got

28:03.080 --> 28:08.080
like we bought you the spider-man set so they have the spider-man levels and we have the

28:08.080 --> 28:12.080
Avenger levels still that you haven't played through it all we have almost all of the

28:12.080 --> 28:18.080
characters now for those you maybe should play the levels but no no he still wants to play

28:18.080 --> 28:24.080
in his toy box mode that he set up and that's fine that's what he wants to do it's so I

28:24.080 --> 28:31.080
leveled up I've Sam Flynn that was like level 18 out of 20 now so it's you know pretty

28:31.080 --> 28:39.080
much I can't be killed with him anymore and I don't know so I played that and then aside

28:39.080 --> 28:43.080
from those two and there's one other thing I'm you know playing a little bit Ingress

28:43.080 --> 28:50.080
today I drove out into the middle of nowhere for no reason the freaking things that game

28:50.080 --> 28:53.080
makes you do you know I drove this finally I was like I've got like time like I don't

28:53.080 --> 28:56.080
know what I'm going to really do right now I'm like I'll drive out there that's fine

28:56.080 --> 29:00.080
it's kind of cool in a way that you get to see things you'd never go see otherwise and

29:00.080 --> 29:05.080
actually I drove to I own a couple weeks ago like I was surprised I'm also not that far

29:05.080 --> 29:09.080
away is no it's really not so who knew you know so they have a good restaurant there

29:09.080 --> 29:14.080
too so drove out there and like it was funny this is like a drove way out there and they're

29:14.080 --> 29:17.080
like yeah they're trying to get me to go up the street a little bit to knock out another

29:17.080 --> 29:24.080
one I'm like but it's just like a little bit over there I'm just gonna go I drove all

29:24.080 --> 29:29.080
this way I'm not gonna drive the show for Ingress is an excuse that wouldn't even work

29:29.080 --> 29:35.080
with me Loki so whatever it's fine and I haven't really been playing that much lately

29:35.080 --> 29:38.080
because I'm on my new work schedule now which means I have weekends off now thank God I

29:38.080 --> 29:44.080
don't work Saturdays anymore that's good but that also means that I start earlier and I

29:44.080 --> 29:51.080
get off during like I did pick up the kids after work so I don't have that few hours

29:51.080 --> 29:57.080
before work that I used to do stuff and actually farm and all that now so like I have like

29:57.080 --> 30:02.080
no gear at all there's something else they played this week also I'm trying to think

30:02.080 --> 30:09.080
it was what was it I think I played a little bit more of laser life and I just I'm not

30:09.080 --> 30:14.080
really getting into that game it's okay but there's like I don't really there's like no

30:14.080 --> 30:20.080
story to it it seems like so I don't know it's alright I think that's it that's all

30:20.080 --> 30:23.080
I played all right that's it for your gaming week my gaming week I actually played a couple

30:23.080 --> 30:30.080
new games this week PlayStation 4 wise I downloaded at Shane's recommendation and the fact that

30:30.080 --> 30:35.080
it was on sale and Shane told me that him and Flaco Jones and and mrs. Flaco Jones were

30:35.080 --> 30:41.080
all playing this game roundabout on the PlayStation oh yes yes and we're laughing their

30:41.080 --> 30:46.080
asses off hysterically at it and so I was like alright funny I was I it's a lot of like

30:46.080 --> 30:49.080
cheesy and I remember talking about the game on the show and I was like oh yeah yeah I

30:49.080 --> 30:53.080
remember that came upon OLR and I wanted to get that and I just kind of blinked and missed

30:53.080 --> 30:58.080
its PlayStation 4 release so oh it's on sale sure I'll get it now so I I paid five bucks

30:58.080 --> 31:02.080
and download a roundabout and I played it a little bit I have to admit I didn't get the

31:02.080 --> 31:08.080
hilarity factor as much as no I'm kind of where it wasn't super hilarious for me either

31:08.080 --> 31:13.080
it was just kind of like silly or I should say I shouldn't I shouldn't falsely say that

31:13.080 --> 31:20.080
Flaco was so it was all via Shane via Shane but I can imagine if I had had a few glasses

31:20.080 --> 31:25.080
of wine at the Jones's household then this game would probably be a lot funnier but I

31:25.080 --> 31:28.080
still thought I mean it definitely had like that cheese factor I'm not sitting here like

31:28.080 --> 31:33.080
completely humorous like nothing was funny pout no there were some like humorous things

31:33.080 --> 31:39.080
in it but you know I didn't I didn't laugh out loud but the game itself it's about the

31:39.080 --> 31:46.080
game anyway and the game itself is a really kind of silly mechanic but it's it is it is

31:46.080 --> 31:52.080
fun it's I actually kind of think of it more like a puzzle game than an action game here's

31:52.080 --> 31:57.080
the deal is that you're driving a limo and you're trying to get from place to place in

31:57.080 --> 32:03.080
the city but your limo consistently spins round and round and round so why it spins

32:03.080 --> 32:06.080
I have no fucking idea that's just the game okay that's why it's called roundabout is

32:06.080 --> 32:12.080
that this limo just spins round and round and round so you can't hit walls and trees

32:12.080 --> 32:17.080
and stuff because each time you do you're gonna hear this note that goes and on the

32:17.080 --> 32:22.080
fifth note your limo explodes although I would have thought there'd be a hilarious cutscene

32:22.080 --> 32:28.080
where the people inside explode but that never happens so it's it's trickier than it

32:28.080 --> 32:33.080
sounds because you're trying to like navigate around walls and navigate around actual roundabouts

32:33.080 --> 32:37.080
which is actually kind of tricky to do while your limo is consistently spinning around

32:37.080 --> 32:41.080
so in a way I kind of think it's a puzzler because you have to think about how to get

32:41.080 --> 32:45.080
through certain parts but of course the game rewards you if you can go faster and if you

32:45.080 --> 32:50.080
can collect these coins in sequence so there is a more in-depth complexity to it so it's

32:50.080 --> 32:55.080
it's one of those indie games that's like kind of really simple in concept but it has

32:55.080 --> 33:00.080
a lot of depth to it and then they threw these really cheesy full motion videos at it for

33:00.080 --> 33:06.080
I'm not sure the reason but it was it was humorous I'll use that word I found it to

33:06.080 --> 33:11.080
be humorous but I didn't find it to be like oh my god it's so funny maybe I just didn't

33:11.080 --> 33:15.080
get far enough but I played a lot with Shane last night and he said the date thing was

33:15.080 --> 33:22.080
the funniest thing and I was like it's it's humorous but it's not it's not strangers

33:22.080 --> 33:26.080
I want to say it's the same company that made gun stringer they did like a lot of really

33:26.080 --> 33:34.080
cheesy motion video stuff as well so yeah so anyway that I let's see Dungeon Buster

33:34.080 --> 33:38.080
and chat over at live.com says spinning car smashing into trees exploding sounds like

33:38.080 --> 33:42.080
a typical day in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row for me yeah but this game is all like

33:43.080 --> 33:47.080
it's more like a classic arcade kind of setup because it's more to those like top down maybe

33:47.080 --> 33:52.080
classic Grand Theft Auto but that's that's what it is anyway I do think especially when

33:52.080 --> 33:56.080
the game cost only five dollars I think that was really well worth it I got mine for like

33:56.080 --> 34:02.080
374 or something like that really what is it normally 10 10 I don't have a price to

34:02.080 --> 34:08.080
I would say even 15 is pretty darn good if it's 1999 that might start to be pushing it

34:08.080 --> 34:13.080
a little bit but I still think for some people you know if you like those old arcade type

34:13.080 --> 34:18.080
of things or if you have a box of wine and I'm going to say a box of wine it will make

34:18.080 --> 34:22.080
for a fun little party game to play with friends if none of you have played it before I would

34:22.080 --> 34:26.080
say that'd be good use your money then the other game I played this week which I did

34:26.080 --> 34:31.080
spend 1999 on amplitude came out this week on PlayStation 4 and you might remember a

34:31.080 --> 34:36.080
while ago I talked about that I wasn't going to kickstart the game but I ended up it seemed

34:36.080 --> 34:40.080
a lot of my friends were really enjoying it and I was hearing a lot of good feedback on

34:40.080 --> 34:45.080
it so I went ahead and bought the game and it's amplitude it's definitely the game that

34:45.080 --> 34:52.080
I remember from you know the PlayStation 2 days especially in the way it's set up the

34:52.080 --> 34:59.080
controls obviously very similar and so on I'm going to say something that is not going

34:59.080 --> 35:04.080
to make me popular though it's it's not as good it's not the ship kind of sailed on the

35:04.080 --> 35:09.080
PlayStation 2 version and the frequency and amplitude and either for me the reason why

35:09.080 --> 35:16.080
it's not as good is the music isn't as great as it was in the PlayStation 2 version it's

35:16.080 --> 35:22.080
not as varied I am all for supporting indie bands and I think the game is at its strongest

35:22.080 --> 35:27.080
when it's relying on some of the guest contributors for example the freeze pop song actually

35:27.080 --> 35:31.080
that song in a way is so fucking good it's probably the best freeze pop song they've

35:31.080 --> 35:36.080
ever put in a game and that probably like carries the song list almost on its back that

35:36.080 --> 35:40.080
freeze pop song is so good and then like I like the crypto the necro dancer song and

35:40.080 --> 35:47.080
amplitude and so forth otherwise I found a lot of it to be generic and I know I'm going

35:47.080 --> 35:51.080
I'm going to so get torn anyone by amplitude fans but this is my opinion take it or leave

35:51.080 --> 35:58.080
it and you're welcome to leave it I think part of what made the amplitude on PlayStation

35:58.080 --> 36:04.080
2 and frequency fun is that they were songs you kind of knew so you kind of knew the beats

36:04.080 --> 36:08.080
to them so like when you would play things like cherry lips by garbage or what was it

36:08.080 --> 36:12.080
by blink-182 the rock show some of the songs rented it was like you know okay I kind of

36:12.080 --> 36:17.080
I kind of know how this goes a little bit and you know it's all cool I'm playing the

36:17.080 --> 36:21.080
song that I've actually heard before and then I think one of the places where the formula

36:21.080 --> 36:27.080
worked at its absolute best was rock band blitz that game was awesome and the fact that

36:27.080 --> 36:32.080
it also used your rock band dlc I would actually have rather they ported rock band blitz to

36:32.080 --> 36:38.080
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one sorry but that's how I kind of wish that's the game they brought

36:38.080 --> 36:45.080
back for this era was that but you know what again taste when it comes to things like music

36:45.080 --> 36:50.080
is kind of subjective and you may completely disagree with me and that's totally okay if

36:50.080 --> 36:56.080
you are looking for strictly gameplay mechanics of what you remember from amplitude on PlayStation

36:56.080 --> 37:01.080
2 and frequency then this game will deliver that absolutely and you never know what might

37:01.080 --> 37:05.080
come through with dlc so I would not give this game like a bad rating because it's still a

37:05.080 --> 37:12.080
good music game I just think I I would be really excited if the old PlayStation 2 game

37:12.080 --> 37:18.080
would show up on as a PlayStation 2 classic on PlayStation 4 I realized due to licensing

37:18.080 --> 37:23.080
etc that's not going to happen but that doesn't mean I don't think that would have been something

37:23.080 --> 37:28.080
I'd prefer so anyway okay now I'm going to turn around and look at chat and see see if I'm

37:28.080 --> 37:36.080
getting yelled at over at live dot vog network dot com let's see let's see our fifth dream

37:36.080 --> 37:42.080
and chat says rock band song should carry over to amplitude or maybe dlc let's see

37:42.080 --> 37:47.080
why why are in chat says yeah thrown together is what I think when I look at the amplitude song

37:47.080 --> 37:53.080
list and that's geo 100 matt says I'm not surprised by this why why are in chat says it's

37:53.080 --> 37:59.080
like they forgot that a music game lives or dies by its music I wonder if dlc is coming

37:59.080 --> 38:05.080
wow I'm kind of surprised that there's a lot of chatters that sort of get it wow okay so I guess

38:05.080 --> 38:10.080
I'm not alone I was fully expecting to get toward a new one by some of the music longtime music

38:10.080 --> 38:16.080
game fans but you know again I think you just I think you just really have to weigh I mean if you

38:16.080 --> 38:21.080
are a longtime music game fan then just think it amplitude because it is going to be enough of what

38:21.080 --> 38:26.080
you remember of the past games I'm just saying the song list you're going to kind of go I want to

38:26.080 --> 38:30.080
play the freeze pop song the freeze pop song is so good and then I'm going to play the freeze pop

38:30.080 --> 38:38.080
song again because that's kind of what I did I played the freeze pop song like 20 times and

38:38.080 --> 38:41.080
the crypt of the necrodancer song is good too and there's a there's a couple other good ones too I

38:41.080 --> 38:47.080
don't want to I don't want to disrespect the artists but it's just a lot of it is very in house

38:47.080 --> 38:53.080
band to do something like a spin off of that kind of like how about rock band blitz on

38:53.080 --> 38:58.080
PlayStation cross between like amplitude and like a DJ hero type game I'll be great you know

38:58.080 --> 39:03.080
they kind of make that and again I I just want to make sure this is clear I'm not against indie

39:03.080 --> 39:09.080
music or discovering like new music and games because Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 2 which

39:09.080 --> 39:13.080
was the best version best home version they ever made and I stand by that to this day and part of

39:13.080 --> 39:20.080
the reason why was the variety of independent catchy songs that were in it and these like bands

39:20.080 --> 39:26.080
that I had never heard of that I grew to really love like echo image that was in Ultra Mix 2 is

39:26.080 --> 39:30.080
like one of my favorite why I only put out one album even if they only put out one fucking album

39:30.080 --> 39:38.080
but it's a fucking great album I think it's on Spotify at this point so let's see also in

39:38.080 --> 39:44.080
chat SJ100 Matt saying I don't think that it getting more funding during the campaign would

39:44.080 --> 39:49.080
have helped this why we are saying actual dance music that helps yes that's part of the reason

39:49.080 --> 39:54.080
why we should totally play skulk during break I can make that happen I think you should teach

39:54.080 --> 39:58.080
the kids today sadly the podcast listeners don't get that that's right that's why you're here

39:58.080 --> 40:05.080
live when we break that's what YouTube's for Spotify all that stuff we'll do that okay so that

40:05.080 --> 40:09.080
was that was my gaming week especially in a nutshell those those are the two new games I

40:09.080 --> 40:13.080
picked up otherwise I've been continuing on with stuff I've already played before like Final Fantasy

40:13.080 --> 40:19.080
14 continuing to get my tomes and oddly enough minecraft this week I just sometimes you just

40:19.080 --> 40:25.080
want to you just want minecraft and chill so would you play minecraft on ps4 thank the only

40:25.080 --> 40:30.080
reason I ask because I have like on every platform now so it's like ridiculous yeah no and then I

40:30.080 --> 40:34.080
started playing and I started to build my little hut because you know you kind of have to especially

40:34.080 --> 40:38.080
if you're playing in survival mode you kind of have to build at least a rudimentary house

40:38.080 --> 40:44.080
really quick to kind of keep you safe at night at least in the beginning I do and then so I

40:44.080 --> 40:49.080
built the whole thing but then I didn't have enough wool for a bed I forgot I needed to kill

40:49.080 --> 40:55.080
more sheep and so what is standing right outside my house a creeper who then sees me promptly

40:55.080 --> 40:59.080
walks in my house blows up my house what's behind my house after he blew it up one of the

40:59.080 --> 41:05.080
endermen and I'm like wasn't I on easy but endermen will hurt you unless you stare at them

41:05.080 --> 41:09.080
you can walk right up to them poke well don't poke them but you can walk right up to them they

41:09.080 --> 41:13.080
won't hurt you unless you stare at their eyes interesting yeah I just I don't know that just

41:13.080 --> 41:17.080
irritated me that happened right away so it kind of put me in a foul mood then I then I wasn't in

41:17.080 --> 41:23.080
such a chill mood after that but I will give it another go I still think minecraft is a very zen

41:23.080 --> 41:29.080
game so that's that's how I feel about that I think minecraft is a very lazy game yyr in chat

41:29.080 --> 41:34.080
says how do you kind of play a game oh wait that's not response something I said that's a response

41:34.080 --> 41:39.080
to a fifth dream saying I'm kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 right now not putting as much effort

41:39.080 --> 41:46.080
into it like lazily playing it yes I think when I think kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 is like

41:46.080 --> 41:50.080
if you're really playing 14 you're logging in and you're doing your dungeon every day to get your

41:50.080 --> 41:55.080
tomes and you're grinding you're crafting to get all your scripts and you're doing your dailies

41:55.080 --> 42:02.080
with the vanu vanu you're doing all that stuff kind of playing is like I'm gonna log in and I'll

42:02.080 --> 42:07.080
do like a bot I'll see if anybody from the free company's on we'll pretend this is a chat room and

42:07.080 --> 42:10.080
I'll just chat with my friends while I run around the housing district and jump I'll check the

42:10.080 --> 42:16.080
market boards and I'll log off that's kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 when it when it when an

42:17.080 --> 42:22.080
MMO is just chat room with swords and spells then that's your kind of playing the MMO I think

42:22.080 --> 42:29.080
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says that was me in Final Fantasy 14 in the end which is why I stopped

42:29.080 --> 42:34.080
paying and playing yeah I mean if you know you're not getting enough of the game out of it I can

42:34.080 --> 42:39.080
I can understand why if fifth dream says I've got it in the background and I go back and forth I

42:39.080 --> 42:43.080
I definitely will have Final Fantasy in one window while I do stuff that's what two monitors are

42:43.080 --> 42:48.080
for MMO in one window and then sometimes I listen to a podcast especially if somebody I know is

42:48.080 --> 42:55.080
live which tangentially I just want to give a quick shout out to my buddies Captain Spike and

42:55.080 --> 43:00.080
Slidekick over at gamebuoy.org they hit 100 episodes today and you know what they did to

43:00.080 --> 43:05.080
celebrate 100 episodes they finally did a live show so I did a live show today I'm very nice

43:05.080 --> 43:11.080
very proud of my base over at gamebuoy.org and the fact that they they did a live show so I

43:11.080 --> 43:18.080
just want to make sure that shout out got there and happy 100 episodes to those guys so yeah and

43:18.080 --> 43:22.080
I'll oftentimes there's a live show on in the evening I'll definitely do MMOs while I listen to

43:22.080 --> 43:31.080
live shows so all right that's it for our gaming week housekeeping tonight I don't have a lot of

43:31.080 --> 43:36.080
new information I will just remind you all I'm gonna be at magfest not in any sort of official

43:36.080 --> 43:40.080
capacity it's not like we have a booth or anything but I'll just kind of be there maybe I'll start

43:40.080 --> 43:44.080
a topic on the forums over at vognetwork.com get a feeling if there's going to be other people

43:44.080 --> 43:49.080
there and maybe we can do like an unofficial official vog meetup maybe do like a dinner thing

43:49.080 --> 43:54.080
like we did at PAX East one year even if that's just you know just getting some pizzas and

43:54.080 --> 43:59.080
chilling in a particular room or hallway or something I don't know what the atmosphere is

43:59.080 --> 44:04.080
like at magfest yet but I get the impression it's just one giant party so we'll do some type of

44:04.080 --> 44:09.080
little unofficial vog meetup and that's really what we'll do for that I'm just excited to get to

44:09.080 --> 44:12.080
the con and check it out that's gonna be a lot of fun and there is going to be quite a

44:12.080 --> 44:18.080
representation from what I understand Bobby Blackwolf still making plans to go I don't know

44:18.080 --> 44:23.080
if that's been a hundred percent confirmed but I have plane tickets and hotels so I'm going

44:23.080 --> 44:30.080
absolutely and meeting up with some of my buddies who podcast on Koopa Club another show that I

44:30.080 --> 44:36.080
enjoy and they will be out there at magfest with me so it's gonna be a lot of podcast stuff

44:36.080 --> 44:41.080
Bobby Blackwolf confirmed I have hotel I'll be driving so there you go so there there's gonna

44:41.080 --> 44:45.080
be at least two vog hosts there and I don't know who else I don't know if Rama might be actually

44:45.080 --> 44:51.080
be going fifth dream in chat asking about conventions is sky going to Final Fantasy fan fest

44:51.080 --> 44:56.080
2016 difficult to say until tickets go on sale and I make sure it's reasonable and that I can get

44:56.080 --> 45:02.080
there but my plan is to be there if I can get to Final Fantasy fan fest the plan is to be there

45:02.080 --> 45:07.080
just you know it's a little far out and too many factors for me to a hundred percent commit to that

45:07.080 --> 45:13.080
I can tell you I will not be trying for BlizzCon this year I'm just there's just so many other

45:13.080 --> 45:19.080
conventions I want to do I've decided to I cut PAX PAX East last year and this year I'm

45:19.080 --> 45:24.080
this year I cut PAX East I'm also gonna cut BlizzCon out of the rotation just because

45:24.080 --> 45:30.080
unfortunately you know now that Horde house is kind of sunsetted I don't really have a lot

45:30.080 --> 45:36.080
the only Blizzard game I actively play a lot of is Diablo 3 and although I really think this is

45:36.080 --> 45:40.080
going to be Diablo 3's big year I just don't think there's going to be a lot a lot of BlizzCon

45:40.080 --> 45:46.080
for me if I could swing the time off of work I might do DizCon and check out some of the parties

45:46.080 --> 45:51.080
but I just the reality is I don't think BlizzCon is going to make the rotation this year I will be

45:51.080 --> 45:58.080
opting to do hopefully there'll be a gamer x4 this year and doing magfest as well and some other

45:58.080 --> 46:04.080
stuff here locally in April Sac Indie Arcade is coming back and VoG Network's been asked to

46:04.080 --> 46:10.080
participate again which surprise Loki no no that's I'm not surprised I already knew that

46:10.080 --> 46:17.080
okay yeah I've been trying to work on my game I got I got no games gonna pressure you

46:17.080 --> 46:22.080
that would be a good day to do it though if you're gonna do any day do that that day in April

46:22.080 --> 46:31.080
I want to get it I really try not to like it's hard because my wife watches TV and I find TV

46:31.080 --> 46:37.080
fascinating so I watch TV as well and it's it's very distracting I get like two lines of code done

46:37.080 --> 46:44.080
and Bobby Blackwolf in chat reminding us VoG jam submissions were due one year ago also

46:44.080 --> 46:53.080
so anniversary celebrating an anniversary this year the VoG jam one year old let's see why we

46:53.080 --> 46:59.080
are saying that he's been waitlisted sadly that right now he's on the waitlist to try to get in

46:59.080 --> 47:04.080
multitasking to show off at magfest but he's hopeful that some folks he knew that were

47:04.080 --> 47:08.080
waitlisted last year eventually got in and he said if I do wind up with a space I will plug

47:08.080 --> 47:13.080
OLR and or VoG appreciate that buddy I'll bring I'm gonna bring flyers I don't know what magfest

47:13.080 --> 47:17.080
fliering policy is but if they're at your booth I don't think they can get mad at me for that so I

47:17.080 --> 47:23.080
will bring that and Rama sadly saying I'm probably backing out that's a bummer doesn't matter but

47:23.080 --> 47:28.080
Rama does a lot of cons so I understand he has to be picky choosy because money don't grow on

47:28.080 --> 47:36.080
trees and you might not have the money for a convention ticket and you might not have the

47:36.080 --> 47:42.080
money to buy an oculus riff this year right Loki I would like to have the money especially since

47:42.080 --> 47:48.080
my wife is insisting on new claim that was it the Powerball that's gonna be up to 1.3 billion

47:48.080 --> 47:55.080
dollars on Wednesday oh yeah oh that's the other thing you guys I had a Powerball ticket that was

47:55.080 --> 48:01.080
a winner and not only was it a win I mean obviously I didn't win the 900 million I had two

48:01.080 --> 48:08.080
numbers and the Powerball and I'm not type words like okay I bought the ticket and I just kind of

48:08.080 --> 48:12.080
kept it away and then when I heard on the news nobody in California won I was just like whatever

48:12.080 --> 48:16.080
I didn't win and you know I'll check the ticket when I get around to it so finally in the car

48:16.080 --> 48:20.080
today I was like oh yeah I should check the ticket and see if I won anything and then I realized

48:20.080 --> 48:25.080
holy shit we match two numbers and the Powerball on one of these now granted I'm not expecting to

48:25.080 --> 48:30.080
win thousands of dollars but I was like that might be like like a hundred bucks to do because

48:30.080 --> 48:35.080
you get four bucks for just matching the Powerball if you just match the Powerball which would lucky

48:35.080 --> 48:42.080
13 a lot of people did this last drawing you won like four bucks so to get two numbers out of the

48:42.080 --> 48:47.080
five and the Powerball I was like holy shit this tickets gonna be like $250 that's awesome like

48:47.080 --> 48:52.080
you know it's not gonna change my life but it's gonna hey exactly it's something to buy some booze

48:52.080 --> 49:01.080
with right okay it was $8 I got $8 that's still not bad I mean it's something but I poured it of

49:01.080 --> 49:07.080
course I poured it right back into as what my mom calls it's a stupid tax Rob if you play the

49:07.080 --> 49:12.080
lottery you're just paying the stupid tax well let's go there and you give them your $10 I can't

49:12.080 --> 49:17.080
wait you can kiss it goodbye because only stupid people play well someone's gonna get a stupid tax

49:17.080 --> 49:25.080
return and it's gonna be you know whatever you know why it's fun and it yes and you have like a

49:25.080 --> 49:32.080
you know a very minimal chance of winning so does everybody else so who cares so I put that $8 prize

49:32.080 --> 49:38.080
right back into the stupid tax that's like when you win on a slot machine in Vegas you win like a

49:38.080 --> 49:42.080
small prize or in Reno for me you win a small prize like five but it just goes right back in

49:42.080 --> 49:48.080
the machine or Dolly Parton gave me $60 and yes she did last time I was in Reno on one of her

49:48.080 --> 49:52.080
machines there's a Dolly Parton machine and you know my gay ass played the Dolly Parton machine

49:52.080 --> 49:58.080
so I played that and I won like 60 70 bucks off that which is like a nickel slot and I was like

49:58.080 --> 50:03.080
woohoo and so what did I do I took the $60 to dollar slots and just watched it all piss away

50:03.080 --> 50:11.080
but oh well it's it's just for fun set your limits before you go don't take your bank card down to

50:11.080 --> 50:19.080
the gambling room with you and you're fine so let's see going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com

50:19.080 --> 50:26.080
YYR in chat says so here's the thing you may have only won seven bucks excuse me eight bucks

50:26.080 --> 50:33.080
don't short me any more than they are in the cost of the the ticket maybe the tickets are two bucks

50:33.080 --> 50:44.080
oh that's even worse but the odds of matching two numbers plus the Powerball are one in 701.33

50:44.080 --> 50:50.080
so you should feel awesome YYR says Powerball.com says it was seven bucks no I assure you I got

50:50.080 --> 50:54.080
eight dollars today I wonder if the money's different in each state I wonder if maybe the state

50:54.080 --> 51:00.080
has to pay things out certain because you know when it's under like 50 bucks you just take it to

51:00.080 --> 51:05.080
where you bought it and they pull the money out of the register like I just everybody like all the

51:05.080 --> 51:10.080
liquor stores and gas stations in town swarmed with people grocery store has a kiosk you can just

51:10.080 --> 51:14.080
walk right up any time of day and buy a lottery ticket there's never a line so I just went to the

51:14.080 --> 51:18.080
grocery store and they just here's eight bucks what would you like I don't even know like I would

51:18.080 --> 51:23.080
have to like hand walk that winning ticket somewhere it's like oh I'm gonna trust the US Postal

51:23.080 --> 51:28.080
Service with this no no are you kidding that's the benefit of living in Sacramento I would march

51:28.080 --> 51:33.080
down to the lottery office it's powerful though I don't think that's California you still you still

51:33.080 --> 51:40.080
redeem it with the California Lottery oh yeah I'd be like I with my newly obtained lawyer would go

51:40.080 --> 51:45.080
and redeem that prize I don't know Tiger Clon chat says the sky wins the Powerball he'll quit his

51:45.080 --> 51:51.080
job and probably retire from any everything yeah I don't know I haven't really thought about how I

51:51.080 --> 51:56.080
would spend the money and I like the people at my job I wouldn't want to just screw them over but

51:56.080 --> 52:01.080
yeah obviously sure I'd love to say all around the world in a yacht but you hear about so many

52:01.080 --> 52:06.080
people dying in yacht accidents I know no that just pissed the money away they win the lottery

52:06.080 --> 52:12.080
and then they pissed money 1.3 billion dollars you can piss a lot of that but you can fill the

52:12.080 --> 52:17.080
ocean with piss for that kind of money I mean it doesn't really matter and that's that's what I'm

52:17.080 --> 52:22.080
gonna do you know what if I win the Powerball first first on the agenda take care of my parents

52:22.080 --> 52:27.080
that's number one on the agenda second on the agenda dig a pool in Loki's backyard and fill it

52:27.080 --> 52:32.080
with pee that it's gonna be second luck there's a nice little drainage pipe going through the

52:32.080 --> 52:37.080
backyard you're gonna get about six inches down before you hit the storm line with a billion

52:37.080 --> 52:45.080
dollars they can rear out that fucking line damn straight all right another as a sky would you buy

52:45.080 --> 52:52.080
a mansion let's not this is these stupid thoughts are how they get a mansion a mansion stupid

52:52.080 --> 52:56.080
thoughts are how they get you to buy the tickets in the first place exactly it's half the fun if I

52:56.080 --> 53:03.080
win my goal is to be responsible and a little irresponsible where appropriate that's that's

53:03.080 --> 53:09.080
why controlling shares and Konami burn it to the ground if I win Powerball I'm fucking buying

53:09.080 --> 53:15.080
Konami I am fucking buying Konami that's it if I win Powerball I'm buying hostile takeover hostile

53:15.080 --> 53:20.080
takeover Rob and we're gonna change the name to Rob Roberts on to me and I'm gonna fucking own

53:20.080 --> 53:24.080
Metal Gear wait for it that's what I'm doing with the Powerball and you know what the first thing

53:24.080 --> 53:32.080
I'm gonna do is PT is fucking coming back and I don't care if we have to like you know get Guillermo

53:32.080 --> 53:38.080
del Toro and Hideo Kojima hand jobs in order to make that happen I'll have 1.3 billion dollars

53:38.080 --> 53:46.080
it'll happen anyways let's get enough Powerball wank let's get into the news and talk about

53:46.080 --> 53:52.080
something that maybe I could afford with 1.3 billion dollars right Logan exactly so the Oculus

53:52.080 --> 53:57.080
Rift they announced the price they announced when it's coming out so now all you have to do is go

53:57.080 --> 54:06.080
order it it's $600 supposed to be launching in March and $600 that's quite a bit of money of

54:06.080 --> 54:11.080
course you're also gonna need to have a PC to run that which will probably run you in about at

54:11.080 --> 54:19.080
least another $1,200 $1,300 and what do you get with that well you also get of course a couple

54:19.080 --> 54:24.080
games that's gonna be launching with Eve Valkyrie also Lucky's Tale and then of course you get you

54:24.080 --> 54:32.080
know the Xbox one controller and everything so I don't know that's a little too rich for my blood

54:32.080 --> 54:38.080
for right now just because I don't have a PC to run it and you know really it comes down to like

54:38.080 --> 54:43.080
how much am I really going to use this because right now I don't use the DK 2 very much but then

54:43.080 --> 54:48.080
again my PC doesn't run it very well so maybe if it ran it like it's supposed to I might use it a

54:48.080 --> 54:54.080
little bit more a lot of people are screaming the sky is falling about the price I don't it the

54:54.080 --> 54:59.080
problem is like the price is not a big deal if you have the marketing behind it to convince people

54:59.080 --> 55:04.080
that they need to purchase it the problem is when you have a price like that you're gonna get people

55:04.080 --> 55:10.080
that are already excited about it to maybe buy it but that's it it's like yeah you want you want

55:10.080 --> 55:15.080
as many people to buy it so there's more support behind it so there's you know it just kind of a

55:15.080 --> 55:19.080
big cycle so you get more people excited because there's more software out there for it which

55:19.080 --> 55:25.080
means that the price is a little bit more worth it and so on but I think a factor that played into

55:25.080 --> 55:29.080
this as well is that you know they said at one point whether it was an offhanded comment or not

55:29.080 --> 55:34.080
people as expectation was it was going to be what 350 that was the expectation at one point

55:34.080 --> 55:40.080
whether it was an offhanded comment or not so when it kind of was a little higher than that I think

55:40.080 --> 55:45.080
some people were kind of irritated because they felt like wait a minute I was budgeting this amount

55:45.080 --> 55:51.080
of money or I expected it at this and now it's this and even though you know 599 that's how much

55:51.080 --> 55:58.080
a PlayStation 3 cost when it first came out but we also kind of hazed the shit out of that press

55:58.080 --> 56:07.080
conference when the PlayStation 3 was first announced 599 US dollars 599 you know I don't know

56:07.080 --> 56:12.080
I think I think I made a prediction on the show a couple weeks ago where I said Oculus is going to

56:12.080 --> 56:17.080
do all right but it's going to be kind of limited to that I need to go back because you know maybe

56:17.080 --> 56:21.080
I'm giving myself more credit than I deserve but I still remember saying it's still going to be a

56:21.080 --> 56:26.080
niche thing but it'll it'll be a thing and it's not going to necessarily be just a flash in the pan

56:26.080 --> 56:32.080
and I think this price kind of cements it as a niche thing at least for now who knows what happens

56:32.080 --> 56:37.080
a year from now you know the great thing about the price technology it falls PlayStation 3's are now

56:37.080 --> 56:44.080
not even what 149 for a place well yeah but the thing for me it's like it it reminds me a lot of 3D TV

56:44.080 --> 56:51.080
like 3D TV is like this amazing technology that it was super expensive and there's people that got

56:51.080 --> 56:56.080
on board with it but they didn't really do a great job of explaining why you needed it you know

56:56.080 --> 57:02.080
what made it so great why you need to spend that and now it's kind of just like well it's been taken

57:02.080 --> 57:06.080
a backseat they don't really have a lot of 3D TVs out there at least it's not something that they're

57:06.080 --> 57:12.080
selling people on it now it's all about 4k and that type of stuff but I don't know one other thing

57:12.080 --> 57:19.080
too is if you did back the original Kickstarter you're going to be and that's at the development kit

57:19.080 --> 57:25.080
level so $300 or higher you'll be getting a consumer rift as well and at no additional charge

57:25.080 --> 57:30.080
which is kind of nice it's hard to hate on that that's pretty rad that you know you don't hear about

57:30.080 --> 57:36.080
that with a lot of kickstarters that kind of go beyond the rewards that were promised for their

57:36.080 --> 57:44.080
investors and I have a hard time expressing anything but congratulations for those people that believed

57:44.080 --> 57:49.080
in it enough that now they're gonna get this thing that you know for many people they felt they've

57:49.080 --> 57:59.080
been priced out of so props to them I can't be mad at that yep and then of course you know basically

57:59.080 --> 58:05.080
there's an AMA that can't it kind of happened right after the announcement which you know lucky

58:05.080 --> 58:10.080
basically said you know apologize that you know the communication of the price wasn't exactly the

58:10.080 --> 58:17.080
messaging wasn't handled well I guess a lot of people's expectation was a supposed to be a lot lower

58:17.080 --> 58:27.080
but it is what it is so I don't know I think I hope it does well but I'm just worried with the price

58:27.080 --> 58:32.080
if they're the market behind it to like get people hyped up about it as much as like anything else

58:32.080 --> 58:38.080
that Apple releases that's ridiculously overpriced then I think that this has a pretty good chance

58:38.080 --> 58:43.080
but it's just the problem is it's not just six hundred dollars out it's not like an iPhone where it's

58:43.080 --> 58:49.080
just six hundred dollars you know out the gate and that's it you also need a computer to run it and

58:49.080 --> 58:55.080
like for the average consumer they're not gonna have that you know your mom and pop or whatever

58:55.080 --> 59:03.080
it's not gonna have like a gaming PC that can run this shit. Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com

59:03.080 --> 59:06.080
Bobby Blackwell pointing out they don't need the marketing they sold out of all their first shipments

59:06.080 --> 59:11.080
you know I don't I don't know how many that was but that you know at least I guess looks promising

59:11.080 --> 59:16.080
but I think again you know when you consider in a niche thing that's not I'm not a niche isn't negative

59:16.080 --> 59:20.080
either I think yeah the hardcore audience and the people that really I think there's enough people

59:20.080 --> 59:23.080
they really kind of believe in this I want to see it happen that are going to be early adopters

59:23.080 --> 59:28.080
it's like the early iPhones that were so expensive you know there are people that buy the early technology

59:28.080 --> 59:33.080
how appropriate this being the week of Consumer Electronics Show which I know we didn't really bring up

59:33.080 --> 59:37.080
in our kickoff topic because there wasn't really a lot of gaming news that came out of the show

59:37.080 --> 59:42.080
but there's a lot of gadgets that are really high dollar there that people will pay a lot of money for

59:42.080 --> 59:51.080
electric cars too not even just Tesla's but Prius and you know Leaf and all that stuff

59:51.080 --> 59:57.080
those are pretty expensive cars but I really think the price of those things is I think the Prius already

59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.080
was one of those things that was a lot a lot a lot of money when it first came out and it's coming down

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:07.080
year after year so you know and there's no reason to believe that the others won't follow suit similarly

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.080
especially you know it'll be interesting to see what happens with the whole Tesla thing as they start to expand

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:17.080
where those charging stations are and all of that and they can you know kind of get more of them out there

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.080
but anyway I'm getting a bit off track you know there's early tech adopters and then there's everybody else

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:29.080
I'm excited for it I do want to eventually get one but it's just I've got to build a new PC for that

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:37.080
and I do want to do that maybe that's more of a motivation for me to finish a game so that I can you know

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.080
have the money coming in to hopefully purchase a PC to be able to run this in

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:50.080
Now Facebook you know obviously Facebook bought Oculus a couple years ago and that was a whole other controversy

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.080
but you know speaking about marketing I kind of think Facebook is doing the right thing right now

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.080
is that Facebook doesn't need to be running commercials on TV and during the Super Bowl right now

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.080
like Bobby said they sold out of the first shipment the geek crowd is going to carry it right now

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:10.080
they know there's enough people interested in it based on Kickstarter etc it's going fine right now

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:17.080
but what's interesting about Facebook being involved is that if you look at your friends list feed right now on Facebook

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:23.080
which many slightly tech savvy people almost all of them have a Facebook unless you're one of those anti-Facebook people

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.080
but as you scroll through your Facebook feed you'll see that there's 3D videos already there in your Facebook feed

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.080
especially if you do it on mobile phone and you'll notice you can take your phone and move it around

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.080
and it actually shows you like a 3D video I went there like a podrace from Star Wars it was on there not that long ago

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.080
which I know there was no podrace in the new movie but they were still showing some type of like sample thing

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:51.080
I don't know I feel like that's something I saw but they're already starting to condition you that 3D videos are a normal thing

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:58.080
you see in your feed you see where this is going Facebook is planting the seeds they might not be doing heavy marketing

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.080
with commercials and everything they don't need to right now but they're starting to get you used to the idea

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:12.080
that 3D video is a thing that we share just like we share selfies and gifts on the internet

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.080
so I kind of think Facebook is starting to lay the seeds for that

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:23.080
now going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com some folks are talking about there's a little debate going on in there

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:30.080
about the PlayStation VR and how that's going to play a role and I guess the fact that Amazon Canada

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:39.080
had a posting that was quickly taken down that PlayStation said you know was nothing has been announced basically

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.080
they didn't deny the price of $800

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:47.080
I don't think they have to deny the price they didn't say they just didn't say they have an announcement

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.080
they never really like even if they're they have a price out there they're not gonna say that's not the price

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.080
they're just gonna say we don't have anything to announce that's how they always handle it

01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.080
you know what though I still there's still a huge grain of salt I'm taking with this

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.080
and part of the reason why is that you know assuming everything was accidental

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.080
which I have no reason to believe it wasn't completely accidental and shit happens

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.080
and that maybe they had some type of placeholder in their system as Amazon often does

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:18.080
when I ordered Kingdom Hearts 3 for yeah Kingdom Hearts 3 for what was like 40 bucks

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.080
they had it on sale at one point you know these things happen in the system

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:30.080
I think it's possible that maybe Sony is totally okay with people thinking it's $800

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:36.080
so that way when they come in and they announce the price is $699 it doesn't seem so bad

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.080
so I don't know there's still a grain of salt they take with that

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:45.080
like there's still a part of me that's like well $800 means system and VR right

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.080
because that's a lot to pay for just the VR headset

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:54.080
I mean we do know that the Playstation VR is gonna be not just the headset but the little processor box as well

01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:00.080
so you know the Oculus doesn't have that little processor box so I mean $800 wouldn't be unheard of

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:09.080
but that's gonna really I mean that's gonna be what the rich kids have at home at least this year

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.080
and there's gonna really have to be the software that substantiates it

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.080
you know what's that game that's worth $800

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:23.080
I hope that it just works as a second monitor so I can play Fallout 4 while my wife is watching TV

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.080
because I seriously okay so seriously like this is what I did this week as well as part of the time

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:33.080
I had built or bought parts to build this thing it was gonna be a second screen device

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.080
that was gonna basically be like the Wii U gamepad but gonna be used for any system

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:45.080
and so I have the parts for it I have a wireless HDMI extender basically for everything

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:51.080
and I hooked it up and didn't fucking work with the Playstation 4 it just got no image whatsoever

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:57.080
it worked with the 360 but I attempted to do something like that but it would be nice to have that second headset

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.080
to be able to view everything plus the VR stuff

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.080
I just think without the $800 game it's going to be sunk

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.080
as much as I love Rez and I heard Shane's enthusiasm for Rez VR and all that

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:15.080
I don't think that's an $800 game so you know if and it's a huge if bolded underlined italicized if

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.080
the price of that thing really is $800 then there's got to be the $800 game that goes with it

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:25.080
and I'm not sure anything we've seen so far is that game but we'll see we'll see what happens

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:32.080
I imagine at this point GDC I mean if it is kind of an expensive techie thing

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.080
I think they'll roll it out on the stage of GDC as opposed to E3

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:42.080
because E3 is where all your newspaper around the country and all those people are tied into

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.080
if Sony announces a huge price like that it'll be in USA Today

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:49.080
they announce something at GDC that's going to be a little more at the tech crowd level

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.080
so we'll see I mean GDC isn't usually the place to roll out those sorts of announcements

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.080
but it wouldn't be out of character for Sony

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.080
Sony did announce the move there I believe at GDC

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.080
I know they did Home one year so it's not out of character for them

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.080
I would like another Home especially tied in with VR would be pretty cool

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:12.080
That would be interesting especially if it ends up being part of the package

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:18.080
could help at least justify the price if it's you know better than Home as it was

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.080
anyway there's a lot of what ifs to be discovered with PlayStation VR

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.080
and hopefully we'll have the answers in the coming weeks we'll see

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:29.080
but I just I really don't I think $800 is just too far out there

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:36.080
and I really think PlayStation I just my gut says Sony knows they cannot get on a stage in a massive form

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.080
and say the word $599 again they're going to have to get it under that price

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.080
I just think I'm just kind of convinced that's what they got to do

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.080
whether that's a practical idea or not

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.080
and I've said this before and it's been a while

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:57.080
but man a new Ridge Racer launching a system that would be pretty badass

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:04.080
alright let's move on I got to move on to something that's actually kind of really sad in nature

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.080
but actually it was as far as the video games itself there was a lot a lot in this early week of the year

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.080
but we did have a real tragedy that happened in the video game world this week

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:20.080
and regretfully I have to report on this is that one of the voice actresses from Final Fantasy 14

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.080
unfortunately was found murdered this past week and there's no really easy way to say that

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:29.080
but Sian Blake who actually played Yugiri in Final Fantasy 14

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:35.080
now if you don't know Yugiri, Yugiri was a character that was not in the original Realm Reborn

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:42.080
but Yugiri showed up in one of the later patches and was revealed to be an Al-Ra which was the new race

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:46.080
so she was a character that tied together the two expansions

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.080
tied together Realm Reborn into Heavensward and of course she carries on into Heavensward

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:58.080
her part isn't, it's not a main character level part but still a very important part of the story

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:05.080
so Sian Blake who played Yugiri was actually found dead and I apologize this is gruesome

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:11.080
but her two children were also murdered and her partner Arthur Kent

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:18.080
Arthur Simpson Kent, excuse me, is missing and the police are looking for him in connection to the deaths

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:23.080
and obviously that's just very, very sick now that we're talking about children

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:29.080
many of you overseas probably heard about this but you didn't hear, you didn't know there necessarily was a video game connection

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:36.080
Sian Blake was actually one of the stars of EastEnders which people here in the States don't really know about that

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.080
but over in Britain it's, you know, a long, long running soap opera there

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.080
so a lot of the British reports are mentioning that it was an EastEnders actress that died

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.080
but that's the same person if you didn't know

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:57.080
of course a lot of vigils and memoriums going on inside Final Fantasy XIV in remembrance of Sian Blake

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:04.080
and I'm sure there's some people wondering what's going to happen to the character, what's going to happen to the voice actor

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:14.080
I have a feeling, A, if you're curious to show up in more patches a lot of the dialogue has probably already been recorded

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.080
I would imagine all of the 3.0 Heaven's Word storyline, all of it was already written a long time ago and it's probably already all been acted

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:27.080
also changing voice actors isn't completely out of character for Square Enix

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:36.080
In this game, Final Fantasy XIV, a lot of notable voice actors actually changed between Realm Reborn and Heaven's Word

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:42.080
like Gideon Emery who does Balthier in Final Fantasy XII plays Oranger in Final Fantasy XIV

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.080
and they totally changed the voice actor going into Heaven's Word

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.080
so that was a little bit, some of those voice actor changes were surprising

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:56.080
so unfortunately this is a tragedy but the reality is we have to talk about what's going to happen with the game

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:01.080
so if Ugiri continues on they'll probably change the voice actor or voice actress

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:07.080
I could see where maybe they would write the character out, out of respect to this actress perhaps

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.080
but one thing to also consider is that there are voice actors in other languages as well

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:21.080
Sian did the English voice, there's still a Japanese voice actor and I think they do voice in French and German?

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:30.080
but hoping that Square Enix in some sort of official capacity does do some sort of memorial for Sian Blake

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:36.080
I think it would be great if maybe they could sell a pet and maybe donate it to some type of children's charity

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:42.080
since unfortunately children were involved in this tragedy, I think it would be a very great gesture for Square Enix

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:48.080
maybe a memory of Sian Blake, maybe a special holiday event in the game where there might be a pet

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:57.080
and maybe they can raise funds and donate it to a children's shelter or a women's shelter of domestic abuse or something

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:05.080
something to, at least we can get some positive ending to this tragic, tragic story

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:11.080
and I really don't know what else to say about it, I'm sorry to be such a downer but it happened

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:17.080
and sometimes they're going to affect the games that we play, especially a game like Final Fantasy XIV that is still unfolding

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:22.080
there's not a beginning and an end for that game yet, so we'll see

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.080
anyhow, let's try to lighten the tone a little bit more and go back to Loki with some other news

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:47.080
so there's rumors or news about the NX, basically saying that they're going to be announcing some sort of concept version of it

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.080
kind of like what it is, letting people know about that, between March and May

01:11:52.080 --> 01:12:00.080
and then the actual unveil of the console is going to be in June and it's going to be launching somewhere between October and November, probably during the holiday

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:08.080
and because of this it's probably going to eat into some of the sales of the Wii U and 3DS

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:17.080
this is coming from Nomura Securities, so I don't know, I guess that makes sense

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.080
would that time frame mean like a GDC type announcement?

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:31.080
no, I think E3 or bust, but I think there's an assumption from a lot of people that it necessarily means it's going to be winter this year

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:36.080
and I understand that's what a lot of analysts are saying, is that it's 2016, but what if it's still the fiscal year?

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:42.080
they could do a spring launch next year and that would not be out of character for Nintendo, they did the 3DS right?

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:47.080
and they could do it in the spring at the end of the financial quarter

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:55.080
I could see them doing that, but maybe, I'm assuming maybe at this point Zelda is probably going to be for the new console

01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:02.080
I'm wondering if maybe they just don't, they're going to run out of things to release

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:08.080
because they've got, all we know so far is we've got Star Fox coming out this year

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:17.080
there's those other two concept games that were being worked on, and Zelda

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:24.080
Zelda could carry the holiday, if Zelda is the only thing they've got this holiday, it could carry it, it really could

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:33.080
I think that's a big enough game for that, but it might be very easy for them to crank out, I still think it would be very easy for them to crank out a sequel

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:40.080
we know Pikmin 4 is a thing, and I don't think that would be an extraordinary amount of effort to make that happen

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.080
I mean, I understand that they like Pikmin, but come on, it's like 2 in this console cycle already

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:54.080
or this would be the second one in the console cycle, and we haven't even seen games for Metroid or some of their other properties that they normally have something for

01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:00.080
the cannibalization of sales though really strikes me as a non-headline, I think there's a big assumption there

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:08.080
or a general assumption out there amongst gamers, if rumors are to be believed anyway, that NX is going to involve handheld and console

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:18.080
and the 3DS and Wii U are starting to wind down their life cycles, I think Zelda will be a last hurrah for Wii U if it is not on the new console

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:26.080
but we'll see, I think there's so many factors right now, but when Wii U first came out it didn't really cannibalize the Wii

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.080
they were still selling the Wii for that particular first holiday, they still sold a lot of Wiis

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:42.080
and then the Wii was still a bargain-basement price, they took out the DVD and the Gamecube stuff and they had a bargain-basement Wii

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.080
that they were basically pitching as a Netflix device that year that was extraordinarily cheap

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:55.080
I don't know if I believe the whole cannibalization of sales of the old system because whatever NX is, is going to be expensive as well

01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:02.080
and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, if it is a handheld and a console, you can expect you're going to buy those two things separately

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:09.080
and that's how Nintendo's going to sell you a $599 product, because they're going to split it into $299 and $299

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:15.080
but we'll see, we'll see, there's so many factors

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:22.080
yeah, I think a lot of it, people are still in pretty tight budgets, I don't know, that's a lot of money to spend on stuff

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:29.080
whether it be an Oculus Rift, the Sony VR, or like another console that's going to be that kind of price, that's a lot of money

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:36.080
in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says Nintendo needs to take their damn time with this

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:42.080
yeah, I've seen some counterpoints that maybe Nintendo shouldn't release it this year, because they should build up a library of games

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:49.080
that maybe, I don't know, Wii U, Wii U kind of had a strong launch lineup, but its biggest problem was a lot of the releases had already been done

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:58.080
and Wii U to me kind of feels a little bit rushed as it is, because it was just like, I kind of thought it should have been to the spec of these modern consoles

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:05.080
I understand that they couldn't do that for the price point, but maybe they should have, because then that way you wouldn't have had the problem with

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:12.080
oh, these companies not being able to develop games for your console, because their new engines won't run on it

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:18.080
YYR in chat says too early for who though, what other major products are coming from Nintendo besides the mobile games?

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:27.080
Amiibo, to be fair, let's not factor out Amiibo, those things are still selling like crazy, they will be a part of the NX experience one way or the other

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.080
this is a whole money farm for Nintendo, and it's been profitable for them

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.080
but when is going to be enough is enough with that stuff?

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.080
I mean, how many are going to be too many?

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:48.080
I mean, eventually Beanie Babies weren't popular, so when is it going to be enough?

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:54.080
When are people going to realize that maybe I'm not getting the functionality with these things that I was hoping for

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.080
yeah, they look cool on my shelf, but that's it

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:07.080
I have to be honest Loki, if Skylanders is still a thing now, with characters that are not as well notable as Nintendo's suite of characters

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:13.080
and still taking up as much shelf space, and they only work with one very specific game

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.080
if that's still a thing, I kind of see that Amiibo could last just as long

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.080
I mean, I think the bubble will burst eventually as it does with most peripheral things, but I think there's still a good couple of years left in it

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.080
and I wouldn't factor it out of the NX at all

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:33.080
Well, and I do give credit to Skylanders where I think there's more gameplay with their figures than there is with Amiibo

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:40.080
I mean, so, I don't know, if they had something cool like that, like a grindy RPG thing

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:47.080
hey, Nintendo RPG or something like that, where you use Amiibo figures like you do, like Disney Infinity or something like that

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.080
that could be pretty cool

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080
Let me read one more comment then we'll move on

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.080
YYR in chat says, my opinion also differs from Rob's on what it is

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.080
I don't think it will be a console with a portable module

01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.080
I think it will be a portable that can dock and become a console

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080
Well, that could be very interesting

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:12.080
I think it is certainly feasible that there could be a portable now with almost as much oomph as you see in the PlayStation 4

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.080
or the Xbox One, and certainly if they sell an additional dock

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.080
which the dock could have something like a little more oomph in the chips that maybe allow it to play on a TV

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.080
as opposed to whatever the fixed resolution on the handheld is

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.080
I could definitely see where, I mean it might be an expensive dock

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:30.080
but they might make it worth it with some of the stuff that they pitch for you

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:35.080
I think that's a pretty clever way to imagine it

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.080
but we are just dreaming right now, we have no idea

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.080
But that doesn't really work as far as having multiple members of the family

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.080
or are they going to have multiple console systems

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.080
and how are they going to talk to each other, I don't know

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.080
We'll see, we'll just wait and see what they say

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.080
We'll see, I know, it's just too much to be, we get tinfoil hat all day

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.080
but we just need to wait for Nintendo to make an official announcement

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.080
Okay, so moving on to another lawsuit

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.080
but this one has to do with a company called Lumosity

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:10.080
and I have to admit, I had not really heard of this company until this article

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:15.080
but apparently they had all these brain games that were out there

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.080
and think about brain training for Nintendo

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.080
but these games actually claimed that it could make you smarter

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.080
and now Lumos Labs who created the game is being ordered to pay

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:33.080
the Federal Trade Commission 2 million dollars for deceptive trade practices

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:39.080
In the report, FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich said in a statement

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.080
Lumosity preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:48.080
suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, dementia, and even Alzheimer's disease

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.080
but Lumosity simply did not have the science to back up its ads

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.080
If you sign up for the auto-renewal program featured by Lumosity

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.080
between January 1st of 2009 and December 31st of 2014

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:05.080
you will be notified about the action and given an easy way to cancel

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:09.080
So, yeah, and some folks in chat, Dungeon Buster, saying, wow, I remember their ads

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:13.080
Yeah, I remember seeing their ads too around the time that brain training was popular

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:17.080
but brain training on DS sold itself differently

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.080
It didn't flat out claim to make you smarter

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:24.080
I think they were a little more clever about it where they said

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:29.080
this Japanese doctor said this is good for you type of thing

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:32.080
where they didn't say the game makes you smarter

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.080
but this doctor said about the game it's gonna do this

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.080
which is completely different

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.080
It's all in how you phrase it because you can't be shut down

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.080
for saying this doctor said this thing

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.080
because, I mean, come on, they put quotes on movie posters all the time

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.080
That's how they sell things

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080
So and so said this

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.080
So, Rob Roberts of Orange Launch Radio said about the new Amplitude game

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.080
The freeze-pop song is great, I played it 20 times

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.080
Put that on the box

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.080
Anyway

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:10.080
Let's see, and Dar Titsuye bringing up the brain training run that Tazbot did during Awesome Games Done Quick

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.080
I missed that whole segment

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.080
and I need to go back to YouTube and see it because I heard it was pretty funny

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.080
So, sadly, I didn't see any of that

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.080
I just saw some pictures and it looked really funny

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.080
so I gotta go back and look at that

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.080
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.080
although I'm thinking we are looking at yet another light week

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:30.080
Right, Loki, or what are we looking at this week in release dates?

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.080
There's nothing

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.080
Nothing in the US this week?

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.080
No

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.080
No? When do we get back into releases?

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.080
In a couple weeks here because I know we've got

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:47.080
the Lego Avengers game is going to be coming out on the

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:53.080
21st? No, it's the 25th

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:59.080
So, yeah, we've got some stuff coming out I think the following week

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.080
But, yeah, unfortunately not anything until then

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:08.080
This is usually a pretty light month and it's been even worse so this year

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.080
Alright, well, in the UK, and yeah, I'm going a little out of order here

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.080
but with Dark Soccer Night here I'm going to do the UK next

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.080
We at least have a handful of games this week

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.080
It sounds like this is mostly digital stuff though

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:24.080
Assassin's Creed Chronicles India is released for the PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4 this week on the 12th

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.080
You also have Gone Home making its debut on Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.080
I forgot they were putting that on those systems

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.080
I wonder if I'll want to check that out again

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.080
I don't know if they're doing anything new to it but I'll be curious about it

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:42.080
And then Tharsis comes out on Playstation 4 and PC as well

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:47.080
If you're more of a mobile person you can look for Pocket Mortis on Android and the iDevices

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:50.080
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases over there

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.080
I think we are finally getting back into some releases

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.080
Yeah, the 14th on the Playstation 4 this week

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.080
You have Evolve Ultimate Edition making its debut in Japan

01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:05.080
As well as Odin Sphere, Leif Drasir comes out this week in a regular and a 3D Crystal Famitsu Deluxe Pack

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.080
That is a new release from Atlus on the Playstation 4 this week

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:14.080
On the Playstation 3 that Odin Sphere is also getting a release on Playstation 3

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:19.080
The Wii U has nothing to note until the end of the month when Mario Tennis comes out

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:23.080
But on the Vita we do have Odin Sphere also out on the Vita

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.080
There's also an accessory set I guess that comes with that as well on the Vita

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:33.080
And then Darius Burst Chronicle Saviors also out in Japan this week on the Playstation Vita

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:38.080
And lastly looking at the 3DS to see if there's any releases

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.080
Just one, Card Fight Vanguard G Stride to Victory coming out in Japan this week

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:50.080
Yeah, and like I was double checking the first releases of this month are actually on the 19th

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:53.080
So next week there will be some releases

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.080
Hooray! We get release dates again next week

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.080
Yeah, next week

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.080
Finally out of that holiday

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.080
And 26th for LEGO Marvel Avengers which I am totally picking up day one

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080
Awesome

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.080
Alright, let's go through a few more stories here

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.080
We'll go a little quickly and then we'll get to Classic Game of the Week

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:15.080
Alright, so there's apparently this latest round of DRM is being more difficult or stubborn to be cracked

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:21.080
This includes this brand new Denovu anti-temper technology

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:32.080
It's being used in such games from EA like FIFA 16 and they also have I guess Just Cause 3

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.080
It's being used on as well

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:39.080
Apparently they're saying that it's remained, they haven't cracked it yet

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:44.080
And this is coming from I guess some Chinese cracking group 3DM

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.080
But then again though there's other hacking groups out there so I wouldn't necessarily take it

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:54.080
Are they really trying hard enough? Are you really trying hard enough or are you slacking off because it's the holidays?

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.080
No, I'm joking

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:02.080
Honestly with Just Cause 3, I mean it hasn't been out that long and maybe it is because it's so buggy

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.080
Maybe that I don't know if they have tried that hard, I don't know

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.080
Who knows, we'll see

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.080
Let's be real though, we're not really supposed to be rooting for the cracking teams

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.080
Well no, let's put it this way though

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.080
That's what keeps games off PC

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:23.080
I understand that but at the same time though the people are concerned that maybe because their thought is that in two years time

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:29.080
There's not going to be any pirated games because it's going to be impossible to hack through the DRM

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.080
Which I just don't buy that at all

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.080
Hackers gonna hack right?

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.080
There is no possible way that that is going to be uncrackable

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.080
All it is, is time

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:44.080
Especially making a comment saying that, oh it's impossible, that's just going to get more people trying

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:51.080
I do find it interesting that for a change instead of the company putting out the game saying it's impossible

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:55.080
You actually have the crackers themselves saying it's impossible

01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.080
I think giving it a month's time is not saying it's impossible

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.080
It's harder than it was but I don't think it's impossible

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:11.080
That's still a win, a big win though for the publishers if it's going to take them a month to crack games

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.080
Because most of the game sales happen when? The first month

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.080
Yeah

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.080
So it's still a huge win

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.080
But it's a horribly fucked up buggy ass game

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.080
A lot of these games that are coming out from these publishers, EA especially

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:28.080
And Just Cause 3 was just as bad, they were fucking buggy as shit when they came out

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.080
And I think maybe waiting some time for all of that to be fixed is not such a bad thing

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.080
Especially when these companies are just willing to, oh well it's good enough

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.080
Batman Arkham City, yeah Batman Arkham Knight, good enough

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:51.080
Do you think that maybe the crackers instead of taking the time to try and get these games to be free for their people or whatever

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.080
Do you think that instead of putting the resources there they should just put the resources in to maybe help them fix the games

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.080
Fuck them, why should they have to help them fix the games

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:06.080
But look at it this way, we're talking two or three games out of how many games that come out all the time

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.080
There's so many indie games, there's so many other games, there's plenty of games out there

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.080
And if you don't want to spend $60 on a brand new game like Just Cause 3

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.080
Go spend $7 on a Humble Bundle

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:20.080
Yeah, go wait a few years or buy somewhere else or buy it on sale

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:26.080
I don't know, I haven't pirated PC gaming in a very long time

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.080
Like it's years, decades probably

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:34.080
But there was a time when it was super available and super easy to do

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.080
It was different in the 90s, it was different a long time ago

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:43.080
But now it's like, nah, it's just like I don't really see a reason to do it

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080
I mean, I don't know

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.080
There's so much out there that you can play

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.080
And it's funny that the quote is about there's not going to be any free games to play

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.080
Of course there's going to be free games to play, there's lots of

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.080
Go play Clicker Heroes, that's free

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.080
But seriously, there's so much out there that you can play

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.080
There's a lot of free to play MMOs actually, now that I think about it

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.080
And here's the thing too, it's like

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.080
There's so much you can play out there, there's just no time

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.080
If it's literally going to get to the point where there's no free things out there

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.080
Well guess what, you know what, it's pretty easy to make your own shit

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.080
So make your own game that's free to play

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.080
Alright, well moving on

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.080
We mentioned earlier in the show about some anniversaries

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.080
And Sonic is turning 25 this year

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:28.080
And we did have the whole rumor last week because of the musical group that said something on the Facebook

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:33.080
Well apparently there are more details and more rumors this week in addition to that

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:38.080
Apparently a former Sega Quality Assurance employee leaked this

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:42.080
Get your salt licks, tinfoil hats, take it as rumor

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:46.080
But apparently Sega is working on two Sonic games for this year

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.080
One of them is Sonic Adventure 3

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:51.080
So Sonic Adventure 3, possibly seeing release this year

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:56.080
The second game is supposed to be a 2D game called Sonic Genesis

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.080
Get it? Get it?

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:01.080
Sonic Genesis The Origin of Chaos

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.080
And it will be the same team that made Sonic Colors and Sonic Lost World

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080
Again, rumor?

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.080
So I see YYR in chat going, what, what?

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:16.080
I will buy, just don't, put the car in park because we don't have any official words yet

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:22.080
But yeah, that is what is rumored to come out later this year for the 25th anniversary

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.080
I'd be down with a Sonic Adventure 3, I think that would be pretty cool

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.080
And I do love the tongue in cheek name, although that could just as easily be a fanboy name

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.080
Sonic Genesis The Origin of Chaos, like I kind of think that's a hilarious name

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:41.080
If true, we'll see what Sega might announce in the coming months

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.080
Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, lowkey

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:50.080
Alright, so this is kind of funny because we actually talked about this I think last week or so

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:57.080
Regarding that there was a Mario Maker costume that someone had hacked into the actual data files

01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.080
And found out, hey guess what, the Skypop plane is going to be a costume

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:08.080
And sure enough, they have this new tie in thing that's the Southwest Air Adventure

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.080
That you can unlock the plane

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.080
So, go play it and unlock that costume

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:25.080
So, well I actually played it and I'm a big fan of costumes

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.080
Nintendo does provide a shit ton of free content for Mario Maker

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.080
So it's hard to be upset

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:34.080
The tie in for the advertisement is a little weird

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.080
But at the same time, wasn't some of the old

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.080
Old at this point, it's not that old

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:43.080
But wasn't some of the first costumes that came out like tie in with Game Center

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:46.080
And some of the Japanese stuff like Famitsu had a mascot

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.080
That sounds cool, people don't really like, damn Southwest Airlines, fuck yeah that's awesome

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:55.080
Yeah right, it's a little weird admittedly but

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:59.080
Like I would take a Burger King costume, can we get the Burger King

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.080
Sneak King, the Sneak King level

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.080
Hell yes

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:08.080
I did not find the advertisement levels to be like in your face offensive

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.080
But that's the thing, even the Mercedes Benz one, it's almost kind of just like a silly

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:18.080
It's not going to get me to think Mercedes Benz, it's been like, okay

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:20.080
I don't know

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.080
We were talking about this a little bit last week with the whole Lightning doing the

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:27.080
Was it Prada, no Louis Vuitton, I can't remember

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.080
Exactly, whoa look at that, effective marketing

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:33.080
You can't even fucker remember which fucking clothing line

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:36.080
We have an email on that, I think we have an email on this, we'll get to that later

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.080
That's so amazing, so effective, great job spending that advertising money

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.080
It was one of those, was it Coach?

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.080
I don't know, it was one of those

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.080
Alright anyhow, the memes that came out of it are priceless

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.080
Anyhow, one more for you guys then we'll get to the classic game of the week

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.080
And that has to do with the term Let's Play

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:57.080
You know Let's Play is a term you usually hear on YouTube like

01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:01.080
Let's play such and such game for, let's play Minecraft for an hour

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.080
Let's play whatever

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:07.080
Well at one point apparently Sony Computer Entertainment America

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.080
Tried to trademark Let's Play and that happened in October

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.080
That Sony actually applied for a trademark on the phrase

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:19.080
Saying quote, electronic transmission and streaming of video games via global and local computer networks

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.080
Streaming of audio, visual and audio-visual material via global and local computer networks

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:30.080
Now interesting because Let's Play, that term wasn't really invented by Sony at all

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.080
That's been around on YouTube for a very long time

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:39.080
So I'm not sure what Sony's trying to do with this except maybe keep it away from Microsoft

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:43.080
You know I thought when I first heard this I was like

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:49.080
Oh, well okay, usually video game consoles have their little slogans that come with it

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:53.080
Like there's, I don't know, there was get in or get out

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.080
Or you know Genesis does what Nintendon't

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.080
I'm trying to think what some of the new ones are

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.080
Is it jump in for Xbox?

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.080
When Playstation had

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:07.080
It just does everything

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:10.080
Oh yeah that's their thing, it just does everything right?

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:15.080
So I thought okay well if Let's Play is like their little slogan, Playstation, Let's Play

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:19.080
Like I was like oh okay, I get that, that doesn't seem seedy at all

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:24.080
Well then if that was the case then yeah they should trademark Playstation Let's Play

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080
That makes sense

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:32.080
But when you hear that the definition says electronic transmission and streaming of video games

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.080
That's not what they were going for

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.080
No that's just them being fucking assholes is what it is

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:40.080
Or maybe they wanted to brand their Twitch area Let's Play

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:44.080
I don't know, I kind of think part of it was to keep the term away from Microsoft maybe

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.080
Especially as a lot of it's open

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.080
Where is it their fucking right to keep that term away from

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.080
It's not theirs to fucking keep away from anybody

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.080
You know what Loki, here's the good news

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.080
It was denied

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.080
The United States Patent and Trademark Office refused Sony's application

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.080
But not for the reason you think

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:08.080
Because of the likelihood of confusion with LP Let's Play

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.080
Which I have never fucking heard of this I don't know what it is

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.080
I don't think it has anything to do with video games

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:20.080
But for whatever reason the patent office said it was a conflict

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.080
And now Sony has six months to make a case for itself and argue against the decision

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.080
But now that this is out there you're probably going to see people file briefs

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:34.080
Probably YouTube or Google is going to get involved saying nope

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.080
I don't understand how you can trademark something that's not your fucking

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.080
Trademarks are really stupid especially when you work in that sense

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080
What are they using this for is what I want to know

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.080
If it's a tagline for their brand then fine

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.080
Then allow them to trademark PlayStation Let's Play or something like that

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.080
But not just Let's Play

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.080
It's too vague

01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.080
I mean it's even like the whole candy and crush shit

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:04.080
Or saga or all that is too vague

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.080
I don't understand especially when the general community

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:14.080
Knows that this has been used before they even had streaming on that console

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.080
I don't even understand how

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.080
But of course the trademark office being fucking retarded doesn't know any better

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.080
So they were just like okay sure

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.080
Dungeon Buster says in chat the trademark office is so broken

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.080
I get the feeling some companies think they can get away with anything

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.080
You know what's funny I googled the LP Let's Play thing

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:36.080
Trying to see what it was and all that I get are results that are with this story

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.080
About the Sony trademark

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.080
But I did get I guess the actual trademark website has it

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:46.080
And it's some company Let's Play of America out of

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.080
I'm probably mispronouncing this horribly

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.080
It's in Georgia

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.080
It's Smirna, Georgia

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.080
And it's entertainment services

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.080
Namely to provide online and offline opportunities for video game enthusiasts

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:02.080
To meet and participate in live video game tournaments

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.080
And on demand console gaming

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.080
So I wonder if it's some type of store

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.080
It might be a video game store

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.080
And do we have these people fucking harassing you

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.080
Harassing YouTubers or anything like that

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.080
No because they're decent

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.080
I mean I assume it's a decent company

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.080
But then you have like these big

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:25.080
Well plus LP Let's Play is like way different

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:28.080
You're not going to confuse that with a YouTuber

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:32.080
Especially if this is what I think it is and it's some type of store

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.080
Anyway

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080
I'm sure there is someone

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.080
We should be thanking them right now because it's because of them

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.080
That little company in Smirna that Sony got denied

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.080
No I don't think it's because of them at all

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.080
It's because the trademark office is just kind of stupid

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.080
And so they're like people are going to confuse that

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.080
No one even knows what that fucking company is

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.080
No one's going to confuse that at all

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.080
I mean like let's see here

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:01.080
I'm just curious I'm going to type in Let's Play into Google

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:05.080
Let's see if we get a nice Wikipedia article or something like that

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:09.080
Oh hey look here's a Wikipedia article about Let's Play

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:12.080
And let's see if we have like the history

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:15.080
If like it figured out where that came from

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:19.080
I'm sure that they know who

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.080
Let's see here

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.080
I was just wondering if they had an idea of who coined the phrase

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.080
I have this weird feeling

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.080
Sony is going to very like out of left field

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.080
And very like discreetly just kind of say

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.080
We were only getting it to protect the term

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.080
Oh fuck them

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.080
I think that's what's going to happen

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.080
They're going to come out and say

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.080
We were only getting it so that nobody else could have it

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.080
Into which I say oh fuck you

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.080
No one asks you to fucking do this

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.080
I don't fucking believe you for a second

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.080
Alright

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.080
There's many people in the chat tonight that are saying

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.080
I've missed Loki rants

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.080
I killed your dog so no one else could kill your dog

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.080
Stop it

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.080
I protected him

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.080
He won't die anymore

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.080
He's already dead

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.080
You're awful

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.080
Alright we have got to go back to a simpler time

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.080
Let's go back to a simpler time

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.080
When you couldn't look up trademarks online

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.080
We're going to get to the classic game of the week

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.080
But before I get to the cutesy little music that goes with that

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.080
I have to introduce a special guest to the show tonight

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.080
Filling in for the one and only Dark Soccer tonight

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:23.080
Say hello everybody in studio again is Alan

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.080
Hi

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.080
Hi Alan how you doing?

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.080
Good

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.080
Thanks for being on the show

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.080
I'm sorry you couldn't be here from the beginning tonight

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.080
But I know you had work and you got to pay the bills and all that

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:31.080
So it's important

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:32.080
Yeah

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.080
But you're here now

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.080
Yes

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.080
Thanks for being here

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.080
You're welcome

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.080
Ingress and Skyrim

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.080
Yeah

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.080
And I logged into 14 a couple nights ago for like 10 minutes

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.080
You didn't see

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.080
I did it behind your back because you would have lost your mind

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.080
Run a dungeon with me

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:50.080
You've been playing a lot of Skyrim and I kind of tease you about it

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:54.080
What's your MO for playing so much Skyrim these days?

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.080
Well I hadn't touched it in two years

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:01.080
And I sort of looked up the mods for it

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.080
Because you know Fallout 4 came out

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.080
And basically all of the Bethesda mod community is now modding for that

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.080
Even though the creator dev kit hasn't been released for it yet

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.080
There's still like dozens and hundreds of mods

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.080
So I was like what has been put out for Skyrim

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:23.080
In the two plus years that I have literally been on media blackout for it

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.080
And there's like hundreds of stuff

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:33.080
Like there's campaigns, quests, NPCs, armory skins, texture reskins, lighting

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.080
And this is much more than just the Steam workshop right?

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080
Oh yeah no no no this is

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:40.080
Oh that's child's play

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.080
Select all

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.080
Add

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.080
Yeah

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.080
He has this whole little thing and I always confuse it for his work

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.080
Because it looks so similar

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:51.080
I use a mod manager because I run so many mods that you really

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.080
Like if you just unzip stuff and dump it into the Skyrim install directory by the 30th mod

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.080
It's like oh I don't like this or it crashes my game

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.080
You're not removing that shit by yourself

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:07.080
By picking out random ass texture files you need an application to sort of figure out what you're overriding

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.080
But this Skyrim train has been holding you for a good long while now

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.080
Like I feel like you got back into Skyrim like all the way back in October or November and you're still going

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:20.080
Yeah I think yeah it was around November

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.080
Before Thanksgiving

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.080
So do you think you'll ever get on the Fallout 4 bandwagon?

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:33.080
I'm waiting for some of the official Bethesda patches to come out just because the physics engine is amazing

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:39.080
It's an incredible open world and it's broken as shit and there's like quest breaking bugs everywhere and some people never see them

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:43.080
It's just Bethesda though that's how their games are

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.080
Like there's this unofficial

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:51.080
Maybe Bethesda should try to get the trademark for let's break or let's patch

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.080
What are you guys thinking?

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:59.080
There's this unofficial Skyrim patch that was done by the modding community that doesn't need like a script extender

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.080
Or any of the weird stuff that you have to get the more advanced mods to run

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.080
And it fixes like hundreds of legitimate Bethesda bugs that they never got to

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.080
Like if you accidentally

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:15.080
Like if you forget to take an optional treasure item from a thief's quest thing and you finish the quest

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:21.080
Then you go back in and it'll disappear the unofficial Skyrim patch puts it there so that oh yeah I forgot to steal this

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:27.080
Just weird stuff that would break or disappear that Bethesda themselves never got to

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:37.080
So even if you have no interest in modding and you're playing on PC just getting that unofficial Skyrim patch fixes like hundreds of tiny little issues

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.080
I would still love them to bring Skyrim to Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:46.080
I was so disappointed was it like the last E3 when they had like you know their show the screenshots and everything

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:49.080
And then one of it was Skyrim like fuck yes Skyrim HD

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.080
And then nope

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.080
Alright well before we get to the classic game which you're here to fill in for Dark Soccer tonight

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.080
Yes

01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:00.080
Quickly like 30 second opinions on some of the stories we talked about already

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:07.080
Oculus Rift for $599 will you let your boyfriend Rob Roberts buy that

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.080
Yes $600

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.080
You can have one

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.080
Really?

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.080
Yeah with the Powerball Bunny you're gonna win

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.080
Would you get one for $600?

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.080
I'd share yours I wouldn't get one

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.080
You'd push me to buy it and then reap the benefits of that I get it

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.080
Yes

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.080
That's fine

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:32.080
Since you do a lot of PC gaming I'm sure you are experienced with the crack I mean not that you pirate games but the cracking community

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.080
I mean you know I'm sure you've been into it a lot of them

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.080
Saying now that games are too hard to crack do you think that finally pirates may be beaten

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:51.080
Well I mean I know that companies have caught shit for it in the past but Ubisoft and Sony and some other PC things would do the whole weird rootkit

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:59.080
Stuff where you have to go into your hosts file and redirect the IP address that sniffs if you have a license or not and point it to you know a dead IP

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.080
All this weird or just like unplug the internet and play this game without the internet

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:17.080
Which is funny that people will do that like they're willing to forego their entire internet connection to play a game but then when Diablo 3 for PC says you need an internet connection to play this people lose their mind

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:24.080
But you'll turn it off to pirate it but you don't want it on when you pay for it like okay

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:29.080
Alright and lastly on a scale of 1 to 10 how excited would you be for a Sonic Adventure 3

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.080
I don't care about Sonic

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.080
So 1

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:44.080
Yeah I mean if it's good great but even what's the Sonic one that came out in the last 3 or 4 years that actually was really good

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.080
Generations

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.080
What's the one that came out last year that was kind of bad colors or no

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:55.080
I think that was the Wii U one last year there was Sonic 4 episode 1 and 2 was kind of crap

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.080
Yeah

01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:03.080
The Sonic game that was really good was the Sonic Transformed Racing was a good Sonic game

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:05.080
You actually played that

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:07.080
It was a kart racer but

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.080
Sonic Lost World as well

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.080
Was it Sonic Boom?

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.080
What was the one that has the cartoon that goes with it?

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.080
Isn't that it?

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.080
That's Sonic Boom

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:21.080
Rise of Lyric

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.080
More shitty friends

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.080
Let's go back to a more classic time when Sonic didn't have any friends

01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.080
In fact I don't think Sonic was even out yet

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.080
I think this game predates Sonic or it's around the same time

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.080
Around the same time

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:43.080
This time Alan is going to step into not the gaming vault but his deep PC gaming archive

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.080
And find a game that he thinks hey you guys should check this game out

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.080
And I believe you can because it's on a lot of different modern platforms

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.080
It's the classic game of the week

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.080
Alan what is tonight's classic game of the week?

01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:00.080
In the states in its initial release it was called Out of This World

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.080
But most of us now know it as Another World

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:07.080
And this game has a lot of ambient sound to it

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:10.080
So there's a little bit of intro music here in the beginning

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.080
But that's about all you're going to get that's just going to be ambient music

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.080
So take it away Alan

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:18.080
So this game came out I believe the first systems

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.080
The systems that were actually made for originally were the Amiga and Atari ST

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:25.080
Which came out in 1991

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.080
Since then this game has been released on

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:35.080
Amiga, Android, Apple IIGS, Atari Jaguar, Atari ST, Blackberry 10, Game Boy Advance

01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:43.080
iOS, Linux, MacOS, Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS, Nintendo 3DS, OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:47.080
Whoa sorry those beeps were really loud I apologize

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:50.080
It was very loud in contrast to the music I'll turn that down a little bit sorry guys

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:57.080
PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Sega CD, Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo, Symbian, Tapwave Zodiac

01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.080
We're getting into platforms I've never even heard of these before

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:05.080
The Wii U, Windows Mobile, Xbox One, and the 3DO

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:09.080
So much like Myst and Half Life

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:12.080
This game is both iconic and prolific

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.080
It was released everywhere

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:20.080
It was developed and released by Delphine Software

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:26.080
Did the development and Interplay Entertainment did the console ports

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:34.080
Publishers were Delphine Software, US Gold, Interplay Entertainment, and Virgin Interactive did the bulk of them

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.080
This game was considered revolutionary

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:43.080
Because in 1991 games were entirely sprite based

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.080
3D wasn't really a tangible thing yet

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:50.080
We still had a few years to go before we got to Star Fox and the FX chip and all that

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:57.080
And this was also before the big adventure and RPG craze of the mid and late 90s

01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:01.080
Of the full motion video with the live actor

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:07.080
But they interacted with sprites, but there were real people like Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest, all that stuff

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:15.080
So the thing that was really ahead of its time about Another World was the developer

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:19.080
Last name is French, I think it's Chihai

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:30.080
Eric Chihai, what he did is he used motion capture and the cool 3D polygons that were possible on the Amiga system

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:36.080
And he did 2D cell sprites over it, so he did a rotoscoping effect

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:45.080
So the motion capture, even though it's flat 2D and looks very crude, it looks life like

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:50.080
For anyone that remembers the Lord of the Ring movies that came out

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.080
I think the Baskin one that came out in the 80s that had rotoscoping

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.080
It's very much that effect where you can see that it's something that's drawn over a 3D model

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:07.080
Very cinematic, the game is about a physicist or whatever working on his particle accelerator

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:11.080
It gets struck by lightning and he is teleported to another world

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:17.080
This game is very frantic, when you are teleported to the alien world

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.080
You are underwater and you are actively drowning

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.080
So if you do not press up on the D-pad first thing, you will die straight up

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.080
Just the game, good luck and then you die

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:32.080
As soon as you climb out of the pool, a monster chases you, you get captured by an alien race

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:38.080
It's kind of the adventure game equivalent of that movie Run Lola Run which takes place in real time

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.080
That movie is so badass

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:48.080
Yeah, so Run Lola Run, the first five minutes is her basically finding out that a drug dealer is going to kill her boyfriend unless she goes and gets money

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:53.080
So the movie takes place in real time where she's just running and this game is kind of like that

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:58.080
If you stand still, you're probably going to die and you will die a lot

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:09.080
One of the great things about Another World is that you're transported to this alien planet

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.080
No one speaks English, you have no idea what's happening to you, why these guards are after you

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.080
Aside from the fact that you're a weird pink human looking dude

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:23.080
There's really no story aside from just run, run, run and live

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:28.080
And the resolution or the ending is actually very bittersweet, it's not even clear

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:37.080
This is a bit of a spoiler, you're not dead but you get injured very badly and the game ends on that note

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.080
So it's kind of a downer

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:46.080
It has lots of platforming and timing elements

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:50.080
The controls are a bit weird, they're hard to get used to at first

01:49:52.080 --> 01:50:01.080
And then there's a ray gun that you get where you press hold to, press second level charge is to do a shield which is very important

01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:04.080
And then third level is to break through walls

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:10.080
And there's a sequence where you have to like break a dam where all this water flows through and you have to make sure you don't drown

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.080
And it'll take you like 20 or 30 attempts to get through that part

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:22.080
For people who have it completely memorized and can one shot the entire game from start to finish

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:27.080
It's about 15 minutes long, maybe upwards of 20

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.080
So the full experience is learning how to get through everything

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.080
If you can just blitz through the game easily 30 minutes or less

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:44.080
It's going to be an intense 30 minutes or 20 minutes where you're convinced at any moment you're going to die and have to start over from the start of that action sequence

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:48.080
But yeah, very short game once you learn the ins and outs of it

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.080
Kind of an appropriate game to follow up a week of awesome games done quick

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:57.080
Because that was kind of part of the charm of it was learning how to speed run it basically

01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:00.080
Some comments from our chat, also Alan if I could

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.080
I don't have access to chat right now so thank you

01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.080
Dungeon Buster in Chat says if people thought the new Tomb Raider had gruesome death scenes another world beat them to it

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.080
Yes

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:13.080
Tigerclaw says there was a sequel out of this world that came out on the Sega CD and you played as the alien

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:16.080
Yes, the developer

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:23.080
Because one of the things when you get captured is you have this alien friend who is in the cell with you

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:27.080
And you break out and you sort of help him in the background and he helps you

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:32.080
You don't really know what his deal is because again there's no explanation

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.080
You just have to run to survive

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:41.080
So there's this alien dude who ultimately carries you away from this horrible city that you've been trying not to get shot up in

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:47.080
He puts you on a pterodactyl and flies you away and you're like critically possibly mortally injured

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:53.080
His name according to Interplay who I think developed the sequel called Heart of the Alien

01:51:54.080 --> 01:52:00.080
Is unofficially or officially named Buddy but my friend Rob and I used to call him Marchubo

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:07.080
Because when you wake up in the cell and you break out of the cell and you kill the guard he puts his hand on his shoulder

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:13.080
And this very weird sort of highly compressed audio of him goes Marchubo

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:18.080
That's his like greeting to you so that was what we called him

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.080
The sequel

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:32.080
Originally Eric the developer Chihai said that the same exact scenario of the first game just from Buddy's point of view

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:39.080
Is what he wanted the sequel to be but ultimately it takes place right after Another World ends

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:46.080
Where you take the scientist guy and you lay him down and then you start going through like your tribe or your village or whatever

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.080
And then it's the same basically more of the same lots of running to live and survive

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:57.080
Way more rotoscoped motion capture in the sequel as well some of it is done very well and looks great

01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:59.080
A lot of it is kind of bad

01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:09.080
Only released for the Sega CD but if you Google Heart of the Alien Sourceforge it's been ported to PC I think for free

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:15.080
Like it's not even on good old games I think you can just download and play it and I didn't know that until I looked up the information for this

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:22.080
So yeah if you want to check out the sequel just to see how good or bad it was and you have a PC you can just get it

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:25.080
And Tiger class saying the sequel explains what happens to the human so

01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.080
Yes and there is a big spoiler there which I will not say

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.080
Alright

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:36.080
So this is one of those things where I've only been able to pick the classic game of the week four or five times

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:44.080
I know I did the Oracle of Ages and Seasons for the Gameboy Advance the Zelda thing that I think Capcom or a branch of Capcom developed those

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:54.080
And lots of King's Quest games but when I saw that a game that was this ahead of its time and really kind of showed you know as far as

01:53:54.080 --> 01:54:02.080
Cinematic like you know visual narratives without expository you know there is no speech really no text

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:08.080
But you are definitely invested in these characters because you want dude to live

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:15.080
It was really ahead of its time and when I saw on the wiki that that was not represented yet on classic game of the week so I figured it was a no brainer

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:20.080
No I think that's a great choice so there it is your classic game of the week another world

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:33.080
You can get it on Steam I think they did a 20 or 25 year no it was 2008 so I think it would have been a 15 year remake where they did like HD backgrounds

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:42.080
And they you know better higher sampling of audio so you can get it on Steam I think it's one of those games that goes on sale for like a buck 97

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:47.080
So if you've never played this and you have a controller I would not play this with a keyboard definitely check out another world

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:56.080
Alright thank you Alan great choice and again very landmark because it was in that era of sprite games but really started

01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:01.080
It really showed what 3D was going to look like and polygons

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:07.080
Excellent you're being commended by the chat room there for your choice there tonight even if you didn't pick Halo

01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:13.080
But we'll just have to do that another time when Jamie's not here and then nobody can tell her about it because we will all die

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:19.080
Alright anyway all kidding aside let's take a quick break we have plenty more show to come

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:24.080
Alan are you going to join us for the second half of the show since you're all done now are you going to answer emails take calls with us or

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.080
No I can do that I just wanted to do something work related really quickly during the break

01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:33.080
Okay sounds good so Alan will be back for part B Loki and myself here with you to talk some more news

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:42.080
We're going to talk about potentially a Watch Dogs 2 next year and then we're going to talk about you know what it's a Half Life 3 story

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:53.080
But Half Life 3 not confirmed in fact it's a very interesting story you'll just have to stay tuned we'll talk about it when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:09.080
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 627th episode for this January the 10th of 2016

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:16.080
Myself and Loki here in studio with special guest Alan who I think he ran out to respond to some chat room comments from his own computer

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:25.080
He'll be back in studio here in a moment not with us tonight Dark Sakura but you know you can't feel too bad for her because she's at Disneyland right now

01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:32.080
Having a blast probably riding Hyperspace Mountain over and over again she'll be back next week I'm sure to tell us all about it

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:39.080
Although actually she's probably doing her bucket of meat dinner right now because I'm sure they made reservations and Victoria she goes to Disneyland so much

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:45.080
Yeah she knows all the employees there it's the restaurant's last hurrah today because they're bulldozing it to make

01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:46.080
Which one?

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:52.080
It's called Bucket I don't it's the Big Thunder Ranch I think is what it's called but everybody calls it Bucket of Meat because you know what you order there?

01:56:52.080 --> 01:57:01.080
Buckets full of meat I know right Loki see and you didn't want to go to Disneyland oh if all I had to do is be like well yeah Loki there's teacups but there's also endless buckets of meat

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.080
But now they have been bulldozed or will be bulldozed to make room for charger

01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:10.080
It's so hard to find like food there because like all the other places serve the same crap it's just like garbage

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:16.080
Disney has some pretty awesome dining but you do have to be willing to pay the higher dollar for it but I'm telling you that

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:27.080
Karthay Circle that's a California adventure seriously one of the best restaurants I've eaten at period and Alan and I will splurge once in a while and eat at fine dining restaurants

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:35.080
You know especially for events like anniversary and so forth and that Karthay Circle is one of the very very best we've ever been to and it was worth it

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:41.080
In fact funny enough I guess transition Alan and I actually celebrated our six year anniversary this week

01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:42.080
Congratulations

01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:43.080
Thank you very much

01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:56.080
And you know not to be too embarrassing on my little podcast but Alan has been a huge supporter of this show and like not a lot of partners would understand the commitment something like this takes

01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:00.080
But Alan not only understands that but here he is participating in that

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:01.080
He can't shut me up

01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:08.080
That's part of it but I'm just he loves to come on here and point out when I'm wrong that's really the flip of it

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:14.080
But no I'm extremely lucky to have a support like that so I'm not going to get too gushy but a little bit and so there you go

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:18.080
But this week we went to for the very first time you want to tell the listeners about this real quick?

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:24.080
We went to a restaurant that does at your table fondue for every course

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:39.080
It's kind of scary because the main like they give you meat that's seasoned and marinated and prepared and you have like the big kettle or fondue pot as it will that's on a heat thing

01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:51.080
And it's boiling oil basically so you put the meat there's like dipping batter like tempura so you take your skewer and you take your piece of like what you had duck and you swirl it in the thing and you have to

01:58:52.080 --> 01:59:00.080
We had our phones out for stopwatch because you want to cook it for like two minutes but you don't want to overdo it and burn it but you don't want to eat raw meat and get sick

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:13.080
So there's like a spatter risk element to it so it's kind of low key stressful maybe more stressful but the food once you put it like you can't eat it off the skewer because you'll burn your mouth and look like you have herpes

01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:25.080
But you take it off the skewer and then you pop the filet mignon or the sirloin or the whatever and it is so good it's one of the best meals I've ever had it's just weird

01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:28.080
I was dealing with like a pot of scalding disfiguring oil

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:39.080
That dinner was Friday night and I'm still full like I had we went to another restaurant today with my just honest aside with my parents my sister my sister was just coincidentally in town today so we all went out for like brunch today

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:46.080
And I ordered a soup and salad how often does that happen where Rob gets a soup and salad but I was still I'm like still full for

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:47.080
I was like Benihana's

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:51.080
That's like you have to prepare for that but like not eating for a day

01:59:51.080 --> 02:00:02.080
Anyway so the melting pot was funny but yes boiling oil and in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com YYR says weren't there Disney villains or cartoon villains who threatened to boil someone in oil

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:10.080
Yes I think that's a common threat and that's of serious business like they have all these contraptions to take the boiling oil away safety's huge over there obviously

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:16.080
Eventually you know you've got bits of batter and spice and food grease and the oil so it gets dirty

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.080
It's like a deep fryer anyone who's worked in fast food knows the deep fryer gets nasty

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:30.080
And then also the oil itself will scald past a certain point it starts to stink and smoke but you can't have a waiter with like you know oven mitt

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:41.080
Take it off your table and tra la la back to the kitchen because all I have to do is roll their ankle and oh my god just like death everywhere so they have this

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:55.080
Vice that goes under the pot and then there's a thing that they then has a big crank or a handle that like goes kachunk and it like screws into the opening of the pot and like secures it and they take this whole apparatus away

02:00:55.080 --> 02:01:02.080
So it's like hot grease containment control like in Monsters Inc. It's this big ritual

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:08.080
Alright we gotta get back to games we can talk about food all night believe me we could we gotta get back to games what

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:09.080
That dessert right

02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:16.080
Oh my god chocolate fondue yeah oh my god marshmallow and broken oreos oh my god I'm gonna I'm gonna shit just thinking about it alright

02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:21.080
No seriously though we gotta get back to some gaming news rapid fire news time Loki

02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:32.080
Alright so Shovel Knight is gonna be getting the amiibo soon and also they're saying though that what's kind of unique about this is you can actually read it through the packaging

02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:40.080
So if you don't want to take that out you can just leave it in its box and play the game based on that

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:46.080
They really should do that with all the amiibos I guess they're worried that people are gonna like copy them or something I don't know

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:52.080
I had no idea about that but I guess and Shane was telling me about this I did get my Shovel Knight amiibo because I know you all care

02:01:52.080 --> 02:02:00.080
But I guess another company made those that particular amiibo was made by the people that did the infinity figures it was not the usual amiibo makers

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:08.080
So that's why some things are a little different and even the figure itself looks a little different from the other amiibo so just interesting

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:11.080
Does it unlock a character in Mario Maker?

02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:20.080
I don't know about Mario Maker I don't think so I just know about the co-op mode in actual Shovel Knight itself although I haven't used it yet

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:24.080
Because Alan won't play those games with me because he's too busy in Skyrim

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:36.080
Speaking of Skyrim one of the I think more popular mods or funny mods that I've seen was the mod that turned all the dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.080
Oh yeah!

02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:40.080
Oh yeah!

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:56.080
So now that we have Fallout 4 it is only fit that we have a sequel to that said mod now with the mod that will turn or they call it the Macho Claws mod it will turn the death claws into Macho Man Randy Savage

02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.080
Oh yeah!

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:04.080
And it's as hilarious as the previous mod so you can check that out

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.080
Do you run on Skyrim?

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:08.080
I do have a dragon mod but no I don't there are some

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.080
Yours just makes the dragon naked or something right?

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:12.080
No

02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:16.080
It does reskin them so they're all purpley and look different but it also adds a new

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.080
So they look like Spyro?

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:22.080
No well there is a My Little Pony dragon mod where it looks like

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.080
Or Thomas the Tank Engine that's like

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.080
Yeah Thomas the Tank Engine is yeah

02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.080
That's the kind of stuff I would play Skyrim with

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:36.080
That's what I wanted like I wanted to have like a play through of Skyrim that was just random mods like just like you take a bunch of mods and how somehow randomize everything into it

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:44.080
The swearing crabs that have the cigar and the top hat and they say fuck you when you get close to them

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:56.080
That's the kind of shit I want in Skyrim can we maybe for like a future like let's play before Sony trademarks that term maybe you could help me load up Skyrim with a bunch of like dipshit mods and then I could play that as a let's play

02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:00.080
Oh like the rainbow gun or something that makes people blow up

02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:02.080
The dubstep gun from Saints Row that's always awesome

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:04.080
Alright back to news

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:18.080
Alright anyways speaking of mods there is yet another mod coming out this time for Grand Theft Auto 5 and what's kind of cool about this one is it's basically kind of creating it's almost like Watch Dogs

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:22.080
So they have the Watch Dogs hacking system and they put it into Grand Theft Auto 4

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:30.080
So you can use your cell phone to you know mess with the different like stop lights they had cars you can make cars like accelerate uncontrollably

02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:38.080
You can explode fire hydrants a bunch of different hacking features and it looks pretty awesome from like the screenshots I've seen in the video

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:46.080
So definitely something worth checking out if you have Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC it's the Watch Dogs hack script they call it

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:56.080
But definitely something I would love to check out if it would run on my PC and if I had Grand Theft Auto 5 on my PC which I don't

02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:02.080
Alright well for those of you that were really hoping and praying that maybe there would be more coming to Smash Brothers on 3DS and Wii U

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:10.080
Nope Bayonetta really is going to be the end of it and we know this because Masahiro Sakurai has confirmed he's moving on to another project

02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:16.080
That was confirmed in the latest edition of Weekly Famitsu and of course he's not going to tell you what that project is

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:23.080
He just says I want to enjoy every day like it's Sunday however that doesn't mean the next job hasn't been decided

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:31.080
So that was what the in response to a question about 2016 ambitions and plans so who knows that could be Super Smash Brothers NX

02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:36.080
But also keep in mind he has done more than that there was the Kid Icarus reboot so you never know

02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:43.080
I think when you're Masahiro Sakurai and you're responsible for a huge franchise like that you get to make other games you want to make

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:49.080
I think he gets to do other stuff and SHO 100 Matt in chat over at live.vlognetwork.com says let the man do something else

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:57.080
And I agree I think you could safely turn over Smash Brothers to maybe another team that's maybe worked under Sakurai and let him go do something else

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:04.080
Alright if you would like to experience some classic Virtual Console games on the Wii U

02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:09.080
It's pretty cool a little twist on the usual Wii U Virtual Console fare

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:17.080
These are all Zapper games that came out now we already had Duck Hunt available on the Virtual Console

02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:25.080
But this last week gave us a better light gun game in the form of Hogan's Alley is now available for the Wii U Virtual Console

02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:31.080
So are these like using the Wii Zapper still or are they using just like you tap the screen or something like that?

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.080
You just use the regular Wiimote

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:36.080
That's what I meant like you use the Wii Remote

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:38.080
Yep that's how you do it you use the Wii Remote to do it

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:44.080
And I thought there was a way you can actually use the Wii Remote with the gamepad because I've seen that happen on Metroid Prime

02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:47.080
And that gamepad actually has a little infrared sensor built into it

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:50.080
And you don't look totally stupid doing that

02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:52.080
Yeah so you can do that

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:59.080
Let's see also yeah and it says that they have off TV play so I would think you'd just be able to use the stylus

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:01.080
But maybe that makes it too easy I don't know

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:07.080
But anyway also available Wild Gunman which is kind of super basic that's just a quick draw game there's really nothing to that game

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:13.080
But then also you might remember the Adventures of Bayou Billy this was a game that was pretty difficult that was like half platformer

02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:17.080
Then half like light gun game it had certain light gun stages in it

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:22.080
And if you didn't have the light gun you had to use the good old moving the cursor around the screen and hitting the trigger

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:26.080
And it was pretty much impossible if you didn't have the light gun in order to beat Bayou Billy

02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:29.080
So you can try for yourself on Virtual Console

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:33.080
Last week we talked a bit about Final Fantasy 9 coming out for the PC

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:40.080
And now the game's official Steam page is available and there are some bells and whistles that you can expect in the Final Fantasy 9 remake

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:44.080
And that is you'll be able to turn off random encounters

02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:50.080
That's pretty cool you could actually just turn off the random encounters and you could just play through the game for the story

02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:58.080
And then I suppose you could take on the bosses you might have to get really creative to beat them without the experience from the trash mobs

02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:03.080
But I know there are some people that are playing through Final Fantasy 7 with the whole no encounter thing in place

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:08.080
And then using the other cheats to come with the game to push through it just to experience the story

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:15.080
And I'm sure some people will be doing that as well with Final Fantasy 9 which is currently imminent basically on Steam

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:17.080
You see the page there for it

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:22.080
Alright let's take a chance on FOOGLE

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:27.080
We're gonna take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together you get FOOGLE

02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:42.080
And every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we do like to ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:50.080
And then also on Google Plus which is still around for you non-facebook people that's google.com slash plus orange lounge radio

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:56.080
And the question we asked tonight has to do with the story that we had earlier about the Mario Maker DLC

02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:04.080
Because remember we talked about that Southwest had actually sponsored that so we wanted to ask our listeners this week

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:12.080
What costume would you put in Super Mario Maker and for fun who do you think should sponsor the costume?

02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:15.080
Alan I'd be very curious to hear your answer in a minute

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:18.080
But in the meantime let's get to some of the chatters answers over on Facebook

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:24.080
Andy R says I don't know what costume but clearly Red Bull has to sponsor something right?

02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.080
That's all they do these days yet somehow they still sell that disgusting drink

02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:29.080
Hey

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.080
That Loki lives on

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:38.080
Degenerate Johnny says for obvious reasons I would want to see Mario in N7 armor from Mass Effect

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:46.080
As for sponsors as much as I would love to see the N7 armor sponsored by Jagermeister it'll most likely be sponsored by EA

02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:53.080
Not to be a buzzkill Degenerate Johnny because I love that idea but EA and Wii U they don't really get along anymore

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.080
That was a bad breakup

02:09:55.080 --> 02:10:02.080
How about Redertainment is up next on Facebook saying a red star power up brought to you by Heineken

02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:04.080
Because there's a red star in the Heineken logo

02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:08.080
Okay, maybe not how about wood Mario brought to you by Viagra

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:11.080
Because never mind I won't explain it

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:16.080
As Joe and Hunter Matt says I'm gonna rehash that ridiculous Apple is buying Nintendo rumor and say Apple

02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:21.080
Mario's costume would feature a black turtleneck and jeans to resemble Steve Jobs

02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.080
Luigi would also have a Tim Cook costume

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:28.080
Hopefully the costume pack won't bend the game or brick when you update the OS

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:31.080
And that's what the little sassy colon P face so

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:40.080
Dark Tetsuya last on Facebook saying spam Hormel foods the level would just be a bunch of enemy stars and items spam

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:45.080
Because obviously and the costume of course would be a little blue spam can

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.080
These ideas are so silly I love it

02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:58.080
Let's try going over to Google Plus and check out some of the answers on Google Plus if I can actually make

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:03.080
The only problem is man after I start to install some of these new things I got to do on the computer

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:05.080
Some of my stuff is running slower

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:10.080
Alan need you to scrub down this computer for me do your fix it magic

02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:15.080
Because that's what you do you fix computers right and install shoutcast and install one amp

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:24.080
No all right a couple answers on Google Plus tonight tech 2030 saying a power up that turns you into baby Mario

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:26.080
Brought to you by Pampers

02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:29.080
That's funny I like that one that's a good one

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:36.080
And then lastly from Prince Peach Fuzz presenting Ron Jeremy Mario from the guys at Pornhub

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:39.080
There it is Google question of the week

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:43.080
Alan did you think one what's a costume you'd like to see and who would it be sponsored by

02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:44.080
I have two

02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:52.080
Captain Falcon spin sponsored by Kleenex to wipe your tears because there's never going to be an F-Zero game again

02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.080
Ass

02:11:54.080 --> 02:12:06.080
And then the slime drop from Dragon's Quest the iconic little slime and that would be brought to you by Sudafed to stop post nasal drip

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:12.080
Those are some good answers see you're funny he's funny you guys he's really funny all right

02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:18.080
SSG100 Matt in chat says low blow Alan on the F-Zero reference low blow

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:24.080
I think they should have Kool-Aid man sponsored by Kool-Aid because you can just bash right through walls

02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:28.080
Just run straight through the walls there's nothing

02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:33.080
You guys are far more creative than I would be that's for sure thank you guys for answering the Fugu question of the week

02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.080
Be sure to follow us on Facebook and Google Plus so you can answer the question next week

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:43.080
I usually post it the day of the show just because the way those algorithms work I'm likely to keep that post

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:50.080
I'm just disappointed that any of the costumes that they have don't change the gameplay like the you know that Super Mario crossover thing did

02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.080
You know that was a little bit more interesting

02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:54.080
I might be asking a lot of Nintendo

02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:57.080
Oh god forbid you put some fucking effort into your game

02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:03.080
Now hold up hold up Super Mario maker in my opinion was the best game they released last year so they took a lot of effort Logan

02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:11.080
Well and okay it's the best game that they released last year that's not saying much they could have put more effort into it

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:15.080
PC people put more effort into it I just don't understand why they couldn't do that

02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:17.080
That PC thing is a little embarrassing

02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:22.080
Alright anyhow did that get shut down yet we didn't follow up on that

02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:25.080
Actually no you got to do the next story Logie

02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:28.080
It's on the internet so it's you know it's probably not going anywhere

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:30.080
Alan did you want to throw something out there before we move on

02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:36.080
I did have a question so I know that you make sure that you scan all of your amiibos into Mario maker

02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:42.080
But don't you have like 30 now at this point that still need to be scanned into a Yoshi yarn party or whatever

02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:46.080
Yeah I probably need to catch up on Yoshi yarn but I did scan them all into Mario maker

02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:49.080
The only one I haven't even tried is Shovel Knight but I really don't think he's there

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:50.080
Yeah

02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:54.080
But I'm caught up like when I got Dedede and all those other newer ones that I got

02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:57.080
Actually I don't know if I did Palutena

02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:59.080
Cuz I just got that

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.080
Cuz you get through your four a week and then you'll be like okay I'm all caught up and then I'll be like did you scan in these four

02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.080
Shut up

02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:07.080
Until now

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:12.080
I really am in it for the figures more than I am the scanning in the games

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.080
Cuz I mean when was the last time I made a Mario level it's been a while

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:19.080
I actually started working on one but I kinda I don't know I didn't make it

02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:22.080
My Mario levels still get played though I'm really impressed

02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:29.080
I'm gonna work with Dark Tetsuya and find the episode of you originally hearing about the amiibo and shitting all over him and I'm gonna make it my ringtone

02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:32.080
Please do

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.080
Please that's how it's lasted six years

02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:37.080
You also get him to start his vog jam game as well

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.080
Oh fuck off read the next story

02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:42.080
So anyways

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:46.080
Let's talk a little bit about how there's not gonna be Assassin's Creed game next year

02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.080
Well geez

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:51.080
That's disappointing I suppose

02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:55.080
Apparently though the next game they're gonna be doing is gonna be set in Egypt

02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.080
But it's not gonna be coming out next year

02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:03.080
Because they're taking some time to make the game better since I think the last one that came out was fucking a mess

02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:08.080
Maybe they decided that the yearly release wasn't really in their best interest

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.080
Actually the last one was supposedly pretty decent

02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.080
It was the one to, Assassin's Creed Unity was the one that was a hot mess

02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:18.080
I thought syndicate was bad too but maybe not maybe it wasn't as bad but

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:20.080
Unity was a mess

02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:24.080
So but taking more time to make your game better not a bad thing at all

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:26.080
Not a bad thing at all

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:32.080
Take the time to make it right put it in the oven a little while longer let it cook in the boiling oil a little while longer

02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:37.080
Watch Dogs 2 apparently a real thing and apparently coming this year

02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:40.080
This time though it will be set in San Francisco

02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:43.080
Which good that'll be a city I know the layout of a lot better than Chicago

02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:45.080
So maybe I'll get to find

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:48.080
Maybe I will play Watch Dogs 1 before that time

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:54.080
Because I still have that from when I bought my Playstation 4 last year and I still have not played that game

02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:00.080
Well when the sequel is about to come out the original will be like bargain basement prices if you still haven't caught up

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:06.080
So who knows what platforms it will be out on because you know Watch Dogs came out for Wii U

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:12.080
But kind of didn't do so hot I mean the fact that it took so long after the other platforms

02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:17.080
Probably had something to do with that so we don't know if it'll be on the NX or if it'll be a PS4, Xbox One thing

02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:24.080
We will see and that might there might they're saying that could be what they do instead of Assassin's Creed

02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.080
That makes sense

02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:31.080
Yeah that could be their big push this year in lieu of no Assassin's Creed

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:35.080
Hopefully it won't be as delayed as Watch Dogs 1 was

02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:41.080
We thought while we are joined by Alan tonight we'd let him do a story so Alan what do you have for us?

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:50.080
I see you giving me this one story to report on hearts which I didn't even hear about because I don't go on Twitter

02:16:51.080 --> 02:17:02.080
So Half-Life is a game that I'm a huge fan of and we've been waiting nine eight or nine years for an announcement of Half-Life 3

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:10.080
Since Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was released and of course it does exist in some form in a binder of you know proof of concept art

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:15.080
And little post-it notes of scripty bits in under Gabe Newell's bed

02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:17.080
It exists only in Gabe's dreams

02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:29.080
Yes so the main writer for that is a he had I think at least two or three novels published before he teamed up with Gabe Newell to do Half-Life way back in like 1996

02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:40.080
Mark Laidlaw and there is a guy who works for BioWare under Dragon Age who I believe is Mike Laidlaw and I get them confused constantly

02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:46.080
They're not allowed to have such similar names but Mark Laidlaw was the co-creator and sole writer of Half-Life

02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:54.080
He knows who the G-Man is in relation to Gordon he knows who G-Man's employers are he knows what the combines are allegedly

02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:57.080
He knows where the fuck Half-Life 3 is

02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:06.080
Yeah he's probably written and rewritten a script five times over in the last ten years for that game and they haven't touched it

02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:18.080
So someone from Reddit emailed him or reached out to him in some way basically saying like oh my god can you tell us anything about Half-Life 3 since you're the writer

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:29.080
And he announced that actually quite recently he had parted ways with Valve amicably as I understand ending an 18 year relationship with the company

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:38.080
There's a really great quote here Laidlaw says that he quit for personal reasons mostly so that he can focus on self-directed writing projects

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:46.080
As in I have content that I wish to release can I release it please? No? Okay

02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:52.080
I want to be able to say here's this thing that I made

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:56.080
I have this trilogy I'm working on and I know that's not really part of your business model

02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:58.080
Yeah right

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.080
It's called Game of Thrones a song of what's the actual book called for that?

02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:07.080
That's what he's been working on this whole time

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:19.080
So that's interesting I mean obviously I'm sure he's been well compensated for the storyboarding and stuff that he's done on Half-Life 3 in whatever form it exists in

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:30.080
But anything after that or any revisions that they want to make if Gabe wants to scrap the script for the 15th time or whatever the fuck his damage is

02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:33.080
Mark Laidlaw will no longer be a part of that

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:37.080
I look forward to Half-Life 3 a song of crowbars and headcrabs

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.080
There's the show title for tonight

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:45.080
Maybe this will be the year guys

02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:49.080
I don't care anymore I've got my own little headcanon about what goes on

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:54.080
It's not even about Half-Life 3 at this point it's about the announcement of Half-Life 3

02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:56.080
More about the announcement than the game

02:19:56.080 --> 02:20:00.080
I'm not even really giving a shit about Half-Life 3 I would just like something new from them

02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:07.080
Like if that's Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, Half-Life 3 something completely different from all of that

02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:09.080
They've been so hardware focused the last 5 years

02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:14.080
I really really you guys want Gabe to come out on stage at E3

02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:21.080
Look at the audience, look in the mic and go Half-Life 3 sluts and then drop the mic and walk away

02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:26.080
It'll just have to be a crowbar with a 3 behind it behind it doesn't have to say anything and then he'll just like

02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:29.080
He could just drop trow and pee on the audience and wouldn't even

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:32.080
He'll go up against a wall and just pop his pussy in a handstand

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:44.080
I broke Rob is so great when I do that

02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:48.080
Explicit tag of the night goes to

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:54.080
For a big guy that's hard to do you gotta put your legs up and you're on your hands

02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:56.080
Alright next story Loki Loki

02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:08.080
Anyways so there's a lot of stuff coming out this year and from Sony they've got about 20 exclusives or so

02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:13.080
So these are going to be the list of titles that are going to be touring I guess with the

02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:18.080
I don't know if they have like what they call it the Playstation 4 tour

02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:21.080
Not really sure what they're calling it this time but they've got

02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:26.080
Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted 4, Street Fighter 5, The Last Guardian

02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:27.080
Yeah I'll believe that when I see it

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:35.080
Gran Turismo Sport, Firewatch which I don't believe is exclusive but it is something that's coming to the Playstation as an indie title

02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:46.080
What Remains of Edith Finch, Shadow of the Beast, Boundless Near Automata, Gravity Rush 2, Alienation, Hellblade, Paragon, The Witness

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:52.080
Ratchet and Clank, The Tomorrow Children, Drawn to Death, Dreams, and No Man's Sky

02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:54.080
God No Man's Sky is going to be awesome

02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:56.080
What's It Finally Comes Out

02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:04.080
So that's going to be the full list of titles touring hopefully within the next 12 months

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:10.080
And hopefully we'll see like a tour date close to us at some point

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:20.080
Well I'm excited that Sony is kind of especially after coming last year where you know at the holidays they didn't really have a lot of big first person stuff

02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:22.080
They're really making an effort to be this year

02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:26.080
Okay guys this year it's going to be different it's going to be very different

02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:30.080
And that's not even counting things that are unannounced that may be a surprise until holiday

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:33.080
Although I kind of I don't know if we have that from Sony this year

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:35.080
I kind of think like we already know

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:38.080
So it'll be like PlayStation VR and that's about it

02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:42.080
Yeah but VR you know this came up on our call with Bobby tonight

02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:47.080
VR supposedly still confirmed for the first half of the year so E3 would be too late to announce it

02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:55.080
Unless they're going to do that whole available today thing which I just I don't know that doesn't that doesn't seem like it would work in 2016

02:22:55.080 --> 02:23:01.080
Not with something like that I mean if you think about the consumers or like those stores that have to stock that crap

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:06.080
That's too risky of like something that's that high price and oh hey here's no announcement whatsoever

02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.080
I mean they

02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:09.080
People got to save up money for that

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:14.080
Available today at sonyentertainment.com

02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:21.080
Order online or Amazon exclusive or something I don't know I'm just making shit up now you guys that's what happens on Video Game Podcast

02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:28.080
I was also going to say you know along with that you know apparently the Cas Horizon said that there's going to be over a hundred titles

02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:37.080
And they're in development right now for PlayStation VR so hopefully they say that we have more 200 developers signed up for the PlayStation VR program

02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:42.080
Who are working on probably a hundred or more titles that will play on PlayStation VR

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:45.080
I hope that's the case

02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:48.080
I guess that's showing a real commitment to it I hope that plays out too

02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:51.080
But working on and when they're released is a whole different thing too so

02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:52.080
True

02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:53.080
We'll see

02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:58.080
I mean still it's good to know it's not just something they're going to support for a year and then drop off the face of the earth like

02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:07.080
I really do hope as a whole the whole thing works it I hope it does end up being the next big thing because I honestly would love to have like something like the HoloLens

02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:13.080
That actually works like they're showing it now and not actually how it actually works you know what I mean

02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:21.080
You know I would love to have that like oh you know virtual computer space and stuff where I'm doing like crazy shit you know applications on the walls and stuff like that

02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:29.080
I've already decided I'm waiting on HoloLens until Xbox 2 or whatever obviously that's not what they're going to call it but I'm going to wait on HoloLens until the next Xbox

02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:38.080
I've already made that decision unless there is that must have game I just have to leave the door open to crack because we all know I go back on the big claims I make

02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:39.080
Hello amiibo right Alan?

02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:40.080
Yes

02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:48.080
If there is that must have game on HoloLens then we'll see but I don't think some of these things that I'm hearing about so far must have

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:51.080
But was it E3? E3 could be the time we'll see

02:24:51.080 --> 02:25:02.080
Anyhow you guys remember we talked about a Kickstarter it was a little while ago in fact it would have been last year talking about Descent Underground

02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:11.080
And Descent Underground was a game that had its Kickstarter up and then it's supposed to be launching this year and you had to pledge $25

02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:20.080
Well apparently the game is now available on Early Access through IndieGala.com's Monday Bundle for $2

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:31.080
That's right so even though people Kickstarted this for $25 you could still buy it on Early Access for $2 as well as 5 other titles

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:37.080
So some people who backed the game for $25 not too happy about that

02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:41.080
I'd buy that for $2 actually it's $2.49 if we want to

02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:48.080
Let's see if chat can guess this movie reference $2 you owe me $2

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.080
I know that

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:57.080
Well anyhow the developer closed the thread and responded for saying the bundle was for charity

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:03.080
And apparently though I guess the developer posted a snippet from the Wikipedia page that says

02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:09.080
Just like in Humble Bundle buyers can set the revenue split between the developers, charities, and organizers

02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:15.080
And some folks pointing out that if you actually bought it you didn't get any type of slider that said

02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.080
Do you want to give this to charity or what do you want to do?

02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:19.080
Descendants Studios?

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:25.080
No that's bull- well I don't know let's see here I'm purchasing it right now

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:28.080
You're like I can get it for $2 hell yeah

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:37.080
Descendants Studios standing by that they believe the bundle would go to support charity and did not know that the bundle would be this cheap

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:45.080
By the way it should be pointed out that back in November Descent Underground was selling 70% off on Steam's Black Friday sales event

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:48.080
While still an Early Access game

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:56.080
Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says I paid $40 for Amplitude and Sky bought it for $20 should I get a refund?

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:00.080
Probably

02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:09.080
No but my serious answer is you know that when you get in on Kickstarter and you're putting in that kind of money you're helping to fund the game

02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:10.080
Terrorism

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.080
Shut up

02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:21.080
I put in $60 I think on the Shadowgate remake which is like dirt fucking cheap now I'm not pissed

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:30.080
I knew that Shadowgate needed X amount of money to come back and I wanted to see it really come back so I put in money that got my name in the credits

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:37.080
Which not a lot of games are now at standard fare but at the time there wasn't a lot of games offering to do that and yeah I'm happy with the decision I made

02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:43.080
I'm fine with it I'm glad that game happened it was good the soundtrack was fun so yeah

02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:50.080
And Bobby Blackwolf says I'm not pissed either because I actually like Amplitude unlike people who are wrong

02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:57.080
You know what though that's good I'm glad you can stand by the purchase you made that's fine

02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:06.080
We talked about handbags last week and it still blows my mind how people spend $1000 on a fucking bag

02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:17.080
Yet I know plenty of ladies and some dudes who are all about that type of price and why it's worth it and how it's worth it and all that stuff

02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:23.080
And I'm like okay that's not something I'll understand but hey it's your money spend it how you like

02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:35.080
Anyway moving on to the mailbag I think it's time to open up the mailbag because every week we invite your emails to participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:44.080
If you want to participate with the program we're going to open up that mailbag right now and dive in

02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:50.080
Except for the fact that I don't actually have it open on the screen because I'm not used to having to do this myself usually I have Dark Sakura

02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:58.080
I should have made Alan do this tonight while he's here but you've been spared email duty tonight Alan

02:28:58.080 --> 02:28:59.080
Yay

02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:01.080
Plus your phone probably wouldn't be very good for doing that

02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:07.080
We have some emails from some of our regular emails tonight we have two emails tonight and the first one is from Ray Genator

02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:15.080
And you guys if you think oh they keep reading emails from the same people maybe you should email us tell us your perspective

02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:20.080
Tell us why you paid 40 bucks for amplitude or you know anything on tonight's topics

02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:22.080
First one comes to us from Ray Genator

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:28.080
Hi people it's Ray Genator I hope all is well as I type this I'm well on my way to getting a new gaming desktop

02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:31.080
I have roughly half the money saved up good job on saving

02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:37.080
I'm still on track for getting the computer in mid April I've been looking at Newegg's site off and on while at the local library

02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:43.080
And I'm leaning towards getting an AMD 6th gen desktop provided there's nothing better that I can afford coming out in the meantime

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:48.080
Nor are there any awesome sales on any of the Nvidia PCs when I go to place my order

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:56.080
Now I should mention that despite the aforementioned info there may be the possibility that I may take an extra month wait and having my home internet and whatnot restored

02:29:56.080 --> 02:30:05.080
I haven't made a concrete decision regarding this yet the reasoning behind the possibility is this should I go forward with this it'll net me an extra 250 or so to put towards computer accessories

02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:13.080
While I haven't picked out and bought a specific PC just yet more than likely and unlike my old laptop it won't come with a built in microphone and webcam

02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:19.080
While webcams from what I've seen are fairly cheap a good headset can be kind of pricey upwards of $200 or so

02:30:19.080 --> 02:30:26.080
I'm going to hold off on buying those especially the headset until I actually have my PC but those are on my radar nonetheless

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:37.080
On a closing note did you three see the one sale on GOG or Good Old Games roughly a week ago from the time I'm typing this where their Duke Nukem games were 75-90% off

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:47.080
The reason behind the sale was due to the games were to be delisted immediately after the sale and wanted to get in some last minute sales revenue

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:56.080
I did not hear about that sale which is funny because I have Duke Nukem on Good Old Games because they gave it away for free some time ago

02:30:56.080 --> 02:31:03.080
I don't think I ever actually paid for that I think I got it for free that might have been like I spent $10 on something else and I got that thrown in I don't know

02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:11.080
But I had no idea that it was being delisted interesting I wonder if something's cooking for the anniversary I wonder why the delisting happened now I don't know

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:16.080
Dr Tutsi in chat saying I remember that giveaway that's how I got Duke Nukem as well

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:26.080
YYR giving some comments in chat saying nobody needs a $200 headset you can get a decent headset for under $100 William Ritterface saying you get a decent headset for under $50

02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:35.080
S200 Matt says don't get a webcam unless you plan on using it often you can get a webcam for $20 seriously webcams are super cheap and some webcams have built in microphones

02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:44.080
YYR in chat says use the rock band microphone if I had nothing else again I don't know if Rage Nator has rock band but it's an idea

02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:51.080
So yeah you don't necessarily need to drop a lot of money on that stuff especially right away

02:31:51.080 --> 02:32:04.080
Hitstun in chat says I just bought a new desktop PC just waiting on the case to arrive so I can build it I took your advice and speced it out on PC part picker and he actually shared the link

02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:13.080
for his PC build that he did on PC part picker so I think that was something I don't know if that was Loki I feel like you brought that to the show Alan because you did that on my PC

02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:23.080
Yeah Alan did that on my PC that he built for me well I guess god that's two in 2014 now it was a while ago time to update the video card I got more games to play this year

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:38.080
One more email tonight from YYR who says hello LR don't know if this is the first mailbag entry of 2016 it's tied with Rage Nators I suppose because we didn't have any last week right so it's tied

02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:49.080
But at the least it's my very first long winded email of 2016 to LR anyway and thanks to Kaijuto the game I played most in 2015 was a mobile game of all things King of Thieves

02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:59.080
I now play it on three different devices and have thrown at least $30 at it thanks Kaijuto I think yeah he got me playing that game too I remember that on a phone call a while ago

02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:07.080
Regarding the show computer Windows Update still works for Windows XP no new updates are being released but you can still download and install everything that's there

02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:14.080
I will say however that I'm a fan of the if it ain't broke don't fix it advice and if I were in your shoes I'd hang on to what you've got for the moment

02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:24.080
If you do want to go to Windows 7 or newer the most important thing is RAM 2 gig is the absolute minimum I'd say but if you're doing live streaming I won't try I wouldn't try less than 4

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:33.080
I'm going to do a quick side tangent because it's interesting the computer thing got some comments last week and I actually received a communication on Facebook so I won't say who it was

02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:45.080
It was a friend of mine who said dude you shouldn't have talked about that on the show and you should probably think about updating Windows 7 because Windows XP is vulnerable and so somebody could just get right in your computer

02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:54.080
Now I pointed out that we do use a third party to relay the show I'm not broadcasting directly from the computer but that certainly did have me thinking

02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:04.080
Anytime you're putting out media on the internet you take a little bit of a risk like that I suppose you know our website has been defaced before it's nothing you know it just comes with the territory being on the internet

02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:16.080
There's going to be little troll kids who want to you know put pictures of tub girl and stuff just to get a ruffle your feathers but that was the best argument I've heard yet for breaking my if it ain't broke don't fix it rule

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:30.080
Honestly because after reading that I was like okay I may have the whole third party thing in place and I may be a little safer because of it but he makes a good point is that you know Windows XP does still have vulnerabilities

02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:36.080
And I got to make sure being on the internet we were minimized to that type of stuff right

02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:46.080
Even if there are like if you could go right now into XP and go Windows update and pull down whatever security like they're not supporting it anymore and that they're not coming out with new stuff

02:34:46.080 --> 02:35:00.080
Given what you went through with Skype right even if there is stuff that you could use to bring your XP more up to date would you even want to run it knowing what you'd be at what would be at risk as far as the computer working right

02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:13.080
Now let me say this as a side story that's also scared me off from upgrading I have a friend who's interested in starting a podcast so since it's not something announced yet I'm not going to tell you what it is

02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:25.080
But a friend of mine is working on potentially launching a podcast soon and wanted to get a sound card for their computer like mine and the question was how do you do OLR I kind of want to be able to mirror that sort of thing

02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:34.080
So I told him what type of sound card I had and we put it in his computer he's running Windows 10 and I can't get that fucking sound card to work

02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:38.080
And this person's computer is top of the line

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:55.080
And I can't figure out for the life of me and maybe I'm going to crowd source this so the sound card is an Audigy 5RX and the deal is is that to tape from Sound Blaster the way I'm able to run music on like let's say Winamp like let's say hey it's time for the mailbag

02:35:55.080 --> 02:36:06.080
And I can do all that live instead of having to patch it in later the reason I can do that is because Sound Blasters have a thing built into it called what you the letter U here

02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:18.080
And that's a source that you can use to record just like you can microphone and line in but the reason why this all works is that we have our mixing board that goes to the line in and then that goes through what you hear

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:30.080
Here's the problem I'm having with my friend's computer for some reason in Windows 10 I can have the microphone or the line in or the what you hear but I can't have them all

02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:43.080
I enable one the others get disabled and I can't figure out what the fuck is going on because and we tried receiving the sound card that was I went on the internet googled it that's what somebody said they did was that they moved the sound card and it fixed the problem

02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.080
Try doing that and it didn't fix the problem so I don't know what it is

02:36:49.080 --> 02:37:06.080
And it's using the mic jack in the front right in the front of the case that's hooked up for anyone who has a fairly recent PC case there's like the headphone and microphone jack up in the front where the power button is you don't have to climb behind your computer every time you want to like take off your headset

02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.080
We was using the mic from up front there right

02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:32.080
Yeah. Now, Tigerclaw by the way pointing out another solution is to use a program called virtual audio cable. Now, what I ended up doing, I set this person up with the Skype recorder and Skype so that they could podcast and they're enabled to do that and they can see if that's what they want to do. So, at least there's a workaround, but I feel really bad and kind of guilty

02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:52.080
Because they bought a sound card specifically for this. Exactly. I told them to buy the sound card because that's what OLR does and now it won't freaking work and I can see where this person is probably really frustrated with having spent the money on the sound card they can't get to work but it's like okay in my system it just works and I don't know if it's an XP versus 10 thing which is maybe possible. I don't know.

02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:57.080
Don't they make external USB sound cards now that have like a mic jack in it that's like the what you hear stuff?

02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:04.080
Yeah, they do, but I'm not going to tell this person to buy something else now. Yeah, I know. So, I don't know. So anyway, I don't know.

02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:24.080
Just so many motherboards now come with, especially if they're a gaming rig, come with on built-in audio stuff that isn't terrible that the idea of buying a Creative Labs sound card separately and using a PCI slot is super like 90s early 2000s to me. Like I have one of course, but it's so unnecessary now.

02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:33.080
The sound card in this computer is the oldest thing about it. This sound card is as old as OLR, if not older. I'm rocking a sound card from 2001.

02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:42.080
Make sure that there are drivers for it if you decide to upgrade from XP to 7 or 10. Right? Because you might lose it by way of software.

02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:55.080
Alright, let's see. Mr. Blackwolf in our chat room pointing out my Realtek and C-Audio sound devices have stereo mix, which is the same as Creative's what you hear. Yeah, I've heard that stereo mix is pretty much the equivalent of that on other sound cards.

02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:59.080
Realtek is what this person's onboard audio is, but we disabled it first.

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:11.080
Yes. So, I don't, I don't know. And Tiger Class says I have a Sound Blaster Rec on 3D. A dedicated sound card is better than the onboard due to the audio quality being better.

02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:21.080
So, and then Bobby Blackwolf pointing out I bought a laptop that has stereo mix card in it. It was Realtek, but unfortunately it delays the audio half a second, so it's really hard to use live.

02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:36.080
So yeah, I'm hoping, praying somebody out there might have the answer to this question because I'm stumped and I feel so bad that I told this person to buy a card, but I said this is what we do at OLR and I expected it would work just as easy, but it doesn't, so I'm frustrated.

02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:47.080
So, I don't know. We'll see. Alright. I almost closed the email. I wasn't even close to being done. Sorry YYR. Tangent there, but it was relevant to what we were talking about.

02:39:47.080 --> 02:40:01.080
So, back to YYR's email. On the subject of Konami, you've talked about how a change at the top might be a good idea and about the possibility of their entertainment division getting sold, but have you considered the possibility that nobody in Japan thinks that there's a problem with what they're doing?

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:11.080
That's my belief and I don't think it'll change unless and until they try releasing a Metal Gear Solid 6 in North America and find a big old American middle finger waiting for them.

02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:16.080
Then they'll be thoroughly perplexed as to what happened. Culture shock. Those are my guesses. What do you think?

02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:40.080
Yes, I think you're actually, you feel the same way I do, but just phrased a different way. I think Japan, I shouldn't phrase it that way, sorry. I think the Japanese end of Konami is so like in a bubble that I think they are completely clueless, but I think part of that is caused by stubbornness, which I said is the downfall of the company is that stubbornness and it's doing them in.

02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:46.080
But I think you're absolutely right. They'll finally realize it when they try to release shit here and we're not having it anymore.

02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:52.080
Unless they are having it and they're going to buy it anyways, even after they complained all this time.

02:40:52.080 --> 02:41:03.080
Let's hope not. Here's something that hasn't appeared on many news sites. Do you remember the Ask Me Anything that Kevin Bacchus, a senior VP at Dave & Buster's did on Reddit some months ago?

02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:19.080
At that time, he mentioned that he was interested in testing DDR 2014. Well, the test happened and as a direct result, approximately half of Dave & Buster's 73 nationwide locations will be getting DDR 2014 machines with full e-amusement support later this year.

02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:30.080
The exact locations are not yet known, but this information comes straight from Bacchus himself. I don't know about you guys, but I'm super excited about the official return of DDR to American arcades.

02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:33.080
Is Konami still involved, though?

02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:36.080
Aren't those stages not very good, though? I don't remember if they are or not.

02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:43.080
You know what? I will give it a shot and hey, if it did well in the test locations, that must lend itself well.

02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:48.080
Actually, I have seen the DDR 2014 machines. The new cabinets are pretty sweet looking, so we'll see.

02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:54.080
And YYR saying, I do hope that the Konami negativity does not affect the DDR 2014 rollout.

02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:59.080
They could put somebody else's logo on it. I'm just being a bitch at this point.

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:03.080
I have an idea. How about they put just a Hideo Kojima game or something like that.

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:12.080
And lastly, YYR saying, I'll leave it at that for now. Time to review the first draft of my provisional patent application that the lawyer just sent me an hour ago.

02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:21.080
Legalese is super fun, except that it isn't really fun at all. Have a fun week, everyone. Hugs and kisses, Aaron or YYR. Are you trademarking bungee ferret tossing? I just want to know.

02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:25.080
He said patent application, so that would be patenting something.

02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:34.080
Oh, I'm curious to see what this is. The plot thickens. Good luck, YYR. Looking forward to seeing you at MAGFest.

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:41.080
And good luck with the patent and all that. I hope you talk to Kyle about that, because after that episode, we know that guy has been through a lot with that.

02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:43.080
So hopefully he had some insight for that.

02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:50.080
It is that time to get into the FUs of the week. A point to rant on the show, because we can.

02:42:51.080 --> 02:43:07.080
How about Loki?

02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:17.080
Loki. I guess I'm just a nephew to my new schedule. I mean, it's cool that I have Saturdays off, but I don't like not having the extra time in the morning.

02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:28.080
It makes it hard for me to get lunch for the week and stuff like that that I used to do in that free time that I had, and now I don't. It's just very constricting, I guess.

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:39.080
And the fact that I'm unable to be motivated enough to work on my game. I really want to, but I'm just brain dead sometimes to do that. But I really just need to try harder.

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:50.080
I can't really think of a lot of angst right now. FU to the sloppy Ingress battle I've been doing for the past two days. That's been a waste of gas, but kind of fun, so whatever.

02:43:50.080 --> 02:44:03.080
Otherwise, things are going pretty well. I really can't find anything serious to give an FU to. I guess FU to the weekend going by so fast. This weekend flew by. Flew by! Alan?

02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:15.080
FU, I guess, to like, this is the longest I've worn my hair in years and years and years, and I need a haircut. It's higher maintenance than I'm used to, and I somehow have motivation to go to my barber.

02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:24.080
Which is totally like a vain and really superficial FU, but hair in my face.

02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:35.080
At least you have hair. True. Alright. Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit. We're running kind of long tonight again.

02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:41.080
But we'll try opening it up for a little bit, see what calls get through just after a couple more stories here. So, Loki.

02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:51.080
Alright, so we're just a little bit away from the Game Development Choice Awards and the Game Developers Conference, but along with that, they're seeing some of the nominees that are kind of leading the pack.

02:44:51.080 --> 02:45:06.080
The Witcher 3 and Metal Gear Solid 5. So, that's pretty awesome. Also, Bloodborne, Fallout 4, and Splatoon. So, I guess we'll find out who's going to win that on March 16th.

02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:16.080
Kind of seeing a very common theme amongst a lot of the nominees seem to be, you know, you see here Witcher, I've heard Splatoon a lot, but they're all good games.

02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:20.080
I do need to check out the Witcher 3, I think. That might be cool.

02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:27.080
Yeah, I really need to spend more time with that, and what a good time this part of the year where there's really nothing else coming out right now.

02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:39.080
And lastly, speaking of award shows, I think this is great. Voting is now open for the second annual CW, as in the television network, the CW, World Dog Awards.

02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:51.080
And guess what? Video games are included. You can actually go to the CW's website, CWTV.com, and you can actually vote for your favorite, I guess, dog from a video game.

02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:59.080
Dogmeat from Fallout 4, D-Dog from Metal Gear Solid 5, and Chop from Grand Theft Auto 5. Top video game dog.

02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:06.080
There's also TV and movie dogs, best celebrity selfie with their dog, best rescue story, and more.

02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:12.080
So, I thought what better note to end the show on than puppies. So, there you go.

02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:19.080
And I just think it's funny that best video game dog now being included, but hey, it has been a big year for video game dogs.

02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:24.080
So, would you vote for Chop, the Grand Theft Auto dog? Loki?

02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:27.080
He's alright. I don't know. Probably not.

02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:35.080
Alright, the Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:41.080
You can give your feedback on any topic we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we missed, or maybe some type of game you've been playing. Who knows?

02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:45.080
Ooh, it's lighting up, so let's get to it. Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:47.080
Hey, what's going on? It's Ron.

02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:48.080
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:51.080
I'm pretty good. I'm kind of stuffed from dinner, though.

02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:56.080
I'm still stuffed from dinner I ate on Friday, so I feel your pain.

02:46:56.080 --> 02:47:01.080
But, like Jamie, I'm also having barbecue, so yeah.

02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:04.080
Yeah, rub it in, rub it in. Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:11.080
Well, I call to give advice on the whole podcasting situation that you discussed earlier.

02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:12.080
Oh, really?

02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:19.080
Alright, because what I did is something along the lines of what I got from Travis Donovan.

02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:26.080
I run my entire podcast through a mix board, but what I do is I use a USB mixer.

02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:35.080
That way, I have the line in open, and no matter what I throw through there, it picks up without any issues.

02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:39.080
Huh.

02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:46.080
I think that would be the best way to go, because I do have a Sound Blaster card, but I use it more for audio,

02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:51.080
and I have a 5.1 speaker system that is amazing, but that's neither here nor there.

02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:57.080
But when I'm doing my podcast, I have my little Behringer USB mixer here.

02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:05.080
It handles my Skype calls when we're live, and when I set up my second computer for the Skype line,

02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:09.080
I have a line in for that, and it handles that as well.

02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:15.080
Yeah, but if his sound card won't do the line in and what you hear at the same time, I don't...

02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:19.080
Oh, I see what you're talking about, though. You run the Skype through another application.

02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:24.080
Yeah, because what was happening... I used to use a whole Skype recorder thing,

02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:30.080
but then when you gave the option and the opportunity to go live, I'm like, I have to figure out a better way to do this.

02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:37.080
So, a little bit of research. With this mixer, I can set the Skype for line in,

02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:45.080
so whoever calls in is picked up on any issues, and I actually have a secondary external sound device.

02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:47.080
You've heard of Astro, right?

02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:48.080
Yeah.

02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:55.080
I have their mixer to use to hook up to the television or surround sound for gaming.

02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.080
I use it as an external sound device, which controls the music in the background.

02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:03.080
You know, it's a process that sounds like it would work. I just would hate to tell them,

02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:07.080
oh, you've got to buy this other thing now, because what I told you wasn't enough.

02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:12.080
So, I'm being stubborn, and I feel like it should work what we've got.

02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:20.080
Yeah, and one thing about Sound Blaster, when I jumped to Windows 7 64-bit,

02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:27.080
I ran into some issues with their drivers, and I had to go dig in for third-party alternatives just to get them to work.

02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:32.080
Ooh, I wonder if it has to do with 64-bit, because he's got a top-of-the-line computer.

02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:33.080
Yeah, that's it, yes.

02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:36.080
Huh, I didn't think about that. You hearing that, Alan?

02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:41.080
Could do with the fact that it's 64-bit, and the OLR computer definitely isn't that.

02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:44.080
Interesting. We'll have to look into that. That's a darn good suggestion.

02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:47.080
I like the idea of third-party drivers who might have to do it.

02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:50.080
Hey, send me an email with some suggestions on where to get third-party drivers,

02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:52.080
because I have no idea where to go looking.

02:49:52.080 --> 02:50:00.080
Will do, and when you guys redo the computer for OLR, I would just recommend picking up a simple USB mixer.

02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:06.080
Then you can use your original Mix port in, but this thing handles everything coming in and out.

02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:08.080
Good suggestion. I appreciate it.

02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:09.080
Yeah, no problem, dude.

02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:12.080
All right, take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go to try and grab some more calls.

02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:13.080
You got it.

02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:15.080
All right, and by the way, Anime Jam Session, back this week, right?

02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:22.080
Yes, we're doing our best of 2015, because we feel, why do our best in 2015 at the end of the year?

02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:24.080
Let's just wait until 2016, then look back.

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:26.080
All right, fair enough. Do it your way.

02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:27.080
You got it, bro.

02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:28.080
All right, take care.

02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:29.080
You got it. Bye.

02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:30.080
Bye.

02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:32.080
All right, we have another call coming in. Let's get to our next call.

02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:34.080
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:37.080
Hello, it's YYR.

02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:38.080
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:46.080
Not too bad, not too bad. I mean, I'm still a little disappointed about the whole being wait-listed for MAGFest thing, but you know what?

02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:53.080
The last time I didn't make it into the showcase, I walked around the indie area, and there were a lot of really impressed games there.

02:50:53.080 --> 02:51:00.080
So I'm sure I won't be disappointed this year if multitasking was wait-listed, so there's that.

02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:03.080
Fingers crossed for you, for what it's worth.

02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:06.080
Yeah. Well, I'll be crossing my fingers, my toes, and my eyes.

02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:11.080
So what's on your mind?

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:23.080
Oh, well, I figured I'd let you in on a little more information. I know you guys know about 2DX Infinitas, the new home version released in Japan.

02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:37.080
It actually came out last month. It is, of course, Japan only. In fact, the only way you can pay for it is using Aselli, which is their Konami funny money used mostly for their arcade games.

02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:39.080
Right.

02:51:39.080 --> 02:51:49.080
In fact, now here's the pricing scheme. Now, I guarantee you, your reaction to this is going to be, ah, Konami.

02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:50.080
Lay it on me.

02:51:50.080 --> 02:52:06.080
You ready for this? So you don't buy it outright, of course. What you pay for is a basic subscription, which lasts one month, and this costs 15.98 Aselli, which is really the same as Yen, so you're talking about 13.5 bucks. All right?

02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:07.080
Okay.

02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:22.080
And what do you get for this? You get to play the game as it is right now. It is just standard mode, there's no free mode, there's no courses, there's no class mode, no beginner mode, nothing.

02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:26.080
It's about 40 songs. Oh, can you hear me?

02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:27.080
Yeah.

02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:28.080
Hello?

02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:29.080
Yep, we hear you.

02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:31.080
Skype just came up and said there's a problem.

02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:35.080
There's a little bit of a delay, but it's not the end of the world, but go ahead.

02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:43.080
All right, cool. So most of the songs are from Sirius, 2DX17, because that's the first home version that didn't come out.

02:52:43.080 --> 02:52:44.080
Makes sense.

02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:54.080
But not all of it. Most of it, but not all of it. So it's just 40 songs, just standard mode, and that's all you get for me. Now, here's the rub.

02:52:55.080 --> 02:53:05.080
I think this combines the worst of two worlds, an MMO and PlayStation Plus. They have added 10 songs to the game for January, right?

02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:14.080
But you don't actually get the songs added to your game permanently unless you are subscribing during January.

02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:23.080
If you're one of these people who's like, I'm going to wait until more songs are in the game, that doesn't work, because every month you are not subscribing, you don't get those songs.

02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:35.080
Yeah, I'm not having it. I'm not a fan of that. I mean, maybe they'll come back to some songs at some point, but that seems a little... I think that'll kind of backfire on them.

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:39.080
I mean, I don't know, but the Japanese culture might forgive that more than we would over here.

02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:49.080
They did announce that they may come back to some songs in the future, but if you think about it, it's like, well, every song they repeat is a new song I'm not getting, so it works both ways.

02:53:49.080 --> 02:54:03.080
Now, there's also a championship mode that they added to the game, right, that has a chorus of four songs that will be added to the standard mode if you complete that course while it's being offered.

02:54:03.080 --> 02:54:12.080
But in order to play that, you have to buy an Infinitas ticket, which is sold for 108 yen for one use.

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:15.080
Oh my god, no.

02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:22.080
They're selling these one-use tickets, and there will be more modes added to the game that require them.

02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:28.080
So they're trying to make your PC an arcade machine that they directly take the money from. That's what it is.

02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:29.080
Essentially...

02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:32.080
Nah, I don't think so.

02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:40.080
Hence the whole discussion earlier on Konami being stubborn and this is going to blow up on them eventually.

02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:46.080
And you don't own anything, of course. You stop paying, that's it. You're done. You get nothing.

02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:58.080
Now, in fairness, before somebody else points it out that I'm not being fair, Guitar Hero has that whole thing where, you know, you can use a credit to play a song one time and all that.

02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:07.080
But my understanding as well with Guitar Hero is that there's a 24-7 feed of, you know, random songs, and you're not paying a monthly fee on top of it either with Guitar Hero.

02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:09.080
It's not there, so there's a big difference.

02:55:09.080 --> 02:55:23.080
You can put those songs in the feed for free, and, not to mention, you also, I mean, you paid $60 for it or, you know, $100 with the controller or whatever you paid when it was on sale, but you do still have an offline game that you own. So, there's that.

02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:38.080
Why do I have this weird feeling that, we were talking about crackers and hackers earlier, why do I have this weird feeling someone's going to reverse engineer Infinitoss and just kind of cut out Konami and put out whatever songs they want? I really feel like that's going to be a thing.

02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:54.080
You know what, I'm not so sure, only because you've already got the arcade rip of, you know, version 22 out there if you know where to go, and, well, that's got like 700 plus songs in it, so why would you waste your time with Infinitoss?

02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:57.080
Because I can.

02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:11.080
Now, here's the thing, too. Let's say you're not sure Infinitoss will run on your computer. The fuckery continues, it's amazing. Konami posted a trial version on their website that you can download. Sounds good, right?

02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:25.080
So, the trial version is, you start it and there's two buttons, start and exit. Start goes straight into a one song, it gives you 5-1-1 on normal, and it auto-plays it.

02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:30.080
So it's like a benchmark software, it's not really a demo, it's a benchmark.

02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:41.080
Exactly, and you can't even test the sync with your controller because you can't do anything. And then it's over, and it kicks you back to that menu. Start or exit.

02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:49.080
Yeah, I think there's a good reason why that game's not coming out outside Japan, and we'll see how well it does in Japan.

02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:51.080
I guess we will.

02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:53.080
Yeah, I hope we have a good week.

02:56:53.080 --> 02:57:00.080
Thank you. I don't know who's driving a Konami right now, but they're about to drive right into a wall, and it's so painful to watch. So painful.

02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:02.080
They're driving the desert bus.

02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.080
They are. They're driving the desert bus right off the road.

02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:10.080
YYR, I'm gonna let you go, we've got a delay going on here, but I'll see you at MagFest in about six weeks.

02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:13.080
I look very much forward to seeing you there.

02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:15.080
Alright, take care my friend.

02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:16.080
Take care, have a good one.

02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:17.080
You too.

02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:23.080
Alright, I think that's gonna do it for calls tonight, because we're well after nine o'clock, which is midnight on the East Coast.

02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:25.080
So we're gonna go ahead and move to wrap up tonight.

02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:30.080
But if you didn't get through, and you want to email the show, again, participate at orangeontrader.com, you can also tweet us.

02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:34.080
I do read all the tweets, even if I don't always get to them on air.

02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:39.080
I'm still waiting for a week where we're only at like two hours long, and we're like desperate for more information.

02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:46.080
But I do read all the tweets, and I do read all the stuff on Facebook and all that stuff, so thank you guys who continue to put that out there.

02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:51.080
Checking in with Loki real quick to see if there's any last minute stories. I kind of doubt it, but I'll check in.

02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:54.080
Not really, no.

02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:58.080
I think we hit most of it. It was relatively a slow news week.

02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:02.080
I can't believe we filled all that time, but that's what happens sometimes.

02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:07.080
So we managed to have enough rants to fill up an entire hour of show.

02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:10.080
So anyway, that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange On Radio.

02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:16.080
Hey, I want to thank Alan real quick for being on the show tonight and doing the classic game and filling in with some stories there.

02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:18.080
I appreciate having him on.

02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:21.080
Alan, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:23.080
No, not really.

02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:25.080
No? I'm sure we'll see you again soon.

02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:26.080
Yes.

02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:27.080
Alright, sounds good.

02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:32.080
And hey, I do want to remind you guys, if you enjoyed Orange On Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:35.080
Help spread word of mouth about the show.

02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:41.080
You know, we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't participating, then we can't share them.

02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:43.080
So help us grow our family.

02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:46.080
You know, we don't ask for your money. We just ask for your recommendation.

02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:56.080
And if you can't really think of anyone to tell online, or even if you can, we still do appreciate five star reviews on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever it is that you found this show.

02:58:56.080 --> 02:59:02.080
Because those reviews, they really do go a long way, and I really deeply appreciate each one of them where you take the 15 seconds to leave that review.

02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:03.080
I would appreciate it.

02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:09.080
I'm charging you less than 2DX Difinitas, okay? It could be a lot worse, people. It could be a lot worse.

02:59:09.080 --> 02:59:14.080
Alright, that's it. We'll be back in seven days. Star Soccer will be back.

02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:18.080
We'll talk about her trip to Disney now. We'll talk about what's coming up in gaming news.

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:21.080
But of course, I have to close out with everybody's final thought.

02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:28.080
My final thought tonight is I think I'm finally, after all these weeks, gonna finally get around to playing Undertale this week.

02:59:28.080 --> 02:59:29.080
See what all the hype is about.

02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:36.080
You also need to play... it's like some pony game. Happy Pony?

02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:39.080
I don't know that one.

02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:41.080
It's similar to Undertale.

02:59:41.080 --> 02:59:42.080
Alright, I'll check that out.

02:59:42.080 --> 02:59:43.080
It's weird.

02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:45.080
Alright, and last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:51.080
My final thought is hopefully I'm gonna work some more on my game this week, but probably will end up just playing Fallout 4.

02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:57.080
Alright, that's fair then. That's gonna do it. Have a good night everybody. Thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

02:59:57.080 --> 03:00:00.080
We'll see you again next week. Happy gaming. We'll see ya.

03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:32.080
See you next week.

03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:02.080
Thanks for watching!
