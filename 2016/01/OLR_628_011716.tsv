7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Another Zelda HD revival is coming our way, and some new content and functionality are also in store. Amiibo is still a highly debated subject, but it can't be denied that the utility is growing. We'll explain more on this along with the rest of the week's gaming news, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 628 for this January the 17th of 2016.
46000	60000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California. You can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me by my side, as always, are my co-hosts. Welcome back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
60000	64000	Is your mic on over there? There we go.
64000	67000	Actually I think that my thing on here is kind of broken.
67000	70000	Uh oh, well that's the joy of live radio.
70000	71000	Can you hear me now?
71000	72000	Yeah, we can hear you fine now.
72000	74000	Okay, well I wrote the teacups for you.
74000	75000	Thank you.
75000	76000	I filmed it.
76000	77000	Yay!
77000	82000	I didn't put it online yet, but I filmed it just for you, which is really just a lot of blurring.
82000	93000	I appreciate that. I like to film when I go on the, what's the one in Cars Land? Not the big one, not the e-ticket there, the little baby one.
93000	97000	Oh man, this is a horrible live radio.
97000	101000	I don't remember, I have never seen it, but I know which one you're talking about. It's the tractors.
101000	103000	Yes, the tractors that spin around around.
103000	105000	By the way everybody, TechMasterLoki over there.
105000	107000	And I've never actually been to Cars Land.
107000	109000	I didn't do any of that California Adventure crap.
109000	110000	Oh, last time I was there that wasn't even there.
110000	111000	Disney only, huh?
111000	113000	I found the new entrance to Club 33 though.
113000	114000	Oh, I didn't know they moved it.
114000	115000	Yeah.
115000	116000	Oh.
116000	123000	It's around the corner a little bit, and the only way to identify a marker is a little doorbell with 33 over it.
123000	124000	Right.
124000	130000	Well, it is a podcast about video games, but with DarkSakura being gone last week at Disneyland.
130000	131000	Disneyland is better.
131000	132000	You know, I...
132000	133000	Hey, now watch it.
133000	135000	Did you play any games at Disneyland? Let's get meta.
135000	137000	Because they do have...
137000	138000	I didn't play Astro Blasters.
138000	144000	Do they still have like the half, it's like half Flynn's Arcade, half Wreck-It Ralph thing at Space Mountain?
144000	145000	No.
145000	146000	StarCade's gone.
146000	147000	Oh, no.
147000	148000	It's all closed off.
148000	149000	What?
149000	150000	It just has like an ATM in there.
150000	151000	What?
151000	152000	That's awful.
152000	153000	I took a picture at how sad it was.
153000	154000	Aw.
154000	156000	StarCade's ATM is the greatest game ever.
156000	158000	Yeah, you win real money.
158000	160000	Yeah, I know you get money.
160000	165000	But, I mean, I did like the usual.
165000	169000	We went to, we did Hyperspace Mountain, which was okay.
169000	170000	What is, what is hyper?
170000	176000	Is that just, they put the Star Wars, like, like the first time in my modern era because,
176000	179000	you know, I went to Disneyland as a kid and then I went back in my twenties.
179000	184000	And the first time I went back to Disneyland was with DarkSakura and the official OLR lesbians
184000	186000	who haven't been on the show in a long time because they moved.
186000	188000	They moved to Wisconsin.
188000	189000	Right.
189000	191000	They're like way out there now.
191000	196000	And, but they, we all went and when we went on Space Mountain, it was a rocking Space Mountain.
196000	197000	It was playing Red Hot Chili Peppers.
197000	199000	It was like people were dancing on holograms.
199000	201000	Is it just that whole thing, but with Star Wars?
201000	202000	Kinda.
202000	207000	But as you go through where they would, would have like the little hologram, not the holograms,
207000	209000	but little things up on the wall.
209000	213000	Instead it was projections of like dogfights in space.
213000	214000	It was okay.
214000	218000	Did Kylo Ren talk to us with his sexy voice?
218000	219000	I didn't.
219000	223000	I was just like, I was too busy going, ah!
223000	225000	That's what you're supposed to do on Space Mountain.
225000	226000	That is what you do on Space Mountain.
226000	233000	But I still have my Fastpass for Hyperspace Mountain because we rode the special entrance
233000	237000	to most of the rides because we had a certain friend with us.
237000	241000	So we got to do the ride within a ride and the back doors and everything and find the
241000	242000	other ways around.
242000	243000	And it was cool.
243000	244000	That's fun.
244000	251000	And I've now got to see kind of backstage on Haunted Mansion.
251000	253000	And I did the cat hunting game.
253000	255000	I found two cats.
255000	260000	So the whole reason you were there at Disneyland was because part of it's closing.
260000	261000	It's gone.
261000	262000	It's leaving.
262000	265000	So you were there the last minute.
265000	267000	You were there right up to closing, right?
267000	270000	I actually have two videos up on my YouTube channel.
270000	273000	It's just DarkSakuraOLR.
273000	279000	Is it just you and Lady Victoria and that whole clique that are big fans of that restaurant?
279000	284000	I came into the party late, but I had only been once before, but I fell in love immediately.
284000	288000	But were there other, does Bucket of Meat have a cult of fans?
288000	292000	There were people who were not wanting to vacate the tables.
292000	296000	And the staff had to tell them to leave because of the reservations.
296000	297000	Right.
297000	300000	We left with like five pots.
300000	302000	We left with five buckets.
302000	305000	They really should just tear out Rainforest Cafe because it was super overrated.
305000	309000	It was, but it's not even adjacent to the park.
309000	311000	I don't care.
311000	316000	I have to go to our chat because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
316000	317000	vog.network.com
317000	321000	See, the fact that we're the Voice of Geeks Network gives us a little freedom to talk about more than just games.
321000	324000	And Disney addiction, that's a little geeky.
324000	331000	But anyway, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show, also a Disney fan.
331000	334000	In fact, the last time I went to Disneyland was with Bobby Black Wolf Show.
334000	339000	But we are live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, of course, right after Bobby.
339000	344000	And Tiger Claw on our chat room, I knew he was going to ask about this because Tiger Claw is always the one that's like,
344000	347000	did you see this or did you know about this?
347000	351000	Tiger Claw asking, did you see Saturday Night Live last night with the Kylo Ren sketch?
351000	358000	And I'm assuming he's talking about the Undercover Boss thing where they parodied that show, which I didn't even know Undercover Boss was still a thing.
358000	361000	I thought that show was off the air, like, for a long time.
361000	370000	But yes, I did see the sketch and it was hilarious because, I don't know, like, again, I'm going to not go into spoiler territory, don't worry.
370000	373000	But we all know Kylo Ren is the villain in the movie, we all know that, okay?
373000	375000	He's got the red lightsaber in the trailer, you all know that.
376000	382000	And even though he's kind of an asshole, like, there's a part of me that's like, I kind of like, really like Kylo Ren.
382000	385000	Like, I just, it's the voice. The voice is so hot.
388000	392000	I don't know what it is. Only when the mask is on, though. I don't, cause, anyway.
392000	397000	Yeah, the mask on, it's good. He's like, oh man, he sounds so badass, like Darth Vader, and then he takes it off.
397000	400000	I'm so whiny! It's like, no, no, it's not working.
400000	402000	He's like the emo Kylo Ren account.
402000	404000	I love that Twitter, by the way.
404000	405000	No, it's a great Twitter.
405000	407000	No, no, no, put the mask back on!
408000	413000	So anyway, the fact that they actually incorporated that a little bit into the sketch, that slayed me. I love that.
413000	417000	So, yeah. That guy has a good, what was his name, Adam Driver? He has a good sense of humor.
418000	426000	He did, like, a porn sketch last night, too, cause they have, like, a reoccurring thing where this girl keeps interrupting porns that are being shot, so they did something to that, yeah.
426000	427000	I haven't watched that in a long time.
427000	432000	I know, I know, there's not a lot of reason to, but it's a little more up than it was a couple years ago.
432000	438000	I was just excited, cause yesterday I was browsing through everything, cause, you know, my kids always hog Netflix.
438000	442000	And so I was like, dude, there's, like, so many awesome movies on here now that I like to watch.
442000	447000	And then I noticed that the new season of It's Always Sunny is on there now, and I was like, yes.
447000	448000	Hilarious show.
448000	457000	Alright, we gotta get to games a little bit tonight, cause, you know, it is a video game show, and we're gonna talk about the types of games we've been playing this week.
457000	459000	We're also gonna get into the news this week.
459000	462000	But we always like to start each week with a kickoff topic.
462000	466000	But, you know, I have to admit, I was struggling a little bit this week to come up with a kickoff topic.
466000	469000	So I thought, you know what, let's go to the listeners.
469000	472000	Maybe the listeners have a kickoff topic for us tonight.
472000	474000	So we're actually gonna go to the mailbag.
480000	485000	Every week you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
485000	486000	I ain't readin' all this.
486000	494000	DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and finds an email, or five, that she deems are worthy to read.
494000	496000	And actually we've picked one of them tonight.
496000	502000	We'll do all the emails later, but we're gonna do one here at the top of the show cause it asks a good question I thought would be a good kickoff topic tonight.
502000	504000	So DarkSakura, please, to the email.
516000	519000	Anyway, it came with two games, Sonic CD and Road Avenger.
519000	522000	Sonic CD blew my mind from the first second.
522000	526000	I'll never forget the video intro and the catchy Toot Toot Sonic Warriors song.
526000	529000	The music quality was a different world.
529000	536000	Sonic had never had more speed and the 3D stages to get the emeralds were unseen at the time.
536000	540000	But yeah, the European OSD was a lot better than the American one.
540000	542000	That's a matter of opinion.
542000	546000	Road Avenger was a full motion video game drawn like a cartoon.
546000	549000	Again, the music and sound effects were amazing.
549000	551000	The onscreen action was over the top.
551000	553000	The video was even more fantastic.
556000	559000	The rest, I guess, isn't to be read out loud.
562000	563000	I'll just read it.
563000	566000	Secondly, can you email me an address or P.O. Box for me to send some Belgian stuff to?
566000	568000	You know, chocolates, beer, candy.
568000	570000	I will take chocolates, beer, candy.
570000	573000	That's a very sweet gesture and we can reach out to him off air.
573000	575000	You guys have done this show forever now.
575000	578000	You were there when I was going through a very rough time.
578000	584000	I listened to this show when I climbed Mount Vento and it brightened up my day.
584000	585000	It's the least I can do.
585000	589000	As always, thanks a million for doing this show, Fabrice from Belgium.
589000	591000	Well, thank you Fabrice for the email.
591000	594000	If I knew you were going to listen to this show while you were climbing a mountain,
594000	597000	I would have actually sung my best Mother Superior.
597000	600000	Climb every mountain.
601000	603000	Anyone? Anyone? All right, forget it.
603000	604000	No.
604000	607000	The only good part of Sound of Music Live on NBC,
607000	610000	because it was the one song that Carrie Underwood didn't sing,
610000	613000	but anyway, back to the email.
613000	615000	Now I'm thinking of the Little Shepherd.
615000	620000	Now that everybody shut the show off,
621000	623000	I can't handle it.
624000	627000	Let's go back to the question that was asked at the top of the email.
627000	632000	What console had the biggest impact on you?
632000	634000	Dark Sakura, why not?
634000	636000	You've played them all.
636000	638000	You have them all in your house.
638000	640000	You've got a ton of them in the vault.
640000	642000	Which one had the biggest impact on you?
643000	646000	I don't know.
646000	647000	Just because.
647000	652000	I mean, I've got different memories attached to each one of them.
652000	654000	So, um.
656000	657000	Go ahead.
657000	658000	Let me ask this.
658000	662000	If the house were on fire, and you had enough time to take one thing out of the vault,
662000	663000	what are you getting out of the vault?
663000	665000	Turbo graphics.
665000	667000	So there you go. I think that's the answer.
667000	671000	But the thing is, though, is that it wouldn't do me any good without the game.
671000	673000	So, kind of why.
673000	676000	I would just plug in the turbo graphics and stay in the house.
676000	680000	Or maybe even the Neo Geo, because then I could sell it and buy a new house.
680000	682000	Um, with all the cartridges.
682000	684000	Um, I got.
684000	686000	Okay.
686000	688000	I'm gonna do, like, my three.
688000	690000	For a reason.
690000	694000	When I was a little kid, my neighbors had a Magnavox Odyssey 2.
694000	696000	We played a shitload of that.
696000	698000	And that's what started video game addiction for me.
698000	700000	That machine right there.
700000	703000	And I had played, like, you know, Atari 2600s.
703000	705000	I'd played all the other things.
705000	707000	But that was the thing I played the most of as a kid.
707000	709000	Do you remember the game?
709000	710000	Quest for the Rings?
710000	713000	I had a feeling. Because when you did that, you did that as a classic game.
713000	715000	But it wasn't, like, the first.
715000	717000	Well, we said, fuck the board game. We just played the game.
717000	719000	But I remember you talking about that game.
719000	722000	And, like, Cryptologic or Crypt Equip.
722000	725000	And MC Crazy Chase and MC Munchkin.
725000	730000	And, um, the other racing game that was on the Crypt Equip 1.
730000	736000	And that was, you know, my afternoons after school.
736000	739000	Was playing the Magnavox Odyssey 2.
739000	741000	And I have one now.
741000	743000	I can't even hook it up to anything.
743000	746000	But I'm not getting rid of it for anything.
746000	749000	The next big one for me would be the ColecoVision.
749000	753000	And I think the ColecoVision is, like, the real big game changer.
753000	757000	Because it was the first video game system my family owned.
757000	759000	And my mom would play the shit out of it.
759000	763000	And her asshole husband would play the shit out of it.
766000	769000	My brothers were little babies.
769000	771000	I mean, Phillip was toddling around.
771000	773000	And Matt was an infant, you know.
773000	776000	I don't even know that Matt was born.
776000	778000	Yeah, Matt was born by that house.
778000	782000	Because I was thinking. Because I lived on the same street years later as a teenager.
782000	784000	When my grandma bought a house down the street.
784000	789000	But it was... I have a lot of memories, especially for that era.
789000	793000	And that was the real big thing that really got me started.
793000	795000	I mean, the Magnavox had been great.
795000	796000	And I had been playing it as a gamer.
796000	798000	But I could just, you know, sneak up at 3 a.m.
798000	802000	And play rounds of Space Fury until, you know, it was cross-eyed.
802000	808000	And so, as much as I love, you know, the NES.
808000	811000	Which I really super loved my NES.
811000	813000	And I played the crap ton out of that too.
813000	814000	And my mom would play it.
814000	817000	And I loved my Super Nintendo.
817000	820000	Which I didn't leave the house for, you know, ages.
820000	825000	But the ColecoVision was the one that was like the big game changer for me and my family.
825000	829000	Because it was something that all of us played together.
829000	831000	Which I think was the intention for it.
831000	834000	It wasn't just a kids thing here or a kids thing there.
834000	839000	It was a family thing for us.
839000	843000	And I really think that those were some of the best years for our family at that time.
843000	849000	You know, even though I, you know, got older and started realizing, you know, other things behind the scenes.
849000	851000	But it was a really good time.
851000	855000	We also watched Thriller and then went and played Space Fury.
855000	856000	That's about-
856000	858000	You're so 80s right now.
858000	859000	I can't help it.
859000	861000	Was it totally radical?
861000	863000	Gag me with a spoon.
863000	865000	Did you trade Garbage Pail Kids after?
865000	867000	No, I didn't. Those things gave me nightmares.
867000	868000	Really?
868000	870000	I'm serious. When those came out-
870000	871000	Did you see the movie?
871000	873000	No. No.
873000	875000	But my friends at school all had them.
875000	878000	And I went home and had like nightmares for a solid month.
878000	880000	I couldn't sleep outside of my covers.
880000	883000	Did you have an arm full of jelly bracelets?
883000	884000	Yes, I did.
884000	886000	That was my big thing was jelly bracelets.
886000	888000	I had jelly bracelets and I had the charm necklaces.
888000	890000	You know what I'm talking about, right?
890000	891000	I do. I do.
891000	896000	That was like when I was like super young, like second grade.
896000	898000	We're dating ourselves on this show.
898000	900000	Oh my god. Stop it.
900000	904000	I want to get to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com and some of the answers there.
904000	907000	DarkTatsuya says, I have to go with the NES.
907000	912000	DungeonBuster says, Atari VCS was neat, but the NES was like having an arcade experience at home.
912000	915000	Well, yeah, because the PayChoice 10 or whatever, that was an arcade thing.
915000	920000	sj100matt says, Super Nintendo would probably be for me, but it's so hard to choose just one.
920000	922000	It's like Sophie's choice to choose just one.
922000	924000	It is hard, but that's okay.
924000	928000	If you have one or two answers or like Jamie and have three, that's fine too.
928000	931000	No, technically I had two.
931000	938000	I had ones that were important, but none of them were as significant as the thing.
938000	939000	As a Coleco.
939000	940000	As a ColecoVision.
940000	941000	Which I still have that.
941000	943000	I still have my ColecoVision.
943000	944000	Oh yeah?
944000	946000	I bought another one and my mom found it and gave it to me.
946000	948000	They used to build them indestructible.
948000	949000	Those Atari 2600s?
949000	953000	You can launch them into orbit. They would, you know, land in the ocean.
953000	957000	They threw them in a landfill in New Mexico.
957000	959000	That wasn't the ColecoVision.
959000	960000	You could kill a man with those.
960000	962000	But Atari, those things are pricks.
962000	969000	Well, my friend accidentally dropped Kick to Super Nintendo off the second story balcony onto concrete.
969000	971000	And guess what? It still freaking worked.
971000	974000	Try that with your PS4, yo.
974000	975000	Alright.
975000	978000	Loki, how about you? The most important console for you.
978000	981000	I don't know. I mean, it depends.
981000	984000	There's a lot of different consoles that I've played.
984000	985000	I mean, I don't know.
985000	989000	Obviously, I would be more inclined to go with the earlier ones that I played.
989000	992000	I mean, I started off with the ColecoVision as well.
992000	995000	But I would actually have to say the PlayStation 1.
995000	999000	And the reason for that is because I played a lot of really great games on it.
999000	1004000	And it was a system that I had Dance Dance Revolution on.
1004000	1006000	So, of course, that is pretty important.
1006000	1013000	But, yeah, I think PlayStation 1, because that kind of got me into the whole, I don't know,
1013000	1017000	even just playing import games and kind of stuff like that.
1017000	1020000	Just really getting involved with that portion of it.
1020000	1024000	You know, it was because of this community, the DDR community.
1024000	1028000	And when I say this community, I mean all of us that met up playing DDR in Sacramento.
1028000	1030000	That this show was born of.
1030000	1035000	It was really because of that community that I even realized import gaming was a thing.
1035000	1040000	Like, you know, I always read the stories in Electronic Gaming Monthly or whatever.
1040000	1044000	Did you know Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan was totally different than what we had?
1044000	1046000	You know, I remember things like that.
1046000	1049000	But I never really got to play that stuff until Jamie was like,
1049000	1053000	I'm going to bring a plug over and you can play import games with it.
1053000	1057000	And we're going to play a real version of DDR and not USA Mix.
1057000	1059000	Did I bring over a third mix?
1059000	1064000	It was either you or the cast of Melrose Place that I used to live with back in the day.
1064000	1069000	No, I think I brought over a third mix because I had the burn at the time before I got my legit copy.
1069000	1071000	Yeah, I feel like it was either you or...
1071000	1073000	Because I got it from George.
1073000	1074000	Gotcha.
1074000	1078000	I do remember playing second mix on the Dreamcast at your house
1078000	1081000	with the dance pads that had the protective sheet for some reason.
1081000	1083000	And that were more like the slip and die?
1083000	1084000	Yeah.
1084000	1085000	Oh, God.
1085000	1086000	Sorry, Loki, not to derail you.
1086000	1088000	Yeah, I'd say that's probably why.
1088000	1090000	Because there was a lot of great games that played on that.
1090000	1093000	You know, Ridge Race R4 was amazing.
1093000	1095000	You know, Final Fantasy VII.
1095000	1098000	Just a lot of great gaming experiences.
1098000	1100000	Sure, I mean, you have that with every console.
1100000	1104000	And I don't know, I'd say maybe up to like the newest ones now, like PlayStation 4.
1104000	1108000	And maybe not so much the Xbox 360.
1108000	1110000	But like a lot of the newer ones, it's just kind of...
1110000	1113000	There's not really that big like, whoa factor from that.
1113000	1116000	You know, going from like Super Nintendo.
1116000	1118000	Nintendo 64 is pretty cool.
1118000	1123000	But I think like the PlayStation 1, there's a lot of really great games on there.
1123000	1127000	Some folks in chat talking about what bricks...
1127000	1132000	I mean, meaning not actual bricks, but like indestructible forces their consoles are.
1132000	1135000	Kaijuto in chat saying, Intellivisions should be around.
1135000	1139000	I spilled orange juice in my Atari 2600 and it still worked.
1139000	1142000	If I let a drop of water in any of the new consoles, it would fry, I bet.
1143000	1147000	And then Bobby Blackwell was saying, I wish the Intellivisions were indestructible, frown.
1147000	1150000	I finally have one that works. All others overheated.
1150000	1152000	Do you realize that they had that issue?
1152000	1157000	You know, sort of the problem about the Atari 7800 was not...
1157000	1160000	Or 7800, whatever number.
1160000	1161000	No, 7800.
1161000	1167000	Yeah, is that sometimes their power supplies would stop functioning properly.
1167000	1169000	And they're hard to find some of those power supplies.
1169000	1174000	The other problems back with the 5200 weren't the consoles themselves, but their controllers.
1174000	1176000	Those things are bitches.
1176000	1183000	Maybe all those reasons are why the Intellivisions games always seem to be the first in line when all the retro stuff comes up.
1183000	1186000	Like, Intellivisions always got something they're putting out.
1186000	1188000	Like when those flashback consoles...
1188000	1192000	I saw the Cliccovision flashback when they had that over at the Target over here.
1192000	1193000	Yeah.
1193000	1194000	And it...
1194000	1196000	I have the Intellivisions one, actually.
1196000	1199000	It was marked down, but it was marked down, like, $40. I'm like, ehhh.
1199000	1201000	I don't need that.
1201000	1206000	The 5200s, though, the problem with theirs is that a lot of the buttons would go out on the controller.
1206000	1209000	Yeah, and actually bmuls in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
1209000	1213000	But Intellivisions had the shittiest control ever besides the 5200.
1213000	1216000	The Cliccovision had a pretty awful controller, too.
1216000	1219000	I want, like, the flashback Dreamcast, or, like, flashback...
1219000	1221000	You know, we're, like, our more modern...
1221000	1223000	Give it time. Give it time. Sega?
1223000	1226000	Sega will milk that nostalgia for all it's worth. Give it a few more years.
1226000	1231000	Here's another bad one, and Dan, I think, had one of these as a kid with a Fairchild Channel F.
1231000	1232000	Mmm.
1232000	1233000	Those sucked.
1233000	1236000	Or a flashback TurboGrafx-16. I mean, where's that?
1236000	1240000	Alright, my turn. I have two answers for this, and I really can't decide between the two.
1240000	1241000	My first for my...
1241000	1242000	And you gave me a hard time.
1242000	1248000	I know, I know. My first would be the Commodore 64, which, I guess, technically...
1248000	1251000	What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?
1251000	1257000	It's technically not a console, but I would argue it is, because...
1257000	1262000	And it totally counts, because you could hook up a Commodore 64 to your television,
1262000	1267000	which is part of the reason why I would think in the 80s it was as successful as it was,
1267000	1275000	because, my God, people, if you think it's crazy today that we have to choose between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Wii U,
1275000	1282000	like, go back to a gaming magazine in the 80s and look at an ad for, like, Donkey Kong or something where it's shown.
1282000	1286000	Here it is on the ColecoVision, on the Atari, on the Commodore 20...
1286000	1290000	On the Commodore... I can't say the name right now.
1290000	1295000	On the Commodore 64, on the TI-99 4A, on the Apple IIe, on the...
1295000	1296000	I mean, like, you would literally see...
1296000	1304000	And I remember distinctly one of these ads was, like, 12 different monitors that would show one screenshot from the game on each console.
1304000	1310000	Somebody's gotta know where one of those retro ads are on the web and can link to it in chat.
1310000	1313000	But, yeah, it was just fascinating, like, all the stuff that was out there.
1313000	1320000	So Commodore 64 was always one of them, and my understanding is that Commodore 64s were really huge in Europe.
1320000	1328000	Like, they were a pretty big deal here in the States, but my understanding is that, usually when I bring up the Commodore 64 retro love here on OLR,
1328000	1333000	I'm hearing from somebody overseas that's, like, right there with me, because it was an even bigger deal.
1333000	1336000	It was an even bigger deal over there, and I think probably lasted a lot longer.
1336000	1343000	And I think the successor, the Amiga, well, one of many successors, I think that one did even better over there than it did over here.
1343000	1351000	But anyway, my reason is just probably simply because it is one of the first consoles I remember getting my hands on,
1351000	1358000	even more so than the Atari 2600, because I was always a fan of, and I think why I was always drawn to gaming in the first place,
1358000	1362000	was that I kind of had control over what was on the television.
1362000	1369000	Like, it's like, it's this interactive thing that I am doing. I am the actor that's on the screen,
1369000	1375000	although when I say actor, meaning I am the dot, or the big beady eyes in Haunted House in the 2600 or something.
1375000	1382000	But the Commodore 64, I think, took that even one step further, because you could write your own programs in Commodore 64 Basic,
1382000	1387000	which was a huge deal, right? And you used to be able to type in the programs from the back of magazines and all this stuff.
1387000	1393000	So, that was part of the reason why I loved the 64. And my dad was really into it, too,
1393000	1399000	and he loved the fact that I was really into Commodore 64, and I probably shouldn't be admitting this on my radio show,
1399000	1404000	but it's been, what, 30 years? The statute of limitations has long since passed.
1404000	1414000	He would bring back, like, discs that were from his railroad buddies of, like, all these games that he would get from his pals or whatever,
1414000	1419000	and, you know, I would just go to town with that and have so much fun playing all that different stuff.
1419000	1426000	And, you know, we certainly bought a lot ourselves, too. And, yeah, just really great memories with all that.
1426000	1434000	But then the other answer, honestly, is what is easily the greatest console they ever made anyway, which is the Super Nintendo.
1434000	1442000	And I just have such fond memories of the Super Nintendo, and I think really being blown away by Mode 7,
1442000	1448000	which was, like, the big new thing, right, that did, like, the kind of pseudo-3D effects and all that.
1448000	1452000	You know, if you've played Super Mario World, you've seen a little bit of Mode 7 in that,
1452000	1456000	but the game that I really remember falling in love with on Super Nintendo was Actraiser.
1456000	1461000	And, you know how you would, like, you play the little platforming level and go through that whole thing,
1461000	1465000	and then you have to go into the strategy type of level, the SimCity-esque.
1465000	1469000	I mean, it's really a bad comparison, but it's the best thing I can think of in the moment.
1469000	1473000	The SimCity-esque type of level, and when you would, like, go down to the action level,
1473000	1477000	it did this little thing with the Mode 7, and it went doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,
1477000	1480000	and it's like you're falling to the earth, because the whole thing is about, like,
1480000	1485000	you are basically God going down to save your people, essentially, and then everybody worships you.
1485000	1487000	So who wouldn't love a game where everybody worships you?
1487000	1493000	So I think the Super Nintendo just, and plus the library on the Super Nintendo, my God,
1493000	1496000	I mean, some of the best stuff they ever did put out.
1496000	1503000	I really think that was just, oh my God, some of the best gaming we've ever had,
1503000	1510000	and I don't even know if we'll ever be in that state of gaming ever again, I don't know.
1510000	1513000	Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1513000	1516000	Bobby Blackwolf, our pal at VOG Network, says,
1516000	1520000	I learned how to program on the Commodore 64, and it led to my career.
1520000	1525000	My dad was a raging pirate, the first video game I ever played was pirated by my dad.
1525000	1530000	He would get the pirated game from the local software store because his friend was the owner.
1530000	1536000	Hey, Kuratika just came out, won it, gets a copy disk of it, and leaves.
1536000	1543000	Bmole says, I had a TI-99-4A, I'm still jealous of the Commodore 64.
1543000	1548000	Let's see, Kaijuto says, Super Nintendo was okay to me.
1548000	1551000	I think I had like three of them at one point.
1551000	1555000	Those are some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
1555000	1560000	So there you go, there's some answers for you on what the most important consoles were,
1560000	1562000	not just from us, but from our listeners.
1562000	1566000	That was a great question, so worthy of starting off our show tonight.
1566000	1569000	And I have to say something about this at some point.
1569000	1579000	It was a pretty crazy week out there as far as celebrities and sad news coming again and again.
1579000	1585000	In fact, right after OLR last week was when the news came out about David Bowie and that he had passed.
1585000	1594000	And yeah, just a lot of sadness out there, understandably, with so much talent being lost just in the past week
1594000	1600000	between Bowie and Alan Rickman and just so many great talents that were lost in the past week.
1600000	1603000	So I'm glad we could start tonight with something a little bit more positive.
1603000	1608000	I was going to also say happy birthday to Betty White, who turns 94 today.
1608000	1611000	And you all know we love Betty White here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1611000	1614000	I just hope she's in a protective plastic bubble somewhere.
1614000	1618000	That is my hope, and that she's doing very well wherever she's at.
1618000	1623000	She has to kill other celebrities in order to suck their life force and stay alive.
1623000	1628000	As long as those other celebrities are like Kardashians or something, I'd be okay with that.
1628000	1634000	Anyhow, let's get into our gaming week.
1634000	1638000	So we've talked a lot about retro stuff, but we're going to get into our gaming week
1638000	1640000	and the type of games that we've been playing this week.
1640000	1643000	But I do want to say something here before we get into our gaming weeks.
1643000	1645000	It is a three-day weekend here in the States.
1645000	1651000	For me, it's a three-day weekend. If you are in certain industries, it's a three-day weekend.
1651000	1653000	But low cap makes us work.
1653000	1658000	Let's not forget, though, the achievements of Martin Luther King
1658000	1660000	and the reason why some of us have Monday off.
1660000	1663000	But anyhow, we do have a three-day weekend this weekend,
1663000	1666000	so I thought that was a good excuse to break out some alcohol.
1666000	1668000	The sludge that I made.
1668000	1671000	And we're going to do some responsible drinking. Yeah, this is really old.
1671000	1674000	It's still okay because I've still got some in my fridge.
1674000	1677000	Yeah, this is like the candy corn stuff you made at Halloween.
1677000	1678000	This is the candy corn vodka.
1678000	1684000	All right, so I'm going to apologize now, but I'm going to get a little drunker as tonight's show goes on.
1684000	1686000	This is going to wear off in 30 minutes.
1686000	1688000	Not for me. Here we go.
1688000	1690000	Yay, toast.
1692000	1694000	Oh, it's still strong. Oh, boy.
1694000	1695000	Oh, my glass is empty.
1695000	1696000	Oh, boy.
1696000	1697000	Oh, I feel that in my nose.
1697000	1699000	All right. Let's get into our-
1699000	1701000	It's so good.
1701000	1705000	Let's get into our games, the type of stuff we've been playing this week.
1705000	1707000	Darsaga, how was your gaming week?
1707000	1709000	I make delicious shit there.
1709000	1715000	Okay, so I've been playing a crap load of Heroes of Dragon Age on iOS.
1715000	1717000	I actually like it.
1717000	1720000	I'm playing Ingress more because I met people.
1720000	1723000	I got recruited, I think.
1723000	1727000	One of us, one of us.
1727000	1729000	Oh, is the alcohol burning?
1729000	1731000	No, I have a bubble in my throat.
1731000	1732000	Ew.
1732000	1733000	Okay, now I feel better.
1733000	1737000	That was a very Ladylike birth that luckily she was a microphone away.
1737000	1739000	Well, I've let him rip on the thing.
1739000	1741000	I'm not a lady.
1741000	1743000	I'm whatever.
1743000	1746000	All right, so Dragon Age, Ingress, what else?
1746000	1752000	We had, I forgot.
1752000	1756000	Oh, yeah, I picked up Omnicron, of course.
1756000	1760000	But I'm really not going to play it.
1760000	1762000	I couldn't bring myself to play it, so I didn't.
1763000	1771000	And, oh, shoot, I got another game, Hexes, something like that.
1771000	1773000	But I haven't really played it either.
1773000	1778000	I just really haven't played much of anything because I'm working on a new graphic design project.
1778000	1781000	So most of it's just been iOS gaming.
1781000	1785000	Oh, yeah, and I finally started Super Hexagon, but I suck at it and quit.
1785000	1787000	So I'm done.
1787000	1790000	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1790000	1795000	Which, by the way, before Loki gets into his week, I just want to point out in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com, thank you.
1795000	1798000	Fifth Dream found one of those old images that I was talking about.
1798000	1810000	It's a Qbert ad where you can see it on the Atari 5200, the TI-99, the Atari 800, the Intellivision, the Commodore VIC-20, the Atari 2600, the 64, and the ColecoVision.
1810000	1812000	So that's eight different screenshots.
1812000	1814000	The ColecoVision version was great.
1814000	1819000	Yeah, I mean, they were all pretty good except maybe, I don't know, I don't remember the 2600 version being that great.
1819000	1820000	But anyway.
1820000	1822000	The 5200 version was really good.
1822000	1824000	Anyhow, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1824000	1831000	So mainly I played Fallout 4, so I'm, I don't know, I'm like pretty far into it now.
1831000	1835000	And still not doing the storyline quest because, of course, who does the storyline quest?
1835000	1837000	We know the ending's going to be shit.
1837000	1844000	And so I just haven't figured out which faction I'm going to, I mean, because I stupidly joined the Minutemen in the beginning of the game.
1844000	1853000	But then I don't know, like, which quests are going to stick me to be on the Brotherhood of Steel or with the Railroad.
1853000	1857000	And, I mean, honestly, I don't mind either one.
1857000	1863000	I kind of was deciding maybe on the Railroad, not necessarily because of the views of the characters and everything,
1863000	1870000	but because I wanted to destroy the Brotherhood of Steel because they seem to be more of a challenge than the other people.
1870000	1874000	I don't know, though, yet, so still playing through all the side quests and that.
1874000	1877000	And then, what else?
1877000	1886000	Oh, I played, yes, I did back on Kickstarter a while back, that Dragon Cancer, so finally that made its way out.
1886000	1891000	And I knew kind of what I was getting into, just playing it, and it's an incredibly depressing game.
1891000	1899000	As, you know, the subject of, you know, parents dealing with a child that has cancer and, you know, spoiler, ends up dying.
1899000	1904000	Is not exactly, you know, flowers and puppies.
1904000	1907000	I mean, it's just, it is a very depressing game.
1907000	1909000	And so, yes, that's what it was.
1909000	1919000	I bought that game day one just to support it and this whole, you know, we've been very fortunate that we've had a lot of very artistic games coming out in the past couple years
1919000	1923000	and things that really push the envelope of what is a game.
1923000	1928000	And so I just wanted to support this game and I do want to play it, but I also know it's going to be an ugly cry.
1928000	1932000	So I have to be in the right, it's got to be the right night.
1932000	1943000	It's just hard hearing the recordings of, like, this child and hearing, like, his parents talking and the other, you know, the other brother or whatever.
1943000	1951000	You know, just hearing them and talking about, you know, going through all that, it's just, like, horrible.
1951000	1957000	Because, you know, you know what the outcome is going to be, or even if you don't, I mean, it's just, it's just horrible.
1957000	1969000	The only, if I were to nitpick about it, the only thing I don't like about it, and I understand what their point was, they were trying to make it something for, like, so everybody had a part of it.
1969000	1977000	It was, like, kind of like a game so that, you know, they could, I don't know, I guess be a part of the game.
1977000	1986000	So they had, like, people submitting, like, you know, cards and stuff, you know, for their family members that may have died from cancer or, like, other things or pictures and artwork and that kind of stuff.
1987000	1994000	And so, like, there's a part in the game where you're, like, able to, like, go through the hospital and, like, read some of these cards to their son.
1994000	1999000	And a lot of them end up being just, like, random cards to, like, other people, like, complete strangers that may have backed it on Kickstarter.
1999000	2002000	And it just kind of, like, pulled you out of the whole thing.
2002000	2010000	Interesting, because I've heard, on the other hand, that that scene is very impactful because of the volume and the fact that there are all these other stories about it.
2010000	2011000	Just another perspective.
2011000	2012000	I don't know, I just thought, like...
2012000	2015000	I've heard that that is actually one of the more powerful scenes in the game.
2015000	2020000	I just thought it was supposed to be, you know, it's more, like, should have been focused on the actual kid, you know, and everything and their family.
2020000	2026000	And just, like, you know, I can understand, like, if in their room it was all, like, stuff for, like, that kid and everything.
2026000	2032000	But, like, it was just random cards for, like, people that aren't necessarily a part of their family or anything.
2032000	2033000	It's just, like, what?
2033000	2037000	The chat is asking, what game is this again?
2037000	2038000	This is That Dragon Cancer.
2038000	2039000	That's the name of the game.
2040000	2043000	Yes, or you're going to be crying when you play the game.
2044000	2045000	Basically.
2045000	2046000	Ugly cries the game?
2046000	2047000	Ugly cries the game, yes.
2047000	2048000	Ugly cry.
2048000	2049000	Ugly cry.
2050000	2052000	Yeah, it's very depressing, so...
2053000	2054000	So, yeah.
2054000	2055000	I'm going to stick with that a lot to me.
2055000	2056000	Yeah, I got...
2056000	2058000	I only made it through partway through the game.
2058000	2063000	It was, like, it was late at night and I was just, like, okay, listen, I'm not going to, like, spend my entire night playing this.
2063000	2069000	So, I got up to the point where the doctor basically says, oh, there's...
2069000	2071000	The treatment's not working, so there's more we can do, type of thing.
2071000	2074000	I was, like, okay, that's what we're stopping for now.
2074000	2076000	But, yeah, it's pretty bad.
2077000	2080000	I mean, as far as, like, you know, the feels or whatever.
2080000	2082000	So, I'll probably finish it.
2082000	2085000	It's not a very long game, so I'll go through that later on.
2086000	2088000	And that's pretty much all I played this week.
2088000	2089000	Okay.
2089000	2090000	My gaming week.
2090000	2093000	A lot of similar things to what I've played before.
2093000	2098000	A little more Minecraft on PlayStation 4 just because, I don't know, just was feeling it.
2098000	2104000	I even played Just Dance 2016 today a little bit because I bought that, like, weeks ago and I had yet to play it.
2104000	2106000	So, I finally played that a little bit today.
2106000	2113000	I don't know if I like the whole unlimited subscription thing online because they really try to kind of force that with...
2113000	2118000	Like, they show those songs on the song select, but it's, like, oh, but you have to be a member of unlimited to play these songs.
2118000	2119000	It's kind of...
2119000	2124000	I mean, you can do a sort that's just the disc songs or whatever, but I don't know, it's just a little...
2124000	2126000	It's a weird direction for me.
2126000	2130000	But the game itself is pretty much just like all the other Just Dance games.
2130000	2133000	So, you already know if you're going to like this game or not, I think.
2133000	2139000	It's a good workout for me in the privacy of my own home with no one else watching.
2139000	2141000	That's why I enjoy these type of games.
2141000	2145000	And I'm happy they do have, like, a workout mode type thing in them.
2145000	2153000	Another game that is one I've talked about on the show before that I've been playing a lot of this weekend is Diablo III.
2153000	2161000	Which, you know, that game is years old at this point, but Blizzard's been keeping Diablo pretty fresh with patches every now and then.
2161000	2166000	They just did a pretty big one that launched Season 5 this weekend.
2166000	2173000	So, the whole deal is that everybody starts a new character at the same time, essentially, and tries to go for different goals.
2173000	2179000	And as you go through the season, you can unlock transmog gear, like, you know, just cosmetic-only things.
2179000	2184000	You can unlock, like, a little pet. Like, there's a little tree pet this season you can get.
2184000	2186000	Little banners, things like that.
2186000	2190000	So, I get into the season thing, and it's something Alan and I do together.
2190000	2192000	So, we actually rolled some new characters.
2192000	2197000	Or, actually, one of the things they did with this patch is that because, like, everybody's running out of character slots,
2197000	2203000	what you can do now is you convert one of your existing non-seasonal characters into a seasonal character.
2203000	2210000	And it resets that character to level 1, and then moves all your gear back into your general character pool.
2210000	2214000	Because they're meant to be different. You're not supposed to just play a character you've played for years and years in the season.
2214000	2217000	But they don't want seasons to be a waste, either.
2217000	2221000	So, at the end of the season, all of your experience dumps into your general pool.
2221000	2227000	So, I know after the last season, I got, like, easily 200 Paragon points plus in my general pool,
2227000	2232000	because I had so much that I had accrued on this last season, Season 4.
2232000	2236000	So, I'm excited to do that again with Season 5, and I'm rolling a Witch Doctor.
2236000	2242000	I want to do the, funny enough, the Harvester build, which they now give you sets as you play the game.
2242000	2246000	So, take out a little bit of the randomness of it, but I think it's a good thing.
2246000	2248000	So, yeah, I'm really enjoying the Diablo patch.
2248000	2254000	One other thing I had to say about the PC version, because this whole seasons thing I just talked about is not on consoles.
2254000	2258000	And it's because the fact that the consoles are not online,
2258000	2270000	and my understanding is there's already cheater players that play online that are, like, Paragon level 11y billion that are just, you know, leveling people to obscene levels.
2270000	2272000	So, it's already been tainted, basically.
2272000	2277000	So, the console ones don't get seasons because they're not always online, which I know that was a whole other controversy,
2277000	2282000	but, you know, here's where we are, and this is part of the perk, I guess, of being always online,
2282000	2286000	is that they can keep the integrity for the most part of the game.
2286000	2289000	So, I've been playing a lot of that this weekend.
2289000	2293000	One other game I played a little bit of today, I just downloaded it today,
2293000	2297000	and it was based off a recommendation from some Twitter pals of mine that said I should play this.
2297000	2300000	It's a game called Oxenfree, which just came out.
2300000	2302000	I've seen the ad for it.
2302000	2305000	Yeah, it just came out on Xbox One, and it's on PC as well.
2305000	2311000	And that game, it kind of reminds me of an old PC point and click game,
2312000	2318000	except that you're controlling the character, and you're participating in these conversations,
2318000	2323000	and the dialogue flows very different than, like, say, Mass Effect.
2323000	2327000	You know, I love Mass Effect, but in Mass Effect, the game comes to a halt,
2327000	2331000	and you choose what your answer's going to be, and then it proceeds.
2331000	2336000	In this game, you have to kind of choose your answer as the conversation's going.
2336000	2340000	So, it gives it a lot more of a natural flow to it,
2340000	2343000	and I think also might cause you to say things that you might not actually say
2343000	2345000	if you had time to think about it.
2345000	2348000	So, I think that brings an interesting perspective to it,
2348000	2353000	and I haven't played an awful lot of the game, but I'm liking what I see so far.
2353000	2355000	So, I'm going to talk to you more about this game hopefully next week,
2355000	2359000	but, you know, just about 45 minutes into the game or whatever,
2359000	2363000	I think it's very interesting, so I'm having a good time with that.
2363000	2368000	Let's see, over at live.vognetwork.com, looking at some of the comments in chat,
2368000	2370000	let's see, Kaijuto says,
2370000	2372000	Diablo 3, is that still a thing?
2372000	2376000	Notice how the other two hosts get very quiet when Rob talks Diablo 3, lol.
2376000	2377000	Well, but...
2377000	2379000	I always play Nickelodeon to me.
2379000	2381000	I don't have Diablo 3, nor have I played it, so...
2381000	2387000	I get quiet when, you know, she talks about stuff that I haven't played, or he does, you know, so I realize...
2387000	2390000	It's respectful silence, but I always play Nickelodeon to me.
2390000	2393000	You were looking at cat butts in Nickelodeon to me.
2393000	2395000	They have cute little buttholes!
2395000	2397000	I just think that's so funny.
2397000	2399000	No, okay, there's a thing about this.
2399000	2401000	Things I didn't expect Dark Soccer to say on the show for $200.
2401000	2404000	There's a thing about this, is that Dan has this shirt,
2404000	2406000	and it's one of those big dog shirts, right?
2406000	2410000	And it says, if you're not the leader, this is the view you see, or something,
2410000	2413000	and it's the big dog's butt, but he has no butthole.
2413000	2416000	And it always bothered me that the big dog had no butthole.
2416000	2419000	So, like, what, is he full of shit?
2419000	2424000	So, I don't know what it is, but seeing the little cat buttholes are...
2424000	2429000	No, you're not the first person to make that observation about that game, I'm just saying.
2429000	2434000	I had a friend that had, like, 20 cats, and purposely waited for them to be all turned around
2434000	2437000	before they took a screenshot, and then posted a status to Facebook that was like,
2437000	2440000	look at all those buttholes, lol.
2441000	2443000	The cat buttholes are the best buttholes.
2447000	2451000	Oh my god, alright, if they didn't unsubscribe when I was singing,
2451000	2453000	they probably unsubscribed during cat butts, I'm just saying.
2453000	2456000	No, they agreed with me. We got more subscribers for that, Rob.
2456000	2457000	Fair enough.
2458000	2461000	Let's see, also from our chatroom over at live.voguenetwork.com,
2461000	2463000	Brad from Pot Culture agreeing with you.
2463000	2465000	That game is crack.
2465000	2467000	And Alan Alchemy in chat says,
2467000	2470000	seeing a cat's butthole unintentionally and far more than you'd like
2470000	2473000	is a universal experience for any cat owner.
2474000	2475000	Yes.
2476000	2477000	Especially with Midna.
2477000	2479000	I think that's true with any cat.
2479000	2481000	Oh, I have woken up in the morning to see
2481000	2484000	Alpha feel f-f- across my nose,
2484000	2487000	and I look up and the first thing I see is Midna's butt.
2488000	2491000	And I look over and Dan's just laughing in the corner,
2491000	2493000	I'm like, you did this on purpose.
2493000	2495000	He'll be like, I did nothing, I just let her in the room.
2497000	2500000	He's just standing there going better her than me.
2500000	2502000	He's been cat butted before.
2503000	2505000	Alright, this is going to a weird place.
2505000	2508000	We need to, uh, we need to get into some gaming news tonight,
2508000	2510000	but first some quick housekeeping.
2510000	2513000	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
2513000	2516000	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2516000	2520000	And we will not be here live next month
2520000	2522000	for the weekend of February 21st.
2522000	2524000	We will not be here.
2524000	2526000	Due to me being at MAGFest,
2526000	2528000	which is getting closer and closer,
2528000	2531000	I booked my plane ticket, I got the hotel, I'm really excited.
2531000	2533000	So, uh, looking forward to MAGFest.
2533000	2534000	And thank you SHA100Matt,
2534000	2537000	started a topic on our forums over at vognetwork.com
2537000	2539000	to do a little planning.
2539000	2541000	And of course my first question was,
2541000	2543000	what if there's a snowmageddon,
2543000	2545000	like there was in Boston,
2545000	2547000	just before PAX?
2547000	2550000	Is there a way I can get around and get to where I need to go?
2550000	2554000	So, some good tips there from our forums over at vognetwork.com.
2554000	2556000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news for the week.
2556000	2558000	Starting off with Loki.
2558000	2562000	Alright, so there's going to be a fan-made Fallout game,
2562000	2564000	or not Fallout game, a Half-Life game,
2564000	2566000	that's going to be coming to Steam soon.
2566000	2569000	It's actually going to be kind of like an unofficial sequel
2569000	2572000	to Half-Life Opposing Force.
2572000	2574000	And they're actually going to be selling it on Steam.
2574000	2577000	And I guess they've gotten their, um,
2577000	2579000	basically the approval from Valve.
2579000	2584000	And I guess it's, you take the role of Adrian Shephard.
2584000	2590000	And I guess the, this is during the events of Half-Life 2.
2590000	2592000	And they're going to be selling the game for,
2592000	2595000	it looks like, $9.99 on Steam.
2596000	2600000	So, interesting that that's happening.
2600000	2602000	So maybe that's what it's going to take is, you know,
2602000	2606000	Half-Life 3 won't be done by, you know, Valve.
2606000	2610000	It's going to be some other company that's putting it out, I guess.
2610000	2612000	So this is it, this is Half-Life 3,
2612000	2614000	or at least the closest you're going to get to it, right?
2614000	2616000	Well, I don't think this is Half-Life 3,
2616000	2619000	but it is, like, kind of a neat side story.
2619000	2622000	This reminds me of, like, that portal stories, Mel,
2622000	2624000	but at least that game didn't cost anything.
2624000	2626000	And that was just kind of like a free expansion
2626000	2629000	that someone made that you can kind of play.
2629000	2630000	So this thing is going to be something different.
2630000	2634000	It's a 13-level game that takes place during, like, Half-Life 2.
2634000	2635000	So that's kind of cool.
2636000	2638000	All right. By the way, the chatters were telling me
2638000	2641000	that my audio was cutting out, so I switched microphones.
2641000	2643000	So if I sound a little different, it's because I'm on a new microphone
2643000	2646000	and hopefully that sounds a little better.
2646000	2649000	Anyhow, going to another story about,
2649000	2653000	remember the Xbox 360 and how broken it was in some places?
2653000	2656000	Remember when the console came out and it would break itself
2656000	2658000	and all that hilarity that ensued?
2658000	2661000	All right, well, anyway, it wasn't just the fact
2661000	2664000	that the consoles were red-ringing that was an issue,
2664000	2670000	but there was the case about the disks being scratched way too easy.
2670000	2672000	There was actually a class-action lawsuit
2672000	2674000	that was brought by Xbox 360 owners
2674000	2677000	over the fact that the console would scratch disks.
2677000	2679000	Yeah, it's because they didn't include, like, padding
2679000	2681000	at the top of the CD-ROM drive or whatever
2681000	2683000	to help prevent it from rocking back and forth.
2683000	2686000	And I also always thought if you ran your Xbox vertical,
2686000	2689000	it was more prone to this. Is that true?
2689000	2693000	Well, I mean, I guess it's prone to it if it's vertical
2693000	2696000	because it can be knocked over, so that's a possibility.
2696000	2699000	But any time that it would jiggle the disk in there,
2699000	2701000	because normally a lot of the CD-ROM drives
2701000	2705000	will have some sort of padding to help keep the disk level
2705000	2708000	or have some sort of thing to keep the disk in place.
2708000	2710000	But because it was missing this,
2710000	2714000	if it got jostled, it would basically push the disk up against the actual laser,
2714000	2718000	and that would just carve a nice little circle into your disk.
2718000	2722000	Well, LOL, our legal system, and this thing's been tied up.
2722000	2724000	I mean, because we're talking about the 360, right?
2724000	2726000	So you already know this is kind of older news,
2726000	2728000	but here's how long this has been going on.
2728000	2732000	So in 2012, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit,
2732000	2734000	saying there wasn't enough actual complaints,
2734000	2736000	basically, to have a class action.
2736000	2739000	But then in March 2015, that was overturned.
2739000	2741000	Well, now guess who's getting involved?
2741000	2743000	The Supreme Court. That's right.
2743000	2748000	The big ones, the nine that make a lot of big decisions here in this country.
2748000	2750000	So here's the deal, though.
2750000	2753000	The Supreme Court is not hearing necessarily the case.
2753000	2760000	They are just hearing whether or not it can even be heard as a class action lawsuit.
2760000	2762000	So that is what's happened.
2762000	2766000	I mean, still, the fact that the Supreme Court is now getting involved in this issue
2766000	2768000	is kind of fascinating.
2768000	2774000	So, yeah, these lawsuits go all the way back to 2007.
2774000	2779000	Then in 2008, there were leaked documents saying that Microsoft knew the 360 had a problem.
2779000	2785000	And now the Supreme Court is going to basically see if a class action lawsuit is even possible in this case,
2785000	2788000	which, I mean, if they even come back and say, yes, they can proceed with a class action lawsuit,
2788000	2792000	there's going to be another two or three years before we hear anything.
2792000	2796000	And then that's when everybody will get a little postcard in the mail,
2796000	2800000	did you buy an Xbox 360 between this date and this date?
2800000	2801000	How many?
2801000	2810000	Send in a postcard and get your $5 or Microsoft has agreed to give you a free copy of Halo 3 for, you know.
2810000	2814000	How many copies can I redeem? Because I had like 12 systems at one time.
2814000	2817000	That's right. You had a ton of Xbox 360s.
2817000	2818000	I did. I bought a ton of them.
2818000	2819000	You did.
2819000	2821000	I think I only have two now.
2822000	2824000	So we'll see what happens with the Supreme Court.
2824000	2827000	But that, I mean, don't expect that ruling till, what, summer?
2827000	2829000	It's going to be a while.
2829000	2830000	All right. Anyhow, moving on.
2830000	2831000	Dark Sakura.
2831000	2835000	Well, I kind of made a mention of this before since it's one of the games I picked up.
2835000	2847000	But you can get a free game thanks to Square in honor of David Bowie's passing is Omikron is there for free.
2848000	2857000	They had put a link up on the Square Enix Twitter for the US or the European editions of the game.
2857000	2862000	You have to sign up for an account on Square, which I already had one.
2862000	2869000	But, yeah, you just put in Omikron as the code and you get Omikron the Nomad Zill for free.
2869000	2871000	I think that's a nice gesture.
2871000	2872000	That's a very nice gesture.
2872000	2873000	I don't think-
2873000	2874000	And it's got original music in it.
2874000	2880000	To be fair, I don't think that game really was huge, you know, but that was the thing about Bowie.
2880000	2885000	Bowie was very experimental and he was on a lot of the tech waves really early.
2885000	2891000	Do you remember Bowie Net? He had his own Internet service provider for a while.
2891000	2896000	You could. Yeah. I mean, that was he was really ahead of the curve with a lot of technology things.
2896000	2904000	And he called the Internet destroying the music industry like way before the music industry was going to admit to it.
2904000	2908000	You know what I mean? When I say destroying, just the whole shifting with the streaming and everything.
2908000	2911000	Bowie was really tuned into that. So, you know.
2911000	2915000	But at any rate, though, it does have I mean, he's in the game.
2915000	2920000	And instead of just using his old music, he made new music for the game.
2920000	2921000	That's awesome.
2921000	2925000	So, yeah, worth the free purchase.
2925000	2931000	Also, it gives you a Steam key so it's not through any of Square's proprietary delivery systems.
2931000	2937000	Cool. I will have to check that out. I've not taken advantage of that yet, but I would like to. I'll check that out.
2937000	2939000	I believe you have until the 22nd.
2939000	2942000	OK, so I have a little more time just to hear the new songs, if nothing else.
2942000	2949000	OK, I know it's not directly related to gaming, but since the man was an artist and so well-respected by many, I have to ask everybody.
2949000	2951000	Favorite Bowie song?
2951000	2953000	Dar Sakra. Favorite David Bowie song?
2953000	2954000	Moonage Daydream.
2954000	2956000	Why?
2956000	2958000	Just.
2958000	2962000	It's just I don't really know. It's just one of my favorites.
2962000	2969000	You know, it's got that sort of, you know, the 70s space rock era, you know, like what?
2969000	2973000	Well, I mean, if you want to look at other people who've done like that space rock thing,
2973000	2980000	Lemmy did it with his band before Motorhead, which I can't now remember the name of the group to save my life.
2980000	2984000	But it was just one of those. It's driving yet.
2984000	2989000	It's kind of mellow. It's both at the same time.
2989000	2992000	And it's seriously. And I about squealed when I heard it in Guardians of the Galaxy.
2992000	2995000	I was like, oh, my God, it's Moonage Daydream.
2995000	3001000	And I honestly, in fact, I honestly think it's a better song than Space Oddity, but it's on the same album.
3001000	3004000	Sure. But yeah, it's it's seriously one of my favorites.
3004000	3009000	If I was going to have to pick a second.
3009000	3014000	I would probably pick As the World Falls Down.
3014000	3017000	My favorite would be and this is going to sound a little strange.
3017000	3020000	I'm picking something that goes, I think, against the grain a little bit.
3020000	3023000	But my favorite is I'm Afraid of Americans.
3023000	3027000	Well, because I really like learn to appreciate.
3027000	3031000	I mean, I liked Bowie's, you know, gender fuck of the 70s phase and all that stuff.
3031000	3035000	But I really grew to appreciate him during the industrial music phase and Earthling.
3035000	3038000	And that whole album was really, I think, underrated.
3038000	3043000	And let's not forget that I'm Afraid of Americans was originally on the Showgirls soundtrack.
3043000	3046000	Truth as a true story. So it's it's in the movie.
3046000	3049000	And but anyway, actually, my love of that song really didn't have to do with that.
3049000	3056000	It's just another plus. But fun fact, you know, I've been doing Internet radio even before Orange Lawns Radio.
3056000	3060000	I was co-hosting with Travis Donovan on Understation Live.
3060000	3067000	And before that, I was doing stuff at the university and we were online on Real Audio back in the day.
3067000	3073000	And I remember when Earthling came out, I would play a track from that album every other week.
3073000	3077000	Easy. And it was, you know, my favorite ones were that and Little Wonder, you know.
3077000	3080000	So, yeah, I that was probably my favorite Bowie song.
3080000	3083000	But I mean, certainly there's a lot that I love.
3084000	3086000	Loki? Favorite Bowie song?
3086000	3090000	I don't know. Probably their heroes or Let's Dance.
3090000	3091000	I don't know.
3091000	3093000	Let's Dance is a good one. That's a classic.
3093000	3097000	And that's the DDR one. Let's Dance is in DDR.
3097000	3099000	One of the newer ones. So there you go.
3099000	3102000	All right. Anyhow, good memories. Good memories.
3102000	3104000	Let's move on, though, with more gaming.
3104000	3108000	I have to say, AkumaJP also did nail Under Pressure.
3108000	3114000	Just makes me think that he's he and Freddie Mercury are pulling off a big Galaxy concert.
3114000	3117000	I and I think that's a fantastic point.
3117000	3125000	I would have said that song. However, I do consider that at its core a Queen song because it was Queen featuring David Bowie.
3125000	3132000	But I mean, not to diminish that song by any means, because that is a one of the all time greatest.
3132000	3134000	One thing to point out. Last thing, if you don't mind.
3134000	3135000	Yeah, sure.
3135000	3139000	Is that David Bowie also was kind of genre bending as well.
3139000	3145000	I mean, if you want to look back, you know, years, he did Little Drummer Boy with Bing Crosby.
3145000	3150000	Why do you think Madonna was so affected? Because Madonna said a lot about David Bowie's passing.
3150000	3154000	And why do you think she was so affected? He was doing it before she was.
3154000	3155000	Yeah.
3155000	3159000	Which I know she gets a lot of credit for always, you know, shape shifting and changing things.
3159000	3164000	Bowie was doing it before she did. Not to not to diminish Madonna's accomplishments, of which there are many.
3164000	3166000	But, you know, Bowie did it first.
3166000	3169000	And he stayed looking amazing without, well, it probably did have some surgery.
3169000	3171000	He probably had a little surgery, but.
3171000	3180000	But I would almost say you run into almost any artist and they would say that he probably was a shaping factor in their life.
3180000	3182000	I know he was for mine. So.
3182000	3187000	Oh, wow. Excellent point by Alan Alchemy in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com.
3187000	3190000	Let's Dance was in Elite Beat Agents.
3190000	3196000	And so that was definitely a way a lot of us music game fans got exposed to that song was Elite Beat Agents.
3196000	3200000	God, that game was so good. Why? Why couldn't there have been another one?
3200000	3205000	I mean, I know there were two in Japan, but it's not it's just different.
3205000	3208000	Man, now I'm really in a bad mood.
3208000	3211000	All right. Let's see if our next news story can perk me back up.
3211000	3212000	Loki.
3212000	3222000	So this, you know, I'd say 2015 is probably, you know, you know, big year for remakes and announcements like of that sort.
3222000	3225000	Well, here's one I never thought I'd see a remake on.
3225000	3235000	You may remember this as a mini game part of Penn and Teller Smoke and Mirrors, but the probably the one that most people remember is Desert Bus.
3235000	3241000	You know, the real life simulation of driving a bus across the desert.
3241000	3245000	Well, it also comes back into gaming culture every year with the Desert Bus Marathon.
3245000	3247000	Yeah, they do different marathons and stuff like that.
3247000	3254000	So apparently they are going to be remaking Desert Bus into a VR game.
3254000	3260000	Yes, that's right. So why?
3260000	3265000	Penn Gillette basically said, you know, during like one of his podcasts that he's working on the game.
3265000	3269000	He's working with Randy Pitchford and we're going to do and this is a big, big deal.
3269000	3272000	We're going to do a new Desert Bus. It's going to be just for charities.
3272000	3277000	So charities can use it to raise money and it's going to be in VR.
3277000	3282000	I OK. I'm going to ask a challenging question and I don't mean to sound like a dick.
3282000	3289000	However, is that really I mean, if you do something to kind of force like it's for charity,
3289000	3292000	like the Desert Bus thing was something that happened really naturally.
3292000	3295000	And you know what I mean? So to kind of like, oh, we're going to make this VR thing.
3295000	3299000	And it's it's just for that. Like it's kind of like trying to force lightning to strike a second time.
3299000	3302000	Does that make sense? That makes sense. Like I just I don't want.
3302000	3306000	I don't really understand what would be the point. I mean, so it's in VR.
3306000	3309000	It'd still be boring. I mean, it's just like what? And I can look around.
3309000	3316000	Well, I think I think for the hilarity of it and the novelty of that, I'm it's not going to.
3316000	3318000	I'm kind of surprised no one's done it already.
3318000	3322000	It's not going to be that difficult of a game to make in VR. I'm sure it depends.
3322000	3326000	It depends how nice they choose to make it. I mean, they could put more scenery in it.
3326000	3331000	I don't know what they're going to actually do with it. So it kind of depends how far they go with that.
3331000	3337000	But I just then when I hear like we're doing it just for the charity and do all these charity events and stuff,
3337000	3343000	it's like I don't I don't want to hate on charities because, of course, anything that is for charities is a good thing.
3343000	3350000	But I just feel like don't don't force it. Let it let these things kind of become a meme or whatever naturally.
3350000	3355000	You know, I mean, I don't know. That's just kind of my my thoughts on it.
3355000	3360000	No one asked you to do this. Yeah, sort of. I know. But then I'm like, OK, well, if they're just going to remake it for the lols,
3360000	3364000	and I'm sure it's not going to take a tremendous amount of effort in this day and age, then do it.
3364000	3369000	It'll be funny. And then maybe, yeah, maybe Desert Bus will do one of the trips in VR or something,
3369000	3373000	or they'll incorporate it into their charity drive. But, you know,
3373000	3379000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sometimes when a game is that good, one is all you need.
3379000	3385000	SG100Matt says, I'm sure he was thinking about remaking the game because of the charity marathons,
3385000	3390000	but VR came along, so he's making it for that. Well, if that's if I'm misinterpreting the quote, then that's fine.
3390000	3393000	I mean, if the charity thing inspired him to remake the game, then OK, cool.
3393000	3399000	That's great that, you know, a good cause could bring that game as awful as it is back into the limelight.
3399000	3406000	So anyway. All right, let's move on to another story that has a lot of people talking this week,
3406000	3410000	and it has to do with Twilight Princess. That's right.
3410000	3417000	The big, big game from the GameCube and the Wii launch title coming back for the Wii U.
3417000	3422000	And some more information came out in Famitsu on The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD.
3422000	3427000	However, there wasn't a lot of new information in the Famitsu article, just some pretty pictures.
3427000	3432000	But some sharp-eyed folks notice a few changes from the original game.
3432000	3437000	Some notice that there are 12 spaces in the tiers of light gauge.
3437000	3441000	But in the GameCube and Wii versions, there were 16 tiers of light.
3441000	3444000	So maybe they've changed some of those collection sort of quests.
3444000	3449000	And then also, rupees. You can only carry 1,000 in the original,
3449000	3453000	but based on a screenshot, it looks like you can carry up to 2,000.
3453000	3455000	So you won't get any more of the message that says,
3455000	3458000	It won't fit in your wallet, so let's put it back.
3458000	3463000	Now, something else, though, that has a little more controversy attached to it
3463000	3469000	is the fact that there is, of course, the amiibo that we knew was coming with Twilight Princess HD.
3469000	3477000	But based on an Amazon France product listing, apparently there is an amiibo-specific dungeon.
3477000	3483000	So, they say other amiibo can regenerate your life or allow you to gain arrows.
3483000	3489000	But apparently, this official amiibo with the Twilight Princess, Wolf Link, and Midna,
3489000	3493000	that is something that is going to actually have a dungeon locked behind it.
3493000	3497000	And the dungeon, I guess, has been translated to the Twilight Cave.
3497000	3500000	Of course, Amazon France has pulled the listing down since then.
3501000	3503000	But, what do you guys think?
3503000	3507000	There could be an entire dungeon locked behind amiibo.
3507000	3509000	A new dungeon, but locked behind amiibo, nonetheless.
3509000	3511000	You know, I still don't like this practice.
3511000	3513000	I mean, I understand.
3513000	3518000	To me, it feels like they're not sure what to do yet with these amiibos as far as integrating them in games.
3518000	3524000	I think good examples of how they integrated them, like Mario Maker, even unlocking the skins is kind of cool.
3524000	3531000	Even Smash Brothers, Super Mario Kart 8, that type of thing.
3531000	3542000	But, what they did with Shovel Knight and with this, where they're locking a big portion of the game behind DLC, it's ridiculous.
3542000	3547000	I mean, especially, let's just say, okay, I decide that I want to purchase this digitally.
3547000	3553000	I'm fucked because I didn't go buy your stupid amiibo pack that you put out at launch or something like that.
3553000	3555000	I mean, what's the point?
3555000	3558000	Like, these enhancements, you know, it's basically DLC.
3558000	3564000	And the fact that they're announcing it with the game launch, it's like, oh hey, by the way, there's this extra DLC in there.
3564000	3566000	You don't do that.
3566000	3570000	Okay, not to totally disagree with you, because I don't.
3570000	3578000	But, to be Devil's Advocate, I seem to remember last week on the show, you were saying that amiibo don't do enough.
3578000	3582000	So now, here's an example where, well, the amiibo's going to give you an entire extra dungeon in the game.
3582000	3584000	So isn't that amiibo doing more?
3584000	3586000	No, it's not amiibo giving you an entire extra dungeon.
3586000	3591000	It's an extra dungeon that they made and locked behind a wall that you have to purchase something to unlock it, is what it is.
3591000	3593000	It's not extra content.
3593000	3597000	It's stuff that they built for this, so you have to buy the figure to unlock it.
3597000	3601000	Is this back to the, what game was it? Was it Street Fighter X Tekken or whatever?
3601000	3607000	Where all the characters were on the disc already, but they were just locked behind the Xbox 360?
3607000	3610000	Well, yeah, it's a lot of those different types of Capcom games that did that.
3610000	3619000	And also, that was, yeah, I think it was Street Fighter X Tekken, or was it maybe Marvel versus Capcom 3 or something like that?
3619000	3621000	I don't remember, but a bunch of those have done that.
3621000	3628000	And it's just that stuff that you would think that if the amiibos haven't been around, they would have just had that out available anyways.
3628000	3633000	And now they're just making, they're almost making an excuse for this amiibo to basically exist.
3633000	3639000	Like, I understand the fact that you get power-ups and stuff from using the other amiibos, that's kind of cool, I guess.
3639000	3648000	But it's not like, you know, unlocking, like I think for example, Splatoon, I think that those amiibos should unlock costumes or something for your characters.
3648000	3654000	Something that seems a little bit more meaningful, not just, oh, we're creating a specific part of the game that we're going to lock behind something.
3654000	3659000	See? Amiibos do stuff now! That's not an excuse. That's just crap.
3659000	3666000	I think the blow would be softened a lot if they had like five new dungeons and one of them was behind this amiibo or what have you.
3666000	3671000	Or, you know, the dungeon that it unlocks is not that big a deal type of thing, like it's just like a little room.
3671000	3677000	Well yeah, exactly, and even not necessarily the doggone Twilight Princess, but like, Shovel Knight.
3677000	3683000	You locked, you locked co-op behind the fucking amiibo. Come on!
3683000	3687000	That's ridiculous. That's just a feature of the game.
3687000	3690000	And you're just like, oh, fuck it, we're going to lock it behind that.
3690000	3697000	Uh, yeah, I don't know. I, you know, I guess it might be a reason for them to charge.
3697000	3700000	It's kind of like a way to force you to get the amiibo, whether you want it or not.
3700000	3706000	Let's just look at it this way. I understand that the amiibo is something, but let's just pretend that the amiibo is completely out of the play and stuff like that and it's a dungeon.
3706000	3716000	So basically, if Twilight Princess HD was to come out and then they had DLC for one additional dungeon for $12.99, wouldn't that seem fucking ridiculous?
3716000	3724000	I would think that's fucking ridiculous. That I'm paying $13 for a fucking dungeon? One dungeon? That's better be fucking amazing.
3724000	3728000	Are you paying it for the dungeon, or are you paying it for the figure?
3728000	3729000	Whatever.
3729000	3730000	Because for me, I like the figures.
3730000	3735000	Yeah, I understand you like the figures, but that kind of excuse allows them to do this kind of crap.
3735000	3742000	True. I sort of feel like this is also how they're going to justify a $60 price tag for a years old game.
3742000	3746000	And I don't know if that's the price, I mean, is that what they're charging for at 60 bucks?
3746000	3747000	If they're not.
3747000	3748000	With the amiibo?
3748000	3749000	Probably with the amiibo.
3749000	3754000	Because that's how they would say, oh, here's a years old game, but you get the amiibo so we can pay the, or make you pay the full retail price.
3754000	3761000	Basically, I just have a weird feeling that might be how they're justifying it during what is otherwise somewhat of a slow release period.
3761000	3763000	I just don't think that they've really used those meterfully yet.
3763000	3764000	When Star Fox again?
3764000	3774000	I don't know. But like, the amiibos, I mean, they're cool as figures, and that's fine if they wanted to sell those figures, but as far as interacting with the different games, I'm just not feeling it.
3774000	3776000	I'm not feeling like that they do.
3776000	3785000	That's why I haven't purchased any, aside from the one I got, you know, from Akuma JP, and the one that I got from, you know, having Mario Maker.
3785000	3790000	I haven't felt the need to purchase any, and it's because they don't do anything.
3790000	3793000	They don't seem, like, there's no incentive for me to purchase this.
3793000	3799000	Alright, well speaking of Akuma JP, he presents another perspective in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, saying,
3799000	3802000	How about a thank you present for those who bought the amiibo?
3802000	3813000	Mmm, I get that angle, but it's sort of ruined a little bit when the game is being bundled with the amiibo, and that's probably going to be the primary way most people buy it.
3813000	3818000	So, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure how I feel about this.
3818000	3826000	I think it might be a bit much, but at the same time, we don't know the extent of the dungeon, we don't know what other bonus content might be in the game.
3826000	3837000	I still feel like there's other factors to weigh before I'm totally willing to say Nintendo's being really mean with this, but what I'm hearing so far isn't incredibly encouraging.
3837000	3841000	But I'll still get the amiibo because I like the figures, and that one in particular looks awesome.
3841000	3850000	There's some cool integration of amiibo figures, like imagine the Twilight Princess amiibo unlocks a character in the new Legend of Zelda game.
3850000	3859000	That is a cool integration with the amiibos, not unlocking a dungeon behind something.
3859000	3870000	It's basically something that you don't necessarily need, and we can argue that the extra dungeon is not necessarily something you don't need, it's not taking away from the original game experience.
3870000	3873000	I think unlocking an optional character to play as is-
3873000	3876000	Cosmetic, yes. Content, no. That's basically what you're saying.
3876000	3877000	Exactly.
3877000	3884000	I don't know, I would think another character is a pretty big deal, but if the character is just a reskin of Link, then I guess that's just cosmetic, if nothing else.
3884000	3889000	Ooh, give me an amiibo where I can play as Linkle.
3889000	3890000	I was just thinking that.
3890000	3898000	I would totally buy that if you let me play Linkle in Twilight Princess, although something tells me that would just completely fuck up the core game.
3898000	3902000	But still, I can dream. Damn it, I can dream.
3902000	3907000	Alright, let's move on though. We have more gaming news, we want to get to release dates as well, but first, Dark Sakura.
3907000	3916000	Activision got sued again, this time over another real-life depiction in Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
3916000	3927000	Basically, Manuel Noriega, who was the former dictator of Panama, sued Activision for using his image in Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
3927000	3934000	The quote is, for blatant misuse, unlawful exploitation, and misappropriation for economic gain.
3934000	3948000	They previously did this with the Angolan rebel chief, Jonas Savimbi, and his family, suing them over the way he appeared in the game.
3949000	3962000	That basically, they're trying to sue for, I guess, misrepresentation overall. But yeah, Activision is getting nailed.
3962000	3973000	I don't think, it's just a money grab. I mean, honestly, the guy wasn't depicted that badly. He was on the good side of everything, and you just kind of partner up with him.
3973000	3981000	Whereas the other guy, the other lawsuit that they had was, he was just like this dictator warlord guy who killed a bunch of people, and they didn't like the fact that they depicted him as-
3981000	3983000	This is who was portrayed as a barbarian.
3983000	3992000	He killed people, but I mean, everybody was killing people in that scene in the game. I mean, I don't think it was necessarily- I think they're just trying to grab at money, to be honest.
3992000	4000000	But the other one was even more ridiculous, because the guy was a dictator who killed people, and that's how they depicted him.
4000000	4009000	But his family is not going to see him that way. But still, whatever. Either way, Activision is going to be back in court over it.
4009000	4015000	Well, somebody's always in court over something. There's always a lawsuit story on this show every week.
4015000	4023000	Alright, let's get to some release dates. Travel around the world and check out what's coming out in a gaming store near you. Are we getting back into releases again, Loki?
4023000	4033000	Yeah, a little bit. There's not a whole tonk about it this week, though. So this week we've got the Resident Evil Origins Collection. That's going to be out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4033000	4042000	Also, Life is Strange. They're going to be doing a disc version of that for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, including a limited edition. And that's it.
4042000	4051000	Alright, traveling to Japan. We're getting back into some releases again on the 21st. The Biohazard Origins Collection, obviously, that's the same thing as Resident Evil over here.
4051000	4059000	That comes out in Japan on January 21st on the PlayStation 4. Ryu Ga Gotoku Kiwami comes out as well on the PlayStation 4.
4059000	4067000	And Zombie gets its Japanese release. A little retail release there on the PlayStation 4 on the 21st as well.
4067000	4076000	Of course, that being the PlayStation version of Zombie Yu. Speaking of the Yu over on the Wii U, nothing this week, sorry.
4076000	4082000	But Mario Tennis Ultra Smash is the next release you have to look forward to on the 28th, so next week.
4082000	4090000	The Vita's still trucking, though, and I always love the title of this series. Muv Luv comes out on the PlayStation Vita this week.
4090000	4102000	Muv Luv is out in also an alternative and a double pack, whatever that means. So if you want your alternative Muv Luvin, you can do that on the PlayStation Vita this week.
4102000	4114000	You just would have to import that. And lastly on the 3DS this week, Zelda Musou Hyrule All-Stars. That's right, Hyrule Warriors on the 3DS in Japan this week.
4114000	4122000	There is also a special 3DS LL, which is their version of the XL, a special Hyrule edition that's out this week in Japan.
4122000	4130000	So some people, I think, with Japanese 3DSs might be importing that one. I'm not sure. How about the UK? Sorry, Sakura.
4130000	4138000	A boy is Bob. That is really it. Oh, no. Hardware Shitbreakers for PC.
4138000	4140000	What? There's a game with the word shit in it?
4140000	4141000	Ship!
4141000	4146000	Oh, ship? I thought you said hardware shitbreakers. I was like, break shit.
4146000	4148000	Oh, Rob.
4148000	4150000	The sounds of broken glass.
4150000	4151000	Special precious.
4151000	4154000	Am I the only one that thought she said shit?
4154000	4155000	Summer child.
4155000	4156000	Maybe it's because I've been drinking.
4156000	4160000	Maybe I'm saying shit because I was actually reading a live tweet of a Trump rally.
4160000	4164000	Talk about bullshit.
4164000	4168000	I really was. It's actually kind of hilarious and sad.
4168000	4170000	Alright, is that it for the UK?
4170000	4171000	Yeah, that's it for the UK.
4171000	4176000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.
4176000	4185000	Alright, so this is kind of disappointing, but Rockstar is kind of a big guy behind the Grand Theft Auto series.
4185000	4191000	Leslie Benzies has actually departed the studio after an extended sabbatical.
4192000	4200000	He's been with the company for 17 years. He joined Rockstar North in 1999, back when it was DMA Designs.
4200000	4207000	And he went on to produce Grand Theft Auto 3, and of course, just recently, Grand Theft Auto 5.
4207000	4213000	He also had a little bit to do with the Red Dead Redemption and Manhunt games.
4213000	4222000	So, it'd be interesting to see kind of how the series goes from here, but definitely something that was more influential behind it.
4222000	4228000	You know, we had a pretty big departure from Valve last week, too. There's a lot of moving and shaking going on, isn't there?
4228000	4229000	Yeah, definitely.
4229000	4230000	Crazy.
4230000	4234000	Alright, well, last week we were talking about anniversaries and gaming a little bit.
4234000	4238000	Some of you were very mad at me for some of those anniversaries I was reading.
4238000	4245000	But I do have an update on Pokémon and the 20th anniversary of Pokémon that's happening this year.
4245000	4250000	So there was some more updates from Nintendo this week on some of the ways they plan to celebrate.
4250000	4257000	For example, there's going to be a new ad during Super Bowl 50, which is coming up.
4257000	4264000	I guess a Pokémon-based ad, that's kind of cool, where they want people to share Pokémon memories on Twitter and all that good stuff.
4264000	4271000	And I guess there is a Pokémon Day, which will be February 27th, and there will be special events at retail locations around the country.
4271000	4279000	There's more information at Pokémon.com slash 20, and some of this is going to include monthly mythical Pokémon distributions.
4279000	4284000	I guess there's a Pokémon Photo Booth app that's going to be happening, so lots of interesting stuff.
4284000	4290000	Also, of course, Pokken Tournament coming out for the Wii U, that I know that was dated for March this week.
4290000	4302000	And then there's also, I want to say, there should be the new 3DS, right? There's a new 3DS bundle that will have Pokémon Red and Blue pre-installed on it.
4302000	4307000	And that's coming out also on February 27th, so that's kind of cool.
4307000	4313000	But there's also a 2DS, I think, that's coming out to celebrate the anniversary as well.
4313000	4319000	So lots of ways to celebrate the Pokémon. I bet there will be a new game this winter.
4319000	4326000	Although, with Pokémon Go, maybe that's kind of what they're using to keep Pokémon going right now.
4326000	4333000	But I would, if we haven't gotten an update on Pokémon Go by February 27th, or whatever that day is, something's wrong.
4333000	4339000	Because I would think that would be a great day for the beta of Pokémon Go to begin. Just saying. Just saying.
4339000	4344000	Alright, well let's travel to a much simpler time in gaming.
4344000	4349000	We weren't celebrating 20 year anniversaries of anything, except maybe Pong.
4349000	4354000	Because they're just, gaming was still a new industry, it was still a baby.
4354000	4363000	Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys need to play and respect this game this week.
4363000	4365000	We can find someone that'll run it.
4365000	4372000	Alright, well Dark Sakura, here it is, the classic game of the week. What did you choose for our listeners tonight?
4372000	4378000	I picked the first adventure game that Lucasfilm ever did. Labyrinth, the computer game.
4378000	4382000	Ah, I'm assuming a little bit of a tribute to Bowie.
4382000	4383000	Indeed.
4383000	4386000	Now the music in this is very minimal, just so you guys know.
4386000	4392000	It came out in 1986. It was developed by Lucasfilm Games and published by Activision.
4392000	4401000	It was indeed based on the movie. You basically have to navigate a maze while solving puzzles and evading antagonists in danger.
4401000	4407000	You have to find and defeat Jareth within 13 real time hours.
4407000	4418000	It doesn't have any command line interface, instead you have a scrolling word wheel that you use to do your sentences.
4418000	4428000	So this one, that whole design of the scroll wheel was invented by the designer David Fox.
4428000	4436000	Who wanted to avoid text parsers and syntax guessing that was a problem in text based adventure games.
4436000	4442000	So he actually worked with Douglas Adams, as in Hitchhiker's Guide.
4443000	4447000	And this is sort of the design that came out of it.
4447000	4454000	And it influenced, actually this game itself was an influence for Maniac Mansion down the line.
4454000	4464000	So basically you've got, when you enter in your name, your gender, and your favorite color.
4464000	4470000	The last two fields determine what your character looks like.
4471000	4476000	And then you play through the game. So it really is like that.
4479000	4486000	It was, for its time, pretty ahead of the curve.
4486000	4491000	And on top of that, it was very, very well received when it came out.
4491000	4498000	And they felt, they weren't really pressured to reuse certain things from the movie.
4498000	4501000	But they felt obligated to use the source material.
4501000	4507000	And were able though to adapt the source to an adventure.
4507000	4513000	So it really was just a big innovation in development.
4513000	4518000	It came out for Commodore 64, Apple II, and the MSX.
4518000	4527000	It was pretty successful. In fact it was more successful than the film was at the time.
4528000	4535000	It was actually even called a superb game by Commodore User Magazine.
4535000	4541000	And Computer Gaming World said that it was a very well done game and an excellent user interface.
4541000	4546000	So it did leave a pretty decent legacy.
4546000	4551000	I mean, it influenced the mechanics for Maniac Mansion.
4551000	4559000	And the SCUMM engine that was made for Maniac Mansion, that of course has been used for so many other games.
4559000	4565000	The word wheels were sort of a predecessor of the whole point and click interface.
4565000	4572000	And the designer, the artist for the game, Labyrinth, did the production for Maniac Mansion.
4572000	4577000	So, if not really for this game, we might not have had Maniac Mansion.
4577000	4579000	So, probably...
4579000	4585000	Yeah, you can see a lot of similarities just in the graphical style to Maniac Mansion just in this game.
4585000	4589000	Which I have to admit, I never played when it was first out.
4589000	4593000	But I'm surprised I never did. This game looks pretty awesome for its time.
4593000	4599000	Yeah, and now people are saying that it wasn't a real classic.
4599000	4603000	But honestly enough, you sort of have to look at the precursors and appreciate it as the classic that it is.
4603000	4604000	Sure.
4604000	4606000	That's really all I have to say about it.
4606000	4610000	Awesome. Well, some of our chatters over at... Oh, look at that. It's like she's in a mosh pit right now.
4610000	4611000	She's being carried by all the hands.
4611000	4612000	Yeah, the wall of hands.
4612000	4613000	Yeah.
4613000	4614000	Yeah.
4614000	4617000	Anyway, over at live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says,
4617000	4621000	One cool thing it did was it started off as a text adventure.
4621000	4625000	And then when Jareth pulled you into the world, it blew up with color graphics.
4625000	4626000	Yeah, there is that too.
4626000	4628000	It's kind of a Wizard of Oz thing to it.
4628000	4635000	DungeonBuster says, as a side note, the Maniac Mansion guys are working on a new Maniac Mansion-like game called Thimbleweed Park.
4635000	4637000	Which had a successful Kickstarter.
4637000	4641000	And Dark Tetsuya pointing out, I was just watching video of the MSX version. It looked neat.
4641000	4645000	So yeah, this is out on a variety of consoles, as we were talking about earlier in the show.
4645000	4647000	Games in the 80s came out everywhere.
4647000	4648000	So.
4648000	4651000	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.
4651000	4653000	Labyrinth.
4653000	4659000	Influenced by the film starring the late, great David Bowie.
4659000	4662000	Alright, that is going to do it for the first half of our show.
4662000	4665000	But don't go anywhere, guys. We have plenty more show to come.
4665000	4667000	We're going to take a quick break first, though.
4667000	4669000	And when we come back, we're going to do the rapid-
4669000	4671000	Excuse me. Yeah, rapid fire news.
4671000	4673000	We're also going to get into the foogle question of the week.
4673000	4676000	We'll also get into what other news is going on.
4676000	4678000	We're going to have an update on Awesome Games Done Quick.
4678000	4680000	We talked a little bit about that last week.
4680000	4683000	We have some other information this week about how that all went down.
4683000	4689000	We're also going to talk a little bit about a game on the Wii U that will use all of your amiibo.
4689000	4693000	When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4700000	4703000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4703000	4709000	Live tonight with episode number 628, January the 17th of 2016.
4709000	4712000	You know, I didn't say anything about this at the top of the show.
4712000	4716000	But it's raining a lot in Sacramento right now, which we need it.
4716000	4719000	We need it. We really, you know, you've heard all the stories about the drought.
4719000	4723000	But, I mean, I think that what we're getting right now is supposed to be a pretty big storm.
4723000	4727000	At least for California measures, a pretty big storm.
4727000	4730000	So, I forgot to get that disclaimer at the top of the show.
4730000	4733000	Knock on wood, everything's holding up so far.
4733000	4735000	But, like, my cable was out.
4735000	4738000	It was Friday night because that was the night the Diablo season got started.
4738000	4741000	We couldn't play, so I was mad because we got a late start.
4741000	4743000	But whatever, timing isn't that important.
4743000	4745000	But it's nice to have a roof over your head in running water.
4745000	4747000	It is nice to have a roof over my head in running water.
4747000	4753000	But when I check in on the Comcast app and it says, the internet will be up by 10pm.
4753000	4755000	And then it's 10pm. I check it again.
4755000	4756000	What day was it again?
4756000	4757000	1am. It was Friday night.
4757000	4761000	Eh, their internet service has been real shit.
4761000	4765000	And so, like, I can never tell if it's my stuff or their stuff that's messed up.
4765000	4769000	And, like, sometimes I'll do a speed test and it just won't do anything.
4769000	4771000	Or sometimes it'll be just fine.
4771000	4774000	I'm like, it's super slow. Like, it's not loading an image on this page.
4774000	4777000	I also consider myself somewhat reasonable.
4777000	4780000	Like, I understand during a storm there's probably going to be some type of outages.
4780000	4782000	Why? It's all underground.
4782000	4787000	Well, it seems like it doesn't, somehow the water leaks in or something, I don't know.
4787000	4790000	Because it seems like every time there's a storm, that's when something goes wrong.
4790000	4793000	But anyway, so far, so good tonight, knock on wood.
4793000	4799000	But live listeners, if we suddenly disappear and don't come back, you can blame that storm.
4799000	4802000	I, of course, I always have, like, Bobby or...
4802000	4803000	It's not windy, though.
4803000	4806000	Somebody on the vog side, I can text if something really bad happens.
4806000	4809000	Usually it's the wind that would cause anything to be interrupted.
4809000	4811000	But it's not windy outside right now.
4811000	4813000	Not yet. I thought it was supposed to be.
4813000	4814000	The other day it was.
4814000	4816000	I think it's supposed to be worse up the hill a little bit.
4816000	4818000	Where we are in the valley, it's not so bad. But anyway.
4818000	4820000	Apparently power's out in the Thomas right now.
4820000	4821000	Is it really?
4821000	4823000	Oh, sorry, that was two hours ago. Not bad.
4823000	4826000	Well, knock on wood, because that's not that far away.
4826000	4828000	Well, yeah. But...
4829000	4833000	All right. Well, anyhow, we're gonna do our best and try to get back into some more.
4833000	4837000	AkumaJP in chat says, wow, snowstorm here, too.
4837000	4839000	Again, I heard it's snowing back on the East Coast, too.
4839000	4843000	You know, and again, I'm just saying, it's a big storm by California measures.
4843000	4846000	And our infrastructure's only built to hold so much.
4846000	4850000	If we had the type of snowstorm that happened back East, shit, the city would be...
4850000	4852000	The city would be shut down for a week.
4852000	4853000	State of emergency.
4853000	4857000	Yeah. Remember that storm of the century we were supposed to get last year?
4857000	4858000	It's crazy.
4858000	4859000	When?
4859000	4861000	Anyway. Yeah, right? It, like, never happened.
4861000	4864000	They kept saying, it's gonna be the biggest storm that's ever hit Sacramento. Oh, my God.
4864000	4866000	It really didn't happen.
4866000	4870000	Anyway, you guys don't care about the weather. You do care about video game news.
4870000	4873000	Let's get back into some rapid-fire news. Loki.
4873000	4880000	All right, so John Romero decided to slum it a little bit and create a new level for Doom.
4880000	4884000	And so he has a brand-new level that you can actually check out.
4884000	4888000	They even have a link on Dropbox for it.
4888000	4892000	Just look, I'm sorry, if you do a Google search, you'll be able to find it.
4892000	4899000	It's, I guess, an interpretation of the level from Episode 1, Map 8, Phobos Anomaly.
4899000	4904000	And so, I don't know, he created something new. Cool.
4904000	4906000	I guess check it out. Free.
4906000	4913000	Also, Earth Defense Force 4.1, the game that I bought accidentally because I thought someone was gonna play with me.
4913000	4915000	But that didn't end up happening.
4915000	4917000	Oh, come on. It's Earth Defense Force.
4917000	4926000	It's okay. I'm not as into it as I was 2017 or Instant Garmageddon, but it's all right.
4926000	4932000	But I can download this level pack that's got 26 new levels for $10.
4932000	4936000	And they also have a second pack that's gonna be coming out later on.
4936000	4941000	Their DLC is really expensive and it's not that great, but let me check out the level pack.
4941000	4943000	New levels are kinda cool.
4943000	4945000	So that'll be coming out next week.
4945000	4950000	And in Fallout 4 is gonna be getting some updates soon.
4950000	4954000	1.3, which is now in beta on Steam.
4954000	4963000	And some of the fixes for that, one of the things is it fixes MacCready's killshot perk, which calculates headshot percentages properly.
4963000	4969000	Before, it was supposed to add 20% to, I think, the amount that it calculates for headshots.
4969000	4972000	So 20% better than what you normally get.
4972000	4975000	I think currently what the game is set at is it's 2000%.
4975000	4978000	So you pretty much always get a headshot.
4978000	4983000	He's my next companion and I'm gonna max out so I can get that ridiculous perk.
4983000	4993000	Also, they are fixing some issues with the workshop, being able to snap pieces together a little bit better.
4993000	4997000	There's an issue where you could become dismembered while still alive.
4998000	5009000	And also, they're gonna be doing some fixes for ambient inclusion settings, some new debris effects if you have an Nvidia card, and general memory and stability improvements.
5009000	5013000	And you were telling me before the show tonight, I have to get Fallout 4.
5013000	5016000	You do, it's fun. It's very Skyrim-ish.
5016000	5025000	Well, and that's honestly more than, I mean, don't get me wrong, I do need to play Fallout 4 at some point, you know, because I usually am into those types of games, at least for a little bit.
5025000	5028000	But Alan is really the one that really gets into it.
5028000	5029000	Yeah, does he have it yet?
5029000	5036000	He doesn't because he's, I think he, like this is the first week in a while where I don't think I've seen him playing much Skyrim.
5036000	5040000	I don't know if he finally beat every piece of content or what happened.
5040000	5043000	Oh, no he's not. It's impossible to do that.
5043000	5046000	Well, you know, besides the randomly generated stuff or whatever.
5046000	5048000	Well, then I'm talking about like with all the mods and stuff.
5048000	5049000	Yeah, it's true.
5049000	5050000	Yeah, it's impossible.
5050000	5058000	Or I don't know if it's because maybe Diablo 3 kind of brought him back or whatever, but he was going to wait on Fallout 4 until some of that mod stuff was really up to speed.
5058000	5059000	So I think he's going to wait a little longer.
5059000	5064000	I think he was, his thing was he was waiting for like the actual official mod tools to come out and that type of thing.
5064000	5066000	That'll help too, for sure.
5066000	5070000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on. I've got some stories as well.
5070000	5073000	Let's talk about a new Mario Maker costume.
5073000	5077000	They're still coming and this one's pretty cool. It's a Daisy costume.
5077000	5079000	A Daisy costume was released in Super Mario Maker this week.
5079000	5085000	I actually did pick it up and yeah, I love that this game is still pumping out all these different costumes.
5085000	5086000	It's pretty cool.
5086000	5090000	So yeah, you can check out Daisy and she is available now in the game.
5090000	5094000	Of course, you have to play one of these special stage levels in order to unlock her.
5094000	5097000	She's not, you don't have to pay 99 cents or anything like that.
5097000	5105000	Just go into the courses and look at the event courses and she's there, along with a lot of other stuff we've talked about in recent weeks.
5106000	5108000	Are you a fan of Yokai Watch?
5108000	5115000	Well, guess what? A new game on the Nintendo 3DS for Yokai Watch is coming out on April 2nd in Japan.
5115000	5120000	Yokai Watch Three Kingdoms is coming out in Japan on April 2nd.
5120000	5123000	This game is a collaboration with Koei Tecmo.
5123000	5129000	If you purchase the game in Japan, you will get a Commander Legendary Medal for Komasan.
5129000	5133000	The first print run of the game also has a figure strap for Komasan.
5133000	5139000	And if you get the digital version instead, you get a Bucinyan that joins you in the game as a partner.
5139000	5144000	So I'm sure, actually it seems like Yokai Watch is doing pretty decent over here.
5144000	5147000	I see a lot of the stuff at Toys R Us for it.
5147000	5152000	I know some kids that are kind of getting into it, so it seems like Yokai Watch is doing pretty well over here.
5152000	5155000	But my understanding in Japan, it's really big.
5155000	5160000	So I know they're very excited, I'm sure, about this game, Yokai Watch Three Kingdoms.
5160000	5163000	Also, a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.
5163000	5168000	Remember we talked last week on the show about the trademark that Sony was trying to get for Let's Play?
5168000	5173000	Well, there was a lawyer who runs this website. It's Ryan Morris on Law.
5173000	5176000	Oh yeah, the game lawyer guy.
5176000	5184000	Yeah, the game lawyer guy. He actually wrote this whole thing about how this is a lot worse than people were making it sound last week.
5184000	5187000	And basically saying that the application has only been blocked.
5187000	5192000	It wasn't denied, it was just blocked because it was similar to a registered trademark.
5192000	5195000	But they have not refused or denied the application.
5195000	5198000	And so what will happen here, he goes on to say,
5198000	5205000	If SCEA tries to circumvent the current office action holding it up, many attorneys, including myself, will oppose it.
5205000	5208000	I'm not worried about SCEA ever being granted this mark.
5208000	5211000	What I am worried about is the application itself.
5211000	5216000	It shows someone at SCEA in charge of filing trademarks does not understand the gaming industry at all.
5216000	5222000	And this was a sketchy, in my opinion, attempt to control a hugely popular genre of entertainment.
5222000	5229000	You can read more on this guy's website. That's all an excerpt from his website, ryanmorrisonlaw.com.
5229000	5232000	Let's go to a few more. DarkSakura.
5232000	5237000	I was just absolutely transfixed by this one GTA mod.
5237000	5241000	It's the Lemmy mod. The Lemmy Tribute GTA 5 mod.
5241000	5244000	Where you can play as Lemmy from Motorhead.
5245000	5251000	Basically, what he can do in there is that he can smoke.
5251000	5254000	He can drink. He can spawn hookers.
5254000	5258000	He has his motorcycle. He has a guitar. He can play.
5258000	5262000	Yeah, it's just pretty awesome.
5262000	5267000	That might make me play GTA 5 if I can play as Lemmy.
5268000	5277000	Also, and I watched this when it came out because I'm a big fan of Man at Arms and Man at Arms Reforged.
5277000	5286000	In fact, I got into their little fan community group that is run by one of the guys there on Facebook.
5286000	5288000	Really, really cool people.
5288000	5291000	But they made Pyramid Head's Great Knife.
5291000	5295000	Except they didn't do the Silent Hill 2 Great Knife.
5295000	5300000	They did the Boogeyman Blade from Silent Hill Homecoming.
5300000	5303000	That basically looks like a ginormous combat knife.
5303000	5306000	Which I would have preferred the Silent Hill 2 one.
5306000	5310000	But this one, I can see, they explained why they went with it.
5310000	5312000	They showed some of the different models.
5312000	5320000	They have a functioning ginormous great knife that was tearing shit apart.
5320000	5322000	It was pretty cool.
5323000	5327000	Actually, my favorite thing is that they've done a lot of video game blades.
5327000	5331000	They've done Link's Shield. They've done the Master Sword.
5331000	5336000	They've done the key blades.
5336000	5339000	They've done both the first key blade and the Oathbreaker.
5339000	5345000	They've also done, my favorite one that they did is the Scissor Sword from Kill la Kill.
5345000	5348000	Where they melted scissors to make the blade.
5348000	5349000	That was pretty cool.
5349000	5350000	Wow.
5350000	5356000	Yeah, some of these, this one was done out of, I believe it was done on a train track.
5356000	5359000	Just slag train track and forged.
5359000	5363000	They've done Sephiroth's Katana.
5363000	5365000	They've done Katana's blades.
5365000	5367000	Instead of Katana, yeah anyway.
5367000	5370000	But they did her fans.
5370000	5371000	Her fan blades?
5371000	5372000	Yeah.
5372000	5373000	So they've done a lot of really cool stuff.
5373000	5376000	And the more that you request something, the better chance there is.
5376000	5378000	I wanna say a functioning gun blade.
5378000	5380000	They've done a gun blade.
5380000	5384000	It doesn't shoot, however, it will...
5384000	5387000	However it would be questioned at airport security.
5387000	5394000	But they've actually done, in fact, they worked with, there's another one, the fan builds people.
5394000	5400000	They worked to make a wedding gift that was an ultra head knife block.
5400000	5403000	And all of the knives are, there was Auron's Katana.
5403000	5405000	There was Sephiroth's Katana.
5405000	5406000	There's the gun blade.
5406000	5410000	And, fuck, one more I can't remember.
5410000	5411000	You know what though?
5411000	5415000	If that Katana fan blade can't actually lift people into the air, then it's worthless.
5415000	5416000	Let's be real.
5416000	5422000	Well, I'm forgetting what the fourth one is, but then they went back and they made all of those swords like for real.
5422000	5423000	Wow.
5423000	5425000	I'm really impressed with them.
5425000	5429000	And the guys that are doing the current iteration of it, they're the nicest guys.
5429000	5436000	I've actually gotten a little bit of advice because I was kind of interested in learning how to forge scissors.
5436000	5440000	But anyway, so not meaning to go off on that, but they're just really cool people.
5440000	5442000	No, you totally gave them a free ad on the show.
5442000	5443000	It's cool.
5443000	5446000	I would love to have them on the show.
5446000	5451000	It would be even better if Man of Arms from He-Man was a part of that team as well.
5451000	5456000	You just want them to make you a weapon is what you really want, Dark Soccer.
5456000	5457000	You want a complimentary weapon.
5457000	5458000	Giant red bat.
5459000	5467000	By the way, in Fallout 4, you can get what they call a swatter, which is basically a giant red bat, and you can put nails in it and stuff like that.
5467000	5472000	I'll go back in there and get on the super fan builds. I found the video.
5472000	5474000	What is your dream weapon, Dark Soccer?
5474000	5477000	If you could have them make any weapon in the world, what would you want?
5479000	5481000	Honestly, I don't know.
5481000	5484000	There is one that I would like for them to make on their show.
5484000	5487000	Not for me, but I'd like to see it made.
5487000	5497000	Just because every time they do the katana, they have this one guy named Elia who is really good at traditional Japanese sword making techniques.
5497000	5502000	And so he will go into detail explaining things on katana building and everything.
5502000	5507000	And I would love to see how they do a cutting edge on a reverse-bladed sword.
5507000	5510000	I would really like to see how that's managed.
5510000	5512000	But anyway, that's just me fangirling.
5513000	5515000	Alright, enough about weapons.
5515000	5518000	I'm going to find out what that other blade is. I can't remember, by the way.
5518000	5522000	But anyway, so John St. John, we know him, right?
5522000	5525000	Duke Nukem, the voice actor anyway.
5525000	5536000	He got approached to be the voice of the ad campaign for a, quote, leading GOP candidate for president, end quote.
5536000	5539000	And he said, no.
5539000	5541000	And this is what he said why.
5541000	5547000	I don't like to turn down jobs, especially when it's a national ad campaign that pays pretty well.
5547000	5554000	But I have a conscience and could not accept a gig to be the advertising voice of the Republican Party's leading candidate for president.
5554000	5559000	Thanks for the kind offer, but I will sleep just fine at night knowing I made a choice I can live with.
5560000	5565000	Really, the only candidate that he would have been perfect for is like Arnold Schwarzenegger running for something.
5565000	5568000	Actually, Arnold Schwarzenegger would just do his own voice.
5568000	5575000	Which is ironic because Arnold Schwarzenegger, I don't know if you guys know this, you know that guy who's leading in the Republican stuff right now.
5575000	5580000	You know he used to have a TV show on NBC. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the new head of that show.
5580000	5583000	Thank you for reminding me. I do need to watch. Has that started yet?
5583000	5584000	No.
5584000	5586000	By the way, the other blade was the Buster Sword.
5586000	5587000	I don't even think it's filmed yet.
5587000	5588000	It was Cloud Sword.
5588000	5590000	But they announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger is the new.
5590000	5592000	Yes, and I totally need to watch it now because of that.
5592000	5596000	Because you know instead of you're fired, it's going to be you're terminated.
5597000	5603000	I don't care. I fully expect that level of cheesiness. And that's why I come to watch that show.
5603000	5607000	It's not because it's quality TV, let's be honest. Any of those like reality shows, no.
5607000	5608000	Hot garbage.
5608000	5611000	It's all garbage and it's just, I can't wait to see that.
5611000	5615000	Sometimes you eat fast food even though you damn well know it's bad for you.
5615000	5616000	I do that almost every day.
5616000	5618000	Don't eat Taco Bell because you're clearly Mexican.
5618000	5623000	So I did decide though which of the blades they've made that I would actually want to keep.
5624000	5633000	I'm still thinking about it and I've decided the one I would want to keep for myself would be they remade the Hattori Hanzo Sword from Kill Bill.
5633000	5635000	I would want that one for the collection.
5635000	5641000	Dungeon Buster in chat says, terminated, but keep up your work ethic and you'll be back.
5643000	5650000	No seriously though, it's like, don't get me wrong, I like Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he has some pretty awesome catch phrases and stuff.
5650000	5657000	But he really tries hard to work that shit into every single quote or interview or whatever.
5657000	5660000	It's like dude, come up with something new.
5660000	5664000	Do something new. He doesn't have to be always like, I'll be back and all that shit.
5664000	5667000	It's just something different.
5667000	5669000	I like Arnold as an actor.
5670000	5671000	Dot, dot, dot.
5671000	5676000	Alright, let's get into the FUGL Question of the Week.
5676000	5681000	And every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we call it FUGL.
5688000	5694000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
5694000	5699000	That is the place to be if you want to participate with the FUGL Question of the Week.
5699000	5701000	Such as our question this week.
5701000	5704000	And this week we wanted to ask you guys about the Pokemons.
5704000	5709000	Because this year there are many ways to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.
5709000	5713000	How do you feel about Pokemon 20 years after its debut?
5713000	5716000	Are you a fan or have you never cared for the franchise?
5716000	5718000	Tell us why.
5718000	5722000	So, act deaf starting us off on Google Plus tonight saying, old.
5722000	5724000	That's how I feel.
5724000	5726000	In all seriousness, I'm still a very big fan.
5726000	5729000	I've played every single generation in lots of the spinoffs.
5729000	5733000	And I'm totally looking forward to playing Pokken and Pokemon Go this year.
5733000	5737000	Prince Peach Fuzz says, 20 years? Really?
5737000	5740000	I love the original red, green and blue.
5740000	5744000	I remember being hella excited attempting the missing no hack.
5744000	5747000	Can't wait for Pokemon Go.
5747000	5749000	Over on Facebook we have some answers as well.
5749000	5754000	Including Bryce H starting us off saying, I'm a 23 year old.
5754000	5757000	Who is not afraid to admit he's a fan of Pokemon.
5757000	5761000	Played every game and I'm having trouble believing that Pokemon is 20.
5761000	5763000	I remember starting Pokemon Red for the first time.
5763000	5767000	And that feeling of beating the elite for the first time is one I will never forget.
5767000	5770000	I'm certainly glad Pokemon has lasted as long as it has.
5770000	5774000	Because now my 3 year old son gets to enjoy it just like I have.
5775000	5780000	Degenerate Johnny who's requesting I read this in an old man voice if possible.
5780000	5783000	I don't know. Should I subject everybody to that?
5783000	5786000	Wouldn't that just be my normal voice? Ha ha ha.
5786000	5788000	That's what grandpa would say.
5788000	5790000	No, Rob.
5790000	5793000	Gosh darn gee willikers you young whippersnappers.
5793000	5797000	I remember the day Pokemon came out like it was yesterday.
5797000	5799000	It was before the days of hashtag.
5799000	5803000	And it was called the pound sign. Used mostly for operators and 900 numbers.
5803000	5805000	I was always more southern than old.
5805000	5807000	Just roll with me here.
5807000	5810000	I was always a fan of those cuddly companions as if they were my own children.
5810000	5811000	Except for Ditto.
5811000	5816000	That sex craving lunatics family portrait looks like a Pokemon diversity assistance brochure.
5816000	5823000	To this day I'm still catching them all and will continue to do so even after this old crippled body has failed me.
5823000	5825000	My ghost will want to be the very best like no.
5825000	5828000	Okay I'll stop. You're never too old to catch them all.
5828000	5830000	Wink wink. Nudge nudge.
5830000	5832000	I just have one word for you.
5832000	5834000	Lick tongue.
5834000	5838000	Fabrice A. replies to us on Facebook saying,
5838000	5843000	I've never played Pokemon back in the day because like most I had to choose what console to get.
5843000	5848000	After I got a DS I wanted to try it but I have no idea on what Pokemon game to start with.
5848000	5855000	Andy R. says, I still have nostalgia for the older games and I've played one of the main games of each gen.
5855000	5858000	But honestly I felt like the last few have been bad.
5858000	5861000	Why it was terrible and why is only slightly better.
5861000	5864000	I've only got four or five badges in each before I stop caring.
5864000	5873000	I will say though I've been enjoying Pokemon P-Cross even if it has gigantic paywalls which really invalidate the claim that the game is free to play.
5873000	5876000	Fifth Dream says, I've been a fan of Pokemon since day one.
5876000	5880000	I watched the anime for a long time and have been playing since Blue came out.
5880000	5883000	I've played every generation of the games and love them.
5883000	5889000	I even have a bunch of toys and plushies which I probably shouldn't admit since I'm 41 years old but it shows what a fan I am.
5889000	5892000	Okay, Fifth Dream, I'm gonna help you rest easy.
5892000	5893000	Own it.
5893000	5900000	I'm 37 so I remember when Pokemon first came out very very well.
5900000	5904000	And I more got into the anime than I did the games.
5904000	5907000	And I even dressed up as Ash one year for Halloween.
5907000	5913000	And I remember going to see the movie in the theaters and me and my friend were the only ones in the entire theater.
5913000	5917000	So we were imitating the Pokemon at the top of our lungs and we were having a great time.
5917000	5919000	So I agree with our saga. Just own it.
5919000	5920000	It is what it is.
5920000	5923000	And yeah, good memories.
5923000	5926000	Anyway, Silent Tom says, I still think the franchise is great.
5926000	5931000	I haven't played them much past the original Red, Blue, and Yellow but have fond memories.
5931000	5938000	My hometown changed the name of the city for a day back in 1998 from Topika to Topikachu.
5941000	5944000	I'm laughing at how stupid that is.
5944000	5945000	I'm sorry.
5945000	5947000	That's so stupid. I love it.
5947000	5950000	I had a plane drop a bunch of Pokemon swag.
5950000	5953000	It was a good time to say the least.
5953000	5955000	Oh my god, that's amazing.
5955000	5961000	Redtertainment replies and says, 20 years? Fuck, now I feel old.
5961000	5962000	Thanks, Pikachu.
5962000	5966000	Jordan T, finally, someone responding saying no.
5966000	5969000	Saying, I've never played a Pokemon game.
5969000	5971000	I figured I've gone this long without it.
5971000	5975000	Okay, I'll stop trying to justify it and go sit in the corner.
5975000	5976000	Hey, that's okay.
5976000	5978000	You know what, sometimes we don't have time to play everything.
5978000	5981000	Last but not least, Veronica Isabelle over on Facebook says,
5981000	5984000	I saw a commercial for the original US Blue version.
5984000	5987000	It was instantly hooked and I've been playing it ever since.
5988000	5989000	Excuse me.
5989000	5993000	Even though I haven't finished White 2 or X, I bought a copy of Alpha Sapphire
5993000	5998000	and I plan on buying Yellow on the Virtual Console for a news-lock challenge.
5998000	6002000	I watched the anime back in the day and still remember the first episode I ever watched,
6002000	6004000	Island of the Giant Pokemon.
6004000	6007000	I played the trading card game and even had it on Game Boy and Virtual Console
6007000	6011000	and was mildly disappointed you couldn't play two-player on Virtual Console.
6011000	6014000	I remember getting excited and downloading the demo for Pokemon Rumble.
6014000	6017000	As soon as I found out about it and have played every game in the series,
6017000	6019000	I hated Pokemon Rumble U.
6019000	6022000	I have all of the third version games except for Emerald
6022000	6025000	because I thought Sapphire was boring when it was over.
6025000	6028000	I had to force myself to pay attention to the Pokemon Advance series
6028000	6031000	when it was on Saturday morning cartoons on Kids WB.
6031000	6035000	Well, even though it sounds like there's a few games here and there she didn't care for,
6035000	6039000	Veronica Isabelle definitely a long-time fan of Pokemon.
6039000	6041000	Great answers, you guys. Thanks so much.
6041000	6045000	Checking in studio real quick, your thoughts on Pokemon 20 years later.
6045000	6049000	Dark Sakura, you were always more a Digimon girl.
6049000	6050000	I was a Digimon girl.
6050000	6052000	Did you resent Pokemon for that or?
6052000	6053000	No, why would I?
6053000	6054000	I don't know. Just checking.
6054000	6063000	I really hated, because keep in mind it was one again that I started watching in Japanese with the anime
6063000	6066000	and I couldn't stand really watching it in English.
6066000	6068000	It kind of made me bristle a little bit.
6068000	6072000	As it happens with anything that I start off watching in Japanese first.
6072000	6073000	I'm the same way with Digimon.
6073000	6082000	So, I remembered having the Japanese theme song memorized
6082000	6085000	and I had all those copies of the movies, remember?
6085000	6086000	Oh, yeah.
6086000	6091000	And I didn't really get, though, too much into the game so much.
6091000	6093000	I mean, I tried to play them and it was kind of boring.
6093000	6098000	Bonds006 in chat says, I would rename my Pokemon to Digimon names.
6098000	6099000	You could do that.
6099000	6102000	Loki, thoughts on Pokemon 20 years later?
6102000	6103000	I never played any of them.
6103000	6106000	So, you're like that guy on Facebook. He's not alone.
6106000	6109000	I mean, it's honestly, I just never got into it.
6109000	6118000	And I'm sure I've seen at least one episode of the anime, but I just couldn't really get interested in it.
6118000	6122000	And I don't know. It's just not a game I've played, unfortunately.
6122000	6125000	Fifth Dream in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says,
6125000	6129000	First I heard a Pokemon is when the kids were having seizures from the anime.
6129000	6132000	Oh, yeah. Pokemon was a bit infamous for that.
6132000	6134000	They never aired that episode in the U.S.
6134000	6136000	That one or the one where James has the boobs.
6136000	6138000	They never aired that episode either.
6138000	6139000	They really should.
6139000	6143000	On top of that, they weren't really, the beach episode was freaking hilarious with the beauty contest.
6143000	6146000	I'm sorry. That was a funny freaking episode.
6146000	6149000	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I have Pokemon Blue.
6149000	6152000	Got it when it came out because it sounded like a neat RPG concept.
6152000	6157000	And then babies started getting them on their blankets and I left forever.
6157000	6160000	All right. That's it for the Fugu question of the week.
6160000	6162000	Let's get back into some other news. Loki.
6162000	6171000	All right. So, it's not Pokemon, but we talked last week about VR and how there was going to be,
6171000	6176000	they're announcing the price and release dates for the Oculus Rift.
6176000	6180000	Well, now we've got some information about the HTC Vive.
6180000	6183000	Pre-order it and begin on February 29th.
6183000	6186000	And that's all we know about it so far.
6186000	6191000	No price point has been announced yet, but hey, we'll figure that out before or on the 29th of February.
6191000	6195000	So, they are also going to keep it a surprise right up until the last minute.
6195000	6196000	Surprise.
6196000	6197000	Surprise. It's $600.
6197000	6203000	Well, I think a little bit less, you know, the HTC Vive, that was always supposed to be more expensive anyways.
6203000	6207000	So, we'll see. I mean, if it's around the same price point as the Rift, it won't be as shocking.
6207000	6211000	I don't know. I guess we'll have to find out soon enough.
6211000	6218000	All right. Well, let's go to another story, except I closed my window.
6218000	6224000	Awkward. Dark Soccer, can you do whatever you had up on the mailbox?
6224000	6225000	Is the mailbox next?
6225000	6226000	Yeah.
6226000	6231000	Ah. No, you had a – never mind. I found my place. Live Radio, super awkward.
6231000	6233000	Oh, yeah, I did have one of the awesome games done quick.
6233000	6234000	Go ahead.
6234000	6236000	All right. Well, it took me a moment because whatever.
6236000	6243000	So, awesome games done quick raised $1.2 million over that for the Prevent Cancer Foundation,
6243000	6249000	which, as we've learned after it was done, cancer's a fucker. So.
6249000	6252000	Well, to be fair, I think a lot of us understood that to be true beforehand.
6252000	6255000	Well, yeah, but it's been really, really chill.
6255000	6259000	Cancer is good at killing people because it's cancer, not can't-cer.
6259000	6261000	Okay, that was really bad.
6261000	6267000	They also – yeah, some of the speedruns they did was, of course, Super Mario 64, Diablo Fest,
6268000	6274000	Belunky, Hudson Hawk, Super Mario Maker. They also did Rocky and Bully.
6274000	6276000	How would you speedrun Super Mario Maker?
6276000	6277000	I don't know.
6277000	6279000	I think it was certain pre-selected levels.
6279000	6280000	Yeah.
6280000	6284000	Remember, because we did talk about – we talked about this a lot last week a little bit as well.
6284000	6286000	They were not pre-selected. They were selected.
6286000	6291000	But we mentioned StepMania was one of the things they did. Remember we talked about that last week?
6291000	6292000	Yeah.
6292000	6293000	And that was more an exhibition.
6293000	6299000	Yeah, and that was like people who could do like so many keystrokes per second and be accurate.
6299000	6300000	It was pretty cool.
6300000	6301000	Yeah.
6301000	6308000	So the next Awesome Games Done Quick is Summer Games Done Quick, which is June 3rd through 9th in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
6308000	6309000	So there you go.
6309000	6313000	One thing I wanted to point out with that piece of information you had,
6313000	6316000	because we did already talk a little bit about Awesome Games Done Quick last week,
6316000	6324000	but that particular article had a link to more stats about like what games got what donations when.
6324000	6329000	And I thought that was really fascinating to kind of see like, you know, what people were really into.
6329000	6333000	Of course, more donations seem to come in at the end because everybody's a procrastinator.
6333000	6338000	So I don't know if you can really say like, oh, this game was better than this game or whatever.
6338000	6342000	But I thought it was very interesting to see that and like the Twitch viewership and all that.
6343000	6346000	For a stats nerd, there's a lot to chew on with that.
6346000	6348000	Always the Super Metroid races are pretty good.
6348000	6351000	Well, yeah, and those are the ones that are like really highly watched, too.
6351000	6354000	And people vote for kill the animals or save the animals.
6354000	6356000	Oh, yeah, that's a huge deal, obviously.
6356000	6358000	They did a lot of voting this year. It wasn't just that.
6358000	6362000	You could vote on what are you going to name the character in Final Fantasy IV and all this other crazy stuff.
6362000	6368000	They had this big one where they were, yeah, where they were either naming him Arby's or Biff.
6368000	6373000	And like people in France started flooding it because they wanted him to be named Biff.
6374000	6376000	It was like naming Edge Biff.
6378000	6379000	It was a thing.
6379000	6383000	And then like they like went to Arby's or something. It was weird.
6383000	6387000	Did Arby's Twitter actually comment on that? I thought I heard something about that.
6387000	6389000	Like anyone follows the Arby's Twitter.
6391000	6392000	Maybe if their food was good.
6392000	6395000	Arby's and Biff? That sounds like the next Splatfest.
6396000	6399000	Oh, yeah, they did a Splatoon.
6399000	6403000	They did. There was a Past vs. Future was this week. You know who won? Past.
6403000	6408000	And yet again, it was because Future was more popular, so Past did better.
6408000	6410000	That's what happens every Splatfest.
6410000	6411000	Yeah.
6411000	6416000	You have to choose the team that is going to be less popular. It's reverse psychology to win those things.
6416000	6421000	This is sort of neat, though. If you go over the thing, they were saying what, like there's the secret to Mana run
6421000	6425000	and how many viewers at that time and their total they were at at that time.
6425000	6431000	And it's a pretty neat kind of interactive thing, their little chart here.
6431000	6435000	Did you know, by the way, I'm going to I'm going to use this little tangent to give a shout out.
6435000	6440000	Our very own here at Orange Lawn Radio and VOG Network, Flaco Jones, who's been on the show before.
6440000	6444000	He is now getting into speedrunning PT.
6444000	6447000	Oh, how does that happen?
6447000	6453000	He did it in 13 minutes, which I guess was good enough to be the number three score on speedruns or whatever.
6453000	6458000	So I believe this is now a thing for the Flaco household is that he is going.
6458000	6461000	He is now a PT speedrunner, but I think that's kind of rad.
6461000	6465000	So I just there's so many random elements that.
6465000	6470000	But sometimes it's about perfecting the randomness, I guess there's randomness in other games that they do.
6470000	6473000	So I've been working on my Mario two.
6473000	6477000	I don't think I'll ever get as fast as those guys in the video.
6477000	6480000	But do you do the glitches and everything?
6480000	6485000	I'm still perfecting how to get through world one one in one fell swoop without stopping.
6485000	6488000	So it's something I'm working on. And then I'm starting on one, too.
6488000	6495000	But the hard thing about one, too, is that if you really want to beat it fast, you have to be able to, like, jump on the little flying guys.
6495000	6497000	You have to say, you know, how there's that flying carpet in the beginning.
6497000	6501000	Yeah, you have to be to be like Yolo and jump on the flying guys instead.
6501000	6504000	I have a hard time doing it, but what I can do is.
6504000	6506000	I thought that's how people normally.
6506000	6507000	No.
6507000	6511000	Unless you're thinking of something different because you have to, like, use an arrow.
6511000	6513000	Where you ride the bees, right?
6513000	6514000	No.
6514000	6516000	Or not the bees, but the flappy.
6516000	6519000	You skip the carpet and you jump on the guys that are attacking the carpet.
6519000	6520000	Yeah.
6520000	6521000	No, that's not.
6521000	6523000	You can do that with the princess.
6523000	6524000	Yeah.
6524000	6529000	I guess with Luigi, though, you can get the air you need to totally skip the cave in one, too.
6529000	6530000	Anyway.
6530000	6531000	There we go.
6531000	6532000	Let's see.
6532000	6533000	Let's move on.
6533000	6536000	I finally got my shit together and found that story I was going to talk about, and this
6536000	6537000	is a big one.
6537000	6540000	It has to do with Hitman and Hitman.
6540000	6545000	You may have heard this week that the pre-orders disappeared from the PlayStation Store, and
6545000	6546000	now we know why.
6546000	6554000	Because there was an announcement that Hitman is going to be a truly episodic AAA game experience.
6555000	6561000	So, on March 11th, the prologue mission and Paris will be released, and then there will
6561000	6566000	be an Italy version in April and Morocco in May.
6566000	6571000	From that point onward, you'll get monthly content, including three additional locations.
6571000	6578000	Thailand, the US, and Japan, until the season ends with the Japanese episode in 2016.
6578000	6580000	Note, that's not like countries where this is releasing.
6580000	6583000	That is countries as part of the story.
6583000	6585000	So, why did they do this?
6585000	6588000	Studio head Hans Seifert said,
6588000	6592000	We decided to take the full leap and publish Hitman as a truly episodic game experience.
6592000	6595000	Part of that decision is for a little bit of extra time to ensure every location we
6595000	6599000	release is at the quality level fitting for a Hitman game.
6599000	6600000	No.
6600000	6603000	But the main driving reason is that this will allow us to create a living game that will
6603000	6607000	expand and evolve over time and will establish a foundation for the future.
6607000	6612000	This is the first game in a storyline which will continue and expand with future Hitman
6612000	6613000	games.
6613000	6614000	Here's the price.
6614000	6618000	The intro pack with prologue in Paris, $15.
6618000	6620000	Each extra location, $10.
6620000	6627000	But, if you buy the intro pack, you can get the full game with the $50 upgrade pack.
6627000	6630000	So, that's $65 altogether.
6630000	6632000	Loki, you're dying to say something.
6632000	6635000	Their excuse of like, well, give us extra time to make sure the rest of those levels
6635000	6636000	are polished.
6636000	6639000	No, you don't just fucking release your game until all that shit is done.
6639000	6640000	That's how you do it.
6640000	6644000	You don't just like, oh, well, shit, we can't release this, we have to release this as episodic
6644000	6646000	because parts of the game aren't done.
6646000	6647000	That means your game is not done.
6647000	6648000	You don't release it.
6648000	6650000	But, Loki, the fiscal year ends in April.
6650000	6651000	Who gives a fuck?
6651000	6652000	You finish your shit.
6652000	6654000	This is the problem with the games industry.
6654000	6659000	It's just, they don't finish their shit and they release it as is, as episodic or something,
6659000	6664000	so that you can play little bits of the game and then pay more than fucking retail on that
6664000	6665000	shit.
6666000	6670000	Or, as this game, if it were released all at once, it would be just $60.
6670000	6672000	But, no, it's $65 now.
6672000	6674000	You know, and I think that's what I'll do.
6674000	6678000	I'm gonna wait until every piece is out, and then I'll see how people enjoy it.
6678000	6680000	I'll wait for the Game of the Year edition to come out.
6680000	6682000	Yeah, the inevitable $40 Game of the Year.
6682000	6687000	Oh, no, Steam sale, $7.43 to get everything.
6688000	6692000	Or, hell, you know, with the case with a lot of these Square Enix games, they'll just be free
6692000	6695000	as part of, like, PlayStation Plus or something.
6696000	6700000	God, can you imagine if a game like Super Mario Brothers did that, where it's like,
6700000	6705000	here's worlds one through three, and that's it, until next month, when you're gonna get
6705000	6706000	worlds four through six.
6706000	6707000	Like, it's just, what?
6707000	6709000	Yeah, here's worlds one through three.
6709000	6712000	Better buy a Mario amiibo to unlock four through six.
6712000	6715000	Buy Luigi the, you know, seven through nine.
6715000	6719000	Yeah, you laugh at that now, but, I mean, seriously, that's what they're fucking doing.
6719000	6723000	They're testing the fucking waters with this stupid one dungeon thing, and you people are
6723000	6726000	fucking buying into this shit because, ooh, the little pretty figurines!
6726000	6732000	And then, and then, this shit is gonna be fucking accepted going into the whole NX and
6732000	6736000	stuff, with their fucking cartridge-less system that everything's unlocked with fucking toys.
6736000	6740000	I hope you, I hope you're proud of yourself, because you are the problem.
6740000	6744000	You are the one causing this game industry to go to shit.
6745000	6750000	Well, I'm glad that they're pretty, and you can't avoid possibly spending money on them.
6752000	6756000	I'll buy all the amiibo in the world, but fuck this Hitman shit.
6758000	6761000	Seriously, fuck the Hitman shit, I'm completely with you on that.
6762000	6764000	At least we can agree on something, Luigi.
6764000	6767000	If you wanna give me the first episode for free, fucking make this shit shareware, is
6767000	6768000	how it should be fucking...
6768000	6769000	Shareware.
6769000	6772000	Seriously, that's what this fucking is, this is fucking shareware.
6772000	6775000	This is where, in the world we are right now, where it's episodic.
6775000	6779000	No, it's fucking shareware, you pay a little bit of money for the first episode to see
6779000	6782000	if you like it, and if you do, cool, you buy the full game.
6782000	6784000	If you don't, well, you've only, you're out a few bucks.
6784000	6786000	So it's Commander, it's Commander Keen all over again.
6786000	6790000	Except it's fucking $15 instead of five, or free.
6790000	6792000	That's the problem.
6792000	6795000	Or the long-distance fees on the BBS you're connected to.
6795000	6797000	I don't know, I don't know why I'm getting so upset about it, I don't give a shit about
6797000	6801000	Hitman because, like, it's just, it, people keep buying into this stuff, and that's why
6802000	6805000	our industry is like it is now with season passes and bullshit like this.
6805000	6809000	Alright, well speaking of season passes, what do you have next for us, Loki?
6809000	6818000	So anyways, what I have here is Mortal Kombat.
6818000	6824000	They're gonna be getting this new online match experience, I guess they're doing an overhaul
6824000	6830000	on the online for Mortal Kombat X, and with that, they're gonna be putting out a beta
6830000	6836000	test for it, so you can, anyone that's spent at least an hour of online play in Mortal
6836000	6842000	Kombat X as of January 19th can sign up for the beta, and only four characters will be
6842000	6848000	included at the start, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Briggs, and Cage, and more will be added as
6848000	6854000	the test goes on, so what they're doing with this is, I guess, improving the online play
6854000	6859000	experience, I'm not really sure, it's very vague, something that has to do with redoing
6859000	6863000	the network code and maybe improving lag.
6863000	6867000	I'm surprised that they're doing this now, since this has been out for a while already,
6867000	6871000	and now they've decided that, oh hey fuck, we need to retool everything?
6871000	6874000	Is it because you finished your DLC, is that why?
6874000	6878000	It's because you've already, you put all your DLC characters out there, and you sold all
6878000	6883000	that, and now you're like, oh well I guess we have time to fix the fucking game that
6883000	6885000	you guys are buying all this DLC for.
6885000	6889000	They have to rework things for the inevitable game of the year edition.
6889000	6894000	Yeah, they're taking a page out of fucking Capcom's book, they released the arcade edition
6894000	6899000	or some shit like that where they recharge you for the game for balancing shit.
6899000	6904000	Alright, well let's talk about, hey, since Loki is a huge fan of Amiibo support, let's
6904000	6910000	talk about a game on the Wii U that supports every single Amiibo, every single one of them
6910000	6911000	is supported in this game.
6911000	6916000	It's a game that's been developed by Lightwood Games, it's for the Wii U and the 3DS, it's
6916000	6918000	called Word Puzzles.
6918000	6924000	That's right, Word Puzzles by Paoji, I guess is the full name of the game, it's going
6924000	6929000	to allow you to actually use your Amiibo in the game.
6929000	6933000	Every single Amiibo is supported, even ones that haven't been announced yet.
6933000	6940000	It uses the nickname that you set when you register the Amiibo to generate a unique puzzle
6940000	6943000	so that whatever Amiibo you tap is unique to you.
6943000	6949000	So essentially, whatever word is stored on your Amiibo, you'll get a whole word search
6949000	6951000	puzzle with just that word.
6951000	6955000	And it's like playing like a Where's Waldo thing, the word only appears there once, but
6955000	6959000	all the letters or whatever all throughout the word puzzle itself.
6959000	6967000	So, yeah, I mean, but then this makes me think, well, okay, so if I name my Amiibo Fuck Boy,
6967000	6972000	I can get an entire puzzle that's just Fuck Boy?
6972000	6974000	Yeah.
6974000	6978000	I can see all sorts of dirty puzzles coming out of this thing.
6978000	6982000	Well, you have all those possibilities, just rename all your Amiibos different things.
6982000	6987000	Can I name my Amiibo dirty things, or does the Nintendo Police shut me down?
6987000	6989000	Oh, I'm sure they'll come and shut you down.
6989000	6993000	If I try to put ass in one of those, does it shut me down?
6993000	6995000	You get flagged by the police.
6995000	6996000	Maybe.
6996000	6997000	I get moderated.
6997000	6998000	Who knows?
6998000	6999000	All right.
6999000	7004000	Well, I'll get like a sad Reggie icon appear on the screen.
7004000	7007000	Here's the thing, though, with all due respect, because, you know, it is an indie developer
7007000	7008000	and so forth.
7008000	7013000	I don't know, the word puzzle thing, it just doesn't strike me as like the kind of game
7013000	7014000	I need to have.
7014000	7018000	If it was something I could play like online with friends to make it a little more exciting,
7018000	7019000	maybe I'd be down with that.
7019000	7024000	I'm pleased that they decided to actually add support for the Amiibos and stuff.
7024000	7028000	Granted, that it's very limited, but I mean, their game is quite limited as it is.
7028000	7030000	So, but props to them for actually doing that.
7030000	7034000	It's nice to know that other indie games can support that.
7034000	7039000	So, I'm surprised we don't see more indie games supporting that.
7039000	7043000	If I could play online with friends, we can hunt for Fuckboy together.
7043000	7044000	Like Minecraft.
7044000	7045000	Minecraft would be awesome.
7045000	7050000	Like if you get like a skin for your Minecraft character based off of whatever Amiibo that
7050000	7052000	you had scanned in or something like that.
7052000	7056000	Like if I want to dress up like Mario, I just put Mario on there and away we go.
7056000	7058000	I mean, that would be cool.
7058000	7061000	That would be something that's kind of neat.
7061000	7065000	Bonce006 over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7065000	7071000	The Nintendo Police will kick your door in and make you use PC safe words.
7071000	7075000	Reggie Fils-Aime personally is going to come to my house and punch me in the face.
7075000	7076000	That is what's going to happen.
7076000	7078000	Well, that's almost worth it for that.
7078000	7085000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7085000	7089000	We already visited it earlier in the show, but now it's officially that time where we
7089000	7090000	open up the mailbag.
7090000	7093000	Participate at orangelaundry.com.
7093000	7097000	Dark Soccer is going to dive in and read the rest of the emails waiting for us this week.
7097000	7101000	Just chiming in to say Rob's a hater and I love amplitude.
7101000	7103000	I was waiting for this.
7103000	7107000	I see where he's coming from, but I don't have any problems with music games introducing
7107000	7108000	me to new music.
7108000	7113000	Sure, it's nice that there are games like Rock Band that let me play songs I know, but
7113000	7119000	I feel like I've more enjoyed finding new music to like from rhythm games.
7119000	7123000	Not having played the PS2 amplitude though, I guess I don't have a point of comparison,
7123000	7126000	but I really have been enjoying the new one.
7126000	7131000	I found a few songs I like and I've been trying to get good enough to unlock the super difficulty.
7131000	7137000	Also, Freak Mode is great.
7137000	7142000	TLDR, thanks Konami, but I'll play rhythm games even without bad covers of Britney Spears'
7142000	7144000	songs and ER.
7144000	7147000	PS, at least he's right about Nino Cooney being good.
7147000	7148000	Thank you.
7148000	7149000	At least you cited me on something.
7149000	7154000	I'm sorry, I tried to play amplitude again and I played this song and it was so bad.
7154000	7156000	I'm sorry.
7156000	7161000	I'm all for new music when the music is really good, but I just think some of the stuff,
7161000	7165000	especially in the amplitude story mode, I think is really unexciting.
7165000	7166000	I'm sorry.
7166000	7169000	Some of it I love though, like I like the Crypt of the Necrodancer song and you all
7169000	7175000	know I love the Freeze Pop song, but I feel like there's a lot of filler.
7175000	7181000	So, I'm sorry, but I love the old amplitude and the old frequency.
7181000	7182000	Those games are great.
7182000	7188000	We've got a two part email, I think, from Robert M. Actually two emails, I should say.
7188000	7191000	Starting off in chronological order.
7191000	7195000	Just a note on last week's show, if you haven't already discussed it, according to sources
7195000	7203000	I've seen, Slow Beef, currently half of the satirical channel Retsupre with diabetes,
7203000	7207000	is considered one of the fathers of the Let's Play format on YouTube.
7207000	7211000	Beats me, of course, how the guys from Rooster Teeth get to have a Let's Play as a channel
7211000	7212000	game.
7212000	7218000	Also, of the games I picked up last Steam sale, I never store my payment info, more
7218000	7222000	for putting a barrier between myself and the impulse buys rather than for security.
7222000	7226000	The one I've been putting off the most time into a script of the Necrodancer.
7226000	7229000	Significantly more if you count listening to the soundtrack.
7229000	7233000	Has anyone there tried the game with an actual dance pad yet?
7233000	7235000	Oh god no.
7235000	7236000	I'm 37.
7236000	7239000	My DDR days have long passed.
7239000	7240000	I don't know.
7240000	7241000	That might be too much.
7241000	7243000	So here's the next part.
7243000	7248000	I apologize for not asking Bobby directly again, but from what you currently know, what
7248000	7254000	is the likelihood that the HTC Vive, or is it Viva or Vive, I guess.
7254000	7255000	Vive, I think.
7255000	7261000	In addition to using one Steam library on PC, would use or have a SKU that would use
7261000	7265000	the HTC phone, much like the Samsung Gear VR.
7265000	7266000	Hmm.
7266000	7268000	Wait, I'm not trying to under-
7268000	7269000	I don't think so, no.
7269000	7275000	I don't think they're going to do like a Gear VR version of HTC Vive.
7275000	7279000	I don't know why they need to do that when the Gear VR is already a thing that exists,
7279000	7284000	but with all these VR competitors, it's going to be very interesting to see what kind of
7284000	7285000	floats to the top.
7285000	7289000	And I sort of think it's going to be the PlayStation VR and the Oculus, and I'm not
7289000	7293000	sure there's a lot of room in the pool for everybody, but we'll see.
7293000	7298000	I mean, even as those words are leaving my mouth, but then I go, oh, but the Gear VR
7298000	7302000	is a really affordable option, and if Apple made a version of it, that would sell like
7302000	7305000	crazy too, so maybe there is room in the pool for more.
7305000	7308000	You know what I say, all you kids with your VR shit?
7308000	7310000	I'm going to read a book.
7310000	7312000	I'm going to read the newspaper.
7312000	7315000	What if you could read a book in VR?
7315000	7316000	No.
7316000	7317000	I want to read.
7317000	7321000	What if you could read a book on weed?
7321000	7326000	Bobby Black Wolf, who knows a little more about VR than we do, says HTC is abandoning
7326000	7329000	phones, and if the Vive was going to be cheaper than the Rift, they would have announced it
7329000	7330000	already.
7330000	7334000	Try to get that good publicity ahead of schedule.
7334000	7335000	Last one.
7335000	7338000	And it's labeled DJ is married to a hockey player.
7338000	7339000	Okay.
7339000	7340000	Hello, peoples.
7340000	7345000	With the upcoming debut of Fuller House on Netflix, the prospect of other somehow beloved
7345000	7349000	series being updated becomes more and more of a possibility.
7349000	7350000	My question for you is this.
7350000	7355000	What video game series would you least like to see updated?
7355000	7356000	My answer is missed.
7356000	7360000	As we saw in the last couple of attempts to release a game in the series, updating this
7360000	7363000	game will lead to the charm of the original being diminished.
7363000	7366000	Stay black, redertainment, trainer.
7366000	7367000	I don't know.
7367000	7369000	Ooh, this is a really good question.
7369000	7372000	What series don't you want them to touch?
7372000	7377000	I'm assuming because they'll fuck it up is the answer.
7377000	7381000	Well, we've already seen them do that with Knight Rider a few times.
7381000	7383000	I kind of feel like that's all.
7383000	7384000	I said game series.
7384000	7386000	I kind of game series game series.
7386000	7389000	I feel like that's already happened with blaster master.
7389000	7392000	Like the original on the NES is so good.
7392000	7394000	And then the Genesis one was garbage.
7394000	7400000	The remake should have been better as much as I would love a guardian legend update.
7400000	7406000	And there's a fan one in the works, but like an official one.
7406000	7409000	They'd have to really make it perfect.
7409000	7411000	Oh, I have a good answer for this.
7411000	7413000	Metal Gear Solid.
7413000	7419000	That is a game that they, or that is a series they should not try to start over
7419000	7423000	or reboot because a certain person is not affiliated with a certain company anymore.
7423000	7427000	And for that matter, they probably shouldn't make, they shouldn't do a
7427000	7430000	Castlevania remake either while we're at it.
7430000	7431000	Let's just be real.
7431000	7435000	Those games are never going to be as good as they were on the PlayStation or on
7435000	7437000	the Super Nintendo or even the NES.
7437000	7440000	I think, I think those are my answers right there.
7443000	7446000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at
7446000	7449000	bognetwork.com use the passphrase hamster.
7450000	7452000	All right. That was it for emails.
7452000	7453000	That was it.
7453000	7457000	All right. If you want to send emails next week, participate at orange
7457000	7459000	lounge radio.com is the place to send those emails.
7459000	7461000	In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.
7467000	7469000	All this is bad.
7469000	7471000	Here is justice.
7471000	7473000	Here is punishment.
7473000	7475000	Here.
7475000	7477000	This is fucked up.
7477000	7478000	Garsakra?
7478000	7487000	FU goes to the governor of Michigan for the fuckery with the water and for
7487000	7489000	the state of the schools there.
7489000	7498000	You don't have this opulent center for, uh, I'm trying to remember what
7498000	7501000	the place was, but it was like this really gorgeous building while your
7501000	7506000	schools have mushrooms growing out of the walls and black mold and moldy
7506000	7507000	food being served to children.
7507000	7508000	I'm sorry.
7508000	7509000	Fuck you.
7509000	7513000	You need to get fired and also the same to the lady who's running the, um,
7513000	7515000	democratic national convention.
7515000	7517000	Cause you're also stupid.
7517000	7518000	I'm done.
7518000	7523000	Loki, um, just after you did my new schedule, because it makes it difficult
7523000	7527000	for me to eat or purchase food that normally would eat during the week.
7527000	7531000	Like I used to do like sandwiches and stuff, and now I've been having to be
7531000	7535000	forced to go to McDonald's because it's the closest fast food place to my
7535000	7536000	work.
7536000	7539000	And I really don't like eating that shit.
7539000	7542000	And I would think about going across the street, the subway, but we had
7542000	7545000	subway catered at our work the other day and it was fucking nasty.
7545000	7549000	So it's like, uh, I don't know.
7549000	7553000	Um, my FU of the week, uh, I don't know.
7553000	7555000	Things have been going relatively well.
7555000	7557000	I would say FU for the power outage.
7557000	7558000	That was shitty.
7558000	7563000	Um, even though dark soccer is, you know, FU, this kind of pales in
7563000	7564000	comparison to that.
7564000	7567000	It was awfully inconvenient, uh, where I work this week.
7567000	7571000	We couldn't drink the water for two days because there was a whole, uh,
7572000	7575000	scare about whatever bacteria causes E. coli or whatever.
7575000	7576000	So that was very inconvenient.
7576000	7577000	Oh God.
7577000	7580000	My fucking wife seriously did this shit.
7580000	7583000	Like she does these things every now and then where like,
7583000	7587000	and I have to indulge her and I really even live in the affected area.
7587000	7588000	Exactly.
7588000	7589000	Exactly.
7589000	7594000	And I had to go out in the fucking night to go purchase a fucking case
7594000	7596000	of water for no fucking reason.
7596000	7599000	And, and did she fucking use the water that we purchased?
7599000	7601000	No, she's still getting shit out of the fucking tap.
7601000	7603000	It's like a fucking waste of my time.
7603000	7605000	Except they did get some Ingress time in there.
7605000	7607000	So that's fine because I was out to do that.
7607000	7609000	But no, seriously though, I had to go to the store for that shit.
7609000	7611000	I'm like, dude, that's like in the pocket area.
7611000	7613000	That's nowhere fucking near our house.
7613000	7615000	We're in a completely separate water district from this shit.
7615000	7617000	And she's like, well, I just want to be safe.
7617000	7619000	Don't you want to take precautions?
7619000	7621000	I'm like, oh my fucking God.
7621000	7624000	But I got Ingress time in, so that's all right.
7624000	7625000	This is supposed to be my FU.
7625000	7626000	Sorry.
7626000	7628000	FU to Loki for stealing my thunder.
7628000	7629000	FU to cancer.
7629000	7631000	Oh yeah, I have FU to cancer after this week.
7631000	7632000	That's every week.
7632000	7635000	That goes without saying every single week, I think.
7635000	7636000	All right.
7636000	7638000	Um, let's get...
7638000	7642000	Well, I should go ahead and say my goodbyes to...
7642000	7644000	Oh yes, it is that time.
7644000	7647000	Because I have to be at work on a holiday.
7647000	7648000	I'm sorry.
7648000	7649000	But it's money.
7649000	7650000	Well, who for money?
7650000	7652000	Well, uh, DarkStalker, before you leave us tonight,
7652000	7654000	do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
7654000	7657000	Um, no. Bye.
7657000	7658000	Bye.
7658000	7659000	Bye.
7659000	7660000	All right, let's get into a couple more stories,
7660000	7662000	and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
7662000	7665000	If you want to take DarkStalker's place here on the show tonight,
7665000	7669000	as if anyone could, you can give us a call, 1-877-GAMO-LR,
7669000	7672000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7672000	7673000	All one word.
7673000	7677000	We will be opening up those numbers in a minute,
7677000	7679000	but we have a couple more stories first.
7679000	7680000	Loki.
7680000	7685000	So, we talked a while back about Vivendi selling off chairs
7685000	7688000	of Activision, or Activision purchasing that type of thing.
7688000	7692000	Well, now they have finally sold the remaining chairs
7692000	7695000	of Activision Blizzard for 1.1 billion
7695000	7699000	to some undisclosed financial institute.
7699000	7703000	And basically saying that it was the perfect time
7703000	7707000	to unload 5.7% of the chairs they retain
7707000	7710000	as a soccer call of duty in World of Warcraft.
7710000	7714000	The company had risen by 90% in the last year.
7714000	7719000	So, yay, we don't have to hear about Vivendi games.
7720000	7722000	What do you think this might mean for the future,
7722000	7724000	especially when Activision and Blizzard have all these...
7724000	7726000	That sold to Jugglords.
7726000	7728000	Have all these products.
7728000	7731000	I don't think it means much of anything, to be honest,
7731000	7733000	other than just changing hands.
7733000	7735000	They're not owned by Vivendi anymore.
7735000	7736000	They're not owned by the man.
7736000	7739000	Or a portion of them is not owned by them.
7739000	7741000	I don't think it's going to make any sort of difference.
7741000	7744000	All right. Well, last but not least,
7744000	7746000	another anniversary note to close on.
7746000	7748000	But this one's about Dragon Quest.
7748000	7753000	And this year is the 30th anniversary of Dragon Quest in Japan.
7753000	7757000	And Square Enix is going to be going all out for a celebration.
7757000	7759000	And there was a live press event that happened this week
7759000	7763000	where series creator Yuji Horii and producer Ryutaro Ichimura
7763000	7767000	talked about how Square Enix will be celebrating Dragon Quest.
7767000	7770000	First off will be Dragon Quest Builders
7770000	7774000	for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita on January 28th.
7774000	7779000	And then Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 3 on the 3DS follows in March.
7779000	7782000	And then Dragon Quest Heroes 2 in May
7782000	7785000	for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.
7785000	7788000	But again, remember, these are all Japanese information,
7788000	7791000	so we don't know about what's going to happen in the U.S.
7791000	7794000	There was no date announced for Dragon Quest XI,
7794000	7797000	no trailer screenshots or any of that
7797000	7801000	for this anticipated 3DS or PlayStation 4 title.
7801000	7803000	But that is what they got in Japan this week.
7803000	7808000	Nothing about the U.S. or if we will ever get that Dragon Quest Theatrhythm game.
7808000	7812000	But the answer, unfortunately, is probably not fucking likely,
7812000	7816000	which is really sad because I really want that game.
7816000	7819000	But I guess I'd have to get a Japanese 3DS and import it
7819000	7821000	if I really want it that bad.
7821000	7824000	All right, that's it. Skypline is open for your calls.
7824000	7829000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7829000	7832000	All one word. The Skypline is open.
7832000	7835000	While we wait for some calls to come in, let me check in with Loki
7835000	7837000	and see if there's any last-minute stories tonight.
7837000	7840000	No, not really.
7840000	7841000	Not really?
7841000	7844000	No. I did notice that the new Humble Bundle, though,
7844000	7846000	that's out now is the Full Motion Video Humble Bundle.
7846000	7847000	Did you see that?
7847000	7850000	Oh, yeah, I saw something like that with roundabouts in that, right?
7850000	7852000	Roundabouts in it, yeah, I don't really give a shit about that
7852000	7853000	because I already have it on PlayStation 4,
7853000	7856000	but I do want 7th Guest in 11th Hour, so I may have to purchase...
7856000	7858000	That's in there? I love those games.
7858000	7860000	That's in the dollar tier as well.
7860000	7862000	Yeah, and there's Steam versions of the game,
7862000	7864000	so I will be purchasing that just for that.
7864000	7866000	That's pretty awesome.
7866000	7869000	Although, I have a bad feeling those are games that were way better.
7869000	7871000	Yes, they were.
7871000	7874000	You try to play them now, it's like, okay, this is really hard to play.
7874000	7876000	Is Phantasmagoria in the bundle?
7876000	7879000	It is not. It is...
7879000	7881000	I want to say there was...
7881000	7883000	Let me see here. I'm going to bring it back up here.
7883000	7887000	There was the, I think, a Tex Murphy game.
7887000	7889000	And what else was it?
7889000	7893000	That fucking shootout game that they always...
7893000	7896000	Like Mad Dog McCree or whatever, because that was on the Wii, right?
7896000	7899000	I don't think Mad Dog McCree was...
7899000	7901000	They had Tex Murphy, the Complete Pack,
7901000	7904000	Tesla Effect, Tex Murphy Adventure,
7904000	7906000	7th Guest in 11th Hour Pack,
7906000	7908000	Missing and Interactive Thriller Episode 1.
7908000	7910000	That's all part of the dollar tier.
7910000	7913000	$5 or more to get roundabout and Her Story, which apparently is pretty good.
7913000	7915000	Oh yeah, I've heard Her Story is pretty good.
7915000	7917000	Yeah, but it's not really a full motion video game,
7917000	7919000	but I understand why they did that.
7919000	7920000	Huh, that's interesting.
7920000	7923000	And the weekly bundles, I don't think they add other stuff to that later on.
7923000	7925000	So, yeah.
7925000	7927000	I do want 7th Guest. I'll buy that for it all.
7927000	7929000	That isn't the official bundle of the now,
7929000	7932000	but it's the Humble Weekly Bundle, because they do different bundles.
7932000	7934000	It's confusing.
7934000	7937000	Dungeonbuster in chat says it's missing the Christopher Walken
7937000	7939000	full motion video game.
7939000	7941000	Ripper, no sale.
7941000	7943000	Another shout out for our skype line.
7943000	7945000	1877 Game OLR, our username on skype.
7945000	7947000	Orange Lounge Radio.
7947000	7950000	You know what other important full motion video game it's missing?
7950000	7953000	SimCity on CD-ROM.
7953000	7955000	Oh my god, that'd be awesome.
7955000	7957000	The amazing cutaways with the weather reports.
7957000	7960000	You know, aren't they supposed to be doing that thing now
7960000	7962000	with EA's Origin or whatever,
7962000	7964000	where they're supposed to be having a monthly service
7964000	7966000	that you can play all these games
7966000	7968000	like any game that they have?
7968000	7970000	I thought that was the thing on Xbox One.
7970000	7972000	No, they're doing something now that's actually going to be
7972000	7974000	on PC as part of Origin.
7974000	7976000	You pay like 15 bucks a month
7976000	7978000	and you get unlimited games, basically.
7978000	7980000	I wonder if they would bring SimCity back.
7980000	7982000	You know, the old SimCity.
7982000	7984000	If they would bring the SimCity on CD-ROM back,
7984000	7987000	I would so be there. Is anyone from EA or Origin listening?
7987000	7989000	That's the one thing I want.
7989000	7991000	Do they have an abandonware yet?
7991000	7993000	Like where you can download the...
7993000	7995000	You know, I haven't really tried looking.
7995000	7997000	I'm not willing to pay for it.
7997000	7999000	I'm not willing to pay a lot for it,
7999000	8001000	but I wouldn't pay for it if it would go up.
8001000	8003000	Tigerclaw is pointing out it's called Origin Access,
8003000	8005000	is the name of that program.
8005000	8007000	Yeah, we didn't even talk about that.
8007000	8009000	But that's something that they're doing as well.
8009000	8011000	Origin Access, where you can pay 15 bucks a month
8011000	8013000	and you get...
8013000	8015000	I don't know if it's all the games
8015000	8017000	or if they're going to do it like the EA Access thing
8017000	8019000	where you can basically have access
8019000	8021000	to different games in their library.
8021000	8023000	No, I hadn't heard about that.
8023000	8025000	All right, I'm going to put only one more
8025000	8027000	request for calls out there.
8027000	8029000	I get the sense we have a little bit less
8029000	8031000	of a live audience than we usually do tonight.
8031000	8033000	The three-day weekend probably coming into play,
8033000	8035000	I think. You've got some people that are probably out of town.
8035000	8037000	Oh, I'm sorry. It wasn't 15 a month.
8037000	8039000	It's $5 a month.
8039000	8041000	Oh, wow. That's really not bad.
8041000	8043000	You get access to a growing collection of PC games
8043000	8045000	plus 10% off of Origin purchases.
8045000	8047000	So it's really like
8047000	8049000	all the crap that's five years old or more
8049000	8051000	is in the $5 bundle.
8051000	8053000	I think it's all the crap that they gave away for free
8053000	8055000	like Dragon Age. Well, they have
8055000	8057000	Dragon Age Inquisition, Battlefield,
8057000	8059000	Hardline. Dragon Age Inquisition
8059000	8061000	is kind of a good game.
8061000	8063000	Well, no, I'm not saying that they're crap.
8063000	8065000	I think a lot of the games are the ones
8065000	8067000	they were giving away for free already, like Battlefield 3,
8067000	8069000	Hardline they haven't done yet.
8069000	8071000	All right.
8071000	8073000	One more shout-out. 1-877-GAMEO-LR
8073000	8075000	or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8075000	8077000	Otherwise, I guess
8077000	8079000	we're going to end up wrapping up early, but
8079000	8081000	for a three-day weekend again.
8081000	8083000	More Ingress time, I guess. Yeah, I saw you over there
8083000	8085000	plotting your road home and what damage
8085000	8087000	you're going to cause on the way.
8087000	8089000	I already have.
8089000	8091000	I'm trying to, obviously, I'm not going to
8091000	8093000	shout everything out on the air where you're going, but okay.
8093000	8095000	Oh, looking for some fields to close.
8095000	8097000	Yep.
8097000	8099000	Awesome. All right. Well, the Skype line
8099000	8101000	isn't lighting up, so I guess
8101000	8103000	that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8103000	8105000	If for whatever reason you were just feeling
8105000	8107000	shy tonight, you can always email us.

8113000	8115000	You know, I love the live audience, but
8115000	8117000	I know there's many of you out there who
8117000	8119000	have been listening for a while, who've never reached out and said
8119000	8121000	hello. Please feel free to say hello.
8121000	8123000	This is the time to do that.

8127000	8129000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
8129000	8131000	I do read everything that goes to
8131000	8133000	the O-L-R Twitter, even if
8133000	8135000	I don't always. I usually, I'll write a
8135000	8137000	response if it necessitates one, even if
8137000	8139000	I don't always read them on air. Sorry about that.
8139000	8141000	Alright, that's going to do it
8141000	8143000	for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys

8175000	8177000	Well, before we wrap it up, we have to get everybody's
8177000	8179000	final thought for the night. So,
8179000	8181000	my final thought for the night will be that
8181000	8183000	I did pretty much
8183000	8185000	finish, I have just one little drop of that liquor
8185000	8187000	left at Dark Sakura and
8187000	8189000	it actually did hold up really well for
8189000	8191000	however long that was in the fridge, like three months.
8191000	8193000	So, kudos to Dark Sakura's
8193000	8195000	brewing factory for that.
8195000	8197000	Even if I didn't really feel the effects
8197000	8199000	of that too much tonight, but if I
8199000	8201000	seem to ramble excessively, more so
8201000	8203000	than usual tonight, you can blame that.
8203000	8205000	Loki, how about your final thought tonight?
8205000	8207000	My final thought is I tried working on the game
8207000	8209000	this week. I did get a
8209000	8211000	little bit of programming done, but it's just not
8211000	8213000	as much as I'd like.
8213000	8215000	I'm just trying to figure out what I need to cut
8215000	8217000	feature-wise to get what
8217000	8219000	I want done. I was trying to do the high score
8219000	8221000	thing, but that's been taking forever.
8221000	8223000	I haven't get enough
8223000	8225000	free time to where I'm actually conscious enough
8225000	8227000	to work on the game, especially after I get
8227000	8229000	home and have to deal with the kids. It's just
8229000	8231000	at night, not working, and during the day,
8231000	8233000	not working out. Note to self,
8233000	8235000	I need to get Gabe and
8235000	8237000	Bree from the SAC IGDA
8237000	8239000	back here to yell at you about that whole
8239000	8241000	game situation, because I know they have
8241000	8243000	another event. They're going to a bigger venue
8243000	8245000	this year. But what? Doesn't he do that as
8245000	8247000	his day job? I mean, if I was fucking doing
8247000	8249000	this as my day job, I would be...
8249000	8251000	I don't think that is his day job.
8251000	8253000	I think it's a labor of love, I think.
8253000	8255000	Kind of like how this podcast is.
8255000	8257000	I don't know. I could go back to my old game
8257000	8259000	I was working on, but I want to get this done at least.
8259000	8261000	Something done on this.
8261000	8263000	You can do it. We believe in you.
8263000	8265000	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode
8265000	8267000	of Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again everybody
8267000	8269000	for listening. Have a great week. We'll be back in
