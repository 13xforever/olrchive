7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, two groups have tried to register trademarks that have been a part of geek and gaming culture for many years, both being met with significant outcry and opposition. We'll tell you about each of them and get your take along with your calls and more, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 629 for this January the 31st of 2016.
46000	66000	I don't know how we are already at the last day of January, but here it is. We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, live with you guys at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
66000	83000	And if you are listening live, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where SHO 100 Matt says, January really flew. Yes it did, and here we are, pretty much by the time people hear the podcast version of this, it's going to be February, and we're in MAGFest month. I can't believe it, we were just talking to Bobby about that a little bit before the show tonight.
83000	94000	Anyhow, my name, Rob Roberts, you can follow me on Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E, joining you from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-hosts. Say hello over there to Techmaster Loki!
94000	104000	Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. I see you plotting your next move. I'm not plotting my next move, I was just seeing if what I took down actually took down what I thought it did.
105000	116000	It's all good. So you and I are sort of the reasons why there was no show last night, or last last night, last week. There was no show last week, sorry about that, you guys know I hate missing shows.
116000	127000	But I was, I was pretty sick actually. If you did hear Bobby's show, I ended up doing a call-in, and I was kind of like right on the last stages of battling something sinacy.
127000	137000	And I was like, me doing a three hour show, not really going to be a lot of fun, so I don't think that's going to work for me. And then Loki, you had a sick kid, right?
137000	141000	Yeah, my youngest was throwing up.
142000	160000	So that's no fun. So there was no show last week. And then here's the weird part, is that unfortunately we don't have DarkSock right here tonight in studio, because even though she was fine and good to go last week, and I guess would have done this show solo for all we know, she was unable to make it at the last minute tonight.
160000	172000	She had a situation come up, so she was not able to be here tonight. But she even said on the phone to me, she was like, I don't want to be known as the flake queen, and I was like, I will make very clear, you are not the reason last week didn't happen.
172000	178000	So DarkSockra gets a pass on last week, but she gets a mark on this week, no I'm kidding, she's fine.
178000	188000	So sadly, no DarkSockra joining us tonight in studio, but we do have, and I'm really appreciative here, filling in at the last minute in studio tonight. Say hello everybody to Shane, Shane Alinko.
188000	190000	I can't talk right now, I have more wine to drink.
190000	192000	Okay, so can we talk about this a little bit?
192000	194000	So he is a perfect replacement.
196000	205000	He has a perfect replacement for DarkSockra this week. So you, probably not even like three months ago, were that guy that was like, I don't drink wine, wine is stupid.
205000	207000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not how it goes.
207000	209000	Alright, then you tell me how this goes.
209000	216000	The way it goes is that I've had wine in the past, I liked it because it's part of Sangria. And I like Sangria.
216000	217000	That's true, I like Sangria too.
217000	218000	It's pretty good.
218000	221000	It's the best thing to have with the Brazilian barbecue, in my opinion, yes.
221000	233000	But like wine in general, I just, you know, wasn't really feeling. But then, you know, Flaco Jones and his wife, they went and got some wine from a winery, and they're like, Shane, try this.
233000	242000	And so I was the wine tasting guinea pig, even though they knew they liked him already. It's like, what will Shane do? It's like a React video basically.
242000	247000	We're going to talk about React videos. We actually would not be able to make one of those potentially. We'll get into that later.
247000	259000	So the whole thing is, like, spoiler alert, all wine tastes like shoes. That's what I figured out. I dislike wine a whole lot. Some white ones are pretty good.
259000	260000	You like the rosé.
260000	271000	Yeah, that. That was okay. Like, oh, and then I got yelled at because I mixed Martinelli's Sparkling Cider in one, and Flaco Jones's wife was like, you need to leave right now.
272000	276000	But it made it taste good. But if it's a red wine, it tastes like a shoe.
276000	277000	Okay.
277000	279000	Various types of shoes.
279000	283000	So I noticed that you had this thing, like you tended to like the sweet wines.
283000	287000	I just like, if I'm going to drink alcohol period, and it's not a shot, it has to be sweet.
287000	296000	So I was telling you, I said, Shane, I know a winery that makes, like, they specialize in sweet wines. I drive out there to get my wine there from the winery. You'll like this.
296000	299000	And you were kind of like, you know, whatever, whatever, Rob, you're never right.
299000	300000	That's true.
300000	305000	But then you came over and just before during Bobby's show, I poured you a glass of wine.
305000	309000	And I was like, you know, don't pour too much because I'm not going to want to drink it.
309000	312000	You're not going to like it. And now you're in this room.
312000	317000	And now I could drink it all day. Like, I found a water replacement.
318000	322000	So yes, Shane Alinko and I are drinking wine.
322000	324000	Oh, and wine hits so hard pretty quick too.
324000	326000	We're going to have to finish off the bottle somehow.
326000	329000	Well, just put it in front of me. It'll be gone before the show's over.
329000	332000	As long as you're safe to drive or you're crashing on the couch, I don't know.
332000	335000	I would just crash somewhere, either in the road or on the couch.
335000	337000	Don't joke about that. That's not funny.
337000	340000	I wouldn't be texting. I'd be drunk.
340000	342000	Anyway, well, I will say this, though.
342000	346000	That winery I almost bought because they make a rosé.
346000	348000	It probably would be pretty good.
348000	349000	It would probably be pretty good.
349000	352000	Do they make red ones? Because I don't know if you could have, like, shoes that taste sweet.
352000	353000	They do make red ones, but they aren't sweet.
353000	355000	Okay, well then, yeah, there would be no point in getting those.
355000	359000	Anyway, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
359000	361000	Martin's in our chat room tonight and says,
361000	363000	Red wine is something you need to learn how to appreciate.
363000	366000	Like, nobody likes beer the first time. They try it either.
366000	368000	I still don't like beer.
368000	369000	No, still don't.
369000	373000	Yeah, I mean, I don't appreciate drinking shoes. It's just not my thing.
373000	376000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Fuck wine. Fireball.
376000	379000	Oh, that would be fun too, though. I don't mind that.
379000	381000	Are you going to mix fireball with the wine?
381000	386000	No, because this is like drinking really delicious, like, apple juice almost.
386000	389000	Yeah, one of my friends hates this wine because he says it's just cool.
389000	391000	Why are they your friend?
391000	394000	All right, let's talk real quick. We're going to get into video gaming news
394000	397000	and last week's news set to Holik and everything we missed and everything.
397000	403000	But I do want to give Shane Olinko an ample chance because a lot's changed since the last time you were here on this program.
403000	405000	Yeah, I got an iPad Pro.
405000	408000	You did. And it's nice. And you've been playing games like...
408000	412000	Oh, yeah. Music games are so good on this, except I don't care for ReRave. I'm sorry.
412000	415000	Sorry, Kyle Ward. You're hot, but I don't care for ReRave.
415000	419000	And I think Shane is wrong in that department that ReRave is plenty fine.
419000	422000	I actually think it's better on my phone than on the bigger screen.
422000	424000	Oh, so you just think the size...
424000	428000	Yeah, I don't have a problem with the game. I think the game is fine, but I don't like it on the bigger screen.
428000	429000	Oh, okay.
429000	432000	I didn't really like it in the arcade either. I think it's a great phone game, though.
432000	436000	Interesting. I don't think Kyle can be too mad at you since she still likes it somewhere.
436000	442000	But I thought it was fine. But I have heard complaints like, ironically enough, Ingressors.
442000	446000	I know some that play on a tablet that have data on the tablet.
446000	450000	And they don't like it as much because when they try to do the glyph and stuff, it's too big.
450000	452000	Oh, yeah. That would be really hard to do really quick.
452000	455000	I have heard that sometimes a bigger playing service can be an issue.
455000	461000	Yeah, but like DJ Max Technica Q on this, which they don't even support anymore.
461000	465000	It hasn't had a new song pack, I think, since 2014.
465000	470000	And Sidus. Love Sidus on this game. So good. Those are my most played games on here.
470000	473000	Okay, but besides your iPad, you have...
473000	474000	I got more Power Ranger toys.
474000	476000	You did. And now you have a podcast.
476000	480000	I do. Oh my gosh, I'm so tired of podcasting right now.
480000	484000	We have done eight shows in 19 days.
484000	486000	We is who?
486000	489000	Me and Spike. Captain Spike from Game Buoy.
489000	493000	Awesome. So you guys now have... Tell us a little bit about this show. What is it? It's a Power Ranger show.
493000	498000	It's a Power Ranger show. We try to stay super positive because there's a lot of negativity in any sort of fandom.
498000	501000	It's also got gay elements because, surprise, we're gay.
501000	507000	And we just talk and have a good time. We review episodes. We talk about news.
507000	516000	Lately, our past few episodes have been nothing but the most recent season up until yesterday for America, which was Dino Charge.
516000	522000	And we just rushed to get through the first 20 episodes so we could start talking about current episodes.
522000	529000	So yesterday was the season premiere. So starting this week, we will have current shows to talk about.
529000	534000	Let me ask this question. I don't personally feel this way, but I have to ask tough questions.
534000	538000	Power Rangers is a kids' show. What do adults have to say about a kids' show?
538000	541000	Apparently two and a half hours worth sometimes.
541000	544000	What do you get out of Power Rangers being in your 30s?
544000	550000	It's just a superhero show. I don't really see it that different than watching the Avengers or watching X-Men.
550000	555000	It might be more geared towards kids, but it's still superheroes and it's fun.
555000	561000	And sometimes they do put things in there for adults that kids won't pick up.
561000	568000	Or it's just neat. It's not like, I don't know. I can't stand SpongeBob, but people my age and older love it.
568000	573000	So you can always find reasons to like something that may not be in your age group.
573000	576000	But screw that. It's your choice to what you like.
576000	581000	5th Dream in chat over at live.hognetwork.com brings up Pokemon as a kids' game.
581000	583000	Is it?
583000	589000	Here's the thing though. Keep in mind we're celebrating the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.
589000	595000	So if you're 30 and you love Pokemon, it's because you were probably playing it as a kid.
595000	604000	That's true. And also, I don't mean to be a jerk or just to say, are you sure you're dumb?
604000	608000	But the Pokemon World Championships, those are streamed on Twitch.
608000	613000	How many 6-year-olds are watching Twitch? I mean, there probably are some.
613000	618000	But I don't know. Last year when the World Championships were on, I was glued to Twitch.
618000	620000	I could not quit watching. It was so good.
620000	624000	And this year it's in San Francisco, so I want to go down there.
625000	629000	Sorry, I'm getting the comments from chat that my mic is dying, so I just switched out.
629000	635000	I don't know what's up with the green mic I've been using, but I've switched that out there, so hopefully that doesn't happen again.
635000	638000	The joys of doing live radio. What can you do?
638000	640000	I don't know.
640000	642000	I guess something might be wrong with the wire.
642000	649000	And with all the mix and match that goes around here in the studio, I wouldn't be surprised at all if the wire is just somehow on its last leg.
649000	652000	So anyway, sorry about that. But I don't even know what I said now.
652000	659000	It was about Pokemon being kids or adults. And Pokemon Go coming out. Is that really going to be...
659000	667000	Well, 6-year-olds do have cell phones now, but I expect a lot more adults will be playing that than kids.
667000	672000	Well, I think it's going to be a big family thing. I think you're going to have a lot of 30-somethings playing it with their kids.
672000	679000	You brought up Flaco and Mrs. Flaco earlier. They'll probably... I just assumed they'd play that game maybe with their kids. Maybe.
679000	688000	I don't know if that's something them specifically are into, but that's kind of an example where you have the 30-somethings who grew up with Pokemon will be playing that with their kids.
688000	694000	It's kind of like, and you're going to hate this example, but I don't care. I've been having a lot of wine today, so I'm just going to say what I think.
694000	697000	How many bottles have you gone through?
697000	701000	It's kind of like the audience I see at Rocky Horror Picture Show these days.
701000	703000	I already hate this example.
703000	709000	The audience at the Rocky Horror Picture Show, we are fortunate that we sell out a lot of the shows we do here in Sacramento.
709000	713000	Which, by the way, we have one coming up on February 13th that I'm hosting for you locals here in SAC.
713000	723000	But a lot of the audience I see now is people that are in their 40s when they were going to the movie when it first came out, like in theaters.
723000	730000	Or even people in their 30s that went through it in the 90s and so forth, bringing their teenagers to experience it for the first time.
730000	734000	So it's interesting to see how that generation handoff happens.
734000	738000	And the reason why I bring up that example, it's more than just games. It certainly happens with movies, too.
738000	746000	I think even Star Wars and the success of Episode 7 is a lot of the parents, perhaps, taking their...
746000	750000	And the parents are experiencing it like they were kids and bringing their own kids.
750000	753000	And that's just throwing out the prequels, like most people do.
753000	756000	And you know, Labyrinth is getting a reboot, supposedly.
756000	757000	Is that real, though?
757000	762000	If it's real, you know, whatever kid I choose to kidnap, I will take to Labyrinth and be like, this is what I grew up with, too.
762000	765000	There you go.
765000	768000	Screw you, Toby! You're staying here!
768000	770000	I'm not dealing with your fucking ass.
770000	776000	Are you actually going to have your own Labyrinth, perhaps? Are you a goblin king in training?
776000	778000	That's creepy.
778000	782000	I still think it would have been cool to follow the comic books for the sequel.
782000	784000	Oh, the manga?
784000	785000	Yeah, the manga.
785000	790000	Yeah, I never read those. I was like, they're ruining Labyrinth, probably, but they're probably actually good.
790000	795000	I just was like, I'm so a purist about Labyrinth, and it can't be touched.
795000	799000	Alright, one tangential topic, and then we'll get into video games for sure.
799000	800000	One?
800000	803000	One. Can David Bowie be replaced as the Goblin King, though?
803000	804000	No.
804000	806000	No, I don't think he can. Like, whoever is going to...
806000	812000	If they were to remake it or do a sequel or whatever, whoever's going to step into that role is damned.
813000	815000	That's why they just can't do it until we have the technology to just...
815000	816000	To bring him back?
816000	817000	Bring him back.
817000	818000	Yeah, that would be okay, too.
818000	821000	Actually, there's one person. One person I would be okay with.
821000	822000	Who?
822000	823000	Tilda Swinton.
823000	827000	I've seen that, and I don't know who that person is, but it's a she, right?
827000	830000	Yeah, Tilda Swinton. But it doesn't matter. She played Bob Dylan in some movie.
830000	835000	But you have to be musical. Like, you have to also...
835000	838000	She can do anything. You have this gigantic iPad.
838000	839000	And I'm talking...
839000	841000	It does an internet. Look up Tilda Swinton right now.
841000	844000	I can't. I'm talking about Power Rangers stuff with people.
844000	847000	It's way more important. But you just have to get some random pop star.
847000	850000	Like, it could be somebody from One Direction to be...
850000	852000	Oh, what is wrong with you?
852000	853000	I've had too much fun.
853000	855000	We'll just get David Hasselhoff. It works, right?
855000	857000	Shut it down.
857000	864000	Oh, twist! What if Jennifer Connelly became the Goblin Queen, and then it follows somebody new?
864000	867000	I guess that's alright. Jennifer Connelly's pretty awesome.
867000	868000	Well, yeah, but she was in the first...
868000	869000	Yeah, duh, I know that.
869000	872000	I don't know if you know that. You had a lot to drink.
872000	877000	Or what if she gets kidnapped and the grown-up Toby or whatever has to go save her?
877000	880000	That would be cool. But who would be the villain at that point?
880000	882000	I think they had a queen in the manga.
882000	883000	Oh, did they?
883000	889000	I didn't really read it. I bought it. I think I bought it for Dark Sakura, actually, but...
889000	894000	Oh, well then they could just get Lady Gaga since she was an actress now, too.
894000	895000	Yeah, that would work.
895000	899000	Tigerclaw in chat says, Tilda Swinton is playing a character in the Doctor Strange movie.
899000	902000	I don't know what a Doctor Strange is. Is that a Doctor Who film?
902000	903000	It's Marvel. It's a Marvel universe thing. No.
903000	906000	But Tilda Swinton could be Doctor Who as well. I'd be totally fine with that.
906000	908000	I've never seen that either, so whatever.
908000	909000	My god, you've got so much to catch up on.
909000	911000	Nope. Power Rangers.
911000	914000	SSG100Matt says, we have the science to make a hologram, David Bowie.
914000	915000	That is out there.
915000	918000	But do we have the science to make his codpiece?
918000	919000	Did you?
919000	921000	That's like the secondary character in that movie.
921000	923000	We're still perfecting that technology.
923000	926000	Did you see the Splatoon concert that happened?
926000	928000	No, but I want to.
928000	931000	It was all hologram with the sister. Like, literally...
931000	933000	Are we talking about that later at all?
933000	936000	I think. I don't know. It might have been on the list somewhere.
936000	938000	Because, although I'm just gonna cheat anyway.
938000	939000	That's fine.
939000	944000	Like, I heard that was so good, and they had like respawn points at the concert,
944000	951000	and they had like all the weapons, and apparently we're getting the Squid Sisters as amiibo.
951000	952000	Oh, that's pretty weird.
952000	953000	That got data mined.
953000	955000	Of course we are!
955000	956000	At least it's...
956000	957000	Cha-ching!
957000	960000	Well, I want more Splatoon amiibo. That's awesome.
960000	965000	I love Splatoon, and I love the amiibo, and they're hilarious.
965000	970000	Alright, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, only like 20 minutes into the show.
970000	977000	But I want to talk a little bit about what we missed last week with Sickness taking over Sacramento and OLR Studios.
977000	980000	We missed last week's show, so let us quickly recap.
980000	982000	Last week's news, Setaholic.
985000	992000	Last week in the gaming universe, there were some big time rumors about the NX leaked from a GfK survey.
992000	999000	And it wasn't the fact that the rumors were out there, because, you know, another week, another set of NX rumors until Nintendo clarifies something.
999000	1003000	But it's the fact that the mainstream media was running like crazy with these rumors.
1003000	1004000	Of course they are.
1004000	1008000	Specifically, the 900p rumor of the system.
1008000	1013000	And since 900p is less than 1080p, clearly it must be bad.
1013000	1021000	But, I mean, if the NX is a handheld and a console system, which I'm almost starting to accept as fact at this point, it's coming up so often.
1021000	1024000	Would it make sense that 900p is the resolution of the handheld?
1024000	1027000	Doesn't seem like rocket science to me. I don't know.
1027000	1033000	Yeah, it makes sense, except, you know, a lot of other handhelds are not that, and, you know, I want to say it's...
1033000	1036000	Don't they have 1080 on, uh, the Vita?
1036000	1037000	I think so.
1037000	1044000	Speaking of other news from Nintendo, Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow coming out on Virtual Console, but there will be no save and restore feature.
1044000	1051000	So you can't grind, you know, one area over and over and, you know, try to get a mutation, and if it goes wrong, reset it.
1051000	1054000	But there will be online Pokemon battles.
1054000	1059000	Also, David Gator leaving BioWare after 17 years last week.
1059000	1063000	Is Dragon Age fucked? I don't know. Stay tuned. I don't think that's right.
1063000	1070000	He was already off of Dragon Age at this point, though, so if they were kind of screwed over, that already was in motion.
1070000	1079000	And really quickly, even though the music ran out, the commentary ran that over, I'll say there's also a 100-game Atari collection on its way to Steam.
1079000	1088000	This looks to be based off the iPhone or iPad Atari collection that's already out there, but Atari Vault apparently was supposed to show up at PAX South this weekend.
1088000	1093000	I haven't heard a lot about it, but that was something that came up last week when Atari announced it.
1093000	1096000	So there you go, last week's news set to Holic.
1096000	1101000	Anything else you guys wanted to say on the NX thing, since I was trying to fit in all that news a minute and a half?
1101000	1106000	I don't really care what the resolution is. I just hope it's, you know, modern specs.
1106000	1108000	Yeah, that's the only thing that matters.
1108000	1114000	Let's not do what we did with, I mean, it worked okay for the Wii because you had a unique control system, did not work very well for the Wii U.
1114000	1115000	No.
1115000	1117000	Let's just catch this shit up.
1117000	1124000	I'm finding the handheld being a little bit lower resolution. I don't even know, what's the resolution on the Wii U gamepad? I'm not really sure.
1124000	1125000	It's not that great.
1125000	1129000	It's not that great, but I believe some Wii U games will run 1080p 60 frames a second.
1129000	1134000	I'm fine, who cares? Oh, it's 100 less pixels. That's not going to be so noticeable.
1134000	1136000	I'd rather have 60 frames than 100 more pixels.
1136000	1141000	I'd rather have Nintendo fix some of their, I'd rather have Nintendo brace online a little more.
1141000	1148000	I'll trade you 180ps for better online ecosystem. Whatever 180p is worth.
1148000	1153000	Which they are trying to kind of move towards, it seems, so they're just very slow about it.
1153000	1155000	Incredibly slow about it.
1155000	1165000	Alright, well we'll see. I mean, again, this is just rampant speculation until Nintendo themselves clarify something which I really don't anticipate to happen until E3.
1166000	1173000	I know a lot of folks are saying, oh, but if the handheld is coming this year, Nintendo has to say something before the fact. Do they?
1173000	1175000	I'm not so sure they have to.
1175000	1183000	Which is interesting because as part of that whole rumor and what's gaining steam there, do you remember the very first episode of the year of predictions?
1183000	1187000	I actually said, they'll sell the handheld this year and they'll sell the console next year.
1187000	1193000	It looks like that is actually happening. Not to talk myself up too much, but let's be real, I called that.
1193000	1196000	Potentially. We won't know until E3, for sure.
1196000	1203000	I don't know. We'll see. I mean, I just hope it's good.
1203000	1209000	Yeah. Maybe the fact that the Wii U releases have been very, very quiet and they've really...
1209000	1217000	I don't want to say they've artificially stretched out their calendar, but I do feel like Mario Maker got pushed back, Star Fox got pushed back,
1217000	1224000	Zelda got pushed back. It's almost like they took a lot of the stuff they had for 2015 and really pushed it back to fill out 2016.
1224000	1227000	And granted, probably give us some better games in the long run.
1227000	1233000	No, and they have to do that too because the reason why is they don't have the third party support anymore.
1233000	1237000	Even the companies that used to support them aren't really doing it anymore.
1237000	1242000	But maybe they've taken a lot of the resources that would be developing games and now they're all developing for NX right now.
1243000	1251000	It could be that. I think a lot of it's just not seeing the sales and it's just not worthwhile to them to develop a Wii U version of the game.
1251000	1256000	But hasn't Wii U broken at least 10 million at this point? It seems like there's enough of them.
1256000	1261000	It's not a flop. It's not a total flop. It's not like a freaking N-Gage or something.
1261000	1265000	It's just the Wii U is... it's alright. It's not a Playstation 4, but it's alright.
1265000	1273000	And at least if you're releasing something at retail, there's not a lot competing with it on that platform. So you got that going for you, I guess.
1273000	1280000	Alright, well that was last week's news. We're going to start to transition into this week and what's going on in video games.
1280000	1289000	We will get to the news from this week, but we do always at the top of the show like to go around and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1289000	1293000	And how was your gaming week? Shane, you're the guest. We'll start with you tonight. How was your gaming week?
1293000	1303000	It was fine. I've played an ungodly amount of Final Fantasy Explorers. No, seriously, everybody I know is like, oh, we're just now getting into two-star quests and three stars.
1303000	1315000	I'm all by myself at seven-star quests, because it's basically Phantasy Star Online with a little bit of Monster Hunter, and it's just a lot of fun to me, so I don't want to quit playing it.
1315000	1317000	What is it about the game that keeps you going on it?
1317000	1321000	It's Phantasy Star Online with a little Monster Hunter, and I can't quit playing it.
1322000	1328000	And why Phantasy Star Online? What about that draws you to the game to keep playing?
1328000	1341000	It's just a fun little beat-em-up where I get to level. Well, you don't really level up your character. You get like ELs, which is, I don't remember what the E stands for, but the more quests you do, the farther you progress in the main quest, the more your levels go up.
1342000	1352000	It's just hack and slash, run to an area, kill a boss, kill this many enemies. I don't know, it's fun. It's a great time waster, and my little character is adorable.
1352000	1355000	Do you play a lot online? I know we played online a little bit this week, but...
1355000	1357000	Oh, just with friends.
1357000	1358000	You don't play with strangers?
1358000	1367000	Not yet. I will probably do that eventually, because all my friends, again, aren't where I'm at, and I can't get any farther right now because my gear kind of sucks.
1368000	1371000	And that's where the farming aspect comes in, because you make all your gear.
1371000	1374000	Do you just have to grind old stuff over and over to make...
1374000	1390000	Yeah, because you need materials from specific bosses or enemies, and some of the bosses have different parts you can break to try to get items, and it's tedious in the Monster Hunter way, but I still have fun with it.
1391000	1393000	And that's really it for Explorers.
1393000	1405000	And I've been playing, you know, my music games on my iPad, a little bit of Diablo because of the seasonal characters, and that's it. I don't play any other games right now.
1405000	1407000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1407000	1422000	Well, let's see, this week I played lots of Fallout 4, so I had that, and then of course Lego Avengers came out, so I've been playing that to unlock characters for my son to play as, mainly just trying to get through everything.
1422000	1437000	I finished the first two, well I finished all the story missions, or most of the story missions, the main ones that they have in there, so now they have the free kind of open world gameplay stuff unlocked so they can play that.
1437000	1440000	And it's got a lot of really obscure characters in it.
1441000	1450000	Originally my kind of gripe about the game was that instead of going with original voice actors for the characters like they did with the last one, which I thought they were great.
1450000	1454000	I mean they had Troy Baker doing Loki and stuff, which I thought was fantastic.
1456000	1468000	They instead went with the movie sounds, the movie clips basically, they kind of took the audio from the movies and just spliced it up to do the voices for the characters, which is fine.
1468000	1480000	And at first I didn't like it, but then kind of watching what they did with it was kind of funny, because there will be different things like dialogue from the movie, and the stuff that they have going along with the dialogue is really silly.
1480000	1494000	So it kind of plays off each other, although some of the little one liners that they have throughout the game are kind of annoying and very repetitive, because they only have a small library of clips to choose from.
1495000	1510000	Aside from that, the game looks good. I had a lot of fun with it. The cars drive like absolute shit, so they completely fucked the cars over. They're so weighty and just annoying, but they did that.
1510000	1522000	I don't know, they have some pretty interesting characters though, like I got Fing Fing Foom unlocked, and just like the little missions you have to do to unlock these characters are pretty silly, and plus he gets really huge and my son loves that.
1522000	1534000	Aside from that, I played a little bit of Ingress, not so much as I have been, because I'm on that new schedule where I don't have a lot of free time, so I played a little bit of that, mainly on my commute to and from work.
1534000	1543000	And aside from all of that stuff, I caught up on a lot of the awesome games done quick stuff, so I watched.
1543000	1544000	Oh, that's right, because they archive everything.
1545000	1559000	Yeah, they archive it, and I haven't been able to, I didn't catch it live, so I was watching the speedruns for Kaizo Mario 3, for the Legend of Zelda Link to the Past reverse boss order run, which is pretty awesome.
1560000	1575000	The Mario Maker hard levels, and they had the blind hard levels that they ran, there was also, I'm trying to think of the other run I watched, I want to go through the Final Fantasy one that they had, I think it was Final Fantasy IV.
1575000	1577000	It was IV, they did IV right at the end.
1577000	1591000	It might have been IV, yeah, so I got to watch IV, mostly a lot of the Mario ones, and the Taskbot stuff, I was watching some of that, but I find it so entertaining compared to just like, I can watch a channel of that.
1591000	1603000	And I am, I'm watching a YouTube channel of that, but I'm just saying that stuff is really interesting, I'm surprised they can't put that on TV, I guess a lot of people might not be interested that long or something, I don't know, but I find it really interesting at least.
1603000	1605000	So that's it, that's pretty much what I did this week.
1605000	1617000	Awesome. Well my gaming week, I've been playing a lot of Diablo III because of the seasons, I am just shy of Paragon 400 for the season, that means I'm already further progressed than I was last season.
1617000	1633000	And you remember last season I talked about what an ungodly level I was at, you know what's really pushed things along this season? The fact that they give you a full set of set gear, essentially right after you hit 70, I mean you have to do some achievements to get it, but it's manageable.
1634000	1646000	And yeah, that really propelled what I was able to do and has made this season crazy competitive. Some of the record holders and people that are doing really crazy stuff out there, already above Paragon 1000.
1646000	1659000	You know, Extrofer's partner plays a lot, he's like Paragon 700 something, so I mean I feel insignificant next to all them, but I'm having fun with it and that's the important thing, it's actually something Alan and I do together a lot.
1660000	1670000	Usually after he gets home from work we'll play Diablo and keep trying to push a higher and higher level rift that the two of us can do. We just did a 57 last night and I think that's the highest we've ever done as a duo.
1670000	1685000	I think the highest we ever got last season was 53 or 54, so I mean yeah it's kind of crazy to see that progression. I don't know if Diablo's going to keep raising the ceiling like that, I'm hoping they're going to announce a new expansion sooner rather than later, I really hope that's in the cards for Diablo.
1685000	1696000	But having a lot of fun with that. Season play, not available on consoles because online on consoles has already been exploited and they can't really do the same thing there that they can do on PC.
1696000	1708000	I also went back and visited some retro stuff on Wii U Virtual Console because I had some things to catch up on, namely Metroid Zero Mission. I finally had to download and play some of that.
1709000	1729000	If you think about it, that was the last 2D Metroid game they made. God, I miss that game. I just miss those style of Metroid games. I liked Other M more than most people did, but it's still not the same thing as those old 2D Metroid games. I never got into Prime.
1729000	1737000	Prime is really good though. I do, I especially like Prime 3, but I just can't love them the same way that I love the 2D games.
1737000	1743000	I wish they would do, was it Retro Studio is the one doing the Donkey Kong game? Yeah.
1743000	1756000	Yeah, so get Retro Studio to do a new 2D Metroid using that engine that Ubisoft has for their hand drawn. Oh yeah, that'd be pretty cool. Like the top light stuff.
1756000	1773000	Yeah, like a really beautifully done 2D game. You know what actually kind of game reminds me of that would be like Wario, was it Wario Land Shake or something like that? The one that they had that was all hand drawn that looked really awesome and nobody bought.
1773000	1775000	I don't even remember.
1775000	1785000	It was like a hand drawn 2D Wario game that was on the Wii and it looked really pretty, but no one bought it unfortunately, because it's Wario and not Mario.
1785000	1799000	Well the WarioWare games are fantastic. Yeah, we need another WarioWare game. I'm surprised we haven't seen one of those in a while. The last one they had was really shit though, wasn't it? Oh no, it was so much fun, especially the multiplayer. The Wii U one?
1800000	1812000	Yeah, but the game itself was not the same caliber as the rest of them. But maybe that'll be an NX thing, who knows. Anyway, also on virtual mode. Yeah, it'll come out with F-Zero too. Fingers crossed.
1813000	1824000	Also on Wii U along with Metroid Zero Mission, it's Super Mario Bros. Advance 4, but it's actually Mario Bros. 3, but because it has all the e-reader levels already unlocked in it.
1824000	1836000	Because they just used save states and I think they used a save state where all the e-reader levels had already been scanned in. And so that's the one that kind of loads by default and so you actually have access to all the e-reader levels.
1836000	1852000	So it's almost like you're playing Mario Maker but with Nintendo made levels. And so that's kind of fun. So if you've never played Mario Advance 4, I think it's worth a look. The only thing that throws me about that game otherwise is that it's hard to play Mario Maker on your TV.
1852000	1864000	Then go play Mario Advance 4 on your TV because the proportions are different so the levels don't look the same. Even though they are the same, they don't look the same. And so it kind of throws you a little.
1864000	1868000	They have the Mario Maker levels. Someone's already made the Mario Maker or levels in Mario Maker.
1868000	1870000	The e-reader levels, yeah. I'm not surprised to hear that.
1870000	1887000	What about the ones that they had on, was it like a Hudson version of Mario or something like that? There was a Hudson version of Mario that came out that had levels that weren't in gameplay elements that were in the normal Mario games but it never got released.
1887000	1888000	I don't remember that.
1888000	1894000	Yeah, I was on PC or something. We had covered it a long time ago.
1894000	1899000	Wasn't it the people that made Commander Keen tried to do a PC port of Mario 3?
1899000	1909000	No, no, no. It's not Mario 3. I don't remember what the hell it's called now. I just remember the graphics were really kind of funky looking. It was a PC or not an actual IBM or anything.
1909000	1913000	Hey, chat room to the rescue. Dark Tetsuya says the PC-88 Super Mario Bros. special.
1914000	1921000	That's what I meant. Yeah, so I'd be interested to see some of those levels. Hey, how about we add that version of it to Mario Maker? That'd be cool.
1921000	1932000	That would be cool. And then lastly on Virtual Console, just completely randomly versus Excitebike because it was on sale. So I got it cheap and I forgot how different the arcade version is.
1932000	1939000	But I remember playing the arcade version but the interface looks different and has the competitive element. Yeah, different.
1939000	1945000	And then the last game I've been spending a bit of time with this week is also Final Fantasy Explorers on the 3DS. But only a bit.
1945000	1950000	Yeah, I'm one of those people that's at the two and three star level, not where Shane is at.
1950000	1962000	Well, and the problem, I'm jumping in and taking over your week. The problem with the game is that it gives you tutorial quests at the very beginning of the game to get you accustomed to it.
1962000	1969000	However, what they don't tell you is that up until you get halfway through, maybe even towards the end of the three star quests, it's still a tutorial.
1969000	1976000	And that's very slow going. But once you get past that, it's just so much fun. So play it more.
1976000	1983000	I don't dislike the game. And I know Shane knows where I'm going to go with this. No, I don't. I already forgot. You do.
1983000	1996000	I don't dislike the game by any means, but here's my biggest problem with the game. It should be on Wii U. I really think this game would be so much better if they'd just done it for Wii U.
1996000	2003000	And I'm really trying to think, why did they make a game like this? Because they wanted to capitalize on the Monster Hunter crowd.
2003000	2009000	Because even if it's only slightly like Monster Hunter, all the really popular Monster Hunter games are handheld.
2009000	2014000	And if you'd let me finish, I would have said... No, no. I took care of it. It's fine.
2014000	2022000	Well, and I understand. The 3DS, especially considering this game was really for Japanese release, we didn't get it until way later.
2022000	2032000	And it was really for that market. I understand it in those terms that, okay, it's a little different. And yes, when you bring in the Monster Hunter, although there is a Monster Hunter game on Wii U, but it also sucks.
2032000	2037000	Yes, but one. And how many are handheld? 50 million.
2038000	2045000	Or I should say the demo sucked. I will give you this. It's now making me curious that maybe I need to go back and re-evaluate Monster Hunter on Wii U.
2045000	2053000	It did the same thing to me, but I know, because I have it on my 3DS, I know if I play it, I'm going to be like, this is still not a game for me. Back to Explorers.
2053000	2061000	But I just wish Explorers was on Wii U. I think it would just... Because it's so weird to me, playing it on 3DS, there's no 3D.
2061000	2068000	It does start to, like if you have a lot of stuff going on on the screen at one time, it does start to, you see the performance issues a little bit.
2068000	2072000	And I mean, it does online pretty well. I mean, for all jokes about it.
2072000	2074000	I haven't seen any disconnects or anything like that.
2074000	2075000	Yeah, me neither.
2075000	2078000	Why is it not on the Wii U? Because it wouldn't sell as well on the Wii U.
2078000	2079000	That's true.
2079000	2082000	And honestly, that's not a lie. And I get that.
2082000	2085000	And apparently, it's like selling really well here. People are having a hard time finding it.
2085000	2089000	Oh, is it? Oh, interesting. Well, they probably underestimated the demand for it.
2089000	2090000	Probably.
2090000	2094000	I mean, I know the Fantasy name goes a long way, but it's not just the name. It's the class design.
2094000	2097000	And, you know, there's a very big sense of familiarity.
2097000	2101000	And that's why I also wouldn't want to do Monster Hunter, is because this has magic and stuff.
2101000	2106000	Monster Hunter really doesn't have that. And Monster Hunter is more, I feel like, hardcore.
2106000	2110000	This is a game like Fantasy Star Online, where I can just sit back and have fun.
2112000	2114000	Look at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2114000	2118000	AkumaJP says, Monster Hunter minus monthly fee equals heaven.
2118000	2121000	It's the monthly fee. Yeah, there's no fee or anything to play this game online.
2121000	2124000	Oh, I didn't... Does our Monster Hunter here have a monthly fee?
2124000	2127000	Not the Wii U one, for sure. I don't think it has online.
2127000	2133000	But here's the funny thing. I wonder if this Final Fantasy Explorers will outsell Monster Hunter here in the States.
2133000	2135000	No. Monster Hunter does well here, too.
2135000	2136000	In the States?
2136000	2139000	Yeah, it does well. It doesn't do as well as in Japan. But it does well here.
2139000	2140000	Okay. Well, that's fair.
2140000	2144000	Monster Hunter, the 3DS one that came out, what, last year for us?
2145000	2148000	You couldn't find physical copies anywhere when it first came out, too.
2148000	2152000	So, I think it's that genre that is picking up steam here.
2152000	2153000	Interesting.
2154000	2158000	Which is a perfect time for PSO2 to come out, might I say.
2158000	2159000	Thank you.
2159000	2161000	Sega PS4 release, please.
2161000	2162000	Thank you.
2164000	2169000	My one, maybe, complaint is that it does feel a little repetitive.
2169000	2172000	But I get that's what a Monster Hunter game is all about.
2172000	2176000	But it is like, okay, I'm going through the same area again, except now this person's here.
2176000	2178000	Or I'm going, and now these monsters are here.
2178000	2181000	And it is a little bit like, or at least it's varied.
2181000	2184000	Like, at least I'm not in the same environment on every map.
2184000	2185000	But, I don't know.
2185000	2190000	Well, then, if you also take into account the monster stuff, where, you know, you got your little followers.
2190000	2193000	Like, because I just learned this, because I was trying to get a couple of them.
2193000	2196000	They all have their own unique stats, and some will be better.
2196000	2199000	So, you'll always want to, like, capture and make them.
2199000	2201000	And then see what they offer you stat and ability-wise.
2201000	2205000	And then if they kind of suck, you'll go capture another one until you get one that you really like.
2205000	2207000	So, it's really, there's a deep customization.
2207000	2211000	Oh, and the spells and abilities, you customize those through.
2211000	2213000	And that's so in-depth.
2213000	2214000	It is neat.
2214000	2215000	Yeah.
2215000	2216000	How do you, how do I explain this?
2216000	2217000	Well, okay, I can do it.
2217000	2218000	Easy.
2218000	2219000	Okay, go for it.
2219000	2220000	So, I have, I play Blue Mage because it's blue.
2220000	2224000	And I learned the classic spell, Bad Breath.
2224000	2228000	And in Final Fantasy, that puts all these status ailments on you.
2228000	2230000	Well, I did what's called a mutation to it.
2230000	2235000	So, not only does it do that, but it also has a chance to cast death on the enemy to kill them immediately.
2235000	2239000	Or it can also put stone on them so they freeze in place.
2239000	2241000	And it all says freeze, so they freeze in place.
2241000	2243000	And how did you mutate?
2243000	2246000	These, I don't remember what it's called. Crystal something or other.
2246000	2247000	Crystal Surge.
2247000	2248000	Crystal Surge, yeah.
2248000	2251000	Which are arbitrary, and that's the thing that throws me about that whole process.
2251000	2254000	But that's how you, I guess that's how they keep the gameplay varied.
2254000	2259000	Otherwise, you're just gonna figure out a way to constantly bring up the ones you want to mutate your spells.
2259000	2263000	So, like, you start off with Cure and you want to put Haste on it.
2263000	2267000	Well, you can Crystal Surge it and maybe you'll get the one that has Haste, maybe you won't.
2267000	2274000	But if you cast Cure while you're under a Crystal Surge, you have a chance to proc that mutation and then you go learn it later.
2274000	2279000	You go learn that spell, then you have that Cure, we'll just call it like Cure 1, because that's what they do.
2279000	2283000	And you proc a Crystal Surge that does Float.
2283000	2292000	And if that, you know, shows up in your list and you use it and you use that Cure 1, now you have Cure plus Haste plus Float.
2292000	2298000	Okay, Bob Coffee is a Monster Hunter fan that looks like in our chatroom and giving some insight on the series.
2298000	2303000	Bob Coffee says, Monster Hunter starts out bad until you understand it, then kill some big-ass monster.
2303000	2305000	Monster Hunter 4U is online.
2306000	2309000	And Bonds006 says, there are some Monster Hunter clubs here in New York.
2309000	2313000	A group of friends meet bi-weekly on Sundays at Nintendo World NYC and play their Monster Hunter games.
2313000	2316000	Average about 8 people or more meet males and females.
2316000	2323000	Yeah, like I said, it's doing well here too, so we're catching up to that genre.
2323000	2325000	Alright, so I...
2325000	2327000	I need more wine, I'm already almost done again.
2327000	2331000	I like Final Fantasy Explorers, I don't love it like Shane does, but...
2331000	2333000	Shane super loves it.
2333000	2335000	Maybe I'm not far enough in yet.
2335000	2337000	I don't think you're far enough in, that's the thing.
2337000	2340000	I keep getting distracted by Diablo 3 and try to push further in that.
2340000	2346000	Yeah, just sit down and play more Explorers and once you get a little farther, and I can come help.
2346000	2352000	I mean, like, my EL is like 77 now, which is really high, so I can help.
2352000	2355000	But then, I don't know, here's the thing, don't take this the wrong way.
2355000	2358000	Nope, already took it the wrong way, because that's how you started it.
2358000	2364000	I had more fun fighting the Adolans by myself, because I felt like I was actually learning the fight and what to do,
2364000	2368000	as opposed to when I was doing them with you, and it was like, oh, they're dead, because Shane killed them.
2368000	2373000	That's how I feel when I bring out my Black Knight, because I'll sit back and die,
2373000	2377000	and he'll just go up there, because he's one of the monsters you can get, and he just owns everything.
2377000	2382000	I'll be trying to break a certain part off of a monster, but I can't because he already killed it,
2382000	2384000	or I'm trying to encase it and get its power.
2385000	2388000	Five minutes ago, he killed it, and I'm just, you know, winged it.
2388000	2392000	God damn it, you stupid Black Mage, I told you I could fucking do that.
2392000	2399000	Yeah, I mean, that was the thing, I finally learned what Ramuh was doing when I had to fight him by myself.
2399000	2402000	When we fought Shiva, I had no idea what the fuck was going on.
2402000	2403000	Oh, I still don't know Shiva.
2403000	2409000	And I actually learned, oh, the little red circle under you means that move is targeting you,
2409000	2412000	and so you want to keep running, so if it's an AOE, you're going to run out of it.
2412000	2415000	That whole time, like, I didn't figure that out until you weren't there.
2417000	2421000	Well, maybe if you played more and got to a point where I wouldn't kill things in, like, two hits.
2421000	2426000	The circle means I fire my most powerful spells at it. Oh, it's dead.
2426000	2429000	All right, some quick housekeeping tonight.
2429000	2434000	Sadly, even though we were out last week, we will be not here the week of, what is it, February 20th?
2434000	2440000	I don't remember the exact day, that's a Sunday, but I will be at MAGFest in the Washington, D.C. area,
2440000	2442000	National Harbor, to be exact, February 21st.
2442000	2445000	We will not be here with the show, because I'll be at MAGFest.
2445000	2449000	If you're going to be at MAGFest, be sure to stop by our forums, vognetwork.com,
2449000	2453000	and say hello in the MAGFest thread we have there, because there will be some sort of, like,
2453000	2458000	official, unofficial meetup, official in that it's vog-official, but unofficial in that we really,
2458000	2461000	we have nothing to do with the con itself.
2461000	2465000	We are going, as fans, we're not doing a panel, we're not doing anything, we're just going to have fun.
2465000	2469000	So, but we want to meet up with some of our listeners and such while we're there.
2469000	2473000	We'll really have our fingers and toes crossed for our buddy YYR that maybe he'll have a booth,
2473000	2478000	because that would be a great meeting spot to help promote the things he's working on,
2478000	2482000	I think his multitasking game, and so forth. So we have our fingers crossed for him.
2482000	2485000	But anyway, we're going to be there, well, I'm going to be there.
2485000	2489000	Sadly, low-key, Dark Soccer, not going to be there. Shane, definitely not going to be there.
2489000	2491000	No, I don't even know what you're talking about.
2491000	2494000	Music and games, it's going to be fun. You're going to miss out.
2494000	2498000	Maybe I'll take you to Rock Edge, which is like the West Coast version of that that's happening in a couple months.
2498000	2499000	No.
2499000	2501000	You're a hater, don't be a hater.
2501000	2505000	And Bobby Black Wolf, our pal from Bobby Black Wolf Show will be there.
2505000	2510000	Some of my other indie podcast friends will be there, like a couple of my friends from Koopa Club are going to be there,
2510000	2514000	or at least just one maybe, just one of my friends from Koopa Club is going to be there.
2514000	2519000	And yeah, so we're going to have a good time at MAGFest, looking forward to that very much.
2519000	2524000	That's really it for housekeeping, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, also Facebook,
2524000	2527000	Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2527000	2531000	Let's get into some news for the week. We're going to start off with Loki.
2531000	2542000	Alright, so Sony has decided to create a whole new subsidiary company to house their entertainment portion of Sony under.
2542000	2549000	So this is going to be Sony Interactive Entertainment, or SEI I guess, LLC.
2550000	2555000	And it'll be incorporated on April 1st. No, it's not a joke.
2555000	2565000	And I don't know how they're structuring everything, but I guess under that they're going to have hardware, game software, the PlayStation Network operations,
2565000	2573000	also PlayStation Vue, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Music, and their original content as well.
2573000	2586000	So it's kind of almost like the movie, the kind of video movie side of things, or the TV I guess on their services, combined with, you know, the other entertainment stuff.
2586000	2590000	So it's all the stuff that you can find kind of on their interactive platforms.
2590000	2594000	So, OMG, PlayStation is now an American company.
2594000	2596000	That is kind of interesting.
2596000	2599000	PlayStation is no longer a Japanese company, it's an American company.
2599000	2605000	That just means we're going to get another PlayStation experience then. Hey, that was so fun, I can't wait.
2605000	2608000	It's not going to be in Japan, it'll be here again.
2608000	2610000	Well, they never did them in Japan anyway.
2610000	2612000	Well, now they have more reason to do it here.
2612000	2615000	Yeah, and they'll be based out of San Mateo, California.
2615000	2617000	Which is a beautiful place.
2617000	2624000	Which is, to be fair, where it seems like most of the activity has been happening for PlayStation's arm anyway.
2624000	2635000	And most of the folks you see getting up on stage at events and things like that, it seems like PlayStation's been slowly moving that direction ever since the PlayStation 4 was released anyway.
2635000	2643000	I mean, I don't know, I'm not going to claim to know enough about the business side of things here on OLR as to why a company would make a move like this.
2643000	2646000	It's restructuring, you think?
2646000	2652000	Yeah, I guess you always hear about that with big companies. There's a restructuring going on to help with cost savings and blah blah blah.
2653000	2655000	Maybe it'll help make the numbers look better or something?
2655000	2656000	Maybe.
2656000	2664000	If they're like, one department's doing well and the other department's not doing so well, lump them together and kind of averages everything out? I don't really know.
2664000	2672000	Dungeon Buster, with some insight here at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, says they're basically consolidating all of their PlayStation stuff into a North American headquarter.
2672000	2677000	They're doing it to cater to what they apparently see as their biggest market.
2678000	2679000	Cool.
2682000	2685000	I don't know, they're doing pretty well so far, so I don't really have much to complain about.
2685000	2687000	Well, it's not like they're doing awful in Japan.
2687000	2688000	No, they're not doing awful in Japan.
2688000	2690000	Remember, the Vita is still a thing in Japan.
2690000	2693000	I wish it was more of a thing here, but they just don't want to make a bet.
2693000	2694000	They're saying they're going to change that.
2694000	2703000	They should change that. Or come out with something, I mean, come out with another handheld once the NX comes out or whatever.
2703000	2707000	I'd be interested to see another handheld from them. I thought the Vita was okay.
2707000	2714000	Even still, the dual analogs seemed like a great idea. It just didn't feel right.
2714000	2717000	And the backtouch thing is kind of annoying.
2717000	2722000	And the touch screen just didn't really utilize that well, I think.
2722000	2727000	And they always, every single time they do a handheld, they screw themselves over with the memory cards.
2727000	2731000	Oh god, yes. And they're stupid proprietary memory formats.
2732000	2737000	Just fuck it. Who cares? Who cares? Just use a standardized format.
2737000	2744000	I got a 32GB memory card for my 3DS that was like $17.
2744000	2752000	And then you can't even get a 32GB for a Vita for under $50? Or even maybe higher than that, I think?
2752000	2757000	I don't remember. I bought a 16GB one when I got the PlayStation TV.
2757000	2762000	I had some way back when I actually had a Vita, but I don't remember what I have now.
2762000	2767000	Still haven't really done anything with the PlayStation TV either, but I keep accruing free games with PlayStation Plus.
2767000	2774000	Here's some perspective from AkumaJP in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, who's actually in Japan,
2774000	2782000	who says, PlayStation 4 is not really a thing here. No JRPG means no Japanese users. Vita is doing well here.
2783000	2789000	And this might be an opportunity to bring up, because I don't think it's in our show world anywhere else,
2789000	2795000	but it definitely was something big, I think, that came out today or last night, and that is the Final Fantasy XV event had happened.
2795000	2801000	And they were showing some new gameplay from that, and then they announced a release date of a release date, I think?
2801000	2806000	Well, it's a release event, so they're going to announce the release date on March 30th, I think.
2806000	2810000	So we have a release date of a release date. March 30th is the big event, or what have you.
2810000	2814000	But didn't we have a pre-release date of a release date of a release date before this?
2814000	2821000	Because they said it was going to be spring, in which they would announce the release date, and now we have a release date for the release date.
2821000	2826000	Alright, awesome. But that is a big JRPG that's going to be coming for the PlayStation 4.
2826000	2829000	And I'm totally down with that. I can't believe it.
2829000	2831000	I don't know if that's necessarily going to turn things around.
2831000	2834000	I hope it's good. The demo's alright.
2835000	2840000	I'm interested. You know, with Final Fantasy, I'm probably going to check it out no matter what.
2840000	2841000	Did you watch the footage?
2841000	2842000	I saw it just a little bit.
2842000	2848000	It was actually interesting. It doesn't look like the same game that the demo we had before.
2848000	2854000	The demo was kind of hard to figure out what to do in. Like, the combat system really confused the hell out of me.
2854000	2860000	And I never played it when they redid it, kind of. I didn't play it. I don't know if it has a new combat system.
2860000	2864000	I hope they were mentioning they had the turn-based thing. I love the turn-based combat systems.
2864000	2868000	I don't know why everybody wants something differently. I thought, I love those games.
2868000	2873000	I love going back to the old 8-bit games or 16-bit games that had the turn-based system.
2873000	2875000	I don't see a problem with that.
2875000	2881000	Or a slight variation, like 12 had. 12 was great because of that. I like 13s as well.
2883000	2885000	I'm going to our chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
2885000	2892000	AkumaJP adding a little more, saying, yes, wait until Final Fantasy XV. That is when PlayStation 4 gets its mojo back for the Japanese users.
2892000	2895000	Final Fantasy VII Remake is another one.
2895000	2902000	The VII Remake looks pretty sweet. Especially if the combat system and everything is good in XV, I'm down with VII using that same engine.
2902000	2906000	Yeah, because VII just kind of looks like, here's Final Fantasy VII in the XV engine.
2906000	2910000	I think it just looks like you're playing Kingdom Hearts and Goofy's going to come run out of nowhere.
2911000	2918000	Or he'll be dressed up like Barret. And then Donald will be, I don't know, Red XIII.
2918000	2923000	I do want to see a new Kingdom Hearts with the Marvel and LucasArts.
2923000	2927000	Well, there is a new Kingdom Hearts coming at some point. Someday. We don't have a release date.
2927000	2934000	How fucking badass would that be? Fucking fighting the Heartless and shit with the Hulkbuster and shit in the background.
2934000	2938000	Okay, first off, fuck and shit are not going to be in a Kingdom Hearts game with Disney.
2938000	2945000	They should be. I mean, they're really, there's the whole Miramax side of Disney that they're completely ignoring.
2945000	2946000	Pulp Fiction world?
2946000	2952000	Pulp Fiction world? Kill Bill? I mean, we could totally do this. I don't understand why that's a problem.
2952000	2955000	Tarantino has enough fucks and shits for everybody.
2958000	2967000	Alright, well something that, a series that has me screaming fucking shit an awful lot is the series Five Nights at Freddy's.
2967000	2975000	And this is in part to Shane's bidding, by the way, as he convinces me to play these games. And then I get really scared playing them.
2975000	2976000	They're really good, though.
2976000	2983000	But, there's a new game in the series, but it's not really like the other games. It's Five Nights at Freddy's World.
2983000	2989000	Now, this was something big that happened in the news last week while we were out, is that the game ended up getting pulled from Steam.
2989000	2997000	And it was because it was getting some pretty bad press that the game didn't feel complete to a lot of people.
2997000	3002000	And I didn't play the game, so I don't know. Did you check out Five Nights at Freddy's World, being the big fan you are?
3002000	3012000	No, I did not because I just felt like other people would play it for me first and then I would make a decision.
3012000	3013000	And they did.
3013000	3014000	Why did it get released early?
3014000	3018000	Well, he always releases everything early, so that wasn't a surprise to me.
3019000	3033000	And I understand the complaints people had about it after watching it, so I'm glad I didn't buy it necessarily, but I still think it has the potential to be a good game.
3033000	3036000	And the foundations were there, mostly.
3036000	3045000	Well, Scott Cawthon ended up posting on Five Nights at Freddy's for Steam page because they ended up pulling Five Nights at Freddy's World saying,
3045000	3048000	Hi, I wanted to make a post about the fate of Five Nights at Freddy's World.
3048000	3053000	I was not satisfied with the reviews and ratings it's getting, so I've decided to remove the game from Steam.
3053000	3060000	I've asked Valve to make it so that the game can be refunded regardless of the amount of time it's been owned, meaning that anyone can get a refund at any time.
3060000	3063000	I'm going to work on Five Nights at Freddy's World and polish it up.
3063000	3065000	I've been creating a fully 3D overworld for the game.
3065000	3069000	When I'm ready to update, I will replace the demo currently on GameJolt with the full game.
3069000	3072000	From this point forward, the game will always be free.
3072000	3080000	I appreciate your support. I encourage you all to refund your Steam game, even if you enjoyed the game, and download the new version when it's available on GameJolt.
3080000	3084000	Now, I just want to point out real quick that it did have an overworld this game.
3084000	3095000	It was just in the Atari-style graphics that Scott has been known to do for his other games when it was a mini-game or sometimes story aspects in the other games.
3095000	3101000	It was just not a 3D world, which we had seen kind of previously in one of the trailers.
3101000	3108000	Wow, you can't fault him for doing what he did. At least he's offering refunds. He's not hosing everybody.
3108000	3112000	He's like, hey, sorry, I feel it needs more work. Here's your money back.
3112000	3120000	I think he just got way too excited for it. This is what he's known for. People like his stuff for various reasons.
3120000	3124000	Everybody was really excited to play it. He just wanted to get it out there.
3124000	3129000	It was missing a few things that maybe he didn't really think at the time were going to matter.
3129000	3131000	They would still get some enjoyment, but people are hypercritical.
3131000	3138000	With all respect to the guy who's had an amazing amount of success with a really good idea in a very short amount of time.
3138000	3143000	I've said on this show, Five Nights at Freddy's is probably the biggest indie game since Minecraft.
3143000	3153000	Of course, now we have Undertale. Still, there's not a lot of indie games that are fortunate enough to ride that kind of wave that Five Nights at Freddy's has.
3153000	3163000	This guy has found a lot of success in a short amount of time. In some ways, he's probably learning to deal with a lot of that, if that makes sense.
3163000	3168000	I'm not faulting him for having the bad game, making a mistake, releasing it early, and so forth.
3168000	3177000	Part of me wonders if maybe now is the time for him to look at maybe partnering up with somebody, like a publisher or something, that maybe can help him set some of these parameters so he doesn't do that.
3177000	3186000	But, okay, he made a mistake. He fessed up for it. The weird thing about this is I feel like the pendulum has now swung from one extreme to the other.
3186000	3193000	It's gone from, okay, you really released a game early and asked people to pay money for it when you shouldn't have and it wasn't really ready.
3193000	3201000	Okay, you made a mistake there, but at least he owned up to that mistake. So maybe he could have done what Warner Brothers did with Batman.
3201000	3207000	We're pulling the game and we'll re-release it when it's ready, that type of thing. But now I kind of feel like the pendulum swung to the other extreme.
3207000	3214000	Like, I fucked up so badly, I'm just going to give it away for free. And I almost feel like, well dude, you don't have to go that far.
3214000	3219000	He's doing that to keep the good will because he is just a single person making these games.
3219000	3228000	He's probably doing well enough to where he's just like, whatever, who cares. I just wanted to make this. If you don't like it, well, it's free.
3228000	3234000	He couldn't have the same clout as Warner Brothers saying, we'll release it later and you have to pay for it still.
3234000	3240000	Now he already took their money, but now he's like, okay, here's it back. I'm sorry, as an apology, this is just going to be free for everybody.
3240000	3243000	And that just is like, you're awesome. Thank you.
3244000	3248000	But I think it would have been fine if he said, you know what, if you want to get a refund, get your money back, you can.
3248000	3254000	Otherwise, we're going to try re-releasing this game and it'll be 20% off or something when it comes out.
3254000	3260000	You know what I mean? Like, I think you could still get away with charging money for it and be okay because Warner Brothers fucking did it.
3260000	3265000	If you followed his stuff, he seems like one of the nicest guys out there.
3265000	3266000	Sure.
3266000	3268000	And this doesn't seem, I mean, this seems like-
3268000	3270000	And I'm not saying this to be mean to him or anything.
3270000	3278000	No, no, no. But this just seems in his character that this is not actually surprising what he's doing with the refunds and going to release it for free.
3278000	3286000	Because that's just the sort of person he is based on everything I've ever seen about him and his posts and stuff.
3286000	3293000	So he's still a jerk for not unlocking the box in Five Nights 4 because we're never going to know what's in that box.
3294000	3297000	Going to a chat for some feedback over at live.vognetwork.com.
3297000	3301000	SHO 100 Matt says he got full of himself and didn't think it needed the amount of QA as he normally did.
3301000	3305000	Dungeon Buster says he should have held it back until it was done to avoid all of this.
3305000	3311000	There are other indie developers under the same pressure, but they had the good sense to hold back despite the backlash delays might have caused.
3311000	3318000	I agree he owed up to it and is going to re-release it as a free game, but wow, it's a situation that could have been completely avoided.
3318000	3322000	Kaijuto says maybe he has ADD. A lot of gamers have that.
3322000	3328000	I think those are all just too harsh on him honestly. I think he just got excited and wanted to put it out there.
3328000	3334000	And it just wasn't what people wanted and it was missing some key things.
3334000	3338000	This is going to sound harsh, again I'm not picking on him, but he made a rookie mistake.
3338000	3340000	He's a rookie.
3340000	3347000	Exactly, and I think we kind of forget he's a rookie. He's not on that level that you think Warner Brothers should be at and so forth.
3347000	3352000	So maybe that's why I'm saying the pendulum is swinging too far to the other direction because I'm like, give the guy a break.
3352000	3360000	He's probably getting a lot of this all at once and he just ended up that over-eager guy that announced something before it was ready.
3360000	3363000	So, I don't know.
3363000	3367000	I still don't think it was about getting money from people for an unfinished product.
3367000	3376000	I think in his mind that it was basically a finished product, but I don't think he probably has any play testers either to really see, oh you're missing this key thing.
3376000	3378000	He probably doesn't trust anybody.
3378000	3383000	No, I wouldn't. With something like that, since it is kind of a huge franchise all of a sudden, I wouldn't trust anybody.
3383000	3387000	Yeah, it's tough. It's probably a lot all at once. I hope he's doing okay.
3387000	3394000	I'm sure he is. He's probably sitting on his money couch drinking his money wine and we'll be fine.
3394000	3398000	Heading over to Beyonce's old house to hang with Notch and they can laugh on their money pit.
3398000	3408000	No, but all that joking aside, maybe, and to be fair in my pendulum experience, maybe that's what he had to do to relieve himself of that burden.
3408000	3417000	And just be like, okay, now that I've given it away, I am not going to be sad about this anymore because I know I'm doing the right thing.
3417000	3423000	Maybe that's what it ultimately boils down to. And if that's what he had to do for his own well-being, then cool. I support that.
3423000	3437000	I think in the long run, what will be seen from this story is that he was somebody who made a game that owned up to his mistakes and then gave people their money back and let everybody play it for free.
3437000	3448000	It's not going to be seen as a greedy developer that tried to take people's money by releasing an unfinished game. I think that's the moral of this story.
3448000	3458000	Alright, well let's move on. Shane has been good enough to fill in for Dark Sakura's stories tonight, even though you have no idea what she volunteered to read about tonight.
3458000	3461000	Yeah, so there's one later I really don't want to read.
3461000	3463000	But this one's okay, right?
3463000	3469000	This one's fine. So remember there's this thing called E3 and it used to be really cool, but now it's just garbage?
3469000	3471000	It's like this big place where they have video games.
3471000	3473000	That's you saying this and not me, wow.
3473000	3479000	Well, I've been to what's considered E3 ever since it turned to garbage.
3479000	3489000	Well, hold on, let's back up a minute. Because I think anybody who's been following the news this week knows what this is leading to. Why did you call E3 garbage? Why are you calling E3 garbage?
3489000	3501000	Because it's nothing but media appointments now and big open spaces where you might see like, okay, the last time I went to E3 I was over in the Activision area.
3501000	3508000	And literally Activision's area was a big screen that had Call of Duty on it and that was it. Everything else was behind for press.
3509000	3520000	I don't even remember why I was at the last E3 I went to, but before I've been there as industry because I worked at Konami and I got in for other things.
3520000	3528000	But they had games out you could play, it was super fun. But Activision, this last E3 I went to, whenever that was, was just a big Call of Duty screen and that's it.
3528000	3532000	If you weren't somebody that had an appointment, you couldn't do anything in Activision's booth.
3532000	3538000	And that's the same for most of the booths, though some had some games out, but everything was still basically by appointment.
3538000	3544000	I will say this much, and I've had my gripes about E3 and they're not all that dissimilar from what Shane is saying.
3544000	3548000	My favorite booth at E3 the last year I went was the IndieCade booth.
3548000	3551000	Oh, you probably went a year after I did.
3551000	3556000	Yeah, it was all the independent developers showcasing their game. You know why that was my favorite booth?
3556000	3557000	Because you love indie stuff.
3557000	3564000	That I could walk up, play a game, talk to the developer right there, ask any question I want, and get a decent answer.
3564000	3574000	It's like the indie ones didn't have a script to stick to or whatever. Everything else is so watered down by publicists and everything.
3574000	3585000	It's like there's not a lot of, I mean, okay, you can have the status of I played this game early, woohoo, you played the on-rails version of something.
3585000	3593000	And now a lot of stuff you can't even play anymore. Like when we went to do Assassin's Creed, they played it for us. That was the year, that was Unity.
3593000	3601000	Remember, didn't we go to the Civilization thing and they were just like, we sat in a booth or a theater and they just showed it on screen and played it?
3601000	3603000	Which I didn't mind because it was Civilization.
3603000	3605000	I was like, I don't know, this game is boring.
3605000	3608000	Shut up, I love Civ. I didn't mind that because I love Civ.
3608000	3619000	I was gonna just interject, because of something Loki said earlier, I did get to play DJ Hero on the 3DS and that never came out and that does make me happy that I got to experience that.
3619000	3621000	I hate you so much.
3621000	3626000	It really wasn't that good, so you're not missing anything. But I did have an exclusive track on that demo.
3626000	3633000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, except for hands-on, anything you could see about an appointment will be on the internet in HD within 12 to 18 hours.
3633000	3636000	That's pretty true. There's always swag though too.
3636000	3638000	Not so much anymore.
3638000	3639000	Well, I'm sure not anymore.
3639000	3645000	Again, mostly from the indie stuff. The appointments I had where I was seeing things like, you know, Hex was...
3645000	3654000	I understand that we have packs and stuff that kind of fills this void, but can we just get like an indie 3 type convention that's just all indie games?
3654000	3656000	I think you just said it.
3656000	3659000	Yeah, but I don't like packs. I don't want to go to packs.
3659000	3662000	IndieCade does have a convention of their own in LA, to be fair.
3662000	3665000	Anyway, what was the point of this story?
3665000	3667000	I don't know. We just don't like E3.
3667000	3670000	But we're not the only ones apparently, kind of.
3670000	3675000	EA decided that this year they will not be on the E3 floor.
3675000	3677000	They're going to do their own thing across the street.
3677000	3683000	It's going to be called EA Play, and it's actually going to let fans go and play their stuff.
3683000	3685000	Which, I mean, Mass Effect.
3685000	3688000	Like, I kind of want to go to go play Mass Effect.
3689000	3696000	But they're saying, no, we still support the Entertainment Software Association. Nothing like that.
3696000	3701000	They want fans to get a hold of their games and not have that information be filtered through the media.
3701000	3703000	Which is great, because that's kind of...
3703000	3706000	I kind of can't believe I'm going to pat EA on the back, but...
3706000	3711000	EA's not that bad, oh my god. Quit playing into stereotypes.
3712000	3714000	No, I'm not playing into stereotypes with EA.
3714000	3716000	Because they're the ones that came up with the stupid...
3716000	3718000	Well, they came up with the whole online pass thing.
3718000	3720000	So, no, I'm not giving a pass for that.
3720000	3722000	But this is totally separate.
3722000	3723000	You're not going to give them an online pass, right?
3723000	3725000	I'm not giving them an online pass for that.
3725000	3726000	But this is totally separate.
3726000	3730000	I like these events where they have consumers able to play their products and stuff.
3730000	3733000	It's kind of like how E3 was, like, way a long time ago.
3733000	3735000	And also...
3735000	3737000	Technically, no. Consumers were never able to get into E3.
3737000	3738000	Okay, I'm sorry.
3739000	3742000	Really? So those little kids I saw running around E3, they weren't consumers?
3742000	3743000	Those were industry...
3743000	3744000	They were midgets, okay?
3744000	3746000	They were little people that...
3746000	3750000	They have a disease that they don't age...
3750000	3753000	You guys, the rules were paper thin before.
3753000	3755000	We all know that, but technically...
3755000	3757000	I'm going to get a comment or an email if I don't say...
3757000	3760000	Technically, it was never a consumer show. Wink.
3762000	3765000	But what I'm saying, though, is they're going to get...
3765000	3770000	I think more impressions or better feedback from having their consumers play their games.
3770000	3771000	Because their consumers...
3771000	3773000	The media is just going to say, oh, this is great.
3773000	3775000	And then right up the story it says, oh, this is great.
3775000	3776000	No matter what it is.
3776000	3778000	Because they got free time with whatever game.
3778000	3780000	Yeah, I mean, they're going to have the new Titanfall this year.
3780000	3782000	They're going to have Mass Effect.
3782000	3783000	Oh my gosh.
3783000	3785000	I want to go to not E3.
3785000	3787000	I want to go to EA3 or whatever.
3787000	3792000	I have this real concern that Shane is going to try to talk me into this stupid road trip.
3792000	3793000	It won't take much.
3793000	3794000	I'll be like, hey, guess what?
3794000	3795000	Mass Effect.
3795000	3796000	Let's go.
3796000	3797000	Hey, guess what?
3797000	3798000	We drove all the way down there.
3798000	3799000	Mass Effect's not there.
3799000	3802000	It'll be in video form only.
3802000	3803000	I would be so mad.
3803000	3804000	I'd leave them there.
3804000	3806000	It's a trailer that's on YouTube where I...
3806000	3808000	It'll be the same trailer from last year.
3808000	3809000	I'd leave them there.
3809000	3812000	I'd be like, you can take a Greyhound bus from downtown LA.
3812000	3813000	Get home.
3813000	3814000	That'd be hilarious.
3814000	3816000	This is great, though.
3816000	3818000	Every company should do that.
3818000	3819000	And then...
3820000	3823000	Do you think this could be...
3823000	3824000	Just throwing it out there.
3824000	3828000	Do you think EA could be trying to strong arm E3 into going public?
3828000	3829000	Because maybe for all...
3829000	3835000	As much as we complain about EA in the past, all these complaints are years old issues.
3835000	3837000	Online pass, charging for cheat codes.
3837000	3840000	This is an EA of several years ago.
3840000	3841000	People change.
3841000	3842000	It's fine.
3842000	3844000	So could EA maybe be getting a read?
3844000	3847000	Could EA be hearing shows like this?
3847000	3848000	Obviously they're not listening to this one.
3848000	3850000	But could they be hearing shows like this?
3850000	3852000	And we're not the only ones to sit here and go.
3852000	3853000	E3 is not what it used to be.
3853000	3858000	Maybe they're looking at the Sony experience thing where they did that.
3858000	3862000	Or any of the foreign ones like Tokyo Game Show and Gamescom.
3862000	3864000	Don't those have public data?
3864000	3867000	Could they be trying to strong arm E3 into going public?
3870000	3872000	No, I don't think so.
3872000	3874000	I mean, didn't Activision...
3875000	3878000	No, Activision bowed out, was it last year?
3878000	3881000	They did, but they didn't hold a competing event across the street.
3881000	3882000	Like that's...
3882000	3884000	I mean, yes, Activision did do this.
3884000	3886000	So this isn't like unfounded or whatever.
3886000	3888000	But Activision did not do something across the street.
3888000	3889000	Maybe they just didn't want it.
3889000	3892000	The closest thing they did was they had that arena that they rented out for DJ Hero.
3892000	3894000	And they had like Rihanna and Eminem.
3894000	3897000	But that's not the same thing as Come Play Our Games.
3897000	3903000	Why I think they're doing is they're pulling a NUYA where they just don't want to pay for the space there.
3903000	3905000	But they're paying for something there.
3905000	3906000	They're having meeting rooms.
3906000	3908000	Well, I understand that they're having meeting rooms.
3908000	3911000	But they're not paying for floor space, which is probably really expensive.
3911000	3917000	It's probably maybe cheaper to rent a space next door and have the press walk us across the street.
3917000	3919000	What Shane is saying is kind of accurate.
3919000	3923000	Is that you go to Activision's booth, it's just meeting rooms.
3923000	3925000	Konami had nothing but meeting rooms.
3925000	3927000	Well, they shouldn't have anything this year at all.
3927000	3928000	Yeah, I know. LOL.
3928000	3929000	But I want to say the last year...
3929000	3931000	Take their slot machines.
3931000	3938000	The last year I was at E3, EA had like maybe some kiosks with like one or two games.
3938000	3941000	But the big bulk of their booth was meeting rooms.
3941000	3943000	E3, again, just not what it used to be.
3943000	3946000	If you don't have booth appointments, don't go to E3.
3946000	3948000	It's a waste of your time.
3948000	3949000	Yeah.
3949000	3954000	Man, remember like one of those years at Konami, it was like, let's go sit in the room from Silent Hill 4.
3954000	3956000	This is awesome. I think that was like all of our first years.
3956000	3958000	That was the very first year all of us went.
3958000	3964000	Like, you go there now and everything is so sterile looking and vacant.
3964000	3968000	It's like, you used to have to be kind of packed in to walk around E3.
3968000	3972000	Now there's all this free open space because they just have like a monitor up with videos.
3972000	3979000	And then there was also the very awkward wrestling ring with the Rumble Roses cosplayers.
3979000	3983000	And like the very awkward photos people were taking with them.
3983000	3985000	It was brilliant.
3986000	3988000	SSG100Matt with a thought.
3988000	3995000	I think they want to manage their own space themselves and not be micromanaged by the space of E3 and having to compete with others around them.
3995000	3999000	Well, you know, they don't have to compete because there's nothing really going on on the floor.
3999000	4002000	Hey, at least Suya's not going to be there next year or across the street next year.
4002000	4004000	So, you know, that's one lesson.
4004000	4009000	Remember the really last great E3 when it was like, I think it was Sega and NC Software.
4009000	4013000	Like, they both had stages and they were just like blaring music at each other.
4013000	4016000	It got so loud. That was fun.
4016000	4023000	This is why the line to do anything Nintendo is like 17 hours long because they're one of the only boosts where you can walk up and play games.
4023000	4029000	But it's like, you know, everybody at E3 has literally nothing else to do but do that at Nintendo.
4029000	4035000	To be fair, Sony and Microsoft also always had a good showing of games out on the floor there.
4035000	4042000	But now even Sony, like you said, is moving to their own pretty successful event that they do.
4042000	4052000	So hopefully this just makes the Entertainment Software Association realize their show kind of sucks and they need to do something about it.
4052000	4058000	Maybe one last question. Was E4 All just ahead of its time?
4058000	4060000	What is that? I don't even know what that is anymore.
4060000	4062000	That was the replacement show.
4062000	4067000	Okay. Do you remember when E3 moved to the Santa Monica airport because it was the disaster?
4067000	4069000	I wasn't going at that point.
4069000	4074000	It was the year after the disastrous Sony press conference and they got all that negative press.
4074000	4076000	And a lot of companies got negative press that year.
4076000	4078000	But that was also the last good year to go.
4078000	4082000	And they all threatened to pull out of E3 because of all the negative press.
4082000	4085000	And so the ESA said we're going to really lock it down.
4085000	4088000	We're only going to let this many people in and we're going to do it at the Santa Monica airport.
4088000	4095000	However, they were under contract to the city of Los Angeles that they would do these yearly events.
4095000	4100000	So what they did instead is they had this event called E4 All that was open to everybody.
4100000	4106000	And All Games, the network this show used to be on, I know had a presence there because they did a booth there.
4106000	4108000	Yeah, I remember that.
4108000	4111000	I didn't go because the timing was different and I couldn't do it.
4111000	4116000	Didn't they have the record holders for the different arcade games and stuff like that?
4116000	4121000	Yeah, and I remember the guys on All Games Interactive were in with Twin Galaxies.
4121000	4123000	So I feel like they collaborated on something.
4123000	4126000	Sorry guys, my memory is fuzzy. Some of you guys probably remember this better than I do.
4126000	4134000	But the point of the story is that was the replacement show that they did for E3 but not nearly as many developers.
4134000	4138000	I think Nintendo was there one year, Microsoft was there the other.
4138000	4144000	But it wasn't like they had that huge buy-in that E3 had.
4144000	4146000	Was it maybe ahead of its time?
4146000	4151000	Why don't we just get rid of E3 period? Let everybody do their own things and it's great.
4151000	4156000	Don't you think that might spread things too thin though?
4156000	4162000	No, because right now what does E3 accomplish besides announcements? Nothing. I do not care.
4162000	4167000	I like watching the press conferences. Can we just have the press conferences? Let's just do press conference day and we're done.
4167000	4173000	Yeah, that's fine too. But E3 otherwise does not serve a purpose like it used to anymore, I feel like.
4173000	4176000	So get rid of it. Or completely retool it.
4176000	4183000	Can we do what they did that was a 2006 where it's like, hey, Capcom, perfect example, Capcom.
4183000	4190000	Hey, we're going to have these games and these demos out on, you know, you can go play them on the show floor or you can play them at home.
4190000	4196000	You know, they had Lost Planet and they had fucking, it was MotoGP 6, I think.
4196000	4201000	And there was some other game that was in there as well. There's like three games that they had demos for.
4201000	4203000	It wasn't necessarily just Capcom, but they had one other one.
4203000	4204000	I remember that though.
4204000	4210000	And I thought that was like the coolest thing. It's like, this is sweet because I'm not going to be able to get to play this on the show floor.
4210000	4216000	And like Nintendo, the past couple of years has done, hey, you can't get to E3, we'll go to like a Best Buy.
4216000	4219000	And we're going to have games. You don't like that? I thought that was great.
4219000	4222000	Yeah, I understand to go to the Best Buy and stuff, but it's like limited.
4222000	4224000	Come to Lion Con, have the same experience.
4224000	4229000	It's limited Best Buys and stuff. Just put a fucking demo on your goddamn online service.
4229000	4235000	It's like, gee, if only we had a fucking online storefront where we could offer demos to people for the play.
4235000	4239000	No, instead you go to Best Buy. Not all Best Buys, just specific ones.
4239000	4243000	Alright, alright. We gotta just make early access for everything.
4243000	4247000	Alright, we gotta move on for time, so let's get to the next story, Loki.
4247000	4250000	Might as well just send you the Blockbuster video to go play Mario Kart.
4250000	4252000	That'd be awesome.
4252000	4254000	I remember doing that too. It was pretty awesome.
4254000	4262000	Anyways, so Steam right now, they have the whole market for early access kind of to themselves.
4262000	4267000	But, thankfully, Good Old Games, they're going to be launching their own service as well.
4267000	4275000	It's similar to early access, but they're going to have a little bit more of a curated experience.
4275000	4283000	So, basically, they want all gamers on GOG.com to have access to these titles that they have to offer.
4283000	4290000	But, they want to do it right, carefully evaluating each and every game, offering a 14-day refund policy,
4290000	4295000	and providing GOG Galaxy support with update rollback and more.
4295000	4302000	Basically, they said refunds will be eligible to anyone in the 14-day window for any reason.
4302000	4308000	And they'll be taking requests also for additional inclusions as well.
4308000	4310000	And the games will kind of be a part of this.
4310000	4322000	Starbound, Ashes of the Singularity, Project Zomboid, TerraTech, and the Curious Expedition are going to be the first few games that are offered that.
4322000	4325000	And they're being offered also without DRM still.
4325000	4328000	So, I think that's a good idea.
4328000	4336000	And also to kind of commemorate the program they're going to be launching, doing some discounts as well.
4336000	4339000	And that's going to be effective until February 2nd.
4339000	4342000	Do you think you might participate in this early access?
4342000	4345000	Participate in it? Like, what do you mean? Like, put my game up there?
4345000	4346000	Yeah, or no, no, I mean like...
4346000	4347000	Whenever I get done with that?
4347000	4349000	Get one of the games that are on there.
4349000	4353000	I don't really buy anything through good old games.
4353000	4358000	Not to say I don't have anything in the library and stuff, but I'm not really buying stuff on Steam either.
4358000	4359000	Okay, I take that back.
4359000	4364000	I am still padding my stupid account with games I'm never going to play, but...
4364000	4367000	Did you get the latest Humble Bundle? Because it's all Civilization games.
4367000	4370000	No, I didn't because I have a lot of those already.
4370000	4375000	Just saying. If you have not seen the latest Humble Bundle, it's like all Civilization games.
4375000	4376000	It is all Civilization games.
4376000	4377000	Shame you didn't buy it.
4377000	4378000	No.
4378000	4384000	I have, but see, and I was going to, but I have Civ III complete already and I have Civ V.
4384000	4388000	And I just didn't need more Civilization games. I still haven't played Civ V.
4388000	4390000	There's no such thing as not needing more Civilization games.
4390000	4393000	There is. It's called being sane.
4393000	4401000	I mean, I guess if I was really into it, this might be worthwhile, but I just don't want to pay for something I'm not going to...
4401000	4405000	Okay, ha ha ha. I'm not going to pay for something I'm not going to play.
4405000	4408000	That's my entire Steam library, so I can't really say that.
4408000	4413000	I just don't want to make that same mistake currently.
4413000	4415000	I don't know.
4415000	4421000	Alright, well, moving on. This is a game that didn't have an early access program, but it did have a Kickstarter.
4421000	4424000	And Kickstarter said that the game would be out in April 2015.
4424000	4429000	Well, yet again this past week, Mighty No. 9 was delayed again.
4429000	4437000	This was after they said that February 9th would be the release date, and I almost want to say they said in that announcement, no more delays.
4437000	4441000	Well, guess what? Now they have pushed it back to spring 2016.
4441000	4443000	Naughty Dog did the same thing with Uncharted.
4443000	4446000	We're done delaying it. Here's a delay.
4446000	4451000	The reason for the delay is rooted in bugs inside the network modes, and specifically problems with matchmaking.
4451000	4456000	There are two large reasons for this problem, one of them being the large number of platforms supported,
4456000	4459000	and the other stems from the fact that the engine we're using is no longer being updated,
4459000	4463000	which means adjustment for matchmaking and online code are being made manually,
4463000	4466000	miscalculations on the part of us, the development staff.
4466000	4472000	So, I mean, we'll get into this a little later in the Fugu question of the week, but what do you guys think at this point?
4472000	4474000	I just don't care.
4474000	4481000	I'm kind of at that point, too, where I'm like, it'll be out when it's out. I don't even listen to their days anymore.
4481000	4487000	I don't really care. I hope it's good. I mean, that's really all I care about is I hope it's good at this point.
4487000	4495000	I have so many other things I'm wanting to play or work on or that type of stuff that this isn't even on my radar really right now.
4495000	4499000	I know it's coming out, but I'm not like, ooh, I can't wait to play that.
4499000	4503000	I would rather just have a real Mega Man game at this point.
4503000	4511000	Mighty No. 9 has not really captured my interest since they announced it, and the more I see of it, actually the less excited I am for it.
4511000	4513000	Yeah, I'm kind of with you on that.
4513000	4523000	It's just, it's like, I don't know, like a generic Mega Man game that maybe some random,
4523000	4528000	oh, this is like a Mega Man game they would put in the Mega Man block on awesome games done quick,
4528000	4531000	but it's one of those knockoffs that's really not that great.
4531000	4538000	It's Mega Man PC. I don't know if you ever played Mega Man PC. It was Mega Man, but it was just different. It was off.
4538000	4546000	You know, there's a franchise that would benefit from like a Mario Maker-esque type game, like a Mega Man thing,
4546000	4550000	where you can design your own bosses. Yeah, design your own bosses.
4550000	4552000	I don't know how you do that, but all right.
4552000	4553000	Oh, easily.
4553000	4554000	Attack patterns.
4554000	4560000	Yeah, attack patterns and also just, you know, your imagination. Do you not have imagination?
4560000	4561000	No, I do not.
4561000	4564000	All of yours would just be like Drag Queen Man or something.
4564000	4571000	That sounds awesome. Oh, my God. I would make a Mega Man game that's just you battle contestants from RuPaul's Drag Race.
4571000	4572000	Oh, it's terrible.
4572000	4574000	Oh, my God. Okay, now I'm on board.
4574000	4576000	Edit this out. I did not say that.
4576000	4583000	Oh, my God. You are going to play my game and it's going to be called Lip Sync for Your Life.
4583000	4585000	Is it going to be amazing?
4585000	4586000	No.
4586000	4588000	Day one. It's on Kickstarter today.
4588000	4591000	I could not back it. You're right.
4591000	4598000	Come on, though. You could fight like, oh, God, what could you do? You could fight Sharon Needles would be a boss.
4598000	4600000	She had like needles that she could show.
4600000	4601000	Yeah, she could have like actual needles.
4601000	4604000	Oh, my gosh. Let's just stop this. This is not a good conversation.
4604000	4611000	Or you could have Latrice Royale who would just like wave her head and like it would cause these like waves to go out.
4611000	4612000	No, this is all bad.
4612000	4614000	This is good. I love this. I love this.
4614000	4617000	Serena Cha-Cha could throw a little Puerto Rican flags at you.
4617000	4620000	I'm so done. So done.
4620000	4622000	Yeah, this idea sounds terrible.
4622000	4624000	Yeah, I don't want this game to be made.
4624000	4625000	Fine, then let's go to the next story.
4634000	4638000	Well, Sony tried to trademark Let's Play.
4638000	4646000	Thankfully, the USPTO, which stands for Words, decided, no, you don't get to do that. The end.
4646000	4648000	The USPTO stands for Words?
4648000	4651000	I mean, it stands for some sort of words. I'm not sure.
4651000	4653000	I think it's Patent and Trademark Office.
4653000	4655000	But you missed the US, which is probably United States.
4655000	4658000	I think so. I think it's pretty safe to say that's what it means.
4658000	4661000	It could mean anything, though, because I didn't finish reading the article.
4661000	4666000	But thankfully, I know a little more about what's been going on, because we've been talking about this on the show previously.
4666000	4667000	I know you have, so go ahead and talk about it.
4667000	4670000	Some people are wondering like, why are you talking about it again? Because...
4670000	4671000	They actually rejected it this time.
4671000	4674000	Yes, this is the actual rejection now that happened this time.
4674000	4678000	Before, it was just like, was it Ubisoft that was getting mad about that? No, that was a different...
4678000	4681000	No, it was the whole internet was getting mad about it, actually.
4681000	4686000	Ubisoft and EA were getting mad about something. It was a ghost. That's what they were getting mad about.
4686000	4688000	But it's also a trademark thing. That's why it got mixed up in my head.
4688000	4694000	You can't trademark ghosts. Ghosts have been around way before you and Ubisoft.
4694000	4696000	Well, on a related note...
4696000	4700000	EA made ghosts. I've never heard a ghost until EA said something about it.
4700000	4704000	Yes, EA did make ghosts. When they killed all those different companies they purchased.
4704000	4706000	Konami, too.
4706000	4711000	On a related note, because a couple weeks ago when we had our last show, we talked about this Let's Play thing.
4711000	4714000	We were reading a blog post from this ryanmorrisonlaw.com.
4714000	4716000	Yep, the game...
4716000	4718000	Yeah, and I've actually been reading more of his stuff.
4718000	4721000	Now, I think I might want to invite him on the show if he's willing to do it. I don't know.
4721000	4727000	Because now, again, I'm looking at this guy's blog, and he did a whole piece on it, and I had no idea that this was...
4727000	4732000	Because it's kind of related, but did you know that... Do you know who the Fine Brothers are?
4732000	4734000	Yes, I watch them all the time.
4734000	4737000	Yes, I watch all the different videos and all the reaction videos.
4737000	4740000	That's what they do. They're all the reaction videos.
4740000	4743000	No, I meant people reacting to their announcement, yes.
4743000	4749000	It's the Don't You Feel Old videos, because it's kids playing 8-bit games, and they're going,
4749000	4750000	This is stupid.
4750000	4754000	They had one for the songs from classic games, and I couldn't even get all of them.
4754000	4757000	But some of the kids got more than I got. I was surprised.
4757000	4763000	Okay. Well, did you know that they registered a trademark for the word React?
4763000	4769000	I think that's dumb, but I see where they're coming from, because almost all of their videos are something reacts.
4769000	4770000	Yeah.
4770000	4771000	Something reacts.
4771000	4772000	But they didn't invent that idea.
4772000	4777000	No, but lots of things get trademarked where people don't invent ideas.
4777000	4778000	That doesn't make it right.
4778000	4782000	It doesn't! I'm just saying, like that Edge thing from a long time ago. Edge trademarks.
4782000	4783000	Yeah, I remember that.
4783000	4788000	Okay. I can talk in lengths about this, because this is all I've been reading up on the last few days.
4788000	4789000	Please! Please!
4789000	4795000	Alright, so basically the Fine Brothers, they came out with this brand new thing that they're coming out with called React World.
4795000	4803000	It's basically, you and I, we can go ahead now and make our own reaction videos.
4803000	4812000	And we can do that by going through their licensing system, and they are going to give us basically just the graphics and whatever.
4812000	4816000	And we can film it, and then they get a portion of our revenue from our ads.
4816000	4819000	They monetize it basically once we've done it.
4819000	4824000	Hey, I have an idea. How about podcast hosts react to this trademark announcement?
4824000	4832000	So they basically did this, and they're also trademarking all their different show names, which are, you know, Kids React.
4832000	4833000	Teens React.
4833000	4835000	They already have Teens React. They already have two of them.
4835000	4837000	They have Teens React and Elders React already trademarked.
4837000	4838000	Oh, okay.
4838000	4840000	And so the other ones that they're doing, like Kids React.
4840000	4843000	Which is weird, if they haven't done Kids React, because that was their first one.
4843000	4846000	Well, Kids React is, there's a few other ones that they're trying to trademark.
4846000	4849000	Aside from that, there's also like the Try Not to Smile.
4849000	4852000	The law guy actually outlined some of these.
4852000	4860000	Celebrity Reacts, Adults React, Parents React, Kids vs. Food, Lyric Breakdown, People vs. Technology, and Try Not to Smile or Laugh.
4860000	4861000	Yeah.
4861000	4863000	Shane would do pretty well at that.
4863000	4866000	So they had all this stuff that basically the system then.
4866000	4873000	And they touted it as like, they're not corporate, you know, they're totally going the opposite direction as corporate Hollywood.
4873000	4882000	And they're bringing the community together because these videos are going to be so impactful that 100 years from now, people are going to wonder like, what did those people think about stuff from earlier than that?
4882000	4889000	Oh my gosh, 100 years from now, I know that if I were around then, I would wonder what kids thought about Nyan Cat.
4889000	4891000	Because that was my first one I saw.
4891000	4896000	I basically thought that this is a great thing, and so that's where it is.
4896000	4903000	And of course, people are fucking pissed because they're like, listen, you didn't invent this shit, the React videos have been around forever.
4903000	4912000	And of course, the Fine Brothers are just saying, oh well, this is just to protect our shows, we're not actually going to try to tell you that you can't make your own reaction videos.
4912000	4915000	Except that they are, because they are pulling takedown notices.
4915000	4918000	And a lot of people in chat are bringing up the fact that they are doing season to season.
4918000	4925000	They're doing season to season on people that are reacting to this video, which is fucking ironic because they're saying, oh, you can't use our content without our permission.
4925000	4929000	Except that they're doing the exact same thing to the other videos.
4929000	4931000	It's all under fair use.
4931000	4934000	One of the takedowns was for Ellen or something like that.
4934000	4941000	No, Ellen Show did their own Kids React. It wasn't even called Kids React.
4941000	4950000	She had some kids on her show, and then she does this quite often with different things where they will show them, here's a phone from the 80s, here's what a cell phone looks like, what do you think this is?
4950000	4952000	And they're reacting to it. They didn't call it anything.
4952000	4963000	And they got fucking butthurt about it and went on their social media pages and everything and said, we need you to fucking tell Ellen that it was our idea first and they should have contacted them.
4963000	4973000	Here's the thing, because I remember in the 80s that there was a show on TV that Bill Cosby hosted. I don't even want to go there with him, but he was in fact the host.
4973000	4977000	There was a show he hosted called Kids Say the Darnedest Things, and it was on CBS.
4977000	4983000	And that was what that show was. So I'm sorry, they didn't invent the React thing. This was on TV.
4983000	4988000	And that was a remake, I want to say, of a show that's even older than that. So they didn't invent this.
4988000	4999000	Of course they didn't invent it, and they're not inventing it. They're not copywriting it. They're trademarking the word React, which is just as bad as, you know, King trying to trademark Saga.
4999000	5013000	They're doing this in the guise that they're protecting their brand, but at the same time they're going to use it, even though they're saying they're not, they're going to use it to bully other people that are doing these style videos.
5013000	5022000	And to protect your brand, instead of trademarking these words, why don't you just put your name in front of everything? Like, the Fine Brothers presents Kids React or something there.
5022000	5028000	Now we know it's yours. If it doesn't have that Fine Brothers presents, then it's not something you don't.
5028000	5030000	Well, most people don't know who the fuck they are anyways.
5030000	5034000	Dungeonbuster with an interesting comment or chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying,
5035000	5046000	As it pertains to their specific product line. You can still make Apple Super Soda or Apple Mega Pie. The Fine Brothers want to do the same thing, but React seems incredibly broad in the context of the medium it refers to. Yeah, I think that's the problem.
5046000	5057000	It's a genre. It's not, it's a genre of video. It's not, like, I don't have a problem with, I mean, it's kind of borderline. I do sort of a problem with them, you know, trademarking their show names.
5057000	5068000	But it's fine in the, if they're doing their show names where it's like, Kids React, I still think it's a bit generic, but trademarking Just React is where I kind of have a problem with it because they're going to abuse this shit.
5068000	5083000	They've already, they've already shown that they're going to abuse this shit. They took, there was somebody that had a video that was reacting to their announcement that had four views and they had ten subscribers on the channel and got a takedown by this group.
5083000	5091000	And I mean, they're censoring the comments on their Facebook page. They're censoring the comments on the videos. It's just, it's, it's ridiculous.
5091000	5093000	It doesn't make you feel good that they're doing this for their purposes.
5093000	5102000	No, it's completely backwards. Here's how it should fucking work is you want to make some good content. They're doing already, they're doing fine already.
5102000	5112000	What they want to do is have people make content from other parts of the world because they don't have the time to translate this into native languages or to, you know, do these different videos around the world.
5112000	5122000	And this way they get that content out there, kind of spread their name or whatever, and they don't have to do, put in really the work to it and they get paid basically just for this.
5122000	5126000	But you shouldn't have to fucking license this stuff. You can do this on your own.
5126000	5135000	Yeah. Bonds006 in chat says, Donald Trump wanted to have trademarked your fired line when he had, you know, the TV show, which I just, just on a tangent, first off, you know, fuck that guy.
5135000	5140000	But second off, Celebrity Apprentice is coming back and they're not going to say you're fired. You know why?
5141000	5143000	Because Arnold Schwarzenegger is the leader of the border.
5143000	5144000	Oh, I can't wait.
5144000	5147000	So you know it's going to be, you're terminated.
5147000	5149000	Can they do that? Can they pay for it?
5149000	5155000	I think a part of the, it's the same people that, it's Mark Burnett's, the same people that do Survivor.
5155000	5160000	No, no, no. But I'm sure that that's like a trademarked like phrase. So can they...
5160000	5164000	I think if they say your employment has been terminated, they can probably, they can use the word terminated.
5164000	5165000	Probably then, yeah.
5165000	5169000	But that is, that all doesn't even matter. The important part...
5169000	5171000	Yeah, he would say like your hasta la vista.
5171000	5176000	The important part about the new Celebrity Apprentice, this is crucially important.
5176000	5179000	One of his advisors is going to be Tyra Banks.
5179000	5182000	That sold me on the show right there.
5182000	5183000	What?
5183000	5185000	Tyra Banks is taking the Ivanka Trump role.
5185000	5186000	And so it's Tyra Banks.
5186000	5187000	Oh, yes.
5187000	5188000	Because top mom's done.
5188000	5190000	It's going to be fucking crazy.
5190000	5193000	This show is going to be the best. I'm so excited.
5193000	5195000	Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tyra Banks.
5195000	5197000	Yeah, Tyra Banks crazy and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
5197000	5200000	It's Warren Buffett and Steve Ballmer. I think of the others.
5200000	5205000	It's nice because it's like actual, like it's not just Donald Trump's whole fucking clan.
5205000	5210000	Like it's actual other people. Like when the show was first on and it was Donald Trump,
5210000	5213000	but he had two other people that weren't his fucking family.
5213000	5216000	Yeah, the old guy and Carolyn.
5216000	5217000	Yeah, Carolyn.
5217000	5219000	And it wasn't, the show was actually pretty good at that time.
5219000	5220000	Yeah, it was.
5221000	5222000	All right.
5222000	5226000	SSJ100Matt says, I can't wait for the panty party episode. Me neither.
5226000	5231000	No, seriously though, if you want to, there's a lot of stuff on Reddit about this whole thing.
5231000	5238000	I recommend the video from one of my favorite channels, Film Cow, I think sums it up the best.
5238000	5243000	With Merlin the Fish, where he's just like a million fucks on both your heads or something like that.
5243000	5247000	It's seriously, it's ridiculous. The whole concept is ridiculous.
5247000	5254000	They even put up an update video basically saying that we're terribly sorry that you didn't understand what we're meaning to do by this.
5254000	5256000	That you're confused by what we want to do with this.
5256000	5259000	No, we're pretty, we're pretty on board.
5259000	5261000	Actions speak louder than words, guys.
5261000	5267000	Yeah, we know what you're doing with this, but to kind of bring it all back, sorry, on this long tangent train here.
5267000	5273000	Ryan Morrison actually has offered his services pro bono to any YouTubers out there.
5273000	5278000	And he will, he's going to fight this to block this from being trademarked.
5278000	5279000	What a nice guy.
5280000	5281000	So, good for him.
5281000	5282000	Good for him. Alright.
5282000	5289000	Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out to a game store near you depending on where you live.
5289000	5291000	Starting with the US, Loki.
5291000	5297000	Alright, so very soon we're going to be getting, let's see, this weekend.
5297000	5304000	Nitro Plus Blasters Heroines Infinite Duel for PlayStation 4, that's a game by Xeed.
5305000	5311000	Mega Dimension Neptunia 7, also on PlayStation 4.
5311000	5313000	Hey, there's your Japanese RPGs.
5313000	5314000	Hey, here's another one.
5314000	5317000	Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth on PlayStation 4.
5317000	5323000	Also this week, XCOM 2 coming out on PC.
5323000	5326000	And, is that it?
5328000	5330000	Let me just take a look.
5330000	5332000	I think, I think that might be it.
5332000	5333000	It's probably still a slow week.
5334000	5336000	That is it. Alright.
5336000	5338000	Moving on and looking at Japan.
5338000	5342000	Japan this week on the PlayStation 4 has Naruto.
5342000	5345000	It's that time of the year where there's a new Naruto game.
5345000	5346000	That's every week in the year.
5346000	5351000	Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 comes out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.
5351000	5354000	Nothing on the Wii U this week. It's still kind of a dry spell over there.
5355000	5364000	On the PlayStation Vita, there is Sangokuko Senke Omode Geshi CS Edition is out on the PlayStation Vita.
5364000	5366000	And that is the big release for this week.
5366000	5370000	And on the 3DS this week, really nothing.
5370000	5374000	The next big release is Shin Megami Tensei 4 Final, but that is not until the 10th.
5374000	5377000	So, kind of a slow week in Japan as well.
5377000	5379000	Shane, are you good to do the UK dates? You got those?
5379000	5380000	Sure, I think so.
5380000	5381000	Alright, what do you have coming out in the UK?
5381000	5386000	So, on February 2nd or 2nd of February according to this because it's Europe.
5386000	5389000	Sorcery! Parts 1 and 2.
5389000	5391000	Comes out on Mac and PC.
5391000	5400000	And then on 5th February 2016, you've got Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth on PS4 and Vita.
5400000	5402000	And then XCOM 2 on Mac and PC.
5402000	5403000	And that's it.
5404000	5406000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
5406000	5411000	And then the classic game of the week, which for some crazy reason we're letting Shane do tonight.
5411000	5414000	So, let's get to those last couple stories. Loki.
5414000	5418000	Alright, so this is interesting.
5418000	5426000	So apparently there is a petition out there to try to get Danny DeVito to do the voice of Detective Pikachu.
5426000	5434000	And it's very brief basically saying there are a number of us that feel Danny DeVito would be a prime fit for the voice acting role of Detective Pikachu.
5434000	5436000	We want to make this happen.
5436000	5443000	And so you can sign on the petition and apparently there is about 8,000 signatures already.
5443000	5454000	You know, it wasn't until watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia that I realized that Danny DeVito is a national treasure for us.
5454000	5457000	So, I am totally on board with this.
5457000	5462000	I think, I mean, if we could bring up the video it would be awesome.
5462000	5467000	I really think if we could find that, it's hilarious, the video that they had for that.
5467000	5470000	And I'm trying to see if we can...
5470000	5472000	Was it linked within the original story here?
5472000	5480000	It wasn't. If you go to the story that we have and show it there on the side, there's a link to a second story.
5480000	5483000	It's more evidence that Danny DeVito needs to be the voice of Detective Pikachu.
5483000	5484000	Oh, okay. Here we go.
5484000	5485000	Yeah, click on the...
5485000	5486000	You got it. Here we go.
5486000	5487000	Alright, so just...
5499000	5501000	Just with the trailer is pretty funny.
5516000	5521000	I can't believe this! I just can't believe this!
5521000	5527000	I am not a human being! I am an animal! Cold-blooded!
5527000	5532000	Alright, I get where this is going. It's pretty funny. It's pretty funny. It just works.
5532000	5533000	I don't know who came up with that.
5533000	5534000	This just is so good.
5534000	5535000	Alright.
5535000	5540000	S.H.O. and Hunter Matt says, if they can't get Danny DeVito I would settle for Nolan North.
5540000	5547000	I would settle for the other obvious voice and I can't believe nobody is talking about Gilbert Godfried.
5547000	5548000	No.
5548000	5549000	The voice of Pikachu.
5549000	5550000	No, we don't want annoying.
5550000	5552000	No, that's like mouth or whatever.
5552000	5553000	Mouth.
5553000	5554000	Mouth.
5554000	5559000	We don't want annoying, we want amazing and that's why they picked Danny DeVito.
5561000	5565000	That would totally... everybody in chat is like giving me a collective no.
5565000	5566000	Yeah.
5566000	5567000	Good job, chat.
5567000	5569000	You know that'll be Nintendo's response.
5569000	5577000	We couldn't get Danny DeVito but we heard the internet campaigning for a famous celebrity so we got Adam Sandler to be the voice of Pikachu.
5579000	5581000	I'd still play the game but with no sound.
5583000	5586000	S.H.O. and Hunter Matt says, Tim Curry. Mic drop.
5586000	5587000	No.
5587000	5588000	He can do anything.
5588000	5589000	Nope. Nope.
5589000	5594000	Still just needs to be Danny DeVito. I'm on board with this.
5594000	5597000	I would also settle for Glenn Howerton.
5597000	5598000	Howerton.
5598000	5599000	Tilda Swinton.
5599000	5600000	Dennis.
5600000	5601000	No, Charlie.
5601000	5602000	Charlie.
5602000	5603000	Charlie actually.
5603000	5605000	Charlie Day would be pretty good.
5605000	5607000	Tiger class says, how about Betty White.
5607000	5610000	Betty White can voice Jigglypuff.
5610000	5614000	Let's just have the whole cast of It's Always Sunny doing the voices in that game.
5614000	5615000	Yes.
5615000	5619000	They'll move it from Boston to Philadelphia because it takes place in Boston.
5619000	5620000	So, yeah.
5620000	5621000	Let's do that.
5621000	5622000	Alright.
5622000	5626000	I'm moving on from this lank fest of dream games.
5626000	5627000	Alright.
5627000	5630000	Let's talk about Super Mario Maker which had some unexpected downtime this week.
5630000	5632000	There was an emergency maintenance that happened in Super Mario Maker.
5632000	5635000	Yeah, I know. I went to go play it and I'm like, uh, I hate you.
5635000	5637000	Do you know what happened?
5637000	5641000	Apparently there was some type of bug in the game where you could download a level.
5641000	5648000	You could recreate the level in the editor, basically, but add something to it.
5648000	5655000	Like, say, a flight power up or something else that would allow you to beat the level in a record time.
5655000	5657000	So people were beating levels in, like, three seconds.
5657000	5661000	And in a nutshell, that's what the exploit was.
5661000	5664000	But what was really interesting was that they actually went to...
5664000	5668000	Because they didn't want to put the exploit out there because they knew tons of people would use it.
5668000	5674000	So they went to LinkedIn and they found one of the treehouse guys on LinkedIn and sent a message.
5674000	5677000	And the treehouse guy said, oh, yeah, we're aware of this and we're working on it.
5677000	5679000	And the game was down the next day or whatever.
5679000	5680000	But then this is the hilarious thing.
5681000	5688000	They had an unlisted video that they had sent to the treehouse guy that then all of a sudden got a YouTube, like, copyright takedown.
5692000	5698000	And that's the most insulting part of it is that Nintendo did a takedown on the video that ratted out the problem that the game was having.
5698000	5700000	It was unlisted, so nobody had it.
5700000	5705000	I'm sorry. You can't tell us of bugs in our own game unless you are one of our Nintendo content providers.
5705000	5708000	That's right. That's right. How dare they? How dare they?
5708000	5711000	All right. We're going to go take a trip down memory lane.
5711000	5714000	We're going to go to a time when games weren't so damn buggy.
5714000	5717000	Geez, imagine how hard it's going to be to do reaction videos to Nintendo games.
5717000	5720000	You're going to have to, like, sign all sorts of agreements to do that.
5722000	5724000	The classic game of the week.
5724000	5730000	Dark Sakura usually steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats ought to be playing this game this week.
5730000	5731000	But she ain't here.
5731000	5742000	So Shane is filling in this week and is using this opportunity to push the agenda on a game that he never shuts up about that he thinks all of you guys should be checking out, if you haven't yet.
5742000	5749000	So Shane, and I thought for sure Dark Sakura had done this before, but we consulted the wiki and it wasn't there.
5749000	5756000	And since we're still not 100% sure, we're just doing one of the games in the series and not the original.
5756000	5759000	All right, so here it is. Shane, what is the classic game of the week?
5759000	5765000	Suikoden II, because it's the best RPG ever made.
5765000	5768000	And you used to go by the name Miklotov online.
5768000	5772000	Yep, which is where this came from, Suikoden II, it's the Blue Knight.
5772000	5773000	Yep, the Midas Hilda Knight.
5773000	5780000	But anyway, this game came out in 1998 in Japan, 1999 here, and 2000 in Europe.
5780000	5787000	I specifically remember going to get this game when it first came out and they had, like, tons at Best Buy.
5787000	5793000	I was like, oh, that's mine. And so I was very happy because this game is super rare to find.
5793000	5798000	But basically it is a sequel to Suikoden I, takes place a few years later.
5798000	5805000	You play as the unnamed hero who, I think it's Ryo if you go by canon names,
5805000	5812000	but Suikoden is a game all about political drama and big armies fighting each other.
5812000	5818000	It's amazing. I don't really know what to say about it because I just love it so much.
5818000	5823000	I'm not going to get into the history, but it's a game where you've got six people in your party.
5823000	5827000	You do Unite attacks where multiple people fight together.
5827000	5832000	You also have one-on-one duels, which kind of work as a rock, paper, scissor format.
5832000	5834000	And you've also got these massive battles.
5834000	5838000	So in the first game, it was also just rock, paper, scissors. It was kind of boring.
5838000	5844000	In this game, it still has a rock, paper, scissors element, but now you also have a grid that you move around on,
5844000	5851000	almost like a very basic strategy RPG. Those were really fun, those big battles.
5851000	5858000	Basically, this story is you, your adopted sister, and your friend get caught up in the middle of the war,
5858000	5863000	and you and your best friend get kind of split onto two different sides.
5863000	5870000	And you go through the story, basically building up an army to take on the side that your best friend has joined.
5870000	5875000	And there's plot twists abound, there's some crying that's going to happen if you play it,
5875000	5878000	but it's a really great, great story.
5878000	5883000	And this is one of those games that came out with a really bad localization.
5883000	5889000	Side note, because insight that I have, when I worked at Konami,
5889000	5896000	a few of us really pushed to get approval to bring out the collection.
5896000	5900000	This game also came out in a collection on PSP in Japan of 1 and 2.
5900000	5907000	We didn't get it here in the States, I forget the reasoning, but we pushed to get the game out,
5907000	5914000	and we were going to redo the text for 2 to make it make more sense.
5914000	5918000	That ultimately got shot down, so there's that.
5918000	5921000	Didn't you yourself work on the localization for...
5921000	5922000	Five.
5922000	5923000	Five.
5923000	5932000	And I was the go-to Suikoden guy for five, so a lot of decisions on naming conventions were handed off to me.
5932000	5939000	So I guess a disclaimer, ethics, with this classic game of the week, you did kind of work on this series eventually.
5939000	5943000	Yes, on a couple of them, but five being most notable.
5944000	5947000	So this game has a really bad translation.
5947000	5952000	Your best friend, they spell his name three different ways throughout the game.
5952000	5957000	There's J-O-Y, J-O-E-I, and J-O-E-Y.
5957000	5962000	Basically it's Joey, but that's just kind of sad.
5962000	5968000	If you had played the first game and did all the collecting of all the characters,
5968000	5972000	and you brought over your save file and gave you some extra stuff, which was nice,
5972000	5977000	there was also a mini-game that was a lot like Iron Chef,
5977000	5982000	where you would have a cooking competition and they would rate your dishes and you'd pick out ingredients.
5982000	5983000	It was really fun, too.
5983000	5989000	But this game is probably the most well-regarded in the series.
5989000	5995000	Personally, for me, it's the best, even though I worked on five.
5995000	5997000	I still don't even consider that the best.
5997000	6000000	This is by far the best in the series.
6000000	6003000	Now the series kind of doesn't do anything, which is really sad.
6003000	6006000	I'm sure it'll get a pachinko game at some point.
6006000	6009000	You can pick this up on PlayStation Network.
6009000	6017000	It came out on the network in America in 2014 and in Europe in 2015.
6017000	6020000	Otherwise, if you want a physical copy, I haven't checked eBay prices in a while.
6020000	6024000	I have two, because that's just how big a fan I am.
6024000	6027000	But they used to go for hundreds of dollars.
6027000	6030000	They may still, just because, you know, collectors.
6030000	6035000	But just pay the six bucks and get it online on the PlayStation Network.
6035000	6039000	It's totally worth your time, and you won't regret it.
6039000	6042000	And if you do, well, then you don't have good taste in games.
6042000	6045000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Sweet Coding 2.
6045000	6048000	So confession, Shane, I don't think I've really played this.
6048000	6049000	Well, you don't have good taste in games.
6049000	6051000	Well, I did play one.
6051000	6052000	One was great.
6052000	6054000	But I felt that I needed to finish one before I played two.
6054000	6056000	No, you don't need to.
6056000	6058000	There are some characters that return.
6058000	6061000	And like I said, if you bring your save file over, you get some extra stuff.
6061000	6068000	Like, you do get the ability to recruit the hero from the first game, which is nice.
6068000	6072000	But you don't have to.
6072000	6079000	It's not super required, and I can fill in any, you know, plot holes that you don't understand.
6079000	6080000	But there won't be many.
6080000	6083000	Maybe one of these days we'll do a live stream or something. That'll be fun.
6083000	6084000	Yes.
6084000	6085000	All right.
6085000	6089000	But, oh, and nobody, you don't need to play four. Nobody needs to play four.
6089000	6093000	Four is not a great game. It's not because of the story.
6093000	6097000	They just tweaked it too much, and five went back to what it should have been, and five is great.
6097000	6101000	Three is really good, even though it's got some tweaks that I don't agree with.
6101000	6104000	But two is the best. And then one and five are tied.
6104000	6107000	And then three. And four doesn't exist in this series.
6107000	6108000	All right, all right, all right.
6108000	6111000	And don't play the tactics game. It's not good.
6111000	6114000	There it is, the classic game of the week, Sweet Coding 2.
6114000	6117000	You know, this also got a spin-off card game in Japan.
6117000	6119000	It came out on Game Boy Advance. I own that.
6119000	6120000	Do you?
6120000	6124000	Yep, and they had two Gaiden games, too, which were text adventures. I own those as well.
6124000	6126000	Why do you think Konami just never brought it back?
6126000	6132000	They tried to revive the series with a DS version and a PSP version called Tier Craze.
6132000	6135000	It was, like, watered down Sweet Coding.
6135000	6139000	I never played the PSP version because that one didn't come out here, but the DS one did.
6139000	6145000	And it just wasn't well made. It didn't have the same charm as these ones did.
6145000	6151000	So I guess all the people had already left that made these games anyway.
6151000	6155000	So, like, the main designers were gone. The people that made the music were gone.
6155000	6158000	The writers were gone. It's good ol' Konami.
6158000	6165000	Was that a surreal experience for you to actually localize, you know, a sequel, essentially, to one of your all-time favorite games?
6165000	6166000	Yes.
6166000	6167000	Was that a real surreal experience?
6167000	6178000	That was super exciting. That was probably the best, most exciting thing I did at Konami was be on the team that did that.
6178000	6180000	Your credits are actually in Sweet Coding 5.
6180000	6181000	Yeah.
6181000	6182000	That's cool.
6182000	6184000	I think we had a team of five that localized the game.
6184000	6185000	How fun.
6185000	6186000	Yes.
6186000	6192000	All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, Sweet Coding 2. I've said that, like, three times now, but I'm trying to get Shane to shut up about it.
6192000	6193000	Is it Sweet Coding 2?
6193000	6194000	Yes, it is.
6194000	6195000	Let's talk about some more.
6195000	6201000	We got to go to a break because we're running long already. When we come back from the break, we're going to have Fugu Question of the Week.
6201000	6209000	We're going to talk a little bit about Saints Row for Loki, Street Fighter 5 for you fans of that, and, ooh, a Mistwalker game for me because I like Mistwalker stuff.
6209000	6214000	So we'll be back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.
6214000	6234000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, January the 31st, episode number 629 of our show, already in progress, back after a week off due to unexpected sickness on the part of myself and Loki's kid.
6234000	6243000	And this week, we have an absent Dark Sakura that filling in tonight is Shane, who is trying to negotiate with me during the break to do the classic game segment all over again because he was reading-
6243000	6245000	Yeah, I found more stuff. Oh my gosh.
6245000	6246000	Okay, I'll give you 60 seconds. Hurry.
6246000	6259000	Okay, so apparently Sweet Coding 2 was written first before Sweet Coding 1 because in 1993 slash 94, the writers were hired to make a game for an internally developed console from Konami.
6259000	6272000	That was scrapped, and then the PlayStation came out, so they were going to make a game for that, but they decided to make a prequel to Sweet Coding 2 first so they could get a better grasp on game development.
6272000	6284000	So Sweet Coding 2's story was first in conception before Sweet Coding 1, which kind of makes sense because 2 is such a better game even though 1 is fantastic.
6284000	6285000	Okay, there you go.
6285000	6288000	Oh my gosh, that was breaking news to me.
6288000	6289000	Can you-
6289000	6293000	From like 15 years- wait, how many years? Like 20 years ago now?
6293000	6294000	Over 20.
6294000	6295000	For 20 years ago, that's breaking news.
6295000	6296000	You're old, Shane. You're getting old.
6296000	6297000	No, I'm not.
6297000	6298000	So-
6298000	6299000	I'll never get old.
6300000	6308000	So, can you imagine if Konami had their own console? Like, especially with everything that's going on now, can you imagine now if they have been a player in the console industry at this point?
6308000	6311000	It would have been such a different outcome, I think.
6311000	6312000	Maybe. Maybe.
6312000	6315000	I don't think we'd be with just pachinko machines and health clubs.
6315000	6321000	Probably not. Alright, Shane and I, by the way, are still enjoying wine, so if we seem especially excitable tonight, it's probably-
6321000	6322000	I'm also hungry.
6322000	6325000	The wine is partially to make. So, there you go.
6325000	6332000	Alright, let's get back into some news. We're going to do some rapid fire news, then we're going to get to the FUGL question of the week. Loki.
6332000	6347000	Alright, so this is pretty cool. So, apparently, and I'm not positive this is the game that they were working on previously, because I know that they're making some sort of like burnout extreme sports thing, but there's this new game coming out by the team that did burnout.
6348000	6372000	I guess at least some of the team, and it's called Dangerous Golf, and it's kind of- it's by Alex Ward and Fiona Sperry, who came up kind of with the Burnout series or worked on that, and it's a game where you're trying to break as much of the level as you can before you put the ball in the hole.
6372000	6391000	So, it's just you blow shit up with your golf ball, which I think is pretty awesome. So, they kind of have some of the elements that you would see like in the crash mode in Burnout, where it's like the crash time or something like that, but I think in this one they're calling it something a little bit different, like a- what was that here?
6391000	6411000	It was different tricks you can perform in there. What did they call it? It was like ball time or swing time or something. Smash breaker is what they had. So yeah, you accrue enough damage and then you earn a smash breaker, which is like the crash breaker, I guess, and it allows you to do even more damage.
6412000	6420000	I'm down. It looks good. I can't wait to play that. Pretty much play anything that they make from the people that made Burnout. Let's get a new Burnout game. How about that?
6421000	6438000	PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live are going to be getting some new games for February in their services. So, for example, PlayStation Plus, your free games that you're going to be getting, Helldivers on PlayStation 4, Nom Nom Galaxy, and Nova 1-11.
6438000	6457000	On PlayStation 3, Grid Autosport, and then also Helldivers, Nova 1-11, and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, which is pretty awesome. And then on Vita it would be Helldivers, Lemmings Touch, and Nova 1-11. I kind of want to try Persona 4 Arena.
6458000	6460000	There was a Lemmings game not that long ago.
6461000	6463000	Apparently Lemmings Touch on the Vita.
6464000	6466000	I had no idea that Lemmings made a comeback at some point.
6466000	6481000	I want to say the last time I saw a Lemmings game on a Sony platform was part of the PlayStation Mobile stuff. So I don't know if that's the same game they're talking about, if they just ported it over, or if it's just... I don't know. I used to be really big into Lemmings at one time.
6482000	6484000	Yeah, Lemmings was one of those huge, quintessential 90s computer games.
6485000	6487000	Lemmings 2, man, I used to play the shit out of Lemmings 2.
6488000	6490000	I've never played a Lemmings game. It didn't look interesting.
6491000	6492000	They're puzzle games, basically.
6493000	6494000	I love puzzle games, but that didn't look interesting.
6494000	6496000	Lemmings 2 was a little bit more fun, I thought. I don't know.
6497000	6503000	Anyways, on Xbox platforms, so we've got for Xbox One through February, the whole month of February, Hand of Fate.
6504000	6510000	And then the second half of February, you get Styx, Master of Shadows on Xbox One.
6511000	6517000	Then Xbox 360, Sacred Citadel for the first half of February, and Gears of War 2 for the second half.
6517000	6528000	And of course, being that everything is backwards compatible, that they're releasing on the service, those will be playable on Xbox One as well.
6529000	6538000	And then, finally, they have made the announcement of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutants in Manhattan.
6539000	6546000	It's going to be the new Platinum Games take on the Turtles series, much like they did with Transformers recently.
6547000	6552000	And it's supposed to be coming out on all major platforms. It looks pretty awesome.
6553000	6554000	I was going to say, it actually looks pretty awesome from the trailer.
6555000	6558000	Yeah, it's going to also have four player online co-op, so I am definitely down for that.
6559000	6560000	That might be fun.
6561000	6562000	So, want to check that out.
6563000	6565000	That was the best part of the old school pizza parlor game.
6566000	6567000	Oh, God, yeah.
6568000	6570000	Ninja Turtles arcade game was the fact that it was four player co-op, except nobody ever wanted to be Raphael.
6571000	6574000	Really? Because all my friends would always go for him. Nobody wanted to be Donatello.
6574000	6576000	Really? But the Psy had such a close range.
6577000	6580000	Yes, but it's the factor of Raphael's so cool.
6581000	6583000	Raphael's cool. I was always Donatello or Leonardo.
6584000	6585000	I was Leo because he's blue.
6586000	6587000	Of course you were.
6588000	6592000	But it looks pretty cool, and hopefully they'll be coming out a little bit later this year.
6593000	6598000	I want to say it was scheduled for the summer, so maybe I'm assuming around the time that the new movie comes out.
6599000	6602000	I think that's coming out this summer, so we'll have to wait and see.
6602000	6607000	All right. Moving on to another EA-related story.
6608000	6610000	EA may have actually told us how many Xbox Ones are out there.
6611000	6614000	You might remember that Microsoft kind of stopped releasing those sales figures.
6615000	6619000	We know that Sony has sold about 35 million PlayStation 4s, so using some math,
6620000	6626000	when the chief financial officer of EA, Blake Jorgensen, said that there are 55 million units out in the wild,
6626000	6632000	that means there's probably just under 20 million Xbox Ones compared to the 35 million PlayStation 4s.
6633000	6638000	Again, I don't think that seems that bad, but it's not exactly a close race either.
6639000	6643000	So, I mean, but, again, both systems have their strengths and weaknesses.
6644000	6647000	It's still pretty early in the console lives, too. I mean, we're just two years in.
6648000	6652000	That's something important to consider as well, is that PlayStation 3 had a really rough start.
6652000	6656000	At least, I remember that. And, you know, then by the end of the cycle, it made a lot of headway.
6657000	6661000	And there's good games on the platforms now. There's still probably people waiting for some of those,
6662000	6667000	like, big anticipated games that come out that they were, you know, hyping up since the launch of the consoles.
6668000	6671000	So maybe there's people still holding off on those.
6672000	6675000	I own both, for what it's worth. I realize that's an expensive thing to do, but...
6676000	6679000	Yeah, I don't have an Xbox One. I definitely like Crackdown.
6679000	6681000	Crackdown will finally crack you down.
6682000	6688000	I don't think so, because the console's expensive. I'm not going to buy a $400 console for Crackdown.
6689000	6691000	It might come down in price again before...
6692000	6694000	Well, it's going to have to be more than Crackdown to get me to purchase that.
6695000	6701000	I do like the fact that it's all backwards compatible. I don't really want to pay for Xbox Live, though.
6702000	6705000	I actually undid my auto-renew for that, too.
6706000	6712000	Alright, well, speaking of a company that you usually tie to Xbox, although now they're everywhere,
6713000	6716000	including PlayStation, Bungie is having a big change.
6717000	6722000	Harold Ryan, who's been the studio president for 15 years, has actually stepped down this past week.
6723000	6726000	COO Pete Parsons is going to be taking over the company moving forward.
6727000	6731000	And of course, Pete Parsons is talking about Destiny right off the bat in this announcement,
6731000	6735000	saying, I want you to know my number one priority at Bungie's is, and always has been,
6736000	6738000	to deliver great games that we can all share together.
6739000	6741000	I also believe you have yet to see our studio's best work.
6742000	6745000	My new role here at the studio will be entirely focused on fulfilling that promise.
6746000	6751000	So we'll see what comes out of Destiny probably later this fall when the inevitable next expansion is out.
6752000	6756000	I seriously need to play that. I have it at home. I have Destiny and I have Watch Dogs.
6756000	6760000	I have played neither of them. I have had those for two years now, almost.
6761000	6766000	Well, not two years. I got them last year, no, the year before last, when I got my console.
6767000	6773000	And I just haven't touched them at all. I don't know. I just don't want to sink that much time into Destiny.
6774000	6781000	Alright, well, also, I guess there was some rumors going around this week that there was going to be possibly some add-ons
6781000	6786000	that were coming to Destiny, some microtransactions that could have ammo involved,
6787000	6790000	that there would be, you know, because they were selling the level boosts and so forth,
6791000	6794000	and that there was going to be these ammo packs that were going to be microtransactions as well.
6795000	6800000	However, Bungie did end up responding to this, saying there will not be paid ammo drops in the game.
6801000	6804000	So that is not something that is on their radar.
6804000	6809000	So, I guess they're going to stick with what's working for them in Destiny right now,
6810000	6812000	because people seem to be feeling a lot better about that game than they did a year ago.
6813000	6818000	I need to go back and revisit it. You know of all people who is super into Destiny right now,
6819000	6823000	is my former co-host from Horde House, Extifer, is like super into Destiny right now.
6824000	6828000	He plays online. They do PvP and everything. And so I was kind of surprised to hear that,
6829000	6833000	because, you know, I tried to get into Destiny, but then to be fair, I didn't really do the Taken King.
6834000	6836000	I didn't get into the expansion at all. I guess I was a little late.
6837000	6840000	But I'll wait for the inevitable price cut as they prepare for the next expansion.
6841000	6842000	Then maybe I'll get into it. We'll see.
6843000	6844000	Okay, what do you have for us, Shane?
6845000	6847000	Well, this story is just terrible.
6848000	6851000	Remember, Dark Soccer was originally going to do these stories, so this will list for her.
6852000	6853000	Yes, please keep this in mind.
6854000	6855000	Well, you know how much she loves Hadaful Boyfriend.
6856000	6858000	Yes, and I don't understand that either, and I don't understand this.
6858000	6867000	There is a dating sim on Steam Greenlight, and you're a human that dates cats.
6870000	6874000	There's really nothing more to be said that's appropriate.
6875000	6877000	So let's move on to the next story.
6878000	6879000	What's the game called?
6880000	6883000	I think it was like Perfect Date or something is what it's called.
6884000	6885000	Yeah, so bad.
6886000	6887000	It's called Cha-Ching.
6888000	6889000	It's called Never Getting My Money.
6890000	6892000	It's called The Internet Loves Cats a Little Too Much.
6893000	6894000	Oh, so gross.
6895000	6904000	Anyway, a better story is that at the Video Game Awards, there was a commercial for this Tron game called Tron Runner.
6905000	6906000	Which I got on Steam Early Access.
6907000	6908000	Yes, it's apparently like ten bucks there.
6909000	6915000	But it's coming out on February 16th for PS4 and Xbox One as well.
6916000	6917000	In Early Access?
6918000	6919000	It's coming out then.
6920000	6921000	Oh, so then they're going to be done.
6922000	6924000	Yeah, this is a full, real launch. Again, February 16th.
6925000	6928000	It'll be twenty bucks, but right now it's still ten dollars on the Early Access.
6929000	6931000	So if you're going to play on PC, that's the best way to do it.
6932000	6938000	It's got some nice contributions to the soundtrack from Giorgio Moroder and other people I've never heard of.
6939000	6942000	Oh, that ties into, there was a leak a while ago.
6943000	6944000	I know, boo!
6944000	6950000	Well, I will say, Tron Runner has a really neat atmosphere to it. It's a cool game.
6951000	6952000	I just want a movie.
6953000	6959000	Well, I want a movie, and I also dream someday that they will do, I would love to see Rockstar Games now.
6960000	6962000	They did a really awesome adaptation of The Warriors.
6963000	6966000	Imagine an open world Tron game, like the Grand Theft Auto engine.
6967000	6971000	Of course, it makes me think of The Matrix Online, which didn't end up so great.
6971000	6976000	Well, The Matrix Online was like, that's like early, I mean, think of how long ago The Matrix Online was.
6977000	6978000	You played a little bit of that.
6979000	6982000	I did play part of the beta of that. I thought it was okay.
6983000	6984000	For what it was.
6985000	6987000	I wasn't going to pay for that. I mean, it was cool.
6988000	6993000	I mean, I think, I liked, was it The Matrix, or Enter The Matrix was fucking awesome.
6994000	6998000	I just, I'd be fine with another Matrix game, to be honest.
7001000	7004000	Sorry, I zoned out. I was reading the next story because I hadn't read it yet.
7005000	7008000	But the next story, because Tron's awesome, we could talk about Tron for forever.
7009000	7016000	Apparently, you know, politicians like to use music in their campaigns, and nobody's ever happy about that.
7017000	7020000	Like, everybody gets mad when they use their songs for campaigns.
7021000	7022000	Well, the creator of the...
7023000	7025000	Unless, you know, they ask for permission first.
7026000	7027000	Yeah, which never happens, so that's why.
7028000	7029000	They always forget that.
7029000	7035000	Because we want our politicians to steal stuff for their campaigns, because that means they're a good leader.
7036000	7048000	One of the people that's, you know, politicking around right now, Rand Paul, apparently used a Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego song.
7049000	7051000	The one from the show that was on PBS.
7052000	7053000	Doo-wop, doo-ba-doo-way-ooh.
7054000	7055000	Come on, everybody knows that song.
7056000	7057000	Like the theme song?
7058000	7060000	It was probably like an attack ad on somebody else.
7061000	7062000	Yeah, it was an attack ad.
7063000	7064000	On who?
7065000	7066000	Marco Rubio.
7067000	7068000	Oh, because he's not in the Senate, he's around campaigning, right?
7069000	7073000	Yeah, something like that. Anyway, it got sent to with a cease and desist letter.
7074000	7077000	Where in the World is all the gaming content?
7078000	7086000	Somebody, I guess the website Politico said that it actually sounds like the song may end up falling under fair use.
7087000	7091000	But it still sucks, and I should probably not do that.
7092000	7097000	Can we get like a Carmen Sandiego movie? I mean, because I thought the TV show was pretty cool.
7098000	7100000	Wasn't there a rumor that Jennifer Lopez was going to be Carmen Sandiego?
7101000	7108000	Oh, fuck that. She is not, I don't think she'd be a good Carmen Sandiego. Although, I would see like Angelina Jolie, I think could be a good Carmen Sandiego, I think. I don't know.
7108000	7118000	The person I can't remember their name, that was in the second Ocean's Eleven movie, why can't, Ocean's Twelve.
7119000	7120000	Why can't I remember her name?
7121000	7122000	How about Ashley Judd? Whatever happened to her?
7123000	7129000	She, no. The one I'm thinking of is better. I just don't remember her name. She married a really old guy. Didn't she, I think she married Michael Douglas.
7130000	7131000	Anna Nicole Smith? Oh, Catherine Zeta-Jones.
7132000	7133000	Yes, she would be a good Carmen Sandiego.
7134000	7136000	Alright, maybe. It's been a while.
7136000	7137000	Yes. The end.
7138000	7141000	I liked my idea of Anna Nicole Smith as Carmen Sandiego.
7142000	7143000	That's sad. That's not good.
7144000	7145000	I know, I miss her.
7146000	7152000	I miss her so much. Alright. Anyway, let's get to the Fookle question of the week.
7153000	7155000	Found her! She's right there, dead. I'm sorry.
7156000	7158000	You're a horrible person and should feel horrible.
7166000	7169000	Sorry, I needed a minute to collect my emotions after how horrible Loki just was.
7170000	7176000	We're going to get to the Fookle question of the week. Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and ask a question and get some answers.
7177000	7178000	So this week we asked about Mighty No. 9.
7179000	7189000	Mighty No. 9 was delayed for another time. This has pushed the game back from the originally anticipated April 2015 timeframe and even comes after the promise of no more delays.
7189000	7197000	What are your thoughts on the issue? Do you tend to shrug off delays as a necessary thing or do you feel that when taking Kickstarter money is involved, delays are unacceptable?
7198000	7200000	Or are you somewhere in between? So we just want to know, like, what are your thoughts on the issue?
7201000	7205000	So going over to Facebook where Hitstun says, I'm okay with this, meaning the delay.
7206000	7212000	I'd rather the game be delayed and complete than rushed and unfinished. I have plenty of other games to tide me over until this one is released.
7213000	7220000	Fabrice A says, I'm just fine with this. I'll wait just a little longer. It's only a game. No one has ever died because a game was delayed.
7221000	7225000	Sorry, I'm laughing because 5th Dream in chat says, Mighty No. 9 months late.
7226000	7235000	Andy R says, Necessary evil. Yeah, it sucks when a game I'm excited for won't be out as quickly, but I'd rather have a good game, the one that's terrible and needs patches after launch.
7235000	7245000	Chad B says, We pretty much accept big budget games that have big publishers behind them delaying games, so it seems to me that expecting a much smaller studio to never delay a game is unreasonable.
7246000	7258000	I didn't back Mighty No. 9, but to me the only extra responsibility that exists because the game was backed on Kickstarter is the backers should be getting updates on why it was delayed and what is being done, which to be fair is happening, for better or for worse.
7258000	7268000	Redertainment says, Delays happen in every industry. Whether it's making a game, building a house, or shipping things across country, inevitably something will happen during the process to cause a delay in the project being completed.
7269000	7274000	The key is making sure that delays and budget overruns don't become the thing that people think of when they think of the project.
7275000	7282000	Sadly, that may be happening with Mighty No. 9 if this goes any further. Mighty No. 9 might be the big dig of the gaming industry.
7282000	7307000	Winston H on Facebook says, Delays do happen and it's understandable. However, if we look at games like Duke Nukem Forever to be released, it did poorly. I'm not saying you should rush a game, but hype can only last so long before people stop carrying.
7307000	7313000	Final Fantasy XV being another example of taking too long. It's been in development for ten years.
7314000	7325000	Degenerate Johnny says, When I hear the word delay for a game, I'm somewhat relieved. It's communication from the developers to the fans that the game is not ready for official release.
7326000	7330000	It's also comforting to know that the game will be complete as the developers intended and not because the public wanted it faster.
7331000	7339000	Games take time to fully develop by some studios. As a matter of fact, Hex Shards of Fate just brought down their beta status three years after the Kickstarter.
7340000	7348000	This delay gives me confidence that Mighty No. 9 will be released and as a completed game instead of an incomplete game. Hitman, Loki and I looking at you.
7349000	7357000	And lastly, Earpster says, If a delayed game is the difference between getting something broken that needs to be patched, looking at you PC Arkham Knight.
7357000	7364000	I love that everybody's calling shit out in their comments. And something that works right out the box, then delay it every time.
7365000	7372000	Delays are disappointing and frustrating, but looking back over the years, I have a hard time telling you which of my favorite games were pushed back a month or two.
7373000	7386000	And lastly, let's go over to Google+, where Act Def says, People will probably quote this already, but like Miyamoto once said, a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.
7387000	7398000	And Martin replies, I believe in games being delayed if it means we get a better and more polished product. Games get rushed to market too much lately, which is a far bigger problem.
7399000	7407000	Games are released unfinished and fans have to wait for months to get a playable patched experience. That being said, sometimes continuous delays are indicative of a major development problem.
7408000	7413000	Just look at Duke Nukem Forever type development trajectories. That is not good for a game either.
7413000	7421000	I apologize, I cut off part of Act Def's thing here, I didn't see the more button, because I've been drinking. But Act Def also said, people are pissed about it and with good reason.
7422000	7426000	But in the end, if a game turns out good, I don't think people will mind that much at all.
7427000	7436000	Those are comments from Facebook and Google+, and it sounds like for the most part, everybody's pretty understanding, saying, hey, I would rather you take the time to get this right than put out something half-assed and unfinished.
7436000	7444000	So, I pretty much tend to agree. I do think the Kickstarter element lends an interesting perspective to it.
7445000	7451000	And I think it's going to make people, I think in the future, I think other Kickstarters will pay for this Kickstarter's problems.
7452000	7459000	Which is unfortunate, but I think it's just a reality. But I do agree with the perspective that as long as you're updating people and being very transparent with the reasons why,
7459000	7471000	which, to be fair, the developers are doing, then that is the extra step you have to give that maybe Sony doesn't have to give when they bump Uncharted back a little bit, because nobody's paid money for that yet.
7472000	7476000	Besides maybe a $5 pre-order, but that's a whole nother Oprah.
7477000	7478000	Alright, let's-
7479000	7480000	Did you say that's a whole nother Oprah?
7481000	7482000	Yes, I did. Have you never heard that expression?
7483000	7484000	No, I'm glad it's just not from my drinking.
7484000	7489000	Alright, another Oprah. Alright. Do you have anything you want to add to this chat, Shane?
7490000	7494000	I wasn't paying attention. I was looking at Power Rangers stuff. It was about delays.
7495000	7496000	On Mighty No. 9.
7497000	7498000	Miyamoto's quote isn't relevant anymore.
7499000	7500000	Oooh.
7501000	7502000	It's a pretty mighty statement.
7503000	7506000	A Mighty No. 9 statement? Well, then I wouldn't say it yet, because it's not out.
7507000	7512000	No, it's a solid quote. I'm not trying to be mean.
7513000	7514000	That's a first.
7515000	7521000	I feel like that quote came from a time when everything was still cartridge-based and you didn't get updates.
7522000	7529000	Now, if a game gets put out and people complain that it's not working or it's broken, patches come out.
7529000	7538000	And it's not ideal. It's not even good. But a rushed game does not necessarily mean a bad game anymore.
7539000	7549000	That happens with so many games nowadays. It's sad that it does, but if it's a game I really care about and the fundamentals are there,
7550000	7554000	I may not mind if it's rushed and has some problems, because it'll get a patch.
7554000	7560000	And if it doesn't get a patch, then I've been burned and I'm not going to support that series again, probably.
7561000	7563000	But that's a chance to take.
7564000	7566000	I don't know how I feel about the whole post-patch thing.
7567000	7568000	I don't like it, but it happens.
7569000	7577000	Patches are better when it's adding stuff to the game. Like when Final Fantasy XIV gets a content patch, which, by the way, there is a content patch already dated, which they needed to do.
7578000	7580000	They also dated it a month way too late.
7581000	7589000	But then Diablo has been getting some regular patches. That's good patching. Patching like Arkham Knight had to do to fix the game in the first place.
7590000	7599000	Yeah, but I mean, I assume at this point Mighty No. 9 is playable. It might not have the online features that they're having issues with, but it's playable.
7600000	7605000	The base game is there. The online features are not going to change anything if they patch that in.
7605000	7616000	It's just like, oh, now we have leaderboard support or whatever else. So if they released it now, it's still going to be the same game minus those online features they're having problems with.
7617000	7626000	So they could put it out and patch it later. They're not going to be like, oh, we're taking the extra time to do the online features and totally revamp the game so it's actually a good game.
7627000	7629000	Alright, let's get back into some other news. Loki.
7629000	7638000	Alright, so this is kind of cool. I was interested to see a little bit about the new, or I guess the cancelled Saints Row game.
7639000	7646000	This was one that I was actually anticipating on purchasing or got me to purchase the 3DS originally, but it never came out.
7647000	7654000	So this game is Saints Row Undercover. It was actually a PSP game. It was also ported over to the 3DS at one time.
7654000	7676000	And it's never made light of day. It's pretty unfinished. But what's kind of nice though is they actually released the playable ISO for the game and you can actually download it and play it on either a PSP emulator or a modded PSP.
7677000	7690000	So if you want to check it out, you can go to unseen64.net and slash Saints Row Undercover and actually download the ROM to go ahead and play that or the ISO.
7691000	7702000	And they give you kind of like the example of it. And I think it's pretty cool looking. You know, I used to play a lot of like Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories, and Vice City Stories on PSP.
7702000	7714000	So I'm kind of familiar with a lot of those games and everything. And this looks similar to that. I haven't actually played it yet. I'm assuming it's probably a little bit more rough around the edges since it's not finished.
7715000	7723000	But it looked promising. And hell, I mean, this even looks promising. I wish they'd kind of do like even like a Vita game or something like that would be pretty awesome.
7724000	7732000	Dart Tetsuya in chat says, I love unreleased prototypes getting released stories. Yeah, me too. Especially when they're, you know, free. Like in this case.
7733000	7743000	Yeah, and Volition was the one that released it too, which is pretty amazing. I mean, they're the ones that actually said, here you go. I mean, you know, I think it's pretty awesome.
7743000	7753000	And they have like a whole bunch of other stuff that you can they put out there as well, like the design documents for it, like a guide to play through and everything. That's pretty awesome.
7754000	7756000	So props to them. I hope that they're working on another Saints Row game.
7757000	7759000	That's kind of a fun little insight into how things work, you know?
7760000	7771000	Definitely. I will definitely be checking this out and downloading it. I watched a little bit of the video that they had for it. It was really buggy, but it's to be expected with a game that's not finished.
7772000	7778000	All right. Well, moving on to some stories about Street Fighter V. Are you excited about Street Fighter V, Shane? You played it at all?
7779000	7784000	I've played it. I played the beta. I played it at PlayStation Experience. My excitement's kind of waning though, I think.
7785000	7786000	Why is that?
7787000	7795000	My experience with it so far, I really liked IV, just the way it played. And this one, it just doesn't feel the same to me, which I know they're probably going for.
7795000	7800000	But I don't know. I'm not feeling it as much. We'll see when it actually releases.
7801000	7806000	All right. Well, some new information came out this week that there's some updates on the story mode.
7807000	7815000	Street Fighter V story mode. In the story mode, each character is going to have their own storyline. There's going to be illustrations by a famous Capcom artist, Benghis.
7816000	7819000	I hope I said that correctly. I'm not as familiar in the fighting game scene. Sorry, guys.
7820000	7826000	But it's going to be illustrated by him, and I remember seeing some of that in the beta. That kind of gave it a comic book feel, which was pretty cool.
7827000	7835000	Also, Street Fighter V is going to have a cinematic story expansion, which is via a free update this June. So here's an example of patches.
7836000	7840000	But you're getting the game, and that's what people want to play.
7841000	7845000	Interesting. I don't know if you're in chat, but a lot of folks were talking about what you were saying there, Shane.
7846000	7847000	Were they mad?
7847000	7848000	Some disagreement.
7849000	7851000	Well, that's fine. They can disagree with me all they want.
7852000	7860000	Anyway, the cinematic mode in June. The mode will tell an overall narrative which takes place between Street Fighter IV and III through rendered cutscenes.
7861000	7867000	They actually released a little trailer about that. By the way, there is one final beta test that just ended about an hour ago.
7868000	7872000	And that was something you could play, but it's too late to talk about it now, right?
7872000	7877000	Also, there will be a post-release character in March.
7878000	7886000	Street Fighter V will include a download pack that's going to have Alex, Guile, Balrog, Ibuki, Juri, and Urien.
7887000	7891000	They will be in the game later, but we don't know who comes when.
7892000	7899000	By the way, don't forget you can actually unlock characters with in-game currency, but there's also going to be a $30 package that unlocks each one as they appear.
7899000	7902000	So, it depends on how much you want to play the game.
7903000	7904000	There you go.
7905000	7909000	At least it's optional. I don't mind as long as they have a way to do it in-game and it's not ridiculous like,
7910000	7913000	Oh, I'm sorry. You're going to have to wait another four hours before you get enough currency to...
7914000	7915000	Oh, I'm sure it's going to be something ridiculous.
7916000	7919000	I don't know. Yeah, Heroes of the Storm. It takes you a long time to get the gold to unlock a character.
7920000	7923000	Well, yeah, but this is not the same company, so I don't know.
7923000	7931000	I'm not familiar with how Capcom does mobile games if they do have a lot of those and how they market it that way,
7932000	7939000	but it sounds like this is just going to be something that if you don't want to wait for everything to unlock, you can just unlock it.
7940000	7942000	Alright, let's move on to Shane.
7942000	7953000	Okay, so a Utah representative has introduced a new bill that amends Utah's criminal code to include doxxing, swatting, and denial of service attacks.
7954000	7956000	So, you know, you could get in trouble for that.
7957000	7965000	So, if you doxx somebody, it's a Class A or B misdemeanor depending on if it's your first offense or not.
7965000	7978000	And doxxing is where you publish people's personal home information on a website or somewhere that's not normally available.
7979000	7988000	I was going to say, don't get me wrong, something needs to be done about this phenomenon, so I can't believe I'm going to say this, but good job, Utah.
7989000	7995000	But at the same time, some things are sometimes supposed to be publicly accessible, like if it's a politician or something.
7996000	8004000	Yeah, but this has to do with the intent also. So, if the intent is to annoy, alarm, intimidate, offend, abuse, threaten, harass, frighten, or disrupt,
8005000	8010000	it says electronic communications of another. So, it's a little specific there.
8010000	8019000	But it's A or B depending on if it's your first offense or not. However, if you do it against a minor, it's a third degree felony, just like that.
8020000	8027000	Swatting, you automatically get a third degree felony for swatting somebody.
8027000	8042000	If the person you swat is injured, it becomes a second degree felony, and the person convicted will have to cover the treatment of any injury, including psychological, that are caused by the offense.
8043000	8053000	Finally, denial of service is the only one to actually be fully defined in this bill, apparently, but if you are found guilty, it is a third degree felony.
8054000	8061000	So, of all places, Utah really jumping on things that should be tackled by every state at this point.
8062000	8070000	SSJ100Matt says, good, these are all douchebaggery things that go on on the internet. It's a starting point. If it works well, then it will be quickly adopted across other states.
8071000	8086000	Hopefully it does, but I also don't see people in Utah really falling under this style of harassment. I would say if a place like California or New York did it, I think it would carry more weight.
8087000	8097000	Well, what happens when, let's say you're the guy in California, if a person from Utah doxxes you, then that person can still get in trouble because it's Utah law where they committed the crime, right?
8097000	8099000	I don't know, it doesn't tell me.
8100000	8106000	I think that's how it works. Maybe I need the lawyer guy's opinion, but I think that's how it works because the crime was committed in the state of Utah.
8107000	8112000	But if I'm in Utah, but my doxxer's in California, I'm not sure this law would apply.
8113000	8115000	Which is again why this should just be nationwide.
8115000	8128000	Well, it's a start. If it goes well, and obviously you want to make sure it's not, you know, like I said, there are some reasonable reasons why you have strangers' addresses publicly, but yes, intent is a lot of it.
8129000	8131000	So, all right.
8132000	8140000	Now if they could get something for like Xbox Live and people that are like 12 and chat and like punish them, that'd be great too.
8141000	8145000	Like I said, those are the ones that need to be spanked by their mother.
8146000	8149000	So anyway, let's move on. Loki.
8150000	8166000	So, they're finally getting rid of the Wii Street View, which I never understood as, like, that was what they were selling the Wii U on as, hey, you can go on Google Earth or Google Street View and use your Wii U tablet to look around.
8166000	8174000	Who gives a fuck? I mean, seriously, but it was something that they had. It was its own app and they are getting rid of it.
8175000	8181000	So if you want to actually check it out before they get rid of it, do so before March 31, 2016.
8184000	8190000	Well, I used the Wii Street View thing once or twice. It was kind of one of those, huh, that's kind of neat sort of things.
8191000	8200000	But it runs way faster on my PC. The Wii U internet is so slow. It takes forever to load anything. So I think it just works better on the PC.
8201000	8212000	It works pretty good for watching YouTube videos. Well, sort of. Although I did have an issue because I was playing some Thomas videos for my son that my boxy is like, no, I'm sorry, I can't play this whole thing.
8213000	8219000	And then the TV video for some reason just stopped working on the Wii U.
8220000	8225000	It totally set until I reset it again. But it's just like, oh, sorry, it'll only play on the gamepad.
8226000	8228000	It's weird. Yeah, it was really strange.
8229000	8239000	S. Jonah and Matt backing up a story here talking about the whole law in Utah. S. Jonah and Matt says, if it's a felony, I think a person can be extradited to that state. Not a lawyer, just watch Law and Order.
8240000	8247000	Oh my gosh, but I watch SVU, so this has nothing to do with like sex crimes or little kids or rape, so I don't get to...
8247000	8249000	You watch more Law and Order than anybody I know.
8250000	8252000	Yeah, I probably have seen every single episode of Law and Order.
8253000	8257000	How about Criminal Minds? We just got into that. Well, not just into that.
8258000	8260000	Only Law and Order. If it doesn't have bum bum.
8261000	8270000	I do watch some of the Chicago series, though, that they have on NBC now, like Chicago Fire and Chicago PD.
8271000	8278000	But that doesn't really deal with courtroom stuff. That's more like, oh, somebody got shot in the head and here's a picture of it, so let's go catch them.
8279000	8283000	Did you ever see the Law and Order episode that was loosely based on Anita Sarkeesian?
8284000	8285000	Oh yeah, that was a terrible episode.
8285000	8295000	Well, it was an absolute terrible episode, and my wife liked to be an asshole and rub it in my face and go, yep, see, this is what happens when you're a gamer.
8296000	8304000	Here's the thing with Law and Order, quick tangent. Law and Order, when they rip stories from the headlines, they do it pretty poorly for the most part.
8305000	8313000	They should just come up with their own stories. Those are better. I think the only one that was good that got ripped from the headlines was the Rihanna Chris Brown one.
8313000	8317000	Because in the end, the chick that was supposed to be Rihanna was murdered by Chris Brown.
8318000	8319000	That's not good.
8320000	8321000	But it was good for the story.
8322000	8335000	But here's the thing that was funny about that. It was so cheesy, it reminded me of hackers, like 90s hackers, where this is what hacking looks like. No, it's not.
8336000	8346000	I forgot that this was the thing. Brad from Pod Culture in our chat asking, what about Law and Order UK? Yes, it's a real show. Wasn't Jon Barrowman on that one? I could be wrong.
8347000	8348000	No, Jamie Bamber.
8349000	8351000	Oh, that's it, it was Jamie Bamber, the other extremely good looking UK guy.
8352000	8360000	And also, what's her name? Amanita from Sense8? The one girl's girlfriend. She was on that show as well.
8361000	8362000	Oh yeah, she was one of the Doctor's companions too.
8363000	8364000	I don't know that stuff.
8365000	8372000	I saw some of them. Because it was basically just the same stories. I'm pretty sure the season I watched was pretty much the same stories, just done over there.
8373000	8383000	Didn't really care for it as much. But I'm not usually a UK show person, except for Downton Abbey. Love Downton Abbey. That is like the best. I've watched it all, I will watch it again.
8384000	8385000	Downton Abbey is so good.
8386000	8388000	I wondered when you'd sneak that into this show.
8389000	8390000	I will sneak it into everything.
8390000	8397000	I talk to Shane just about every day, and so for the past two weeks, I'm hearing nothing but, Downton Abbey is so good.
8398000	8399000	It is so, so good.
8400000	8402000	I don't know if I could go out, Rob, because I have four episodes of Downton Abbey I'm going to watch today.
8403000	8404000	That's pretty much it.
8405000	8407000	I can't play Diablo. How am I going to watch Downton Abbey if I play Diablo with you?
8408000	8417000	I know, because I couldn't focus. I had to rewatch an episode, because I was trying to watch when we were playing one night. I was like, this is not working for me. I have to go back and watch it from the start.
8418000	8423000	Dark Tetsuya says, I still have to finish Sense8 if they're getting a second season. Yes you do.
8424000	8425000	They're filming.
8426000	8429000	I will get on board with what Shane says about that show, because that show is amazing.
8430000	8432000	Sense8 is so good. It's a little slow though, at first.
8433000	8437000	It is, but then by the time it ends, you're like, oh, this is what Heroes Reborn should have been.
8438000	8444000	I still think Heroes Reborn is passable to pretty good, not usually all that bad.
8445000	8446000	Better than season two.
8447000	8451000	Better than season two and three. And better than most of four, except for the end.
8452000	8457000	Kaijuto says, I like Law and Order North Korea. Is that a thing? I don't think that's a thing.
8458000	8462000	That's a thing that would be interesting. Believe it or not.
8463000	8469000	Hey, you know what else would be interesting? I would be all about this, because I like Mistwalker Studios and some of the stuff they did.
8470000	8476000	You know, they did The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and a game I never shut up about called Lost Odyssey.
8477000	8478000	I missed that game.
8479000	8484000	Which needs, let me say that again, needs to be on Xbox One backwards compatibility.
8485000	8487000	Like, is anybody listening?
8488000	8494000	I'm disappointed. I thought I still had it. I guess I must have sold it back or something, but I swear I still have that game.
8495000	8496000	But I can't find my discs.
8497000	8509000	Anyway, even though I doubt Lost Odyssey is ever getting a sequel, which is kind of tragic, it is still good to know that Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is the boss of Mistwalker, is working on a new game for consoles.
8510000	8515000	And if you don't know that name, you can kind of thank him for a little series called Final Fantasy.
8516000	8517000	I've never heard of that.
8518000	8522000	He was one of the lead creative folks on that game before he went to found Mistwalker.
8522000	8525000	Which might explain why Final Fantasy games have changed a bit in the last few years.
8526000	8530000	But anyhow, so Mistwalker does have a new game in development for consoles.
8531000	8540000	He offered a sneak peek showing some concept arts and just a little bit of detail when he was talking to students at the University of Hawaii's West Oahu campus.
8541000	8544000	Mistwalker's headquarters, by the way, are in Hawaii as well as Japan.
8545000	8546000	What a rough place to have students.
8547000	8551000	I mean, I get that Hawaii actually has a pretty decent gaming presence because of its proximity.
8552000	8558000	It's actually a really big Japanese tourist destination as well as the U.S. because Hawaii is only half the distance for the folks from Japan.
8559000	8563000	So, Hawaii is a very popular Japanese destination, so there's a lot of studios there.
8564000	8565000	I know Konami used to have an office in Hawaii, of course.
8566000	8567000	And I think there's some other companies there, too.
8568000	8571000	But anyway, some of this, of course, leaked to Twitter.
8572000	8578000	But then, actually, the whole presentation was on YouTube at one point, although it has since been taken down.
8578000	8581000	So, I don't know what happened there, but it disappeared.
8582000	8585000	So, yeah, we know it's going to be for consoles.
8586000	8591000	It's going to have that sketchy style that you're kind of used to seeing from Sakaguchi, and the graphics will be in 3D.
8592000	8594000	I'm assuming this is something we're going to hear out of E3.
8595000	8596000	Tinfoil hat.
8597000	8598000	I wonder if it's an NX game.
8599000	8606000	Because Mistwalker did put out that game on the Wii that they finally did release over here, and it was kind of one of those last great Wii games.
8606000	8607000	What was it?
8608000	8610000	The Last Story. It was part of that Operation Rainfall thing.
8611000	8612000	Oh, okay.
8613000	8619000	And Blue Dragon was on 3DS. I don't know, I could see that a little more than I could maybe PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
8620000	8629000	Because Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon were Xbox exclusives, because that was Microsoft's part of their ploy to be like,
8629000	8633000	Look, we're cool, we're hip, we're in with the Japanese RPG crowd, look at us.
8634000	8639000	It's a shame that Microsoft bought that, because Lost Odyssey on a different system would have actually sold.
8640000	8641000	Yeah, so fortunate.
8642000	8643000	But anyway, there you go.
8644000	8645000	It could be on, like, Lost Odyssey 6 by now.
8646000	8649000	I'm sad now, thinking about that.
8650000	8653000	Although, I don't know, the first game did kind of have a definitive ending, I don't know.
8654000	8655000	Well, just like Final Fantasy does.
8655000	8661000	That's true, it could have been a different character that was immortal or something.
8662000	8668000	I don't even remember the story of Lost Odyssey, I just know that the little memory things you find were just so depressing.
8669000	8673000	Yeah, it's like you're crying every five minutes playing that game, and then at the end of disc one, you're just like,
8674000	8676000	I cried as hard as I did at the end of Dancer in the Dark.
8676000	8678000	Alright, anyway, let's get to the mailbag.
8679000	8687000	Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your emails here on the show.
8692000	8700000	Dark Soccer usually dives in the mailbag to read your emails, but as she is absent tonight, I will be taking her place and reading the emails tonight.
8701000	8703000	We do have a few, so sit back and hold on.
8703000	8706000	First up, we have Martin from Belgium saying,
8707000	8712000	Greetings Sky, Dark Soccer, and Loki. I want to talk to you all about acceptance of video gaming for adults in everyday life.
8713000	8715000	Recently, one of my colleagues asked me what I like to do in my spare time.
8716000	8720000	When I mentioned video games, I got some funny looks from some fellow colleagues, even those my age. I am 29.
8721000	8722000	The same happens with my parents.
8723000	8726000	When I played Fallout 4 for a couple of hours on end over the Christmas break, my dad asked me,
8727000	8731000	Don't you ever get tired of that? However, my parents watch TV for hours as well.
8731000	8752000	It is clear to me that video gaming is still seen as childish or useless activity that adults should not engage in.
8753000	8754000	I thought we were getting past this, but we are not.
8755000	8759000	By contrast, watching movies, TV, sports are accepted ways of spending your free time.
8759000	8763000	Objectively speaking, these activities are just as useless and time-wasting.
8764000	8772000	Yet, when I am among non-gamers, I feel reluctant, even ashamed, to mention that I play video games.
8773000	8774000	I feel people will think I am immature or weird.
8775000	8777000	This makes me a bit angry because I know it is nothing to be ashamed of.
8778000	8780000	I think games are still misunderstood as a medium due to ignorance.
8781000	8786000	On the other hand, when I found out recently that some friends of mine play video games as well, this led to us bonding over it.
8787000	8788000	What are your opinions on this?
8789000	8793000	When do you think video games will finally get accepted in the mainstream the same way TV is?
8794000	8797000	Maybe it will take another generation of kids having grown up with them to make this happen.
8798000	8799000	I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this.
8800000	8801000	Join the podcast, as always, Martin.
8802000	8808000	What do you guys think? Video gaming being shamed by some generations?
8809000	8819000	My perspective on this has always been, well, this is something that is slowly going to get better as more and more people are growing up with video games.
8820000	8827000	The 30-somethings that are having kids today, we all grew up with Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System as the norm in a household.
8828000	8833000	Whereas maybe your parents give you the strange look because they didn't maybe have that all around.
8833000	8837000	But I don't know. What are your thoughts on this, Shane? Do you think...
8838000	8839000	Do you think...
8840000	8841000	Do I think...
8842000	8843000	I don't know.
8844000	8852000	Do you think that there's a way... I mean, I feel bad for him because he says he's embarrassed or whatever and part of me is like, well, fuck them if they don't like it.
8853000	8859000	That's, I mean, that's basically it. I mean, it's with any hobby. Not everyone's going to always understand everything.
8859000	8868000	Yeah, maybe sports is more widely accepted, but that's, I mean, again, that's still going to be specific to specific circles you run in.
8869000	8871000	Do you like sports, Rob? Do you care about them?
8872000	8879000	Hockey's okay, but all my hockey-loving friends went out to whine with me yesterday and they were even talking about stuff where I'm like, well, that sounds cool, but I don't...
8880000	8887000	Because they were talking about the all-star game and the whole vote for the guy that isn't actually one of the better hockey players and all the drama that went on with that.
8887000	8895000	But apparently he's a really nice guy. So anyway, so I couldn't really follow a lot of it, but I just kind of smiled and nodded. Oh, neat. That sounds neat.
8896000	8899000	I just think it doesn't matter if it's accepted or not. If you like it and it's not illegal...
8900000	8901000	Did your mic go off? You're suddenly not coming through.
8902000	8903000	No.
8904000	8905000	Oh, that was weird. Go ahead.
8905000	8918000	I think that if you like it and it's not illegal and it's not hurting anybody, then who cares if it's accepted or not? Everybody's going to have likes that aren't accepted or popular, so who cares?
8919000	8920000	Well, it's kind of like you and Power Rangers.
8921000	8922000	Exactly.
8922000	8929000	I don't quote unquote get it and I don't like Power Rangers the way you do, but I don't have a problem. It seems to make you happy.
8930000	8942000	And the toy hunting and all that stuff is something you really seem to enjoy. And the fact that you have now finally started your own podcast, that part of it makes me very happy and excited for you because now that's something we both have in common.
8943000	8950000	Yeah. So it's exactly that same thing. So I wouldn't even worry about it. So what if they don't understand?
8950000	8957000	You don't understand why your parents can just sit there and watch TV for hours on end.
8958000	8961000	Unless they're watching Downton Abbey, then maybe you should learn to understand.
8962000	8969000	Oh my gosh. Spend some quality time with them if they're watching Downton Abbey. You will not regret it. It is so good.
8970000	8974000	Dungeon Buster says, I don't get why people play certain things, but why give them grief over it?
8974000	8984000	Kaijuto with an interesting perspective here that you may not want to hear. Video games will get respect when the loud majority of gamers stop acting like self entitled assholes.
8985000	8990000	I don't know if they'll get respect, but I would like that just to happen. Because it is really annoying.
8991000	9000000	Fifth Dream in chat says, grownups watch Disney movies. Fuck everything else. Do it loud and proud, but do what you enjoy. It's not hurting anyone.
9001000	9004000	If someone thinks something you do is stupid, find out what they do. Realize they are stupid.
9005000	9012000	Exactly. Or maybe instead of realizing they're stupid, find out what they do. Maybe you'll like it.
9013000	9016000	I'm not a big sports guy. I love watching baseball.
9017000	9020000	But even that probably took something. Did you always love baseball?
9021000	9022000	When I was a kid I did.
9023000	9025000	I thought that was something you got turned on to as an adult.
9026000	9037000	No. It just resurfaced. But like last night I was hanging out with Flacco Jones and his wife and Extifer and we were like there's nothing we could watch on TV because the kids were up.
9038000	9043000	But then Flacco Jones and I were watching college basketball and got into that because I forgot, hey, college basketball is really fun.
9043000	9052000	So you may think it's stupid, but then just give it a shot and I guess everybody needs to do that.
9053000	9059000	Then we wouldn't have this problem that your emailer said, I don't remember your name, I'm sorry. I'm on like my fourth glass of wine.
9060000	9061000	It was Martin.
9062000	9063000	Yes, Martin.
9064000	9065000	Or like wine. Just try it.
9066000	9067000	Except for reds.
9068000	9069000	They taste like shoes.
9069000	9070000	Moving on.
9071000	9075000	Raginator emails us. Hi all, it's Raginator again. I just want to give everyone a quick heads up.
9076000	9086000	There's a strong possibility I may break down and buy my new PC slightly ahead of schedule, meaning that I might buy it next month rather than waiting until April if only because, to be honest, I'm getting just a tad impatient waiting and saving up.
9087000	9096000	Assuming that I do go this route, it'll mean that I'll have a little less money to work with and hence I won't be able to buy quite as nice of a PC, but the tradeoff will be that I'll be back to my usual routine that much quicker.
9097000	9102000	Even if I do this, my internet won't be turned back on until March 1st, but still, any thoughts?
9103000	9113000	I would say you do have to kind of weigh the pros and cons, and I think, again, I thought we talked about this a couple weeks ago when you emailed about how much power should you put in your computer.
9114000	9120000	I think you need to figure out what's the acceptable computer, and not the bare minimum, but the acceptable computer for the games you want to play.
9121000	9132000	You, I know, email the show a lot and talk about the trading card games like Magic the Gathering, so figure out what kind of system you need to play those games and get that, and then I think you'll be fine.
9133000	9149000	Although, you've mentioned wanting to play Final Fantasy XIV, which you might need a little bit beefier of a computer to play something like that, so I think you need to figure out what are the games you want to play most of all, and make sure your computer can play at least that and maybe a little extra, just so you're ready for whatever comes next.
9150000	9173000	I would say just wait. Wait till your original plan, because if you're saying April at that point, that would be two months before E3 comes rolling around, and they're going to announce stuff that you're going to see is really cool, and if you skimped on your computer because you couldn't wait the extra couple months just to make it better, you might be kicking yourself later and have to pay even more to play those new games that you see.
9174000	9179000	I think that's a good perspective on it as well, is that if it's only two months, eh, that's not that big a deal, right?
9180000	9190000	By the way, Fifth Dream in our chat wants to know, why does Shane know what shoes taste like? That's the question of the night. How do you know what shoes taste like? Do you have like a shoe fetish thing?
9191000	9201000	No, that's gross. No, it tastes like the way rubber soles smell. So that's why I say it tastes like shoes.
9202000	9207000	Is it kind of like, that's how you know what gasoline tastes like? Because it has such a strong smell, it probably tastes like that.
9207000	9216000	If you know what it smells like, you know what it tastes like. Because your taste is tied in with your smell. So that's how you know what something tastes like.
9217000	9224000	I'm sure I know what the taste of dog shit is, based on the smell of dog shit. Doesn't mean I've actually munched on dog shit.
9225000	9228000	So the point of the story is, you've eaten gasoline.
9229000	9231000	Oh, I wish, thanks. I love the smell.
9232000	9235000	That's like an episode of My Strange Addiction.
9235000	9246000	Yeah, it probably would be. Like I say, gasoline and coffee are the same thing. They both smell really good, but they both are probably disgusting. Well, coffee is disgusting, but I'm sure gasoline is too.
9247000	9256000	Moving on. From YYR. Hello, LR. Last week Rob mentioned the Super Nintendo era and all of its classics as being the sort of thing we might never see again.
9257000	9262000	I agree, and the reason has to do with both the colossal market and the changing way we absorb our entertainment.
9262000	9269000	If you think back to the Nintendo and Genesis and Super Nintendo and perhaps even a generation or two ahead of that, you'll remember that we had our games drip fed to us.
9270000	9277000	Game development was expensive and so was building cartridges. When a new game came out in the 90s, people noticed because only a few games came out each week.
9278000	9284000	Just as an aside, the NES artificially limited that too because they limited publishers as to how many games they could put out in the year.
9284000	9289000	And it's Ultra. Yeah, which is why we have Ultra Games, which was just Konami's side company basically.
9290000	9298000	But they did that to prevent what happened on the Atari 2600 where everybody was fucking making 2600 games and it was all this commercial garbage.
9299000	9307000	E.T. didn't kill the industry. Oh my gosh, remember I guess when Konami made so many games they had to have a different label for them? That's ridiculous to think about now.
9308000	9318000	Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, it was possible to play every new game and trivial to at least be aware of every release. I could make recommendations to people on platforms I didn't even own.
9319000	9324000	Hop on Steam and you'll find that approximately 80 new games released in the last 7 days. This is in January.
9325000	9331000	We now literally have thousands of choices at any given moment, not even counting the games we grew up with and can go back to at any time.
9331000	9338000	The huge market means that there is literally something for everyone. If a game isn't the best possible fit for your taste, there is most probably something else that is.
9339000	9343000	New genres are seemingly coming out of nowhere and indie developers are covering bases we don't even know about yet.
9344000	9349000	If you add all this up, we get this fact. The days where we are playing the same games together are pretty much history.
9350000	9354000	That I think is one of the defining differences between current gaming and several generations ago.
9354000	9362000	Because if you ask 100 random gamers in their 30s to put together a Super Nintendo Top 10 list, I would imagine that many of them will look similar.
9363000	9370000	If you ask 100 random gamers in their 30s to put together a Top 10 of 2015 list, I anticipate 100 different lists without much in common.
9371000	9375000	I don't know if I get your point, but I don't know if I would totally agree with that.
9376000	9381000	Because Jamie and I had some really similar lists for 2015. Or no, Shane and I. I don't know.
9382000	9386000	Yeah, you, me, and Jim all had like two of the same games on them.
9387000	9396000	But I do get the point. I'm not trying to dismiss the point. I'm just trying to say I do feel like there are some games that still kind of buck the trend and everybody knows about them.
9396000	9402000	Even if they haven't necessarily played them. Like even Undertale from the indie side. Everybody knows about that game even if they haven't played it yet.
9403000	9408000	So, you know, there's still some of that. Fallout 4, everybody fucking knows that happened, right?
9409000	9415000	So, I mean, just, you know, again, I don't disagree. I'm not sure it's as black and white as that.
9416000	9424000	It's kind of like what's happening now with TV. After an episode of my favorite series aired, I used to be able to discuss it with friends or folks at work the next day.
9424000	9433000	Nowadays, whenever I ask friends if they saw the latest Gotham or Blacklist or what have you, they either say, what's that? Or, oh, I haven't downloaded it yet. Or, is that on Netflix?
9434000	9443000	Everyone gets their entertainment individually and I think games are moving in the same direction. There is more choice than ever, but it's always going to feel different from the way it did years ago.
9444000	9445000	Get off my lawn, YYR.
9445000	9452000	Hmm. It was an interesting email. It's definitely changed a lot, especially with the cartridge.
9453000	9460000	PC development has always kind of been there, but there wasn't a place where you could, you still had to go to a store to buy PC games.
9461000	9468000	Even though there was a ton of stuff available on PC, Commodore, and all that stuff, you still had to go to a store and buy them.
9468000	9476000	Now you can get it all at your fingertips. And that's the common thread between Steam and Netflix, is that you can consume as you want.
9477000	9484000	We're becoming that instant gratification society. So, anyway, I still like that perspective, so thank you for the email.
9485000	9489000	We have one last email tonight from ActDeft.
9490000	9494000	Hi, it's your friendly neighborhood Mexican and avid amiibo collector, ActDeft.
9494000	9506000	It's been a while since I've written an email, but after listening to the last episode and Loki's rant about amiibo, before anyone starts calling me a fanboy, let me state that I do agree with what Loki said to some extent, and his points are totally valid.
9507000	9511000	But at the same time, I cannot help but probably play devil's advocate and defend my passion.
9512000	9516000	As we all know, the amiibo craze started with the Smash amiibo, which are probably the most complete amiibo there is.
9517000	9523000	They work with a lot of games unlocking stuff, not to mention that training amiibo in Smash is really fun and also a competitive scene.
9524000	9531000	I personally know because I've participated and hosted tournaments locally, and know of other players that do it too. I really don't see anyone having problems with these amiibo in particular.
9532000	9538000	The Mario Party amiibo also work with most of the games. They're pretty much like the Smash ones, but only with Mario characters.
9539000	9546000	Since amiibo can only hold one game info or save stored in them, and Mario Party having a somewhat important usage of amiibo, I can see why these are created.
9547000	9551000	Especially for people that wanted to play both without erasing their amiibo data from another game.
9551000	9558000	Granted, I can see why people see them as cash grabs, gold and silver Mario, but in the end, if you're not into collecting these, you can easily forget about them.
9559000	9564000	The rest of the amiibo work pretty much the same, to be honest, unlocking, saving progress, and custom characters.
9565000	9567000	They're not all that different and work with their respective game, including Shovel Knight.
9568000	9573000	Of course, many have a problem with the Shovel Knight amiibo unlocking an important mode in the game, co-op, but I don't see it as one.
9574000	9576000	Shovel Knight is, for the most part, a single player game.
9576000	9582000	Also, it started as a Nintendo console exclusive, and yes, I know it also came on PC at the same time, but it was console exclusive.
9583000	9589000	Not to mention that people kind of got mad that the Nintendo version of Shovel Knight didn't get an exclusive boss or level like Sony's or Microsoft's.
9590000	9595000	So the amiibo came in place, and what better console to adopt co-op than on Nintendo's, king of same-couch multiplayer.
9596000	9606000	And again, this amiibo works like all others. It's not only a method of unlocking co-op, but you can also save a custom Shovel Knight character that it levels up and gets custom powers and such.
9607000	9612000	I think the amiibo is fantastic, both in how the figure looks, but also how it works in the game.
9613000	9620000	Though I see why anybody would be mad about it. Not everyone wants to pay 13 bucks to have access to something that should have probably been in the game as free DLC or something.
9620000	9625000	But I still think the amiibo has that added value that makes it worth paying for it and using it on the game.
9626000	9630000	And again, the figure looks really great, and thankfully it's not hard to obtain either like most amiibo nowadays.
9631000	9635000	Well that's it for this email. Sorry if it was long, but I had to speak out about this. Thanks for reading.
9636000	9644000	P.S. Like seriously, have you seen the price of some of the amiibo on Amazon? Specifically the Animal Crossing ones. They're crazy cheap. Like holy fuck.
9645000	9646000	That's from MacDeft.
9647000	9652000	I got a whole bunch of Animal Crossing amiibo this week actually. I bought the entire second wave.
9653000	9660000	Because I had to have Blathers and Celeste, and you know I had to have Resetti, so I was just like what the hell, I'll get Kix too.
9661000	9662000	Yeah, you're missing the best one, which is Kix.
9663000	9667000	Yeah, so I was like what the hell, I'll get him too. So I bought all those amiibo this week.
9668000	9672000	Loki, anything you want to say to that? I don't know. You were the one that had some strong feelings on amiibo?
9672000	9686000	I still think that the amount of use they have for the amiibos is pretty limited. I understand that you can use them in other games, but their uses are basically unlocking something.
9687000	9694000	It's unlocking some items or something. It's not like, I think very innovative I guess.
9694000	9703000	To me it reminds me of some of these systems when they launch, like the portable systems or even with the Wii and stuff, where they don't really know what to do with them.
9704000	9713000	And so they just kind of use it in a very generic kind of gimmicky way. And that's sort of what I'm seeing with these amiibos. They're not really being used in a meaningful way.
9714000	9721000	The training partners are pretty cool in Smash, but aside from that I don't really see the point with a lot of them.
9721000	9729000	It's cool if you want to collect the characters because they look nice, but it's not really adding a lot of functionality to games I think.
9730000	9739000	Alright, well that's going to do it for our emails this week. You should send us some emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
9740000	9746000	We're going to get to a couple more news stories here and then your calls at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
9746000	9754000	But first, we have to get to the FUs of the week, where we rant. Why? Because we get ranty sometimes.
9770000	9773000	Shane, since Jamie's not here, do you want to start us off tonight with your FU?
9773000	9776000	Sure, FU to you and your show role.
9777000	9778000	Why?
9779000	9781000	Because you left off a very important story for the day.
9782000	9783000	Well then you can put in the last minute stories.
9784000	9785000	Alright. Loki?
9786000	9804000	My wife still insists it's the stomach flu, but seeing as I didn't throw up, I didn't have any other symptoms, I just got very sick all of a sudden and that was that.
9805000	9809000	I'm blaming the food that I ate during lunch because I kind of felt eh after that.
9809000	9815000	So yeah, on Tuesday I ate some food from McDonald's and it was pretty disgusting as usual, but you know, it's quick.
9816000	9822000	And so driving home I felt very, very fucking nauseous to the point where I'm like, oh shit, I better pull over because I'm going to vomit.
9823000	9831000	And so I pulled over to like a gas station and apparently at that point I was like getting almost to the point where I'm passing out from the nausea.
9832000	9836000	And so I actually fell over into a parking lot and kind of scraped my leg up and stuff doing that.
9837000	9838000	Wow.
9838000	9842000	But then it passed. It just went away. I didn't like throw up or anything. It was just really weird.
9843000	9845000	But I blame McDonald's for that and so I'm not eating McDonald's anymore.
9846000	9849000	I'm glad I'm not the only one that's like randomly fainting and passing out.
9850000	9859000	Well it wasn't fainting. It wasn't like I was just very disoriented, like dizzy and just, I was trying to make, I was trying not to throw up in my car and so I stepped out and I was like, okay, I'm going to go use their bathroom to do that.
9859000	9872000	I'm like, there's no way I'm going to get over there. So I like walked over the curb, but I just, my balance was just not there and so I kind of, you know, I don't know, didn't like fall and hurt my head or anything, but I just, I did scrape my knee and that was about it.
9873000	9878000	It burnt my pants, which sucks because I don't really have a good pair of jeans anymore.
9879000	9880000	Aww.
9880000	9881000	Well I bought some today, but you know.
9882000	9897000	My FU of the Week goes to the fact that I've been like sick for about a week now and it caused me to miss last week's show and I'm feeling a little worn down even after, like I'm like, okay, we're at the end of the show. It's about time for this to wrap up because I'm feeling a little worn down.
9898000	9904000	But a big thank you to the fact that Sanrio just walked out in the kitchen and she's never here during the show. This is, this is a first.
9904000	9919000	I guess she thinks that because Alan just got home, Alan has something for her. I don't know. But Alan had a treat for me, that's for sure. He just brought into the studio red velvet Oreos and I'm going to make Shane try one. Do you like red velvet?
9920000	9921000	It's just red chocolate.
9922000	9923000	It's just red chocolate, but you got to try one.
9924000	9925000	The Oreos are just cream cheese.
9926000	9931000	And Alan says the Oreos are just cream cheese, so. Alright, let's get to a story real quick so I can rip open this bag of Oreos. Loki.
9931000	9939000	Alright, so TBS is going to be bringing E-League, which is, I think this was originally announced by Shaquille O'Neal during the game awards.
9940000	9950000	And so it's going to take place. They're going to have two seasons throughout the year. They're going to last ten weeks long and consist of like a six, six regular or six week regular season.
9951000	9965000	And a bi-week and a one-week wildcard qualifier around two weeks playoff. And the first season will feature, I guess, Counter Strike Global Offensive.
9966000	9975000	And they're going to have some of the, I'm not sure if they're going to have some of the actual people in there. I don't know how they're setting up the teams or anything for that.
9975000	9985000	But apparently it's going to debut on TBS as well as other digital platforms May 24th. I don't know.
9986000	10001000	Neat I guess. I'd be kind of interested to see what it looks like and how they're setting up the teams. If they're just using existing Counter Strike CSGO teams or if they're going to have like create their own teams for this league type thing.
10001000	10006000	Okay. I hope they don't screw it up on TV.
10007000	10009000	I don't know. We'll see.
10010000	10020000	Alright. One more story for you guys. And I don't, why is this making the rounds again? I swear to God, we talked about this ad nauseam on the show like ten years ago.
10021000	10028000	But for some reason, this is all around the blogs this week. And I think for some reason we have the Huffington Post to blame for this, I think is what's going on here.
10028000	10042000	But apparently it is, is it confirmed? I don't know. I guess the people that were credited with writing the music for Sonic 3 have revealed that Michael Jackson did help out on the soundtrack.
10043000	10047000	So this, is this like their archives that you're getting this news from?
10048000	10050000	It's their blog.
10051000	10054000	I'm trying to see what this is from here real quick.
10054000	10064000	No, Huffington Post ran it on January 25th. So they ran it this week and they ran this whole thing about trying to conclusively prove that yes, Michael Jackson did work on this.
10065000	10073000	And I thought we had finished this years ago that yes, it was done. But maybe it was just that we had some really strong evidence.
10073000	10085000	And so it was just like yes, we pretty much decided it. But now the actual people that made the music in Sonic came out and said yes, we did use samples made from Jackson's beatboxing.
10086000	10091000	We chop it up, we use it in his cues. There were other signature Michaelisms and so forth.
10092000	10096000	So I think that's the fact, the fact that it is actually confirmed, that's the news.
10096000	10103000	And that they had this interview with some of the people behind the game. But we always knew, didn't we guys?
10104000	10107000	Yes, from the news about it a long time ago.
10108000	10115000	Alright, so that's all I'm going to say on it then. I am going to open up the phones. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10116000	10122000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Meanwhile, we'll get to some last minute stories and Shane, you seem deeply offended that there's something missing.
10122000	10126000	It's somebody's 17th birthday today.
10127000	10128000	Uh oh, who's?
10129000	10130000	Silent Hill 1.
10131000	10133000	Oh, I didn't even realize that was a game that had come out in January.
10134000	10141000	Yep, January 31st, 1999. It's Silent Hill's birthday. And let's celebrate it by not playing any recent games because they weren't good.
10142000	10143000	Except for P.T. by your tongue.
10144000	10146000	Which, that's Silent Hill's...
10147000	10149000	Well happy birthday Silent Hill, rest in peace.
10149000	10153000	Yeah, pretty much. We miss you a lot. Like a lot.
10154000	10158000	Why don't we, in tribute, watch the second movie? Wouldn't that be a great way?
10159000	10160000	No, that is such a bad movie.
10161000	10162000	I have yet to see the second movie.
10163000	10164000	Don't watch that.
10165000	10166000	I still want to do it. I still want to see it.
10167000	10174000	Alright, again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, I'm looking at our chatroom for some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
10174000	10185000	MXC is trying to say, the article is trying to prove that his music is in the final game. Well, I think they actually interviewed the folks and got the conclusiveness that yes, he was a part of that game.
10186000	10187000	I've got some...
10188000	10189000	Last minute story, Logan?
10190000	10194000	Yeah, it's stupid. I don't even... Just looking at this, I'm like, this is stupid.
10195000	10196000	That's okay, you've heard this show.
10196000	10206000	This is totally, like, this is totally rumor, okay, but there is a rumor for the NX that, guess what, Super Smash Brothers will be a launch title.
10209000	10219000	Launch title? I don't know about that. Launch title's pushing it. I mean, maybe they'll adapt the 3DS or Wii U version, but I don't know how people would feel about that.
10220000	10221000	No, it's too soon.
10221000	10230000	Granted, Smash Brothers has been on every Nintendo console, home console anyway, since, what, Nintendo 64, because there was a version on 64, GameCube, Wii, Wii U.
10231000	10233000	So, I mean, it's in better shape than, say, F-Zero.
10234000	10235000	Cry, cry.
10236000	10244000	So, I think it's inevitable there will be one on NX at some point, but I don't think that necessarily means right away. It seemed too soon.
10244000	10245000	Yeah.
10247000	10252000	And even in chat, Kaijuto says, doubt it. Dr. Tetsuya says, I don't know if I buy that either.
10253000	10257000	And Orangewrite says, I think the only way is that if it's a straight up port of the Wii U version.
10258000	10265000	Well, you know, they didn't, they never really did name that game. It's just Super Smash Brothers for Wii, Wii U, excuse me, and Super Smash Brothers for 3DS.
10266000	10270000	So, they could just do Super Smash Brothers for NX, or whatever, obviously, they're not gonna call it NX, but whatever they call it.
10270000	10277000	So, this is pretty cool. There's someone working on a mod for Fallout New Vegas to add multiplayer to the game.
10278000	10279000	This always happens with Bethesda games.
10280000	10292000	They did the same thing for Skyrim. I don't remember what the progress is on that, but this one they've got now for New Vegas. I mean, I guess it's kind of the same type of thing, same engine, basically.
10293000	10297000	Alright, one more call for phone calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
10297000	10307000	So, the ever eloquent grandpa from Hoard House and the Starboard Power Coupling podcast just texted me, because you were just talking about birthdays, right?
10308000	10318000	So, he just sent me this meme, and it says, it has a picture of Nintendo 64 cartridges, and it says, Nintendo 64 turned 18 this month, now you can legally blow the cartridges.
10319000	10320000	That's funny.
10321000	10329000	That, of course, and the ever eloquent grandpa, Starboard Power Coupling podcast, where he goes by Captain Matt, but he'll always be grandpa to me.
10330000	10337000	That's very good timing. In fact, I'm even gonna tell him. I just read this meme on air. See what he has to say for that.
10339000	10340000	Is that it for stories, you guys?
10341000	10342000	I think so.
10343000	10348000	Alright, I'll put out one more call for calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype. Call for calls.
10350000	10355000	Uh, let's see. Act F says, Super Smash Brothers for Game Boy next.
10356000	10357000	Darktacuus says, didn't someone make that already?
10358000	10359000	Yeah, I think they did like a demake of that.
10360000	10366000	I know the Game Boy systems didn't have them, but now the 3DS handheld has one, but there you go.
10367000	10370000	AkumaJP in chat says, news, Mario will be on the NX.
10371000	10374000	Well, you know what's interesting about that though? Would they necessarily do a 2D Mario?
10374000	10382000	Because Mario Maker I sort of see as kind of the final, I mean, now you can make all the 2D Mario games you want.
10383000	10384000	I mean, it would have to be something kind of different.
10385000	10388000	No, because you would still need like new elements. It's just rehashing the old elements.
10389000	10390000	I guess.
10391000	10392000	But they also said that they were moving away from the 2D Mario now.
10393000	10396000	Well, I mean, but Mario games can also be Galaxy.
10397000	10399000	Can we get a new Paper Mario game? Super Paper Mario is fucking awesome.
10400000	10402000	Mario 3D World was pretty cool.
10402000	10405000	So Super Paper Mario 2 would be awesome.
10406000	10411000	Alright, well our phones are not lighting up. I guess the callers are shy tonight. I don't know. Sometimes we don't get them.
10412000	10414000	So I've closed up the Skype line. No calls tonight. Sad face.
10415000	10417000	I guess too many people were watching Grease live.
10418000	10422000	Or that's what happens when we take a week off is that people forget we're here.
10423000	10425000	So that's why I hate missing a show, but it is what it is.
10426000	10428000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight. We really appreciate it.
10428000	10432000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10433000	10435000	Help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.
10436000	10438000	Maybe your friend will want to call into the show next week.
10439000	10444000	So, you know, help us spread the word because we don't have any big website or ad campaign to back us up.
10445000	10446000	So we really appreciate the word of mouth.
10447000	10449000	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought here in studio.
10450000	10453000	Shane, I want to thank you for being on the show, filling in last minute.
10454000	10456000	Being enthusiastic, wine probably helps.
10456000	10459000	And filling in the last minute with Dark Soccer Stories. Thank you so much for being here.
10460000	10463000	Welcome. Except for that cat story. You're not welcome for that.
10464000	10465000	You didn't really read it anyway.
10466000	10467000	Because nothing needed to be read about.
10468000	10470000	Good luck with your podcast. I'm seriously happy for you on that. That's really wonderful.
10471000	10472000	Thank you.
10473000	10474000	Do you want to tell people how to listen to it?
10475000	10482000	It's called Ranger Pride. You can find it on Twitter. Our Twitter is at Ranger Pride Cast.
10482000	10489000	C-A-S-T. It's also on iTunes. Just look up Ranger Pride. And we will have a Facebook soon.
10490000	10496000	We start our weekly episodes next week. And we'll be talking about the season premiere of Dino Supercharge.
10497000	10498000	Possibly among other things.
10499000	10503000	But we have like eight other episodes you can listen to now. With episode five being like the absolute best.
10504000	10505000	But it's like a two hour show.
10506000	10507000	Because you interviewed one of the other Ranger podcasters.
10508000	10509000	Yes. Yes we did.
10510000	10511000	Awesome.
10512000	10515000	You know I listened to the first. I haven't listened to anything but the first episode. I listened to a part of it.
10516000	10521000	And I. Up until the part where you were discussing the episode I was like alright. This seems kind of fun. This seems cool.
10522000	10527000	So. I don't know. Maybe you might convince me to watch an episode of Power Rangers at some point. Maybe. Maybe.
10528000	10529000	Again. You've done it before.
10530000	10534000	I did. I watched the trains one. But that wasn't. You don't talk about that because it's a Japanese one right? Or do you?
10535000	10538000	Well no. Not yet. We may at some point. But the trains aren't coming over here.
10539000	10541000	So we're all. Me and Spike are pretty depressed about that.
10542000	10544000	Aww. Let's just not bring it up please. Sorry. Sorry about that.
10545000	10547000	Let's do a cross licensing thing with Thomas the Tank.
10548000	10551000	See. Thomas the Tank engine is like popular. I don't get it. But whatever.
10552000	10557000	Thomas the Tank. I mean. I swear to God. I've watched enough of that to like know way too much about that show.
10558000	10564000	Like they have their own like their own like sentient beings. But they have people that drive them.
10565000	10571000	And so. Are the drivers just fucking retarded. Because they go like through. They have the dumbest fucking ideas.
10572000	10573000	All the time.
10575000	10580000	Alright. Shane. Did you have any last thoughts. Final. Final thoughts for us tonight.
10581000	10585000	I'm still hungry. But those Oreos were pretty good. Like I'm gonna get another one.
10586000	10587000	Alright. Regardless if you say I can or not.
10588000	10591000	Shane. You're pretty agreeing with me tonight. You like the wine. You like the cookies.
10592000	10593000	Well. Two for two tonight. The wine is just amazing.
10594000	10595000	The wine's making it more agreeable.
10596000	10598000	That's true. Probably. Probably right. That's probably right.
10598000	10603000	Then I'll have to be like. What's a game Shane hates. I'll be like. We'll play this game and you're gonna like it this time.
10604000	10606000	Yeah. We're gonna play Ni No Kuni and you're gonna really enjoy it this time Shane.
10607000	10608000	Okay. Can I get wine.
10609000	10611000	Alright. Thank you for being here.
10612000	10616000	My final thought for the night is. I'm sad we didn't get any calls. But act deft is true in chat.
10617000	10621000	That we did have emails to compensate for tonight. And my voice is about hit it's end.
10622000	10625000	So I'm ready for tonight's show to end. But thank you all for being here and listening. I really really do appreciate it.
10625000	10628000	And I'll hopefully be at 100 percent next week.
10629000	10630000	Loki. Last but not least. Your final thought tonight.
10631000	10638000	My final thought is I was just playing my game during the break and I don't really know where I'm going with it anymore.
10639000	10642000	So I think I'm just gonna finish what I have and just be done with it.
10643000	10650000	Because I had like good ideas for it and it just unfortunately it's. It's not quite what I wanted it to be.
10651000	10654000	And so I just want to work on something else at this point. Just get it done.
10655000	10661000	Alright. That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back next week to do it all again.
10662000	10664000	Hopefully Dark Soccer is better and she's with us next week. I'm sure she will be.
10665000	10668000	So stay tuned for that. And East Coast look out. I'll be seeing you in a few weeks at MAGFest.
10669000	10670000	Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time.
