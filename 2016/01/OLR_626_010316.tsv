7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	Another year of making your gaming memories come true has finally arrived. We're getting this year started with the explosive mod announcement everyone has been waiting for, an homage to a recently departed Rockstar, and more.
22000	27000	OLR 2016 starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	50000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight live on January the 3rd of 2016, our first episode of 2016, with episode number 626 of our show.
50000	61000	Joining you here live in our studio in Sacramento, California are myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me in the studio, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
61000	62000	I need a wheelbarrow.
62000	63000	A what? A wheelbarrow?
63000	64000	Yeah.
64000	65000	For what? What are you going to haul out of here?
65000	68000	Roll me around the house, because I'm all full of udon.
68000	69000	Oh, because you've been eaten.
69000	70000	Noms.
70000	72000	Usually dinner time, right before OLR.
72000	73000	So good.
74000	76000	Hey, guess what? Tonight is episode 626, right?
76000	77000	Chicken butt.
77000	81000	Tonight is episode 626. It's my birthday. It's my birthday show.
81000	85000	Oh yeah, I got you something.
85000	88000	Oh, yay! Cool, I got a present for my birthday show.
88000	89000	I got Loki something too.
89000	96000	What? Hey, Loki doesn't get presents on my birthday show. Alright, while she's digging, I will also introduce over there, Techmaster Loki.
96000	97000	Hi.
97000	99000	Hi, happy birthday to both of us, I guess, right?
99000	100000	I guess, yeah.
100000	102000	Oh, this must be like a holiday thing.
102000	103000	Oh, sorry.
103000	109000	I'd love to. Oh, cool. I'll take Loki's present as well, since Dark Sakura just threw it at me.
109000	113000	I threw it to him, and physics intervened.
113000	121000	First off, since this is radio, I'll just say Dark Sakura put a little penguin sticker, and she made out the card to the whole family.
121000	123000	She put to Rob, Alan, and Sanrio.
123000	124000	Yes.
124000	125000	Which I love that, so.
125000	129000	I might have just put Matt and Ellie on there, but I don't know how well your kids read.
130000	133000	They don't read very well, but that's alright. I can read too.
133000	135000	Aww, thank you for the card, it's very lovely.
135000	136000	Welcome.
136000	139000	Yay, there, that was great radio, live on air, opening gifts.
139000	140000	We need to read your cards to people.
140000	141000	Good times.
141000	147000	When I hear a story, once upon a time, I peed on your tree just now. Hope all of your holiday stories are happy.
147000	153000	Mine says jingle all the way, and then when you open it, it says nobody likes a half-assed jingler.
153000	162000	Now, if this had been Grandpa from Hoard House that had got me this card, I'd open it up and it would say nobody likes a half-assed, and that would be crossed out and it would say ginger.
162000	165000	So, if you know Grandpa and his sense of humor.
165000	166000	Yes.
166000	167000	There it is.
167000	169000	Although I was thinking like a dingle or something.
170000	173000	Alright, so did you have a good New Year, Dark Sakura?
173000	174000	Well enough.
174000	178000	Yeah, I know you guys had a little festive get together, play some games and stuff.
178000	179000	Yes, we played games.
179000	180000	Yay.
180000	181000	I hurt myself.
181000	183000	That's always a good way to ring in the New Year with video games.
183000	184000	And pain.
184000	193000	Have you seen that meme that's floating around the internet where it says the gamer on New Year's Day and it's like 11.50 PM and dude staring at the computer gaming.
193000	196000	This is 11.59 PM, dude staring at the computer gaming.
196000	199000	And then midnight, he's holding up a firework and then 12.01, back to the computer.
199000	202000	So it's like, you know, I think a lot of you guys probably saw this on Facebook.
202000	203000	We turned on the ball drop.
203000	204000	Do you?
204000	208000	And then got tired of looking at Carson Daly and all these other people who we had no idea who the fuck they were.
209000	211000	And I was like, why aren't we watching Kathy Griffin?
211000	218000	I actually have to admit, I was a little surprised at the thing I went to that we didn't have Kathy Griffin and Anderson Cooper on.
218000	223000	Because I sort of thought that was kind of like required television on New Year's Eve these days.
223000	224000	I love them.
224000	226000	Yeah, they're pretty awesome.
226000	227000	Rest in peace, Dick Clark.
227000	230000	I mean, you know, you had to pass the baton to somebody.
230000	232000	He's passed it to two fabulous people.
232000	236000	That's right. Even though technically he passed it to Ryan Seacrest, but you know, screw him.
236000	238000	Uh, Loki, you've been gone for a couple weeks.
238000	242000	I know you did like a late holiday thing, so that's why you missed last week's show.
242000	244000	But you're back, even though you sound a little sick.
244000	247000	Yeah, I'm back with my kid's disease.
247000	248000	That's always fun.
248000	251000	It's just a chest cold now. It's like, you know, it's on its way out.
251000	252000	When the kids get you sick.
252000	254000	Did you have a good New Year too?
254000	257000	I was playing my son's video game.
257000	259000	Yeah? What's your son's video game?
259000	260000	Disney Infinity.
260000	261000	Oh, okay.
261000	263000	Yeah, so now we have a figure thing now.
263000	266000	Did you get the 3.0 yet or are you still working on 2.0?
266000	271000	Well, technically we have 3.0. He got from Santa 2.0.
271000	279000	But I downloaded 3.0 because one of the figures that Santa brought for my youngest son was Olaf.
279000	282000	And that's a 3.0 figure, so you kind of need it in order to play that.
282000	287000	So it was like, it was on sale. It was like $17 or something.
287000	290000	You know, so they only play in the toy box anyways.
290000	291000	He's like, I want to do the levels.
291000	303000	I'm like, fine. So he has a ton of characters that Santa purchased used at GameStop because they had a sale for, you buy two and you get three free.
303000	304000	Oh my, oh that's pretty good though.
304000	308000	Yeah, and they're like $7 to $10 each. It's like, dude.
308000	312000	They have a ton of those. But I got to admit, even I want some of those Disney Infinity figures.
312000	316000	Like, I think I've caught a little bit of the Star Wars mania. Have you seen the new movie yet, Loki?
316000	318000	Still haven't seen Star Wars yet?
319000	323000	I haven't been to the theater to see it, but yes.
323000	325000	Uh oh, shame on you.
325000	332000	Hey, no, no. I wanted to go to the theater to see it, but realistically that's probably not going to happen for a long time.
332000	337000	And so I wanted to see it before it got spoiled for me on the internet.
337000	341000	I will try very hard not to judge. I can understand.
341000	349000	I would still, I still very much want to go see it in the theaters, but it's just, I've managed this long without seeing the spoilers.
349000	353000	And like I started seeing spoilers, like actually what it was, it was a spoiler on Facebook.
353000	359000	I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Like the headline was the spoiler. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
359000	362000	Like I got to watch this now because this is going to get only worse.
362000	364000	Yeah. So, so you watched it.
364000	365000	So everyone watched it.
365000	373000	Well, I got to say, I caught a little bit of the Star Wars mania from, from all that, even though I was never, you know, super into Star Wars.
373000	377000	I hate saying I was never into Star Wars because that makes it sound like I hated it. I didn't hate it.
377000	379000	Well, I didn't like the prequels, but nobody did.
379000	383000	I appreciated the trilogy for what it was.
383000	388000	And, but you know, I wasn't like, oh my God, foaming at the mouth crazy about seeing the new one, but I got to admit it was really good.
388000	396000	And there is a part of me where it's like, okay, I do kind of want, I want a Poe figure really, really bad.
396000	404000	And I do want a Kylo Ren and I want Rey and you know, I'm Finn. I want all the new characters because they're all really cool.
404000	408000	So there's a part of me that's like, oh God, do I want to get into this Disney infinity thing?
408000	415000	But I can already like feel the eyes of Alan's judgment because just the other day I took a picture of my updated amiibo collection.
415000	419000	I'll be the first to say it's pretty fucking disgusting. My amiibo collection.
419000	423000	Let me just put it this way. You're not a child. You're probably not going to find much in this game.
423000	430000	I mean, you can design levels and stuff and you can make like intricate stuff like that, but the gameplay is pretty kind of meh.
430000	438000	It's a little bit boring. I still was leveling up my, because I also purchased a figure to go along with it.
438000	442000	I also purchased a Sam Flynn. So I was leveling up my Sam Flynn character.
442000	447000	Yeah, I got to see and thank thanks to you. I have a Tron figure that I have to have to work on in the game.
447000	455000	So we'll see. I don't know. Going to a chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
455000	461000	And if you are listening live Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show,
461000	468000	we encourage you to head on over to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com is where you can chat along with us.
468000	475000	Or if you're old school, you can use IRC and go onto the game search, because that's all the website is, is a fancy front end for IRC.
475000	479000	So you go to IRC and you get on the game search network and we're in channel VOG, V-O-G.
479000	486000	And there's actually some chatters wishing me a happy birthday. Thanks you guys, except it's not really my birthday today.
486000	493000	But it's episode 626. My birthday is June 26. That's why I was saying it was my birthday show. So it's not really my birthday.
493000	497000	If there was any consolation, there was a really kick ass Deadpool trailer on Christmas.
497000	502000	There you go. I guess. I don't know what that has to do with my birthday, but Ryan Reynolds, I guess, maybe.
502000	504000	Deadpool?
504000	509000	I'll see the Deadpool movie. That looks like it's going to be fun. We'll see.
509000	513000	Let's see, looking at some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
513000	520000	Shehulk is in our chat saying, it is actually a great era for movies right now with Star Wars and the Hateful Eight in theaters and 70mm.
521000	526000	You know, I know we're a video game show and not a movie show, but let's be real, the two go hand in hand an awful lot.
526000	533000	And I got to kind of agree. There's a lot of buzz around movies this year. Probably more so than games, let's be real.
533000	543000	Or this, excuse me, this last year. I have to get used to the whole concept of 2016 now because you know I'm that guy that's going to be still writing 2015 on his checks for a month.
543000	545000	The two times a month I have to write a check.
546000	553000	But anyway, this era right now, this end of 2015 was really, really good for movies, I think.
553000	561000	And I don't know if it was as good for games as it was movies. Not to say all the games sucked, but I just feel like we've had some bigger.
561000	565000	And we were talking about this a little bit last week's show. We've had some kind of bigger years for games.
565000	572000	I feel like a lot of the stuff that could have really pushed this year over the top got delayed to 2016, but I guess that kind of happens every year, right?
572000	573000	And so it goes.
573000	578000	But I will agree that movies have helped subsidize the entertainment an awful lot there.
578000	584000	And Bobby Blackwolf in chat, yeah, I knew I was going to get called out on that, says, Rob writes checks?
584000	594000	Are they ones his body can't cash? No, there's certain things I still have to write checks for. Like the landlord doesn't take credit card. I have to do checks for that still.
594000	596000	Why would you pay your rent with credit card?
596000	601000	I've heard of people doing that as far back as when I was in college. Some people did that.
601000	604000	That just strikes me as kind of irresponsible.
604000	605000	Money's money. Well.
605000	607000	But it's money you don't own.
607000	611000	I mean, like, what about like debit card, credit card? That's what I mean.
611000	617000	Yeah, that's what I mean. A lot of people would do with that. Well, and if times are tough, I've heard of people doing it.
617000	625000	But anyway, that's another issue for another time. But yeah, so there are still the reasons to write checks, but it's very, very, very few.
626000	631000	Let's see. Going to our chat for some more comments. One more over at live.voggenetwork.com.
631000	636000	Brad from Pod Culture giving a hearty, Fuck Deadpool. He's Green Lantern.
636000	640000	It's true. You have him in both universes, DC and Marvel.
640000	643000	Yeah, except the Deadpool movie is actually going to be good.
643000	646000	We'll give him a chance. We'll give him a chance.
646000	651000	Alright, since we were just talking about 2015, you know, last week on the show, we had a pretty full house here.
651000	655000	We had myself and Dark Soccer, Flaco Jones and Shane Olinko were here in studio joining us.
655000	663000	We had a nice little round table talking about our favorite games of 2015, but with Loki being gone, we were not able to hear his picks.
663000	669000	So I wanted to give Loki a chance to go over his favorite three games of 2015. Out of curiosity, did you hear last week's show?
669000	670000	Nope.
670000	674000	So you don't know what we picked. Well, we'll tell you what we picked as you reveal yours here.
674000	678000	So let's start with number three. What was your favorite, third favorite game of 2015 and why?
678000	682000	You know, honestly, that's the thing. I couldn't remember three games I played during the year.
682000	689000	I mean, I played, I remember I played the last few months, but like, what was I playing earlier this year?
689000	692000	I think I was working on my game for a lot of time.
692000	696000	You were. You were working on your game a lot. If you go back to the gaming weeks and so forth, would you come up with something?
696000	709000	Yeah, I mean, I guess. God, if I had to pick a third game, I would say Just Cause 3, maybe. I mean, honestly, it's going to be a good game.
709000	717000	I just can't play it right now because the load times are ridiculous, but I love watching people play it and the videos and the glitch views are fucking crazy.
717000	719000	And I think it's hilarious.
719000	720000	You do love your glitches.
720000	724000	Oh my God. Now that's where we'll get to my number one pick.
724000	735000	Yeah, I mean, I love, love that game. Just Cause 2 is pretty fun and just watching what they're doing with 3 and I do want to get more into it.
735000	745000	And it was one I was looking forward to most of the year. I'm just, you know, once I was playing it and trying to grind through some of the missions and taking three minutes between each one, I'm like, dude, this is ridiculous.
745000	753000	I got to just stop playing this until they fix this. And maybe they have. I don't know. I haven't gone back to it. So that would be my number three.
753000	764000	All right. So, uh, so Just Cause 3 is Loki's number three. And as a reminder, uh, mine was Everybody's Gone to the Rapture was my number three and Dark Soccer's I believe was Undertale if I remember right. So there we go. So there's our threes.
764000	768000	So Loki, how about your number two favorite game of 2015?
768000	776000	My number two game and like, I don't even know if it's my favorite, but it's the one I've been playing probably the most. Ingress.
776000	781000	I knew it. I called it last week. I fucking called it last week. By the way, we predicted what your top three would be.
781000	785000	All right. All right. Fair. Okay. So Ingress and your top three.
785000	792000	And it's only because I've been playing it quite a bit. Actually this week I've been pretty, you know, lethargic with it. I just haven't really wanted to do anything.
792000	804000	Like, in fact, I was like driving over here today. I'm like, oh, hey, there's a field. And I'm like, yeah, but my, my bursars are in a capsule. Well, I've got some level six ones. Tap, tap. Yeah, fuck it. I just don't want to do anymore.
805000	814000	I'll hack this instead. Um, so yeah, I mean I played quite a bit of that and it's got me out to visit many parks.
814000	816000	And cemeteries? Have you done cemeteries?
816000	822000	I haven't done cemeteries yet, but lots of parks. And now I don't have any time to do it because my schedule's changing again.
822000	830000	So I'm going to be working Monday through Friday and off on the weekends. Whereas I had Thursday to kind of do whatever the hell I wanted. I don't have that anymore.
830000	832000	So real life sucks sometimes. Yeah, you do.
832000	835000	Oh well. So that's that. And then of course number one's going to be Fallout.
837000	846000	I think I already got ruined. So number two for Loki was Ingress. My number two was Rocket League. Dark Soccer's number two was Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, if I remember right.
846000	849000	Alright, so your number one, as if this is going to surprise me at this point, Loki.
850000	862000	Fallout 4. Because that's what I've been playing the most of recently. And it's entertaining. I find this as entertaining as Skyrim. I mean it's just taking up a lot of time.
862000	875000	And like Skyrim, thankfully they have perks to allow me to walk around fully encumbered because I'm just picking up every piece of garbage on the ground and carrying along with me.
876000	879000	In case I need it. I'm like a hoarder in that game.
879000	884000	The weight restrictions in those games always bother me because in the same way I have to hoard everything.
884000	895000	You get perks though and eventually you can get to where you can actually fast travel with being over encumbered and also you can use your action points to move.
896000	904000	I'm just used to the vast majority of JRPGs where every character is bringing around a bottomless pit or something to carry all the items in the world.
904000	906000	So that's why I always do that.
906000	915000	Yeah, I mean in Skyrim I used to have to make multiple trips and I'd have to glitch it to just get an armor that would have like plus carry 99% or something like that.
915000	919000	But this one I can't because it's on console so far.
919000	922000	So right now I'm just kind of doing that.
922000	927000	I mean there's glitches where you can get your companions to carry extra stuff for you but I just don't want to.
927000	929000	This works just fine.
929000	931000	Because I've been playing that. I haven't really played much through the story.
931000	936000	I do want to go back and play it again as a complete asshole this time and just kill everybody.
936000	943000	Especially the Minutemen kind of bother me so I'm just going to go through next time just with I don't give a fuck what you want.
943000	948000	Oh hey, settlement. Kill everybody. Just kind of go through that way. That'd be fun.
948000	952000	Alright, so there it is. Loki's favorite game of 2015, Fallout 4.
952000	962000	I feel like for what an event game that was and how many lists that game is making, I have to admit I haven't touched it yet because I know how it's going to go with Bethesda.
962000	966000	There'll be a game of the year edition next year that has all the DLC included that's on sale.
966000	969000	I'll wait for that one. I don't have to be first in line for Fallout.
970000	975000	I still think you're going to get enough out of just the vanilla game. I don't think it's really a big deal.
975000	976000	That's fair.
976000	980000	You know, even if it's like Skyrim, their DLC is kind of hit and miss.
980000	984000	I mean, some of us are like, well, I don't really need that.
984000	991000	So I wouldn't go out and buy, I don't know, I would just, I'd buy just the vanilla game. I think you're going to spend enough time in it as it is.
991000	998000	Alright, fair enough. I would say Dark Soccer, we did a pretty good job predicting Loki's list because I'm pretty sure we predicted Fallout 4 as well.
998000	1003000	Well, there's just very few games I played this year. I'm like, I was trying to think, well, what the hell did I play?
1003000	1008000	So before I tell you what we picked, any wild guesses what myself and Dark Soccer picked for our number one?
1008000	1016000	For our number one? I don't know. I'm guessing Dragon Age Inquisition.
1016000	1018000	She did! She did!
1018000	1019000	And then for you.
1019000	1021000	The DLC. The DLC in Dragon Age Inquisition.
1022000	1031000	And then for you, um, gosh, it's going to be, oh, shit, no, I know what my number three was. It wasn't just cause.
1031000	1034000	It was Mario Maker, but, you know, never mind.
1034000	1044000	Well, let's see, for you, I would say probably, I don't know, maybe like Splatoon, but I don't know if it's Splatoon.
1044000	1050000	I would say maybe, um, no, cause Diablo 3 came out so long ago. I'd probably say Splatoon.
1050000	1057000	Splatoon, close. You should have went with your first gut voice and went with Mario Maker. That's why I picked for my number one.
1057000	1061000	Well, no, that was my number three, I think, actually, cause Mario Maker's pretty fun.
1061000	1068000	Good job, though! You predicted ours about as well as we predicted yours. I think I said the Lego game he'd been playing would be on his list.
1068000	1074000	Well, the Lego game, no, that's funny enough. The new one's coming out in a couple weeks, so I'll be playing that, actually.
1074000	1079000	And I didn't include that, cause I think that I included last year, cause we're still playing it then.
1079000	1088000	But, dude, my son's put like 200 plus hours in that game already, in the Lego game. Like 230 hours, I think, was the last time I looked at that.
1088000	1089000	Wow.
1089000	1091000	So, I mean, that's ridiculous.
1091000	1102000	Alright. Well, as we transition from 2015 into 2016, a big thing we like to do usually in the first episode of the year is talk about our predictions.
1102000	1110000	We opted tonight not to do List List, which I know may disappoint some people, but we don't have any other extra people here in the studio with us tonight.
1110000	1117000	So, we thought we'd just do this a different way tonight. We'll bring back List List at some other point this month when we have a guest here in the studio about some other topic.
1117000	1128000	But I thought we'd talk a little bit about 2016 predictions, cause, you know, a lot of stuff from 2015 has been delayed into 2016, and this is shaping up to be a really interesting year in games.
1128000	1133000	One that could be pivotal, actually, and we'll talk about that in a minute here.
1133000	1143000	So, I'm gonna open up the floor to any predictions that my co-hosts or myself may have, but I do have, first off, I have like five kind of topics I wanted to talk about first before we open it up to that.
1143000	1148000	So, one big thing a lot of people are talking about, and by the way, I open this up to our chatters as well.
1148000	1154000	If you want to comment along with these, I definitely will read some of the comments in our chat, live.voggenetwork.com.
1154000	1161000	Alright, first thing I want to talk about, Nintendo NX obviously won't be its final name, but you hear a lot of buzz about it.
1161000	1165000	My question is, do you guys think it will happen this year, and what is it?
1165000	1168000	Nintendo NX, will it happen this year, and what is it?
1168000	1174000	I'm just expecting my bar of, you know, what they're coming out with to be extremely low.
1174000	1180000	It's gonna have a stupid name, because for some stupid reason they have these weird naming conventions.
1180000	1187000	I'm hoping it doesn't. I think it's gonna be just simply kind of like Wii U with a detachable gamepad that runs on some.
1187000	1189000	I think that's as basic as it's gonna be.
1190000	1202000	I'm kind of with you. I kind of think that the gamepad this time is going to be fully detachable as a gaming device.
1202000	1206000	And this might be why we don't hear a lot about the 3DS's successor.
1206000	1214000	Because I have this weird, funky feeling, and again, this is a Predictions episode, so we have our tinfoil hats in full swing.
1214000	1216000	I have a feeling the two are gonna be sold separately.
1216000	1225000	I think you're gonna have your main desk NX, if you will, that will play the games, and you can have a classic controller or whatever and play the games on that.
1225000	1231000	And then you can also have a portable Nintendo, and the two will link together for some features.
1231000	1237000	But it's not gonna be as essential, so to speak, for the system as it was on the Wii U.
1237000	1244000	And that 3DS or whatever the successor is, that handheld device, not only will it function with the desk one, but you will be able to take it wherever you want.
1244000	1249000	I kind of think that, and they're gonna be sold separately, and that's how they're gonna mask how expensive it really is.
1249000	1252000	Well, yeah, I mean, that and not selling the power supply with it.
1252000	1260000	I would hope that they would do something exciting. I'm just, I just don't expect that anymore, unfortunately.
1260000	1267000	Do you think it will make this year? You know, we have supposedly a Zelda game on the horizon.
1267000	1270000	No, I think it'll be spring of 2017.
1270000	1273000	So we could have a console release in the spring, which we don't see very often.
1273000	1276000	It was initially announced for fall, but it's gonna get pushed to the spring.
1276000	1283000	I think something really funky will happen where the desk comes out in the winter, and the handheld comes out in the spring.
1283000	1287000	They don't release at the same time, so they can pull your money twice.
1287000	1291000	I just have this weird feeling that's how it's gonna break down, but we'll see.
1291000	1301000	And the reason, again, the reason why I'm saying this and where I'm getting this from is I'm going back to way back when they first revealed the NX, and they were kind of talking about that ecosystem for Nintendo.
1301000	1314000	I just sort of think they're gonna try to bring the handheld, which they've always been very dominant in, and the living room consoles more together into one system.
1314000	1316000	I think that's what's gonna happen.
1316000	1323000	Darsakha, any predictions on your end for the NX? Do you think it's gonna happen this year, or what do you think it is?
1323000	1328000	I think they'd like for it to happen this year, but I don't know that it will.
1328000	1346000	I think it's gonna sit in limbo, and I also think that the goofy name thing, the convention will stay, but that's also been a positive marketing ploy in the case of the Wii and the Wii U, is the fact that, yeah, the name sounds goofy, but you don't forget it.
1346000	1355000	It instantly sticks it in the head. It's something that you've got a connotation to, so I think that Nintendo's seen success with that plan and will keep going at it.
1355000	1357000	I don't know. That's just any name, though.
1357000	1364000	I think for Wii, it worked. For Wii U, it didn't, and because Wii U's name was too similar to Wii.
1364000	1372000	But I think the silly name thing, for as much shit as we gave the name Nintendo Wii when they first announced that, yeah, for what you're saying, I think that worked.
1372000	1380000	But I think I could see them doing a silly name thing for the new console, but it's not gonna sound anything like Wii. It's gonna be completely different.
1381000	1391000	And if it is these two things coming together, it's gonna be something like, I don't know why, but the image I get in my mind is like Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.
1391000	1394000	They're gonna be like complimentary things.
1394000	1402000	Can we, like, drop the Miis already? Does anybody give a shit about the Miis anymore? Because they're not utilized in most games.
1402000	1404000	The Miiverse is kind of...
1404000	1405000	They were all over Smash Brothers?
1405000	1408000	Yeah, Miiverse is kind of a thing. I don't know if the Miis are done.
1408000	1415000	I like the Miis. I play the stupid little Mii Plaza thing all the time. So yeah.
1415000	1420000	Alright, Kaijuto in chat says, Miis forever. I love the Miis. Let's see some other comments here.
1420000	1425000	Sjoan Hunter Matt says, Nintendo will finally announce that must-have game to make people upgrade to the new 3DS.
1425000	1426000	Yeah, the new Zelda game.
1426000	1435000	Dungeon Buster says, if you combine the dev kit and production rumors from Foxcon late last year, they point to 2016 as the year it could come out, but that's a lot of heavy speculation.
1436000	1446000	Dungeon Buster also says in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, if I recall correctly, Iwata said over the summer at a shareholder Q&A to wait until this year's E3 for more information on NX.
1446000	1454000	Yeah, I think for sure we get a name and whatever the twist is about. This is Nintendo's little twist. What a twist!
1454000	1467000	We're going to get that at E3 because Nintendo is going to want to put it in front of developers soon enough where they can start developing for it because they definitely want third parties on board with whatever this is because we all saw what happened with Wii U.
1467000	1480000	The question is, does that necessarily mean it comes out over the holiday in 2016? I don't necessarily think so because if you think about it, Wii U was announced E3 20...
1480000	1493000	Sorry, I'm getting my ears fuzzy, but it was the E3 the year before it actually came out and that was because they wanted designers to be thinking about how am I going to use this tablet and the second screen, that whole thing to its full potential.
1493000	1498000	And we have that probably to thank for things like Zombie U and some of the...
1498000	1502000	I don't know, I remember when I first saw it, I was like, eh, that's kind of dumb.
1503000	1517000	I like this name, She-Hulk in chat says, it will be called the Nintendo Power. That would be a cool name. I love it, but I don't know. I still think it's going to be something where there's two names that complement each other, if that's even going to be right.
1517000	1528000	Well, speaking of Nintendo, here's my second topic on Nintendo, Nintendo Mobile. After a long resistance to mobile gaming, Nintendo is going to enter that market this year.
1528000	1536000	And I think we've heard, what, four to five titles planned for this year. The first one we know is Miitomo. We've heard a little, little, little bit about that.
1536000	1552000	How do you guys think mobile is going to work for Nintendo? Do you think it's going to be huge for them? Do you think it's going to tank? It's going to get lost in the shuffle? Do you think they need to not be doing this and should be focusing on their, you know, whatever NX is?
1552000	1557000	What do you guys think? Nintendo? Mobile? How do you think that's going to go for them? Loki?
1557000	1572000	I think it's just, what is it? It's going to be about as popular as it is now. I think that the mobile space, I mean, if people want to play Nintendo products, they're going to play those on Nintendo devices. I think that's kind of what their mindset is.
1572000	1594000	There's a lot of different properties out there on the mobile space. Like, I asked my coworker all the time, like, what the hell are you playing? I mean, oh my God, it's like Panda. I don't even know what the fuck it is. It's some puzzle, one of the billion puzzle games out there, but like, there's that many brands out there. It's just a big mess.
1594000	1605000	And don't get me wrong, Mario on like a mobile device would be pretty cool, except no buttons, so, you know, I don't know. I just think it's not going to make a huge difference either way.
1605000	1613000	I'm going to make a pretty bold prediction here, and maybe I'll be right, maybe I'll be wrong, but this is what my gut is telling me, and I'm going to say it.
1613000	1627000	I think Miitomo is going to be kind of a flash in the pan. Like, it's going to get a ton of downloads initially, and a ton of people are going to look at it right out the gate, but then I don't think it's really going to have the staying power. I think people will kind of move on to other things.
1627000	1638000	Pokemon Go, I think is going to be the biggest cellular phone game of all time. I think Pokemon Go is going to be the biggest money-making game ever released. I really do.
1638000	1656000	And I just, my gut, and it has nothing to do with my own ingress and the fact that the company is, I just, I say that because Pokemon has been a big reason for the Game Boy and the DS and those systems to do as well as they have.
1656000	1669000	I think you don't really want to underestimate the power of Pokemon in that regard. And I think the fact that they're coming out with something that's going to get people out there moving around and, you know, something kind of the family can do together.
1669000	1679000	It's going to be, we know it's going to be a kid visiting graveyards. I have a feeling, again, don't go ingress one to one with Pokemon Go. They're going to change it up a little, we'll see.
1679000	1695000	But I think they're going to really get that family element there. And, you know, when you consider that, what are some of the biggest mobile phone games we've had to date? Candy Crush, the OMG Pop, what the hell was that, Draw Something, what, Trivia Crack maybe, Flappy Bird.
1696000	1711000	You know, I think Pokemon Go stands to obliterate the shit out of all those things. I really do. I might be wrong. You know, maybe the whole real world aspect of it, in fact you do have to get up and move around and can't necessarily play in the house, may hold some people back.
1711000	1722000	But maybe Niantic's thought of that and maybe there'll be something you can do without going out and necessarily moving around. So, I mean, we'll see. We'll see. That's just what my gut tells me. I might be wrong.
1723000	1726000	DarkSoccer, anything you care to comment on Nintendo going mobile?
1727000	1742000	It's about time. I mean, honestly enough. They've seemed resistant to it for the longest time. And I think it's bound to happen. Now's a good time as any.
1743000	1759000	And I do want to make sure I make this clear because if I don't clarify this I'll get an email or a tweet correcting me on it. I do realize technically Pokemon is not Nintendo, it's Pokemon Company. However, come on, I still associate the two very closely together.
1759000	1767000	And the success of a game like Pokemon Go would only stand to benefit Nintendo. So that's why I still loop it in with Nintendo.
1768000	1775000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Kaijuto says Rob is talking crazy right now. Maybe.
1776000	1787000	Let's see. Dungeonbuster says a new mobile Golden Sun 2. You know, we don't know what those other mobile games are going to be. Are they going to be related to existing IPs like Mario, Zelda?
1787000	1795000	Although, I don't know. I think a platformer, I don't think is the best thing for a phone. Or is it going to be dormant IPs like I think we've all said on the show before.
1795000	1802000	Advanced Wars would be a great thing to have come back on mobile. You know, we'll see. Let's see.
1802000	1809000	SSG100Matt points out Pokemon Shuffle is huge on other devices though. Talking about another Pokemon game that's doing pretty well.
1810000	1818000	Let's see. Dungeonbuster says there will be five mobile titles total if I remember right. Miitomo is the first so there should be four more to see where they go.
1818000	1831000	That is assuming they don't get pushed back another year. And I think already, like weren't we supposed to have the, didn't they have that whole press conference in the first place to say we were going to do a mobile phone game this year being 2015 and that's not happening.
1831000	1838000	Here's Miitomo, it's the first one next year. So, things always get pushed back in gaming. Always. Always, always, always.
1838000	1844000	Alright, let's move on to my third topic. Third out of five. I think this is going to be a big one next year.
1845000	1865000	Virtual reality. I mean, we are looking at the imminent launches of things like the Oculus Rift, the PlayStation VR, possibly Microsoft's Hololens, 2016, which we can go over the whole VR AR thing but you know why I'm lumping it in the same bucket.
1865000	1881000	This stands to be a huge year for that sort of gaming but my question is do you guys think it's going to be successful? How do you guys think 2016 is going to treat virtual or augmented as the case may be reality gaming? Loki?
1882000	1892000	I'm really behind it but I don't think it's going to do well. I think it's going to do as well as well as connect. Everyone's going to get hyped about it. It's going to come out, kind of underwhelmed.
1893000	1913000	I mean, I think it's a great experience but the cost of entry is really high. We'll see what it comes out with, what the price is going to be but when you keep having the guy behind Oculus saying, yeah it's going to be expensive, the cost of entry is just going to be a big factor there.
1913000	1924000	You're going to run into PlayStation 3 type problems where I don't want to spend $500 on this, especially when there's not a lot of software out there. Why do I need this? That's going to be the big convincing factor.
1924000	1937000	Maybe the Samsung Gear VR might do a little bit better. I can see that doing better because the cost of entry is a lot lower plus it runs on mobile devices but unfortunately I don't think it's going to do that well this year.
1937000	1943000	If I give it a couple years though, maybe it'll take off. But right now, does it launch? I don't know.
1943000	1945000	Dar Sakura, any thoughts on VR gaming in 2016?
1945000	1959000	I pretty much agree it's going to go the way of the Kinect. I mean, it's a neat concept. Some of the games have been really fun. I just don't know if it's going to stick. They'd have to really do something to make it really uniquely different to make it stick. So, holiday time maybe?
1960000	1978000	My personal thoughts on this. When you're talking about Gear VR, you know what's funny? I really do think this. If Apple were to do that, they would know exactly how to tell people why they need it, and it would be huge. I don't know if they're going to go that direction or not. We'll see. That's my thought when it comes to that.
1978000	1980000	Yeah, and that's the thing. It would take something...
1980000	1982000	Apple knows how to tell people, you need this.
1982000	1988000	Well, a lot of people that buy Apple products don't necessarily... they're like, ooh, shiny, and they'll buy it.
1988000	1990000	Not necessarily.
1990000	1998000	That's my general impression. But yes, their products, though, kind of help push that market, so that could help.
1998000	2000000	Anyway, that's just a side thought.
2001000	2017000	Even the PlayStation 4, when the PlayStation VR comes out or whatever, that I think could help if the cost is low enough. Because in that way, the console's not that expensive, and hopefully the device isn't that expensive. That's a lot better than buying over a thousand dollar PC plus this.
2018000	2032000	PlayStation VR is really tough to call, and it really hinges on, are they going to have Wii Sports? And I don't literally mean Wii Sports. I mean, are they going to have that game that makes you have to get the VR?
2032000	2033000	The system maker.
2033000	2048000	Exactly. You know, like, Wii Sports sold the Wii. Say what you will about the other fantastic games on Wii, like Zelda and all that other stuff. Wii Sports sold the Wii. If PlayStation VR has Wii Sports, I could see it stands to do very, very well. It is really, really tough to call.
2048000	2057000	Obviously, I'm hearing a lot of good feedback, and you might remember a few weeks ago, we had Shane Alinko on the show, who was at the PlayStation Experience, and was completely sold on PlayStation VR.
2057000	2063000	So if they can get people to kind of do that and try it for themselves, I think PlayStation has the chance to do very well.
2063000	2080000	Well, and that's the bizarre VR game that I played. That was great. I mean, it was really fun. But, you know, I could see having something like that be more of a smartphone type thing. You know, something that you can maybe unfold, attach your smartphone to it, and then play.
2080000	2084000	You know, they even have View Master things for iPhone now.
2084000	2086000	Yeah. Oh my gosh, right?
2086000	2093000	Yeah. But, I mean, I see that being a thing, but it'd have to be something portable, you know.
2093000	2111000	So PlayStation VR is still really hard to call, but I think it stands to do well enough. I think what's going to be most important about PlayStation VR is that I see these really interesting things when I read random news articles, as I sometimes do on things like, I don't know, Business Insider, Yahoo, Google News.
2111000	2128000	And I see a lot of these, you know, industry, and I mean like finance industry, kind of talking about is this cycle of gaming consoles, is it going to be a shorter cycle than what we're used to? Meaning, can the PlayStation 5 possibly come out in 2017 or 2018, which would be a pretty short cycle?
2128000	2137000	And I kind of think no, because I think PlayStation VR is going to augment the life of the PlayStation a little bit. But again, it has to have those must-have games.
2137000	2139000	Yeah, I don't think they've pushed the hardware to the...
2139000	2148000	I don't think they have either. And I think, I kind of don't know why some of those stories report on that the way they do. I think things like PlayStation VR just stand to extend the life.
2148000	2157000	So PlayStation VR, I'm going to say it does well enough. I just don't know if that mainstream game is there yet, but that could change in the coming months.
2157000	2169000	Yeah, that's all it takes is one thing to get people hooked on it. And I mean, I really do hope it does well. I'm definitely excited about it, and I want to get in on that stuff. I don't have a PC to run Oculus, but I would like to build one.
2169000	2187000	And that's, you segue into my thoughts on Oculus Rift, is I really like it, but I kind of think you just called why. I don't think it's going to be huge. I think it's going to be more of a cult nerd thing, which isn't bad. There's a lot of cult nerd things that still make a lot of money.
2187000	2195000	I just don't know if I see it being super mainstream, and I think it's because of cost. You have to have the right computer to run it, you have to have the...
2195000	2207000	If they were able to do some sort of breakout box, like they're doing with the PlayStation VR, where it offloads a lot of the processing, that could help. I think if you could get it to run on just average devices.
2207000	2221000	But again, that's just a little silly prediction I'm throwing out. And again, I say Facebook is an interesting player in this, the way that I was actually talking about Apple a second ago. Facebook may have a magic way to kind of convince people they need Oculus.
2221000	2237000	One thing Oculus Rift has that other companies don't necessarily is that Facebook is in front of the majority of Americans every single day. Every single day, we're checking Facebook.
2237000	2251000	I obviously know that I don't have a Facebook, but realize the majority of folks do have that and are tuned into it every day. So Oculus Rift has a great platform to be talked about on. But we'll see.
2251000	2274000	And I would love a HoloLens once it's up to what they're showing us. Obviously right now there's that really narrow field of view, but as soon as it becomes to that full field of view where they're kind of making it seem like it actually is, then I'm on board with that. Because that looks awesome. It's just right now, not there.
2274000	2291000	Now here's my thoughts on HoloLens. And this may sound a little cruel, but I think it's going to fucking tank. And I think my reason for that, and it's not an anti-Microsoft sentiment by any means, I just think at this point we've already talked about two people getting into the game and I think HoloLens is going to be last.
2291000	2307000	And yes, I know it's AR versus VR, but I think they're going to be too late to the game. Microsoft has a track record that they won't support something if it doesn't catch on in that first year. Hello, game room. Hello, Kinect. Hello, and so forth.
2307000	2330000	I just, I mean, then again, to be fair, the Xbox division is under different supervision now. And maybe that will give HoloLens a better chance. And if HoloLens has their version of Wii Sports, then of course it's going to do fantastic. I just feel like it's going to be not enough too late. But that's how I feel today. My opinion may completely change by the end of the year.
2330000	2345000	I just, I'm very skeptical, thank you, Kinect, on what they show me on stage versus what the actual product is. Especially, especially now, when even up until right now they won't fucking admit that that narrow field of view is there.
2345000	2357000	Instead they do all this bullshit with this stupid rig on a camera that makes it look like it's fucking amazing. And the fact that they're going up to launch with this shit is why I'm skeptical about this.
2357000	2368000	It's, you know, it's just like the fucking Kinect videos where I'm going to scan my skateboard in and try on virtual clothes and shit. That fucking never happened. It didn't happen when Kinect 1 came out. It didn't happen when Kinect 2 came out.
2368000	2384000	I think you do raise, as mean as you're getting right now, I think you do raise a good point that if they don't advertise it the way it's actually going to be, that's going to only hurt them in the long run. I think that's something for everybody. This is not exclusive to Microsoft. This is something Sony needs to take notes on and so forth.
2384000	2395000	Anyway, let's see, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com for some comments. Tiger Claw says, do you think the whole VR thing is going to be overcrowded? One of those VR headsets is bound to fail and only one or two will survive.
2395000	2407000	Yes, and that's why I'm saying I think Hololens may not do it, but we'll see. Because Bobby Blackwolf in chat says it's also not primarily for games, the Hololens, it's more for businesses.
2407000	2429000	And that ended up being Kinect's kind of little twist that ended up making that interesting. I kind of think that Oculus Rift is going to be way more for the business end than we think right now on a video game podcast, but AR versus VR, there's going to be some different things that Hololens does.
2429000	2443000	I could maybe see that. I could see maybe the technology could go interesting places like arcades and theme parks and things like that. But I mean, we'll see. We'll see. Let's see other comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2443000	2462000	Let's see. SSG100Matt says, Loki rant level is at 8 of 10. Let's see. Tech 2030 says, I'm so done with console cycles. I'm all PC when it comes to the type of experiences that are on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
2462000	2472000	Some things are exclusive to those consoles, though, that you have to give up in order to stay with PC. But he's certainly not the first person to give that perspective.
2472000	2483000	In PC, they just don't really make cycles. It's more of just upgrades in hardware and upgrades in demand by games. I mean, they don't just advertise that. It's not like, ooh, this is a new generation. I mean, it's just gradual.
2483000	2499000	Alright. Couple more quick ones here and then we'll move on. Number four out of five that I have. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. How will the exclusives look in 2016? I think I'm actually going to kind of say, how does the games look in 2016 on these consoles? What do you guys think, Loki?
2499000	2512000	There's not a whole... I mean, I'm excited about a few things on PlayStation 4, really. I was only excited about Crackdown on Xbox One and I don't know at this point this far into it that I'm really going to pick up an Xbox One before Crackdown.
2512000	2521000	I say that now, though, but I don't know. I just don't think that's going to be there. That's going to be enough to get me over to Xbox as well.
2521000	2535000	PlayStation 4. I mean, they've got No Man's Sky, which looks pretty cool. Also, that new game event. I forget what they call it. The tech robot dinosaur thing. I mean, that looks pretty cool.
2535000	2554000	I don't know. And also the stuff that they haven't announced yet. I mean, obviously, I'm kind of interested to see what they have coming out. But a lot of the stuff that's supposed to be coming out in 2016 is stuff that has been kind of pushed and pushed and pushed. At this point, I'm not all that excited about it. I mean, I don't know.
2554000	2564000	For me, personally, I'm only worried about how fucking crowded the holidays are going to be this year. It's going to hurt some games that could stand to do really well.
2564000	2568000	I don't think they're going to be that crowded because anything that's crowded in there is going to get pushed to 2017.
2568000	2578000	I think, you know, you have all the things that you just named. Microsoft did a really good job of delivering exclusives this year and I think they'll do it again in 2016.
2578000	2581000	I think it'll be Crackdown, Quantum Break. I'm really looking forward to it.
2581000	2582000	Yeah, Quantum Break looks pretty good.
2582000	2597000	But I know Mass Effect is on the horizon for this holiday as well. I think EA is going to deliver on that. You all know that probably for Dark Sakura and myself, that's going to be the gaming calendar for at least a month, if not three. If not an entire year, right, Dark Sakura?
2597000	2599000	She's laughing at me.
2599000	2601000	And rolling my eyes a bit.
2602000	2609000	Any of your thoughts on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One releases and how that's going to look this year compared to previous years?
2609000	2621000	I have no fucking clue. I'm looking forward to Andromeda. I don't think we're getting an Xbox One. Dan wanted the Forza thing, but that boat sank.
2621000	2639000	To be honest, I mean, most of our gaming has been on our Wii U and my PC and my Mac. So I kind of think that they're going to have to do something really amazing, I think, to bring more people in.
2640000	2656000	Interesting, too, because I'm thinking about that comment that was just said about I don't get into PlayStation 4 and Xbox One because I have PC. Well, Wii U, hardly any of that you're going to get on PC. Although we do have a story later on tonight. It's kind of interesting. But anyway, I digress.
2657000	2670000	My thought for this year in game releases is it's going to be a very crowded year, especially if the NX does release this holiday. It's going to be an insane holiday. If the NX releases this holiday, it's going to be crazy.
2670000	2675000	You thought you couldn't play everything this year. This next year is going to be insane.
2675000	2678000	It's okay. Because it won't be in stores.
2678000	2680000	Because you won't be able to find it.
2680000	2690000	Because there will be a shipping issue. They'll be held up in customs or fucking, I don't know, turtles not swimming fast enough across the ocean.
2691000	2710000	And I swear to God, we did everything we can, but the demand is so high, we just can't possibly make enough. Every fucking time, Nintendo. Come on. You've been singing that story since, what, 2006? Come on. It's been like ten years now. You should figure this shit out by now.
2710000	2720000	You know, one interesting word that hasn't come up with Nintendo yet during this whole conversation is Amiibo. And that has really changed Nintendo. For better or for worse.
2720000	2725000	Yeah, they sell a fuck ton of figures that do absolutely nothing in games.
2725000	2728000	But, Loki, I've got to admit, I love the figures.
2728000	2737000	Yeah, that's cool. And the figures are cool, and they're profitable, and they're going to keep doing it because it makes tons of money for them. But support for the game, eh, whatever.
2737000	2740000	But I like my Animal Crossing Amiibo.
2740000	2746000	I like that it's a dippy little costume in Mario Maker. Whatever, cool. I like that.
2746000	2752000	Okay, well, those are some expensive fucking DLC costumes. It's like an 8-bit costume that really means nothing.
2752000	2766000	Loki, I'm not buying it for that. I'm buying it for the figure because I genuinely like the figures as a Nintendo nerd my entire life. I just think, like, have you seen the Palutena one? It is so well done. It is so, it's an awesome figure. I truly believe that.
2766000	2781000	So, anyway, Loki's looking at me. Alright, lastly but not leastly, number 5 on my list, and I had to ask this one, for 2016, what's it going to look like for Konami in 2016?
2781000	2785000	Will they save themselves, or what happens in 2016?
2785000	2787000	They'll be gone. That's it.
2787000	2788000	They'll be gone?
2789000	2795000	They'll have nothing coming out, so there's really no reason to bring them up, and no one's going to give a shit about them. I mean, that's it.
2795000	2801000	All that's going to happen is going to get drowned out by the fact that Kojima's going to have some really fucking amazing game. There you go, exclusive for 2016.
2801000	2804000	And, um, that's it.
2804000	2808000	Well, yeah, add Kojima's game to the list of shit coming out. Actually, I don't think Kojima's game will be up until 2017.
2808000	2813000	Well, probably 2017, but whatever. It's still, though, that buzz will be there, and everyone will just be like, what the hell is wrong with you, Konami?
2813000	2822000	They're going to guarantee Sony closes, or opens, or puts in a very sweet spot in their E3 press conference, whatever Kojima's working on.
2822000	2828000	They will blow the lid on that, because six months is enough time for them to get a little pre-rendered trailer out.
2828000	2832000	Yeah, I mean, that's going to be pretty awesome, but I just don't think anyone's going to give a shit about them anymore.
2832000	2838000	And even if they are still making games, it's just like, there's other companies out there that you don't fucking give a shit about anymore.
2839000	2844000	Like, does anyone talk about Majesco? Does anyone talk about fucking Atari?
2844000	2852000	No, because they've fucked over their customers with their shitty-ass games and policies, and no one gives a shit anymore about them, so they don't talk about them.
2852000	2859000	And Konami, if they don't have anything coming out, big like Metal Gear Solid, no one fucking gives a shit about Pro Evo. I mean, yeah, that comes out, and that's cool.
2859000	2862000	Maybe in this country, but in Latin America, Loki.
2862000	2867000	Okay, people who like football, that's fine. They may like that game and everything, but...
2867000	2873000	No one fucking gives a shit about Konami. I mean, at this point, it's like, why should I give a shit about them?
2873000	2877000	I'm not hoping that they turn around. They're too far gone at this point.
2878000	2881000	Darsakra, any predictions for Konami in 2016?
2882000	2883000	Pachi-slot!
2885000	2887000	Many, many Pachi-slot.
2887000	2892000	It's Silent Hill, and it's Metal Gear, and it's everything that stabs us in the heart.
2894000	2895000	Fuck.
2896000	2907000	My thought, and this is a wild shot in the dark, but this is just where I see it going, I think Konami will spin off the computer entertainment division.
2907000	2919000	I think they'll keep their slot machine and the arcade and the machines and all that. They're gonna keep that, but I'm gonna say they sell the home entertainment division, and Sega buys it.
2920000	2923000	And that's what happens in 2016.
2923000	2925000	What money does Sega have?
2926000	2930000	Well, Loki, it's not gonna be very expensive to buy what Konami's selling.
2931000	2941000	I'm sorry, I don't think Sega would buy anything like that. They don't have any money to spend on that kind of crap. They don't make anything from Sonic. So, I don't know.
2942000	2951000	Alright, there it is. Some comments over at live.vognetwork.com. Rama says the money will come from Sega Sammy.
2952000	2958000	You know who would buy that? Probably it's like Deep Silver. They're the ones that purchase the remains of companies.
2958000	2963000	I don't think a Western company buys it. I think a Japanese company buys it. That's why I went for Sega.
2963000	2966000	And William Murderface pointing out the Total War games make decent money.
2966000	2968000	Yeah, but not enough to purchase Konami.
2968000	2970000	Again, I don't think the going rate's gonna be very high.
2970000	2975000	Well, if the going rate's not very high, then a company that makes a lot more money is gonna outbid them.
2976000	2983000	Let's see, but a lot of folks more focused on the Kojima thing. Dark Tetsuya is saying the Kojima Productions game, that's gonna be epic.
2983000	2992000	Let's see, William Murderface says if I were Kojima and Konami did that, I would sue the shit out of them, and I think that is referring to the Kojima themed pachinko machine.
2992000	2997000	Well, you couldn't have a Kojima themed pachinko machine, but you could absolutely have a Metal Gear themed pachinko machine.
2997000	3005000	But then again, this year is also gonna be, what is it, fucking Shenmue 3. Remember, that's this year.
3005000	3007000	Oh, you think that'll actually come out this year?
3007000	3008000	Maybe.
3008000	3009000	Nah, 2017.
3009000	3014000	Updated E3, maybe a playable thing. 2017 at the earliest, I think.
3014000	3022000	Alright, before we move into our gaming weeks, any random fun predictions you guys want to throw out there for 2016? Anybody?
3022000	3026000	In gaming. And I opened this up to the chatters as well over at live.vognower.com.
3026000	3038000	I want a new Animal Crossing, like a real one. Just how much fun I've had with Amiibo Festival. They've got the assets there. They could easily do another Animal Crossing for the Wii U, and I think we'll see it this year.
3038000	3040000	Nah, I think that'd be for the NX at this point.
3040000	3047000	You know, with what I predict or threw out there about the NX, imagine if you could play your village on the TV and then you could take it with you wherever you go.
3047000	3053000	You know, that could make for a very interesting launch title for NX. We'll see. Loki?
3053000	3067000	I don't know. I mean, something Minecraft related, maybe? I mean, they've got that IP now. I mean, they released it on Wii U and that's okay. Will we see a sequel to Minecraft?
3067000	3068000	Minecraft 2?
3068000	3073000	Isn't there supposed to be a Minecraft movie coming out at some point? I mean, the Minecraft story mode is okay.
3074000	3086000	I don't know. I kind of hope that they finish patching the PC version, the Windows 10 version, because that client is fucking rocking. Just, you know, keep up the good work. That's all I'm saying.
3086000	3087000	Get the features. Get them in there.
3087000	3097000	Yeah, get the features in there, because the client is amazing. I love it. Because my PC's not very fast. My laptop runs awesome.
3098000	3113000	Alright, looking at our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com for some crazy predictions. Brad from PodCulture saying, Nintendo cuts a deal with Sega and the NX is the Dreamcast 2. If only. Can you imagine launching with a Mario and Sonic game?
3113000	3130000	All I hope, I mean, as much as I dig on the game, because I think that they've really gone in a stupid direction and it's so, I still can't help but play them. I really hope there's another Saints Row game coming out soon, because I do love that series.
3130000	3142000	It's just, I love the characters in the series. Just, it's really, just try to come into your own game. Stop fucking knocking off Crackdown at this point. I mean, come on. Just make your own game out of it.
3143000	3154000	Alright, we're a good 50 minutes into the show, so I think that's plenty of time for a kickoff topic. So, let's get into our gaming week. So, we're going to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
3154000	3163000	And then we'll get into the weekend news, which, as you can imagine, was a little bit slower than usual, but we still have a few things to talk about. But first, our gaming week. StarkSoccer, how was your gaming week?
3163000	3176000	A little busy. I mean, I played, we had Animal Crossing, Amoeba Festival. I'm still playing Happy Home Designer. We played some Super Smash Brothers. I've totally lost some of my Kirby skill.
3176000	3198000	What else did I play? A little bit of Dragon Age Inquisition. Not too much. Yeah, really just that. And if you want to go for non-video. Oh, actually, no, we did play some Black Knight 2000, because I was playing some pinball and some jackpot. So, there you go.
3198000	3201000	Okay. Loki, how about your gaming week?
3202000	3214000	Bobby's saying, don't make the game the fans want. Make the game that I would consider good. Hey, I considered Saints Row the Third good. It's just when they went fucking crazy with the superhero powers that they make any fucking sense.
3214000	3224000	Saints Row the Third was pretty good, except for that they, like, knocked off the bad guy super quick. And that's, I didn't like that. I thought they could have done a little bit better, but whatever.
3224000	3240000	Anyways, this week, or I should say the last few weeks, I played quite a bit of stuff. So, first off, of course, played Ingress, so did that. And then, I played lots of Fallout 4. I'm not really playing through the story portion, but there's so many side quests and everything that I've been just kind of busy doing all that.
3240000	3264000	And I've got, let's see, I've got Kate as my companion, who's completely maxed out as far as, you know, and then I get her perk or whatever. So, I switched to Nick Valentine, who's like the synth detective guy, which is pretty awesome. So, I'm switched to him. And then, I don't know, I'm just carrying a shit ton of garbage with me.
3265000	3275000	Like, I'm just dragging the Commonwealth in my pockets. It's ridiculous. So, you know, because I'm like, I'm over-encumbered anyways, I'm like, what's it going to matter if I just...
3275000	3276000	It's video game logic, it's fine.
3276000	3298000	You can carry 350. You're carrying 5,000. So, whatever. So, I've been playing that. And then, Eric, who wanted me to download Earth Defense Force 4.1, I did that. And then, he couldn't play, so I'm stuck playing that game now by myself.
3299000	3300000	I like that such a bad thing.
3300000	3317000	It's Earth Defense Force. This one's extremely cheap as far as the way the enemies act. I mean, it's even worse than 2017. Which, that's just the game. But it is frustrating sometimes. Like, it's like, here, let me ramp it up to hardest. I should be able to beat that. And they'll just get swarmed by everything.
3317000	3324000	But that's the game. It's insanely hard. So, whatever. But I've been kind of bouncing around with that a little bit.
3324000	3340000	I downloaded a game called Laser Life on PlayStation 4, which is the new game from the guys that did Bit Trip. So, it's like this Rez amplitude-type music game.
3340000	3341000	Oh, really?
3341000	3355000	And it's used like the analog sticks to move these two lasers around the screen. And then, there's like circles or whatever objects you have to hit with lasers. And you pull the triggers to the beat.
3355000	3364000	And so, you have to do that. And then, you're like syncing memories of this dead astronaut or something. I'm not really sure what the story is. But they've got that kind of going along with it. It's a little trippy.
3364000	3373000	The other thing I don't like about that, though, is it's hard to line up your lasers with whatever the targets are because it's very hard to tell perspective-wise where they're at on the screen.
3373000	3384000	So, that's a little bit frustrating. And also, with the analog sticks, it's really hard to kind of like, okay, I need it to be kind of half this way and a little bit up. It's just too hard to be accurate with it.
3384000	3405000	But I did pick that up for like three bucks. So, whatever. I mean, that's cool. I played quite a bit of Disney Infinity 3.0. My son's been playing the Toy Box stuff because he got 2.0. He doesn't want to play any of the levels. He wants me to play the levels. I'm like, no, you're playing the levels. I mean, the game is for you. You're playing those levels.
3405000	3421000	I'm like, come on. You should be doing that. But he has a ton of fucking characters. We got him so many characters. He's got almost all the Avengers except for Hawkeye and Hawkman.
3421000	3439000	Hawkeye and Falcon. That's what I'm thinking. So, Hawkeye and Falcon. I was searching all over the place for the Spider-Man set because that's really hard to find. I'm trying to pick up a lot of the 2.0 stuff now because it's dirt cheap and they're closing it out.
3439000	3455000	And so, he wanted Spider-Man. And so, I finally found the Spider-Man set. And then I picked myself up a Sam Flynn because I thought it was cool. And then he wanted a Yoda. So, he has a Yoda now too. And then my youngest son has an Olaf.
3455000	3471000	So, overall, he's got, I think, probably 15 characters already within a week. I almost bought another five the other day because they were so cheap. I was like, I kind of want to do that. But he was like, I don't really want these characters. I'm like, okay, fine.
3471000	3484000	Because they had Baymax and stuff like that. And I was like, oh, sweet. I can pick up that. And you have more characters to play as. But I'm like, oh, man, if I pick these up, my wife is going to be fucking pissed. So, when are you buying more of those four?
3484000	3494000	So, but, I mean, it's hard to, you know, complain when they're like five bucks each. I mean, seriously. So, he's been playing quite a bit of that. I played some of it just to level up the character.
3494000	3520000	And then finally actually getting to figure out how to actually use the Toy Box mode. I played some of the pre-made stuff. They had one that was kind of a knockoff of Splatoon that you play. So, that was okay. But, I mean, they can't really get that involved and deep. It's not like LittleBigPlanet or LittleBigPlanet or Mario Maker and stuff. I mean, you're very limited on what you can make in the game. But it's fun.
3520000	3531000	I'm sorry. This comment from our chat is too hilarious over at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby Blackwolf says, Loki is like the George Lucas of Saints Row. Don't make the game fans want. Make the game that I would consider good.
3531000	3547000	Well, yeah, that's what I read earlier. But, yeah, I mean, so. I would make a game that's a cross between Saints Row the third and Saints Row two. I mean, I thought those were great games. And you get the guys involved with, you know, the gentleman in the row. And I think you get a pretty good game.
3547000	3561000	It's the problem. The problem is they went with the whole matrix. It's the matrix problem is what I call it. They made Neo too fucking powerful too quickly. How the fuck do you go from there? Now the world, they fucking destroyed Earth and they...
3561000	3562000	Spoilers.
3562000	3576000	Well, come on. That's Saints Row the fourth. They destroyed Earth and fucking went to hell and in like another completely separate game. And they're traveling through time now. It's not fucking Saints Row anymore. It's a completely fucking different game.
3576000	3594000	They wanted to make a fucking space game or just knock off. I don't know what it was. But, like, it's not so much that Saints Row four was bad in that sense with the superhero powers. I'm fine with you having the crazy powers and stuff. But they just recycled the fucking third game all over again. That's all they did was recycle everything to make another game.
3594000	3595000	Alright, alright, alright.
3595000	3603000	It was an expansion that they made into a full game. That's all it was. That's my problem. But I still wanted another one.
3603000	3605000	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
3606000	3607000	Um, no.
3607000	3632000	Okay. My gaming week. Actually, not a lot of new stuff, but I've been playing like a lot of just stuff that I have. Like, you know, a lot more Baume & Essie 14 because I play that a lot. Diablo 3. I got Prap of the Rappa on PlayStation 4. Prap of the Two, excuse me, on PlayStation 4. And I was playing a little bit of that. So I kind of appreciate the whole PlayStation 2 classics. And I actually never did have that disc. Somehow I completely missed that game.
3632000	3633000	I have like two of them.
3633000	3639000	Isn't that weird that I just didn't have it? But I do now on PlayStation 4. So I was playing some of that.
3639000	3649000	The only new game that I really checked out this week was on Steam. I checked out a game called Distance, which is like a racing game.
3649000	3667000	But it kind of reminds me of a cross between the Tron Runar game with the look of it being all very neon and like Blur, I guess a little bit. Remember how Blur was kind of like, that game was really underrated, I think. I just don't know why that game didn't do better.
3667000	3675000	Distance kind of reminds me of that look a little bit. So it's early access, though, so it's hard to tell exactly what the full picture is going to look like for that game.
3675000	3681000	And I think it's weird that you control it with a keyboard because that only is going to allow so much for controls.
3681000	3690000	But okay, I enjoyed what I was playing with it. It's fast and you do absurd things like flying over ramps and you fly up onto another track and so forth.
3690000	3699000	So I'm liking how I'm getting all these fast racing games lately to fill in my gap since I don't have F-Zero with fast racing Neo on Wii U.
3699000	3706000	I have to show that to you at some point, Loki. It's kind of fun. You got to see that. So yeah, fast racing games. So Distance was new when I played that.
3706000	3714000	I also went back on Steam and I revisited a game and this came out probably a couple years ago at this point. I don't know why I randomly picked it up, but I did.
3715000	3725000	And it's a game called Before the Echo, which is a music game. And I believe it used to be called Sequence, but there was something with the rights holders to that.
3725000	3732000	I think Sequence is like a card game making company or something. They make Skipbo or one of those games, I think.
3732000	3738000	So basically, the makers of the computer game, Sequence, had to change the names. They call it Before the Echo.
3738000	3746000	And it's kind of like you're playing DDR step mania because you're not really dancing. You're using your fingers.
3746000	3751000	But the interesting thing about it is you have three different grids that you're having to cycle between.
3751000	3759000	So it's like you can do the step pattern in the mana well to regain your mana, but then you have to go over to the spell one to cast a spell.
3759000	3763000	Or you want to go to the defend one to hit those buttons or you're going to lose hit points.
3763000	3772000	It's kind of an interesting mechanic. It's not just straight up finger-finger revolution. It's a little more strategy into it as to when do I cast my spells and so forth.
3772000	3779000	So yeah, I just was randomly playing that and having a good time with it. So check that one out.
3779000	3786000	And that was pretty much my gaming week. I feel like I've played a lot of games, but not a lot of new stuff that's worth talking about.
3787000	3792000	MMO playing will do that to you. And of course I play Ingress as well, but I don't know. That's just kind of a given.
3792000	3799000	I've told every story I'm going to tell with that game. I hit level 13 in the past week.
3799000	3807000	Cool. I got my silver fueling one. The one for MU or whatever.
3807000	3808000	Good job.
3808000	3817000	I don't know. Everyone's like, I kind of wanted to go. Everyone did this big ole, they have different missions in the game. A lot of them they create banners.
3817000	3824000	So all the little icons for all the missions make giant banners. So there's one that's like, was it the Sacramento Enlightened one?
3824000	3826000	60 missions.
3826000	3828000	Yeah, it's ridiculous the amount of missions.
3828000	3833000	I haven't done it yet either. So when you decide that you want to do it, I'll go with you. And maybe we can drag Alan into it if he's off work.
3833000	3835000	That would be fun. I mean, I just don't know.
3835000	3841000	It takes five hours. So you have to plan. But let me know because I still need to do that one too. It would be fun.
3841000	3848000	Alright, so that's it for our gaming weeks. So we have some housekeeping and then we'll get into the news for the week.
3848000	3857000	Housekeeping is follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. And we are also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3857000	3863000	As well as Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
3863000	3872000	And there will be no live show in February on the 21st, I want to say it is.
3872000	3878000	There will be no live show on the 21st of February because I will actually be back east. Yeah, it's the 21st.
3878000	3886000	I'll be back east at MAGFest. We'll try to tape something earlier in the week so that way, you know, because we had a lot of gaps in November and stuff.
3886000	3890000	Just due to various goings on. So I hate missing shows. So we'll try to fill that in.
3890000	3895000	Well, speaking of missing shows, all of you will be deprived of me next week.
3895000	3899000	Party! Party! No, I'm kidding. We'll miss you.
3899000	3903000	Yes, with everything you throw. Will your aim improve?
3903000	3911000	Yeah, well, considering where you're going, I have the right to be hateful and jealous. So you know what? Deal with it.
3911000	3913000	Last week of Bucket of Meat.
3914000	3917000	At Disneyland. Because you don't know what you're talking about when you say Bucket of Meat.
3917000	3923000	It's the Big Thunder BBQ. They serve all of their food in these little metal buckets. Hence, Bucket of Meat.
3923000	3926000	Sounds delicious.
3926000	3927000	It's amazing.
3927000	3929000	Do you get to eat it on the ride? Because that'd be cool.
3929000	3931000	Some people have.
3931000	3935000	It's going away because they're bulldozing it to make Star Wars land.
3935000	3940000	Technically, you can take like a go box and you can eat your ribs on the ride.
3940000	3946000	Maybe one of two good things will come out of this. One, they'll move it to California Adventure. I mean, why not? That'd be great.
3946000	3948000	Two, Victoria will steal me a bucket.
3948000	3954000	Two, perhaps they'll have Bucket of Jar Jar in Star Wars land.
3954000	3959000	And you can actually eat the flesh of Jar Jar Binks.
3959000	3963000	That would be poisonous. It'd be like eating Fugu.
3964000	3970000	A lot of people have seen that story floating around Facebook. I'm sure about everything they've got to close at Disneyland.
3970000	3973000	Either temporarily or permanently to make room for Star Wars land.
3973000	3982000	Well, the thing is, I actually do like the ranch there. But someone has decided to adopt all the animals there and start caring for them.
3982000	3983000	Yes.
3983000	3990000	But I thought it was, it's sort of getting rid of something that was part of, I think, Disney's vision, you know?
3990000	3997000	That you take care of, you know, it's educational on top of everything.
3997000	4003000	And that it provided, you know, a look into caring for animals and livestock and whatnot.
4003000	4007000	I know. I kind of liked it when it wasn't necessarily themed around a certain property lands.
4008000	4013000	That's the thing that kind of bugs me about it too. And don't get me wrong, I love me some Star Wars.
4013000	4019000	And Star Tours is one of my favorite rides in Tomorrowland. But A, they have Tomorrowland for things like that.
4019000	4027000	And B, yeah, I'm kind of the same as way. I think if they're going to do a land centered around one movie, it should be a California Adventure or a new park or something.
4027000	4030000	You know, because California Adventure has Cars Land and that works out okay.
4030000	4032000	Aren't they talking about making a third park anyways?
4032000	4038000	Yeah, and that's why I don't understand why they won't do Star Wars Land there.
4038000	4047000	Unless the new park is going to be an animal, like a SeaWorld competitor type of thing where it's an animal like Wild Kingdom in Japan, in Florida.
4047000	4053000	Or maybe a water park. It may not be the same type of park as Disney and California Adventure.
4053000	4058000	I don't know. It's kind of like a lot of that's very nostalgic. It's like, you know, 50's Disneyland type stuff.
4058000	4066000	I feel weird about a Star Wars Land in Disney proper. California Adventure, they can do whatever because that's kind of the more modern park.
4066000	4071000	But I feel very weird about how they're getting rid of stuff to make Star Wars Land.
4071000	4078000	And again, that's no disrespect to Star Wars. It's just a weird thing to have a land for at Disneyland. Anyway.
4078000	4083000	But I would be totally fine with them, you know, smoothing it over with me by creating some Tron specific rides.
4084000	4089000	Right? They could just move it over. The people mover turning into Tron bikes.
4089000	4093000	The people mover. Because there was that whole little Tron part in there.
4093000	4099000	And they do have, let's not forget the Disney. Is it Shanghai Disney or something? It has a fucking Tron light bike ride.
4099000	4104000	That was all over Facebook a few months ago when that opened. That looks fucking rad.
4104000	4110000	Or they should do one that's like, you know, Soarin' Over California. Let's just get rid of Soarin' Over California because it's fine.
4110000	4114000	But do that as the actual gliders? The light gliders or whatever they had?
4114000	4121000	Actually, if I remember right, Soarin' is going through a big closure. If it's not now, it's coming up and they are redoing the movie.
4121000	4129000	So it's going to be something new. So, I don't know. I don't think it'll be Tron because I think Disney is kind of distancing itself from that.
4129000	4131000	Why? It's so good!
4131000	4135000	It'll be Frozen. It'll be the Frozen take flight.
4135000	4139000	Fuck Frozen. No, seriously. I mean, Frozen's an okay property. That's fine.
4139000	4147000	But Tron is so good. I seriously was hyping up my son about the Tron figure and he wanted to play as him and stuff like that.
4147000	4152000	And I'm like, hey, let's watch Tron. And so he's like, no, I don't want to watch that.
4152000	4156000	I'm like, why not? It's so awesome. He's like, no, I don't want to watch that.
4156000	4161000	So I watched it anyways at the beginning of Tron Legacy. And then he watched some of the light cycle battles and thought it was cool.
4161000	4169000	But he still didn't want to watch it. But it's such a good movie. Why does that not get its own treatment and stuff?
4169000	4176000	Why are they just dumping on that universe? But, I don't know. Whatever other fucking movie they're making 80 billion of or something.
4176000	4178000	Cinderella 4 or something like that.
4178000	4182000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says, Soarin' over Hoth.
4182000	4187000	Look, I love Star Wars, but we need not to go the Frozen route with Star Wars.
4188000	4193000	We don't need to do everything. Let's not forget, Disney has a lot of cool stuff.
4193000	4196000	Let's give everybody a little piece of something.
4196000	4200000	Alright, anyway. Let's move on. We gotta get into some news.
4200000	4204000	We could talk Disneyland all night, but believe it or not, there was some video game news this week we gotta get to.
4204000	4206000	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
4206000	4208000	There's no news. Unless it's Tron news.
4209000	4216000	So, apparently, Activision is in talks to acquire nearly all of the MLG.
4216000	4228000	I'm not sure if a deal has been signed so far, but apparently they're very close to signing a deal if they haven't already done that.
4228000	4231000	And so that's the thing. We haven't really seen a confirmation yet.
4231000	4237000	According to the rumors, they're supposed to be paying about $46 million in cash and assuming all liabilities.
4237000	4246000	And, of course, they're supposed to be, I guess, some of the shareholders will be getting money from that.
4246000	4254000	I'm sure this is just to kind of help with, you know, getting some more exposure for Call of Duty. Definitely that would help.
4254000	4259000	You know, they've been wanting to try to get that as an esports game and this will definitely help.
4259000	4269000	And, you know, Blizzard's mobile kind of helping get that a little bit going.
4269000	4274000	And, actually, a lot of the stuff Blizzard's been putting out would be kind of perfect for the esports scene.
4274000	4280000	Yeah, between Hearthstone, StarCraft, and Heroes of the Storm, they kind of have a lot of that stuff locked up.
4280000	4287000	And World of Warcraft arena mode is also very popular. And I think they're trying to get some of that in Diablo now.
4287000	4293000	Season 5 of Diablo is supposed to have this whole set dungeon thing that you can run and it's for a time.
4293000	4298000	And I wonder if that's something that they'll try to see what they can put in Diablo to make it more competitive, too.
4298000	4303000	Because right now, PvP in Diablo is nothing. It's there, but nobody plays it.
4303000	4307000	So, it'll be interesting to see maybe what they try to do with Diablo with that.
4307000	4314000	That's interesting. I mean, I hope that that makes maybe things come a little bit more mainstream.
4314000	4321000	Because I think a lot of people don't really realize that this exists, especially a lot of casual game players and everything.
4321000	4328000	It's weird, because when you say that, I agree with you, yet at the same time I'm like it's exploding online.
4328000	4333000	And the whole numbers for Twitch TV is sometimes outranking cable channels.
4333000	4340000	You know, I think more people watch Twitch TV than were watching Heroes of the Storm on ESPN2 or whatever it was on.
4340000	4343000	It's just interesting to me.
4343000	4351000	I'm Bobby Blackwell following that up in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying ESPN fans know esports exists. They bitch about it.
4351000	4361000	But is that a conflict, though, with a game maker owning the game competitive branch as well?
4361000	4368000	Yeah, I can see some conflicts of interest, but it depends how they treat it.
4368000	4377000	Is it a conflict of interest for some of these cable companies that own certain things? I don't know.
4377000	4387000	I guess MLG isn't the only one out there, but you can certainly see where MLG will probably prominently feature the Activision products.
4387000	4393000	And maybe a little less emphasis on things that Activision doesn't do, like fighting games.
4393000	4396000	If you don't like it, then I'm sure someone else will come out with a competitor.
4396000	4399000	Change the channel. If you don't like it, change the channel.
4399000	4406000	Bobby Blackwell, though, pointing out it would be worse if a company which sponsored a team also owned the esports federation.
4406000	4414000	Because then I guess you'd be getting into a little bit of the whole that you don't want to favor the competitors, because then it makes the sport look rigged, basically.
4414000	4421000	Alright, let's move on and talk about a game announcement from this week.
4421000	4424000	An old game about to be made new again, sort of.
4424000	4433000	Final Fantasy IX has been announced that it will be coming to PCs and phones in the next year. Or this year, as the case may be.
4433000	4438000	I can't tell you how many times I saw the headline, and I was like, ooh, Final Fantasy XI!
4438000	4443000	Because my brain just flipped it around. I'm like, well, no, it's IX.
4443000	4447000	Well, good news! Final Fantasy XI is already on PC.
4447000	4455000	No, I understand that, but I thought they were going to be doing something new with it, like redoing it, doing an HD version, because I saw they're remaking, or remastering it.
4455000	4458000	I'm like, oh, yes, remastering XI. Oh, it's IX.
4458000	4464000	They will be pulling the plug on the 360 and Playstation versions in, what, like two months?
4464000	4467000	It's your last chance to get those 360 achievements if you still need them.
4467000	4468000	Oh, god, no.
4468000	4472000	Well, apparently it's easier to, like, grinding to 75 is no big deal now.
4472000	4475000	It's weird. That game's changed a lot from when I first saw it.
4475000	4478000	Yeah, how times have changed. It's like, I can't get to 50, I can't do this stupid quest.
4478000	4483000	Somebody needs to help me do the goddamn quest so I can get to 65.
4483000	4486000	I don't want to fight, Matt. It's too hard.
4486000	4493000	Alright, anyway, where were we? Oh, yes, Final Fantasy IX, Loki, being remastered for PC and phones.
4493000	4496000	My least favorite of the modern Final Fantasy.
4496000	4497000	Really?
4497000	4498000	Yeah.
4498000	4502000	I don't think I would use that strong, I mean...
4502000	4505000	I'm just weird, though. I liked VIII, so, you know, whatever.
4505000	4508000	I'm just begging the listeners to fight me, but I think VIII's...
4508000	4510000	You guys know how I feel about VIII.
4510000	4518000	I like the story in VIII, but I just can't stand the gameplay elements, so I think IX is certainly better than VIII, in fact, by a lot.
4518000	4522000	I think there's some elements of IX that are better than VII, but anyway, I digress.
4522000	4526000	You have a chance to rediscover your opinions for Final Fantasy IX when they release this.
4526000	4537000	Slightly better-looking characters in the trailer, so it looks like maybe some of the things that they had to compress to fit this on a PlayStation 1 disc, or three or four of them, however many it was on.
4537000	4540000	Maybe they have some uncompressed textures in there now.
4540000	4555000	Also, some of the things that are popular from the Final Fantasy VII PC release, as well as when it was ported to PlayStation 4, is auto-saving, achievements, and a high-speed mode, which I know a lot of people are using in Final Fantasy VII on their replays.
4555000	4571000	This is notable, too, because this game, as Loki's kind of inferring, never really got the same attention level post-release that VII, certainly VII, and a little bit VIII kind of got, so now this is a chance to experience it again.
4571000	4578000	I find the phone element of this interesting, too, that they're going to release this on phones, because that means they're going to release it like this on phones.
4579000	4585000	But then again, four CDs worth of data is what? Two gigs? That's no big deal for a cell phone game anymore.
4585000	4589000	I'm sure compression technology is a lot better than it used to be.
4589000	4595000	I know, so I'm sure actually running it on the phone is no big deal, so it's going to be very interesting. I probably won't bother playing it on the phone.
4595000	4597000	Oh god, no. Why would anyone do that?
4597000	4605000	But I'll do PC, and who knows? If they do the PlayStation 4 version, because they port from PC to PS4 like they did VII, it could be interesting.
4606000	4608000	By interesting being terrible.
4608000	4610000	I don't hate it like you do.
4610000	4618000	It doesn't look good. I had fond memories of VII and I played it on PC, and I'm like, oh my god, what the fuck?
4618000	4620000	Because your TV was different.
4620000	4632000	I understand that, but I'm just saying it does not hold up graphics-wise. I'm sure IX would be a little bit better, because the character models were way better, but it's just not quite the same.
4633000	4640000	Well, I'll give IX another look. It had some very interesting characters, I thought, in IX, so I'm going to give that a look when the PC version comes out.
4640000	4652000	I hope they do get a chance to enhance some of the graphics, but I have a feeling it's just going to be magic with rendering and uncompressed textures and things that'll make it look better.
4652000	4659000	I don't think they're going to go back and redo an awful lot, although they did show glimpses of the battle interface, and the battle interface did look different.
4659000	4663000	So maybe they are putting a little more work under the hood than you would think.
4663000	4669000	Because Final Fantasy VII and VIII on PC were pretty much ports with just a few extra things.
4669000	4671000	So, we'll see.
4671000	4673000	Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura.
4673000	4675000	Who likes fashion?
4675000	4679000	I like Project Runway.
4679000	4683000	One day you're in, and one day you're out.
4683000	4687000	I'm sure we're all familiar with Louis Vuitton, right?
4688000	4694000	Is that the one that makes the handbags that all the middle-aged ladies are standing outside in a line?
4694000	4695000	Yeah.
4695000	4705000	Well, they've actually recruited a new model to show off the 2016 Spring Summer.
4705000	4710000	And it's me! It's me, you guys! I'm so flattered to be modeling bags.
4710000	4722000	So, the individual chosen by Nicolas Gasquere, I think it's Gasquere is the name, is Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII.
4722000	4726000	Lightning is the new model for Louis Vuitton.
4726000	4734000	This choice seems about four years out of date, but Lightning's cool. Why Lightning? That's such a weird choice.
4734000	4741000	Because apparently she is a hero, and they thought that she was perfect to show off the clothes.
4741000	4749000	And this isn't just reusing pictures of her with the clothes overlaid.
4749000	4756000	This is a collaboration with Square Enix's Visual Works studio.
4756000	4758000	So, Square Enix is actually putting resources-
4758000	4759000	No Moreau was in on this.
4759000	4765000	Wow. So, I mean, granted, they're being paid by Louis Vuitton for it, but they're actually using resources to create these custom ads or whatever.
4765000	4771000	There's like video and everything of her walking around in the clothes and posing in attack poses with her purse.
4771000	4775000	Is this in Japan only? Because I don't-
4775000	4779000	They put this out on their social media, like all of it.
4780000	4791000	Target audiences don't seem to overlap, like the kind of ladies I would see playing Final Fantasy XIII and the ladies I would see lining up outside of Louis Vuitton's store aren't usually the same.
4791000	4795000	Again, sure, of course there's some people that are into both, but not enough to spend money.
4795000	4805000	It's not like this is the first time, because apparently they had a couple of characters modeling for Prada, and Square Enix worked with Rowan, the Japanese brand.
4806000	4810000	So, I mean, it's neat. I like one of the outfits.
4810000	4816000	However you want to spend those advertising dollars, I guess. I mean, might as well. It's better than burning them. I mean, sure.
4816000	4826000	Admittedly, I do think it's cool, and maybe, you know, even though I said, oh, but they don't overlap, maybe that's the whole effing point, is that maybe the idea is to try and, you know,
4826000	4831000	here we are talking about Louis Vuitton on a video game podcast. I mean, when does that ever happen?
4831000	4836000	So, maybe the dollars were well spent to get their name out there with an audience.
4836000	4841000	No, it's not well spent. Let's think about it. I mean, are our listeners going, oh my god, he mentioned Louis Vuitton. I'm gonna go buy a Louis Vuitton bag.
4841000	4847000	No one fucking cares! It just doesn't make any sense. We're just pointing out that that's a really dumb way to advertise that.
4847000	4848000	I disagree.
4848000	4851000	Go ahead, because then I have a comment.
4851000	4862000	Because if you think about it now, with, you know, for all of us who were gamers when we were younger, now we are old enough that we, some of the lady gamers who've grown up are the target audience.
4862000	4872000	You know, I could, in theory, go out and afford a Louis Vuitton bag. I could. I would not buy it, but I could.
4872000	4881000	And I think that it's sort of more taking a character that embodies an ideal and then applying that ideal as a branding point.
4881000	4891000	That, you know, here we have a woman who is very petite, very pretty, but still a strong character, and they want to tie that in with their brand.
4891000	4901000	So, I understand it from the marketing point of view. It actually is a neat gimmick. It's the same thing as Toyota using Hatsune Miku. So, not that big of a deal.
4901000	4906000	I don't get that one either, but whatever. I mean, if that's what they want to do, then that's what they can try.
4906000	4909000	The big thing? People are talking about it, and that's what they want.
4909000	4912000	But talking about something doesn't mean I'm going to go buy it.
4912000	4914000	It doesn't matter. It's still publicity.
4914000	4922000	I was going to say, if you want a Louis Vuitton bag, just go to certain street vendors in the back alleys of New York City and you'll get one real cheap.
4922000	4923000	L.A. too.
4923000	4926000	It's not legit. But the whole thing is, is that...
4926000	4927000	It says Louis Vuitton on it.
4927000	4938000	Us right now. We are right now proving the point of their marketing campaign. Not a single one of us in this room is going to buy one, but we're talking about it.
4938000	4947000	That argument can be made that all this fuckery that Comcast does with their shitty service is actually good advertisement because we're talking about them.
4947000	4955000	That doesn't make any sense. I understand that there's no such thing as bad advertisement, but it doesn't sell anything.
4955000	4961000	I get where you're coming from, but I actually think she's right because...
4961000	4967000	Who is it that said this? Was it Paula Abdul or somebody that said, even if they're talking bad about you, they're still talking about you.
4967000	4973000	And it's like, okay, how is Kim Kardashian famous? That whole thing. How is Kim Kardashian famous?
4973000	4983000	Oh, look at that ass clown Trump. I mean, the whole... He spews shit every time his numbers start to take a dip.
4983000	4987000	And what happens after that? Up goes numbers.
4987000	4990000	And you can get a toupee in the back alleys in New York City as well.
4990000	4998000	It doesn't change the fact that he's a shit spewing ass clown, you know, but it's proof right there.
4999000	5005000	Bonz006 in chat says Dunkin Donuts uses Domo. Is that true? That's kind of rad. I like Dunkin Donuts and Domo.
5005000	5009000	Let's just pick random company that use random Japanese icon.
5009000	5019000	How about this though, Loki? I remember a time when if you were into video games, you were a nerd and it was the outcast and it was that part of society.
5019000	5025000	Now, the ultra suave fashionable handbags are going to video game characters.
5025000	5030000	And, you know, whether it helps or not or whatever, I still think that's kind of like... It's like a victory in a way.
5030000	5036000	It's like video games are mainstream with audiences we ever thought it would crack through to. Does that make sense?
5036000	5042000	No. No, it doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry. It's because you make this choice to advertise this way.
5042000	5046000	It doesn't mean it's like all of a sudden breakthroughs have been made in society.
5046000	5058000	Oh my god, we're accepted now. It's a choice. It's like if they use Friskies and Nancat or something like that.
5058000	5062000	It just wouldn't fucking make any sense. At least that has a cat.
5062000	5069000	Wait, but Friskies did do that iPad thing for cats? What the fuck was that? Is your cat really going to know?
5069000	5077000	Alright, forget it. Forget it. I'm all out of evens. I can do nothing but can't right now.
5077000	5084000	So, we're going to move on to the next story. Everybody's had their say. Next story.
5084000	5098000	So, Valve, of course, they come out to actually talk about the issues that they were having regarding basically some cashing problems that were causing people to be able to see the account information of other people.
5099000	5108000	During the whole holiday sale. And I guess in regards to this, they were doing something. They had an outside company that was helping them fight against some DDoS attacks.
5108000	5117000	And they made a change to their cashing system that unfortunately caused some people to see the information on the accounts of other people.
5117000	5129000	And this included just some basic information. Their address and email address that they had associated with PayPal.
5129000	5135000	Last couple digits of the credit card number and that type of thing.
5135000	5145000	But, of course, they were saying, though, that this didn't necessarily include the full credit card numbers, user passwords, or anything like that.
5145000	5152000	They didn't allow anything to be changed with this. They just saw your purchase history and that type of stuff.
5152000	5158000	Well, you missed it last week, Loki, because I had a Loki-level rant about what happened with the whole Steam thing.
5158000	5166000	And at the end of the day, I was kind of throwing out there, isn't this in some ways worse than a credit card breach with somebody's private information out there?
5166000	5168000	Because some of us are very protective about that information.
5168000	5173000	So, I'm not going to rehash, because obviously things have changed with this announcement and so forth.
5173000	5179000	So, I've been getting some questions about, well, where's your head at now that Steam has finally replied to this?
5179000	5184000	And for one, there is a part of me that's like, well, it did take them a while to do it.
5184000	5192000	But, I'm trying to be mindful, it was the holidays, it's realistic, nobody was in the office, and this was a vendor issue.
5192000	5197000	At the end of the day, we can talk about the reasons why and all that stuff until we're blue in the face.
5197000	5203000	I'm glad Steam finally admitted something happened. I feel they explained it pretty well.
5203000	5207000	I mean, what happened, whether we agree with it or not.
5207000	5210000	My question is, what are they going to basically do from here?
5210000	5213000	I really would like to see how they can kind of prevent this from happening again.
5213000	5223000	And I understand, okay, well, if they're using this vendor or whatever and the person made a mistake there, mistakes happen, maybe there's not a lot that can be done.
5223000	5231000	But my throwback to that would be, why are you showing full addresses and this credit card information and all this in the first place?
5231000	5237000	Like, maybe Steam needs to evaluate what they're actually showing, the pages that they're generating in the first place.
5237000	5241000	If they don't have a need to show the customer the full address and all that stuff, then don't show it.
5241000	5246000	Because I know every time I buy a game, I see my address and name. Do I need that?
5246000	5251000	And to be fair, I'm a little ignorant when it comes to business law and all that.
5251000	5260000	So if there is a law that says they have to show that before I can run my card or something, then okay, I guess we've hit a wall.
5260000	5266000	But if they only need to show, like, my zip code, I would prefer that.
5266000	5272000	Because I also know when I buy games on the Wii U, they don't show my full address, they only ever ask for my zip code.
5272000	5277000	So I kind of feel like maybe that, and so you kind of ask, well, Rob, what would you like to see done?
5277000	5285000	That's what I would like to see done is, why is the content of those pages, why do we have so many people exposed to this?
5285000	5289000	The ability to edit my address should be a page I access extremely infinitely.
5289000	5298000	Yeah, I don't think that they need that on there. I mean, it's not that way through other, you know, if I'm purchasing on PlayStation Network or purchasing Xbox Live, I don't ever have to do that.
5298000	5302000	Yeah, I feel like I don't see that when I purchase on the other networks.
5302000	5311000	So, yeah, but at least I'm glad they fessed up, there's something going on, and, you know, Steam will get my trust back.
5311000	5314000	I bought two games today, so I guess we're already back there.
5314000	5324000	But I just, you know, I'm glad they are going to try to figure out who all's information was exposed and figure out, you know, what they're going to do.
5324000	5334000	I guess for the most part, you were probably seeing people's information in another country, so maybe there wasn't a whole lot you could do.
5334000	5341000	But I just, I hope they'll offer credit monitoring or something to those affected people if they choose to do it.
5341000	5347000	Well, I don't know if they should do that, because it's really only two digits of the credit card number. I mean, that's nothing.
5347000	5359000	I have a feeling what's going to happen is that they're going to say, hey, because your information was exposed, we're going to offer you an apology package, you know, click here to redeem.
5359000	5372000	And it'll be a copy of, what, Portal 2 and maybe some other Valve goodies. But in order to accept it, you're going to have to agree, you're going to basically electronically sign a clause that you won't participate in a class action lawsuit.
5372000	5381000	I also, by the way, back to having a couple of the numbers being exposed, I wouldn't be too worried about that, because I do believe that the first four numbers have a credit card number just to identify the vendor.
5382000	5394000	I think it's always last four they show, though. But yeah, but anyway, I mean, like, and I talked about this last week, actually, the credit end of it, I'm kind of like, your credit vendors are there to help protect you from that kind of stuff.
5394000	5403000	I'm actually not even as worried about that as the whole name and address thing. But I've calmed down a little bit from where we were at last week. I do feel like we're able to move forward from this.
5403000	5412000	I just, my suggestion to Steam would be, please evaluate, do you need to be showing addresses? Why are you generating all this information on the page?
5412000	5424000	If there's a legal reason to do it, then okay, I guess we're stuck. But I don't, again, I don't recall seeing my full address when I buy on Wii U or when I buy on PlayStation Network or Xbox One.
5424000	5430000	So maybe Steam needs to adopt a similar policy. That would be where I'd like to see things move forward.
5430000	5440000	Anyway, JohnnyB7990 in chat says, I'd like to know what they will do also. I bought a few games over the winter sale.
5440000	5447000	Well, did you buy on Christmas morning? Because that would be the time that you would be worried if you were on the store when this was going on.
5447000	5454000	So hopefully not. I hope none of our people got affected by that. My fingers are crossed for you guys.
5454000	5459000	And hopefully if your information was shown, it was shown to somebody who had no idea what to do with it.
5459000	5465000	Hopefully another honest person who said, you know, I probably shouldn't be looking at this and close the window. Hopefully.
5465000	5473000	Well, there was some like I read when it first came out, like there was a guy that had that happen. And that's kind of how the whole thing got kind of rolling is they saw that information.
5473000	5480000	They actually contacted the guy. They said, hey, I saw your information. Just wanted to let you know what's going on.
5480000	5484000	Huh. Interesting. I wonder how that guy responded. Interesting.
5485000	5492000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase reward.
5492000	5500000	All right. Well, moving on. Speaking of stuff going on on Steam, you know, they have this whole holiday sale that I think finishes at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
5500000	5505000	Right. And they they did it a little different this time. They just had I may have bought Rocket League.
5505000	5510000	And that's OK. That's a good choice. We should play sometime. It's fun. They just had kind of like a big bucket of sales.
5510000	5516000	They didn't really do the whole like hourly daily. They just kind of were like, everything's on sale. Go.
5516000	5524000	It was kind of a lazy sale, but I think we're all OK with it because it was pretty easy to understand how the sale worked this year.
5524000	5533000	You didn't have to be like, all right, buy the game when it's on a daily or a flash sale, but don't buy it if it's not on the like that kind of those rules were not really a part of it this time anyway.
5533000	5539000	But apparently there was a whole nother thing going on that people haven't really picked up on for the most part.
5539000	5542000	But thank you to gaming blogs. We're learning about it.
5542000	5550000	Apparently, the North Pole Noir Web comic that was unveiled through the different trading cards that you could get during the sale.
5550000	5558000	There is actually a type of ARG that these cards are exposing. There's a whole Reddit even dedicated to this.
5558000	5564000	It's the Reddit steam sale detectives. And I guess people are finding some crazy stuff about this ARG.
5564000	5574000	So I guess there was a hidden password prompt in the steam store. And to make this visible, you would do like you type search and then you get a field that pops up.
5574000	5583000	And if you do this on the Hitman Codename 47 page and type a big long stream and hit enter, you get a dialog box that is something you put in the URL.
5583000	5590000	I mean, it's totally one of those ARG like it's really hard to figure out. And I don't think they've figured out the answer to the whole thing yet.
5590000	5598000	And who knows if Valve is going to say anything about it. Like, you know, I doubt that Half-Life 3 is at the end of it, but there could be something interesting.
5598000	5606000	Also, there was an achievement, I think, on some Valve designers profile that said something about ARG.
5606000	5612000	So people are wondering if there isn't a hidden Steam badge or a Steam achievement tied to the ARG.
5612000	5621000	But, since the sale is over at 10am tomorrow morning, who knows if anybody is going to get it. Or maybe the ARG will continue. We'll see.
5621000	5623000	Alright, moving on. DarkSakura.
5623000	5630000	Well, this is something that could be done in the previous Fallout games, but Fallout 4 made it really freaking difficult.
5630000	5641000	That you could actually beat Fallout 4 without killing anybody. Or at least without you being the one that did the killing.
5641000	5651000	And it almost broke the game because they really programmed it in to where you sort of have to go around, you know, killing people here and there and fighting certain enemies.
5651000	5663000	But, this one guy pretty much went through it trying to get other people to do his dirty work for him. The guy's name is Kyle Hinckley.
5663000	5675000	And he basically beat Fallout 4 with zero kills in survival mode. By, you know, bumping up his pacifist stats and whatnot.
5675000	5683000	And then talking to other people and trying to charm them into doing the killing and many many many resets.
5683000	5689000	But he also found certain mechanics in the game, how some characters were tied to the others.
5689000	5699000	And how if your minions do kills for you, it counts as your kill. So he had to really be careful with it.
5699000	5704000	And have basically talk other people into doing the killing or get different things to happen.
5704000	5710000	And it was pretty neat. The article's a good read. But the thing that I like is just how it goes into the mechanics of the game.
5710000	5721000	And how, you know, the game makers expect certain things to happen and when you don't do things exactly the way that they've programmed it into the game.
5721000	5725000	Or you found ways to circumvent it. It's sort of like the world doesn't know what to do.
5725000	5732000	It's pretty interesting. I mean, lots of reloading and reloading and reloading. But he pulled it off, so kudos.
5732000	5738000	It's interesting. I see this happen a lot in games that people take a bit of a pacifist approach.
5738000	5745000	I know we were talking before the show. It isn't really pacifist because he's having somebody else do the killing. But, you know, technicalities.
5745000	5749000	He's sort of doing the purple man version.
5749000	5753000	Yeah, I see this happen in MMOs a lot. Especially when I was doing Hoard House.
5754000	5764000	We'd always be talking about, oh, this player got from 0 to 60 without ever killing another character because they picked herbs to get the whole way there.
5764000	5771000	Because the crafting in the game gives you experience and all that stuff. So it's interesting how people will take these alternative approaches in games.
5771000	5774000	Make jewelry for social progression and profit.
5776000	5780000	Step one, pacifism. Step two, question mark. Step three, profit.
5781000	5784000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5784000	5793000	One other thing that I do want to mention is that there was another one about someone going through and killing everybody in, I think, Fallout New Vegas.
5793000	5799000	And about how that kind of broke some of the mechanics, too, and left you with permanently immortal NPCs.
5799000	5809000	See, this is how we know that Undertale is taking over gaming because you've got people taking the pacifism approach and people taking the genocide approach in other games.
5810000	5816000	Alright, in all seriousness, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and video games that are coming out to a store near you.
5816000	5823000	Although I expect it's probably still going to be a little empty this week, even though we do have folks getting back to work this week.
5823000	5828000	I don't know if we're going to have a very busy release calendar, but we'll start with Loki in the US.
5830000	5831000	Not a thing.
5831000	5832000	Not a thing.
5832000	5834000	Not a thing. Not a thing for a few weeks, actually.
5834000	5836000	For a few weeks. I seem to remember we've had some-
5836000	5840000	January's pretty light, and it's been even worse the last few years, so yeah.
5840000	5844000	Well, didn't we get, like, wasn't Lightning Returns a January release a few years ago?
5844000	5845000	It was, yeah.
5845000	5848000	Borderlands had something in January at one point, didn't they?
5848000	5853000	Borderlands, yeah. I think Borderlands 2, wasn't it? I could be wrong.
5853000	5858000	No, Borderlands 2 was not. That wasn't so there. I don't think it was Borderlands. It wasn't Borderlands. It was, um...
5860000	5862000	There was something that came out, though, similar to that.
5862000	5863000	Yeah.
5863000	5868000	Maybe once in a while we'll have that random huge January, like, spend your gift card on me release,
5868000	5871000	but it seems like we're not really getting that this year here in the States.
5871000	5875000	They've delayed things far into 2016.
5875000	5878000	Well, going over to Japan, honestly, I see a very similar story.
5878000	5884000	Whenever I look at the consoles, I don't see anything as far as the living room console goes.
5884000	5889000	And even for the Vita, there's nothing out until January 14th, and that is true for the 3DS as well.
5889000	5892000	It's an empty week in Japan. Happy New Year. Play the games you got.
5892000	5894000	Dark Soccer, anything in the UK?
5894000	5895000	Nope.
5895000	5897000	This is a dry week for games.
5897000	5898000	Jack and shit.
5898000	5902000	This is a very dry week for games. Well, things will pick up again in Japan at least next week.
5902000	5908000	I don't know about the other regions, but this is usually the time of year where there's not much to say in this segment.
5908000	5910000	So let's get back into some news. Loki.
5910000	5918000	Alright, so as we've been talking about a lot of delays, you know, I want to say that the Vive was delayed not too long ago,
5918000	5926000	and now we have the Oculus Touch, the gamepad, or virtually all the handheld motion controllers that are going to be coming out with the Rift,
5926000	5936000	are coming out now until the second half of 2016, and saying that they need more time to make it even more comfortable, reliable, and natural.
5936000	5939000	So it could be a while.
5939000	5943000	And then along with that, though, you're going to get your launch game or packing game.
5943000	5947000	They're going to be including the Oculus Rift not only will you be getting...
5947000	5952000	they aren't supposed to be coming with the Xbox One controllers, but you're also going to be getting a game called Lucky's Tale,
5952000	5956000	which is kind of a cute little platformer game.
5956000	5962000	And that'll be something that's coming out whenever the Oculus decides to make its way out.
5962000	5969000	Now Bobby's in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying that the Touch was always coming out for holidays 2016.
5969000	5973000	This isn't a delay, it's just a reiteration, I guess.
5973000	5976000	Why do they need to reiterate?
5976000	5980000	For all you guys that were eager, just a reminder.
5980000	5982000	Wait.
5982000	5984000	It's interesting.
5984000	5988000	Alright, I don't know.
5988000	5990000	Well hopefully...
5990000	5992000	To hopefully make you forget about the fact that you came out and said,
5992000	5996000	oh yeah, I know what he says is going to be around this prize, but it's going to be a little bit more.
5996000	6000000	Hopefully games such as Lucky's Tale and the other games they put out again,
6001000	6003000	will make it worth it.
6003000	6007000	Alright, let's talk about SNK Playmore.
6007000	6010000	And this is, again, another story that involves Steam.
6010000	6014000	I feel like we have a ton of Steam stories tonight, but I guess that's where the news is at this week.
6014000	6022000	Well, SNK Playmore has actually been talking about how their Steam ports are helping the company out
6022000	6025000	and getting them back into making new games.
6025000	6031000	Back in November, SNK Playmore actually put out a statement saying that they're going to move away from the Pochi slot business
6031000	6034000	and go back into traditional game development.
6034000	6038000	And that's, of course, we love SNK Playmore for things like Fatal Fury, Samurai Showdown, and all that.
6038000	6041000	So they're going to get back into that a little bit.
6041000	6044000	And there was an interview recently with Famitsu.
6044000	6050000	And in that interview, Yutaka Noguchi, who's the chief of the gaming division,
6050000	6058000	said that PC ports like the King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition help them back towards game development.
6058000	6062000	And, of course, having the international recognition helps, too.
6062000	6069000	Even as of now, this is a quote, we're better known as a game company than as a Pochi slot company.
6069000	6073000	People still talk about us as a game company when we say our name.
6073000	6076000	So, that's all from the Famitsu interview.
6076000	6085000	So, interesting that the PC releases here in the States of those games kind of help them, I guess, show there's a market for it and the sales.
6085000	6091000	So, a lesson learned here. Konami, you should release your games on Steam, more of them.
6091000	6097000	Actually, they have been, though. I want to say the Castlevania, like the 3D Castlevania games are there on Steam.
6097000	6102000	Konami, you want to make some money? Well, actually, no, they're not going to make money this way because they have to license everything.
6102000	6107000	But, imagine releasing the DDR games as PC versions.
6107000	6109000	Well, they did. A long time ago.
6109000	6112000	I know they had DDR PC, but that's not the fucking same thing.
6112000	6116000	That gave us the gift of Mr. Spanky as a DLC character.
6116000	6122000	Yes, I know. That made no fucking sense. But, no, I'm talking about actually releasing the old games as PC downloads.
6122000	6125000	Make a USB game pad or something like that. That would be pretty cool.
6125000	6132000	I don't know. I don't know if it would work today. I feel like where we're at with technology is just a way different place.
6132000	6134000	Yeah, fine. I'll just pirate him instead, I guess.
6134000	6142000	That's what it's going to take. Or, eventually, just get my own arcade cabinet once I have the room and can do that.
6142000	6145000	The disposable income to do that.
6145000	6152000	Alright. Well, let's say an orange riot in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says DDR Infinitoss.
6152000	6158000	You know, there is that Beatmania 2DX Infinitoss thing that they're trying on PC.
6158000	6161000	So, maybe it's not outside the realm of possibility. Who knows?
6161000	6168000	Well, the most modern DDR games run on PC anyways. They run on PC at the arcade.
6168000	6170000	Because people have leaked to PC clients.
6170000	6178000	Well, yeah. And that's how people were playing Beatmania on PC. Being little pirates downloading the ROMs and all that stuff.
6178000	6179000	Opportunists.
6179000	6180000	We'll see.
6180000	6184000	Alright. Let's travel back to a more classic time.
6186000	6190000	Let's go back to when game companies were making games and less pachinko machines.
6190000	6195000	It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she says,
6195000	6199000	Hey. You. Play this. Because it's cool.
6199000	6207000	And Dark Sakura with a pick tonight that is a little more recent but still falls under that rule of 10 years older or more.
6207000	6209000	I did it on purpose.
6209000	6218000	And when I saw the game you picked, I was like, Oh my god. I remember talking about this game on the OLR to go edition.
6218000	6228000	And it's not exactly 10 years because technically, actually it is because the Japanese release was 2005.
6228000	6236000	Alright, Dark Sakura. What is the classic game of the week? Get ready for it, people. You guys are going to go, Oh my god. It's 10 years of all that.
6237000	6238000	Electroplankton.
6238000	6251000	And the reason why I picked Electroplankton in particular is because it was among the first releases in the US in 2006.
6251000	6258000	It came out on January 9th, 2006 in the US. It had already been out in Japan in 2005.
6258000	6266000	But Electroplankton, and there's really not a whole lot to say about it except it has one of the longest katakana names I have ever seen in my life.
6266000	6269000	Like Erakuto Parenkutom.
6269000	6280000	So, anyway, Electroplankton is a kind of a participation game, I should say.
6281000	6288000	It is an interactive music video game. And you have two versions of play. You have performance and audience.
6288000	6296000	And in performance mode, you basically tap on the little plankton or work with a plankton with the stylus and the touch screen and the microphone.
6296000	6303000	And then it lets you put down where you can play music with the plankton.
6303000	6310000	Audiences, basically, you just let them sing to you. The plankton make the music.
6310000	6319000	You can't interact with them like you can in performance mode. But it's like a demo, kinda, so you can hear them make music.
6319000	6321000	Can we listen to it for a minute, Rob?
6321000	6324000	Sure, of course. Let me try it.
6326000	6330000	And of course it stopped right as you said that. It's going in between stages.
6330000	6333000	Well, we'll get to the next stage and then we'll listen to it a little bit.
6333000	6337000	But the thing that I liked about it is that the music was just really peaceful for the most part.
6337000	6343000	Here you go. This is like the plankton are swimming around like these little leaves, I don't know, in like a...
6345000	6349000	Boy, every time we stop to listen to the music, it's a very non...
6352000	6354000	It's very relaxing, though.
6354000	6361000	It's very, like, I could see Enya singing along to this.
6361000	6368000	More like a little bit of ambience. But yeah, you're basically playing the music with your plankton.
6368000	6388000	Now, this game was developed by NT0, which also the game really only has the director's name directly on the packaging, which is Toshio Iwai.
6388000	6397000	And this was a decision made by Satoru Iwata because basically Iwai created the game alone.
6397000	6408000	The developers also had considered putting in a save function, but they didn't put it in because they wanted this to be something that you enjoy when you enjoy it.
6408000	6413000	It has to be in the moment and more visceral than that.
6413000	6420000	So they were thinking that if you put in a save function, instead of it becoming a moment of enjoyment, it's going to become a tool.
6420000	6432000	And that would also require more flash ROM storage, but they ended up dedicating that to the voice files for Vol Voice and RecRec.
6432000	6443000	The game did make its first public appearance at the Game Developers Conference, and then later the 2005 E3, which we were there for, remember?
6443000	6444000	I do.
6445000	6448000	I remember standing in line and playing the demo.
6448000	6459000	It actually was released, like I said, on January 9th, 2006 in the US with kind of a limited sale outlet.
6459000	6463000	It was online retailers and Nintendo World Store in New York City.
6463000	6468000	And some retailers had an option to get it. Like, remember Electronics Boutique EB?
6468000	6474000	They had it in Canada, and it was released in Europe on July 7th, 2006.
6474000	6480000	They were going to do an Australian release, but apparently they didn't have enough room in the schedule.
6480000	6486000	It was censored out of Australia. The electroplank didn't look like little penises, so Australia censored it. Kidding.
6486000	6497000	Anyway, so on July 6th, 2009, Nintendo re-released this part of the DSiWare.
6497000	6503000	And the instruments were available to buy separately for 200 Nintendo points each.
6503000	6516000	And then there were the different characters. There was Tracey, or Trappy, Hanenbon, Nanocarp, and Beatniss came out on July 11th.
6516000	6523000	And then Rugwreck and Lumi Loop came out on July 22nd. All the characters had various individual releases.
6523000	6530000	And then in North America, all 10 of the electroplank didn't came out in November 2009.
6531000	6539000	So basically, it got an 8 out of 10 from Joystick, and Nintendo Power gave it an 8.5 out of 10.
6539000	6545000	So it got really decent ratings, but one of the biggest complaints was the lack of the saving.
6545000	6549000	You know, you could play your tunes, but there was no real way to save it.
6549000	6554000	So the only way you could do that would be just to have some type of external recording device.
6554000	6561000	Or, you know, now I'm sure there's more ways of doing it, but when it came out, there wasn't really a way.
6561000	6569000	In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, by the way, there was a stage called Hanenbo that was based on the Hanenbo feature.
6569000	6571000	So, that's it.
6571000	6580000	There it is, your classic game of the week. Electroplankton! Celebrating 10 years. Just long enough to be a classic game.
6580000	6587000	I do also want to mention that EY has done a number of different music-related games.
6587000	6594000	He did Otoki for Famicom Disk. It's a music shoot-em-up.
6594000	6603000	Sound Fantasy, that was an unreleased game for Super Famicom. He also did that SimTunes, which is for PC.
6603000	6611000	Tenorion, which is a digital music instrument. And then Daigasso Band Brothers.
6611000	6619000	I don't think that he designed it, but it was another one that was sort of related for the Nintendo DS.
6619000	6624000	Alright, there it is. Electroplankton, your classic game of the week.
6624000	6628000	And I wonder how many times Dark Soccer is going to do that to us this year in 2016.
6628000	6632000	Remind us how old we are with these 10-year-old choices of games.
6632000	6634000	I'm going to drill that in.
6634000	6637000	Is that our first DS classic game of the week? I feel like it is.
6637000	6639000	For the Nintendo DS. I feel like it is.
6639000	6640000	It might be.
6640000	6645000	Just think, it's going to be a matter of time before Xbox 360 games are eligible. Blows my mind.
6645000	6646000	Yeah.
6646000	6654000	Wow. Alright. Maybe the chatters will get their wish of a Halo game when 360 games become eligible. We'll see.
6654000	6661000	Alright. All joking aside, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, we have more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid fire news.
6661000	6665000	The FUGO Question of the Week. We're going to talk a little bit about Rise of the Tomb Raider.
6665000	6672000	We'll talk about Just Cause 3 and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6672000	6687000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with our first episode of 2016 for January 3rd of 2016.
6687000	6693000	Episode number 626. And thank you guys who are here live listening to our show.
6693000	6696000	Thank you guys who listen to us on the podcast feed as well. We appreciate that.
6696000	6702000	But I do know that going on live right now as well is the whole awesome games done quick marathon.
6702000	6707000	Which, you know, that always happens around the first or second week of January.
6707000	6711000	And they basically speed run games for a good cause.
6711000	6719000	And through their Twitch feed and donation, they are raising money for, I believe it's Prevent Cancer Foundation is who they're raising money for this time.
6719000	6724000	And yeah, I think that's great and it's a fun thing to watch.
6724000	6729000	Kind of the different exploits in some games that are out there that help people beat it really quick.
6729000	6734000	So, DarkSakura, weren't you saying you and Dan were watching a little bit of that earlier today?
6734000	6740000	We were watching the Rayman Legends bit, which made me think of I want to be the guy.
6740000	6743000	And then Dan was watching Kirby when I left.
6744000	6747000	Which he wanted to watch some of the Mario ones tonight.
6747000	6754000	But yeah, I was actually a little surprised. I didn't expect it to start this week, but I guess there it goes.
6754000	6762000	Yeah, there it is. So, that'll be continuing. I think it's calendared through Saturday, although sometimes they do the kind of encore and it goes on even longer.
6762000	6766000	And I thought it was interesting. I was looking at the calendar games they plan on doing.
6766000	6771000	They actually have an indie block that's happening for about 24 hours of it is all dedicated to indie games.
6771000	6778000	So, I thought that was really cool. And you have classics and new stuff. There's a really big range in there of games.
6778000	6781000	So, very cool to see that.
6781000	6788000	Apparently, SHA100Matt in our chat over at live.voggenetwork.com says Notch dropped in and donated $8,000.
6788000	6796000	And he does that too. Ever since he sold off Minecraft, he dips in once in a while to donate to these fundraisers.
6796000	6801000	So, let's see. Dartetsuya says Super Mario 64 just wrapped up.
6801000	6806000	I would imagine some of you guys have the video open in one window and you're listening to us and that's okay.
6806000	6811000	I know some people listen to us while they play MMOs and stuff and that's fine. It's a radio show.
6811000	6817000	We don't have video for a reason. We try to be accessible to those that for whatever reason don't have access to the video.
6817000	6823000	Some of you listen in the car. Some of you listen at work. So, it works. That's why it's Orange Lounge Radio.
6824000	6833000	Let's see. On a different note here in chat, JohnnyB7990 says Glad to be here for the first 2016 episode live.
6833000	6837000	I need to come here more often. Usually listen on Stitcher but live is always fun.
6837000	6839000	Well, thanks for being here. I appreciate that.
6839000	6843000	Yeah, live is a little more fun because then you can have an impact on the show and have your voices read.
6843000	6847000	Don't get us wrong. We appreciate all the listeners being on the podcast.
6847000	6852000	We try to have other ways for you guys to interact too via the Fugu Question of the Week or through the email bag.
6852000	6856000	So, even if you can't be here live on Sunday night for whatever reason, there's always that.
6856000	6866000	But, yeah, very different when you're here live because then you can kind of talk to other people about what's going on live on the show and the topics that we talk about.
6866000	6872000	In fact, we're going to get right back into some more topics right now with our rapid fire news. We'll start with Loki.
6872000	6879000	Alright, so there's a game going through Kickstarter right now called Slipstream and it looks very much like Outrun.
6879000	6889000	So, they're only looking for $6,000 but the visuals are pretty much straight up art 90s Outrun type racing game.
6889000	6894000	So, it's pretty awesome. And they even have a demo that you can play on PC.
6894000	6899000	And it's supposed to have 30 tracks and 4 cars and 8 original songs. So, go check it out.
6899000	6915000	Slipstream. Now, you may remember that they offered this, like, exclusive Amiibos for the whole Skylanders, their brand new Skylanders game with the turbocharged.
6915000	6923000	Well, now you don't need to necessarily buy the game to get those Amiibo figures. They will be sold separately at GameStop.
6923000	6937000	Hey, I got some good news. I saw them on the shelf at Toys R Us yesterday. GameStop may be having them some particular day, but Toys R Us, I don't know if they broke street or what happened, but I almost bought them at Toys R Us.
6937000	6945000	But then I was like, I don't know. They were a little expensive. They wanted like $25 because it was really like two figures.
6946000	6952000	It's like the Bowser and the plane, so I was like, eh, I gotta draw the line somewhere.
6952000	6956000	Now, do they unlock figures for Mario Maker?
6956000	6960000	No, I think they function as normal Bowser and Donkey Kong Amiibos.
6960000	6962000	Oh, that's fucking lame.
6962000	6968000	I don't think they do anything special. Except, here they have a switch, so you can actually switch them between Skylanders and Amiibo.
6968000	6972000	I don't know how that all works, but apparently there's some type of switch.
6972000	6981000	So, at least that's what Shane was telling me, because again, I didn't buy them because I was like, eh, $25, that's kind of above the most I'm willing to pay for an Amiibo.
6981000	6986000	Exactly. But yeah, you can go check those out if that's something you're interested in.
6986000	6995000	This is kind of cool. More characters or skins coming to Super Mario Maker, unfortunately still for only the 8-bit version of the game, or that skin.
6995000	7003000	This time, Excitebike, and then you've got the Excitebike guy, and Birdo are coming, so you can check those out.
7003000	7007000	Actually, right now, because they're available on the 31st of December.
7007000	7011000	I got them both in Mario Maker, actually, since you bring this up.
7011000	7018000	And I like Birdo, because now you played levels to unlock these characters, right?
7018000	7022000	The Excitebike level was jank. I did not like it at all.
7022000	7029000	If it's supposed to be Excitebike, it's not. It's like the conveyor belts and springs. I did not like that level at all.
7029000	7036000	But the Birdo one was basically World 1-1 in Mario 2, done for Mario 1.
7036000	7042000	And so that was kind of fun, to play that. They called it NES Remix, but it had nothing to do with NES Remix.
7042000	7044000	So yeah, it was kind of fun.
7045000	7051000	I think, one of the things I kind of miss from the Mario 3, and I think I know why they haven't done any other ones.
7051000	7060000	Although I really think they should. Remember how they used to have the actual slanted ground, where you can slide on it and stuff like that?
7060000	7061000	Yeah.
7061000	7063000	I really wish they'd bring that back.
7063000	7070000	You never know! They've been slowly rolling out these random features in Mario Maker, like the checkpoints showed up after the fact.
7071000	7078000	In Splatoon, they were supporting for a good six months after release, or so. Probably even longer. So you never know. Mario Maker may still have some of that stuff.
7078000	7087000	I tried going back and playing a little bit last week, I think. There's still not a whole lot there, and I'm not really motivated to make any more levels right now.
7087000	7089000	We'll see.
7089000	7099000	Alright, well if you aren't playing Mario Maker on the Wii U, maybe you don't have a Wii U, you could try and play a different version of Mario Maker on the PC.
7099000	7103000	But you better hurry up and get it, because Nintendo's legal department is probably-
7103000	7107000	It's already on the PC, already on the internet. It's gonna be there forever.
7107000	7115000	Yeah, I know. It's there forever. But you can take a look at Super Mario Remaker. It's actually fan-made, and it's something that you can run on the PC.
7115000	7123000	And there's a demo of it available now, which I think only has the 8-bit modes. It doesn't have Mario 3 or Mario World or any of that.
7123000	7135000	But definitely they want to do a browsable level search system as they're adding to it. There's also your own costumes, and even in the little preview they have Homestar Runner as a costume.
7135000	7145000	So obviously, crossing all these lines of copyright and so forth. But yeah, I'm pretty sure Nintendo will be siccing their legal team on it.
7145000	7149000	Apparently plenty of people have told this guy, and he's kind of sick of hearing it.
7149000	7161000	But unfortunately, that's just the reality, is that Nintendo is making some good money off Super Mario Maker right now, so they probably don't want to see somebody outdo them on the PC.
7161000	7173000	But hey, you know what? For what it's worth, I think it's really cool. And maybe Nintendo should talk to this guy about doing something for the official game, because he's clearly putting things in there that players want.
7173000	7179000	Like, what else was it? Oh, the slopes are in this game. Like, you were talking about the slopes in Mario 3? They're in this game.
7179000	7180000	Cool.
7180000	7185000	Yeah, it has some things that the regular game does not.
7185000	7191000	Let's talk about the Shovel Knight amiibo, because the Shovel Knight amiibo apparently went up for pre-order, but it was an error.
7191000	7198000	And people were wondering, oh, does this mean the supply is short? What happened? Well, Shovel Knight amiibo went up for pre-order on Best Buy and Amazon.
7198000	7205000	Yacht Club Games actually came out and said they weren't taken down due to stock issues, but they shouldn't have been listed in the first place, saying,
7205000	7217000	quote, the Best Buy Amazon pre-orders were not taken down due to stock issues, but because they should not have been listed for pre-order in the first place, stock should hopefully be plentiful at release, and refresh shipments will continue arriving frequently.
7217000	7223000	Luckily, I got in there while it was still open for pre-order, so I grabbed myself a Shovel Knight amiibo. I'm excited about that.
7223000	7230000	Because I like Shovel Knight. I think it's kind of weird that they're locking, because I think co-op mode is locked behind the amiibo.
7230000	7231000	Yeah.
7231000	7233000	That's a bit much to me. I don't know. All right.
7233000	7246000	I mentioned a minute ago about Splatoon still getting support all this time after its release, and the latest update on Splatoon, I think we've heard this before, is that January is going to be the last month of DLC.
7246000	7258000	However, in a Famitsu interview, the producer of Splatoon, Hisashi Nogami, and the co-directors of the game, actually elaborated on what will happen in Splatoon in 2016.
7259000	7272000	So, substantial updates, things like weapon, gear, stages, that all wraps up this month. However, balancing will continue, and Splatfest will continue to carry on with no end date as of yet.
7272000	7284000	I imagine even those will end at some point, but we're talking whenever the inevitable sequel comes out, because let's be real, this game's done well enough, there's going to be a sequel, or whenever we move into the next phase of the NX.
7284000	7295000	Interesting other comment in the interview is that they say it's difficult for players to remember which weapons are best suited for each individual stage. There's already so many.
7295000	7302000	Adding even more would exacerbate the situation. This is why they're dropping off DLC in January.
7302000	7310000	And probably these guys want to move on to make other games, including Splatoon 2 or whatever else may be in store on the NX or otherwise.
7310000	7318000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com stating, I'm glad no more DLC. It's good to have a game that's final with no more DLC.
7318000	7325000	You know what though, I gotta say, kudos. As much as I had my issues with Splatoon in online mode, it narrowly missed my top three.
7325000	7336000	Loki guessing it as my number one game earlier in the show was a really good guess. I thought it had a tremendous level of support post-release, and I think that's really cool.
7337000	7349000	By the way, on a note with Splatoon before I turn it over to DarkSakura, I did notice over on our forums over at live.vognetwork.com that Dark Tetsuya, and I think it was Kaijuto, are actually trying to put together a little Splat League.
7349000	7355000	So if you want to get in and play some Splatfest with some other VoG participants, I think that's a fabulous idea.
7355000	7367000	Visit our forums over at vognetwork.com and get in touch with Dark Tetsuya and let them know you would like to be on that team and meet up for some online gaming. I think that would be fun.
7367000	7374000	All right, and TigerCloud pointing out that Awesome Games Done Quick did the speedrun of the single player mode. That's right, that was earlier today, right?
7374000	7380000	Splatoon is still very much in the limelight all these months after its release. You can't say that about a lot of games.
7380000	7383000	All right, let's move on. DarkSakura.
7383000	7391000	For folks who are still playing Killer Instinct, Tusk has been announced. We will be having Tusk before too long.
7391000	7404000	And they actually did address a request to have Idol and Gargos. They said that Idol is tough because, well, he had Satterlegs, a giant club, and only had two moves.
7404000	7408000	And is really cheap. But hey, Tusk. That's cool.
7408000	7421000	Also, for Dissidia, there is going to be Ramza from Final Fantasy Tactics coming, quote, soon.
7421000	7429000	It was teased in November but is going to be joining the cast pretty soon, they said.
7429000	7432000	Looks like they're aiming for a character every two months.
7433000	7439000	And then there's going to be a Street Fighter V live action prologue, supposed to be coming in March.
7439000	7454000	It looks like there's going to be the Street Fighter Resurrection, a live action mini-series, that's going to outline what Street Fighter V is going to be going on.
7454000	7457000	It's the same team behind Street Fighter Assassin's Fist.
7457000	7459000	So there you go.
7460000	7467000	Alright. I don't think I ever talked about it on the show but I played a little bit of Street Fighter V while it was in the beta.
7467000	7472000	I'm looking forward to picking up the full game. It was fun when I got to play with it.
7472000	7477000	Alright, let's now get into the FUGL question of the week.
7477000	7483000	Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus community and you slam those words together and you get FUGL.
7490000	7496000	This week, in honor of Awesome Games Done Quick, because we know a lot of you have your eyes on that right now,
7496000	7500000	we wanted to know, is there a game that you like to speedrun?
7500000	7506000	Have you ever played a game with the goal of completing it as fast as possible and do you have any notable speedrunning achievements?
7506000	7510000	So let's start over on Facebook with Fabrice A who says,
7510000	7514000	I once held the world record on Sega Rally Championship for Sega Saturn.
7514000	7519000	I was really proud of myself at the time. I do want to hold a Sonic Marathon for charity.
7519000	7521000	That's pretty cool.
7521000	7526000	We don't have many world champions that listen to Orange Lounge Radio, current or former.
7526000	7532000	SSG100Matt says, I haven't really speedrun anything myself,
7532000	7538000	but my mother has been speedrunning Super Mario Brothers on and off since the game came out on the NES.
7538000	7543000	She doesn't have any records or anything but she's able to beat the game faster than I am able to.
7543000	7548000	She didn't even know that speedrunning was an actual thing until I told her about it a few years ago.
7548000	7553000	That's pretty epic. I think you should get your mom involved with Awesome Games Done Quick.
7553000	7555000	I think they'd love that.
7555000	7560000	Although I know they probably have a crew that already does Super Mario Brothers probably like disturbingly fast.
7560000	7564000	I think it's always fun to watch the different generations get involved.
7564000	7567000	Retertainment on Facebook says, no.
7567000	7572000	The only kind of game I can think of where I actively try to do things as fast as possible is racing games,
7572000	7576000	since that's the point. Fair enough, it is the point in a racing game.
7576000	7580000	But interesting that racing games are also involved in Awesome Games Done Quick.
7580000	7582000	They were doing a race on Mario Kart earlier,
7582000	7587000	so sometimes it's still about knowing all those shortcuts on Rainbow Road
7587000	7591000	to just get an insane time and all the little cheats and so forth.
7591000	7595000	Flaco Jones on Facebook says, when I was a kid it was Contra.
7595000	7598000	As I mentioned on the show before, and he has talked about this on a previous episode,
7598000	7605000	I would record my gameplay by running the Nintendo through the VCR and was clocking in 20 minute runs.
7605000	7610000	Being such a fan of Games Done Quick has inspired me to informally run some of my current favorite games,
7610000	7618000	most notably Journey and P.T., the latter of which can be a real pain during the super random final section of the game.
7618000	7625000	Hitstun over on Facebook says, I keep coming back to Super Mario 64 because it's awesomely broken.
7625000	7630000	The 16 star route has plenty of fun glitches and shortcuts and finishes the game in under half an hour.
7630000	7634000	It's a great game for learning the basics of speedrunning.
7634000	7638000	Unless you know how to do the big jump and get up to the roof early.
7638000	7641000	You have to elaborate.
7641000	7647000	There's a particular wall jump in Super Mario 64 that will get you up to the roof early.
7647000	7653000	Oh wow. I'm sure that's something we're probably going to see in this unless it's banned for whatever reason.
7653000	7658000	Let's see, Degenerate Johnny says, I don't usually speedrun games because it breaks the story for me.
7658000	7663000	However, I'm an intervention worthy achievement or trophy whore.
7663000	7677000	So when Blizzard places an achievement for beating each chapter in Diablo 3 in less than an hour, I was up for the challenge.
7678000	7683000	I was able to beat the campaign pre-ROS, the expansion, in 3 hours and 23 minutes.
7683000	7688000	Now that I'm thinking about it, I might do a full ROS speedrun in hardcore mode. Good luck to you.
7688000	7694000	And on Facebook, Haseo Sumeragawa says, I used to be able to beat Ocarina of Time in 12 hours.
7694000	7700000	Well, main game anyway was with two hours shy of the world record, but that's the only one I've really tried.
7700000	7704000	That's still pretty impressive, I gotta say, so good on you for that.
7704000	7711000	Going over to our Google Plus page over at Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
7711000	7718000	We have one answer over there from Tech2030 who says, I haven't attempted any, but I've always been interested in speedrunning Metroid.
7718000	7722000	The Super Metroid race is the best part of any games done quick marathon.
7722000	7730000	And I'm sure they are going to once again do their save the animals and what do they call it?
7730000	7731000	Leave them behind.
7731000	7732000	Fuck the animals.
7732000	7736000	Fuck the animals. Well, then you don't want to actually fuck the animals, but anyway.
7736000	7741000	Which is funny because if you only play the next game, the animals are all alive and they help you.
7741000	7745000	That is true, so we know which ending is canon anyway.
7745000	7750000	But doesn't save the animals always win? It'll probably win again, let's be real.
7750000	7752000	I thought last year these did fuck the animals.
7752000	7755000	No, I don't think they did. They save the animals one every year.
7755000	7760000	Alright, anyhow, let's get back into some other gaming news. Thank you guys for your responses.
7760000	7765000	Actually, quickly before I go back to news, anybody in here have a speedrunning thing of note they want to say?
7765000	7773000	I can't really think of anything. I think the closest I've done, Mario Brothers 2, I have tried to do that as fast as possible.
7773000	7781000	But I would imagine the fastest way to do it is by using Toad and I really can't play with Toad.
7781000	7782000	You can princess over everything.
7783000	7788000	That's, you know, and I can do princess. I can play with princess, but I don't think I know all the shortcuts and things yet.
7788000	7792000	Because I imagine in the last level there has to be ways you can shortcut over the walls and stuff.
7792000	7795000	There's got to be things I'm not thinking of yet.
7795000	7802000	But as far as running through to the warp zones and all that, that's probably a game I've sat down and said I'm going to beat this as fast as possible.
7802000	7807000	I'm honestly not a super big fan of speedruns myself, of doing them.
7807000	7814000	But sometimes I'll find, when I'm playing a game, I'll find little shortcuts for myself just to get past annoying things.
7814000	7823000	You know, like, for example in Dragon Age I've found cliffs I can jump down and get to where I want to go.
7823000	7827000	It's kind of hard when you have a free roaming game like that, but yeah.
7827000	7829000	Loki, anything you've tried to speedrun on?
7829000	7831000	No, not really.
7831000	7832000	Not big on the speed?
7832000	7841000	Unless you count speedrunning or seeing how fast I can get people to disconnect from me from multiplayer games before Grand Theft Auto IV because I'm beating their ass so bad.
7841000	7846000	In which case, I do hold some pretty high records for that, but other than that, nope.
7846000	7852000	That's only Grand Theft Auto IV. That certainly doesn't transfer over the Grand Theft Auto V, but IV I was king.
7852000	7856000	Alright, let's get back to some other gaming news, Loki.
7856000	7861000	I would totally go back to IV, too. I really do want to. Maybe I should pick that up on PS3.
7861000	7868000	Anyways, speaking of games and multiplayer, one of the games I thought was pretty awesome, Just Cause 2.
7868000	7872000	They had this multiplayer mod that was just fucking nuts on PC.
7872000	7882000	It allowed up to a thousand players at one time, if not more, playing together on one map in a game that was basically just single player.
7882000	7884000	And they're doing it again.
7884000	7894000	Just Cause 3 multiplayer. They haven't put out any sort of release date or anything like that or an ETA, but the mod team is working on it.
7894000	7899000	They had some early footage they showed kind of displaying some of the racing that they did and everything.
7899000	7902000	I think it's going to be awesome.
7902000	7907000	If it's anything like Just Cause 2 multiplayer was, it's a complete mess.
7907000	7912000	It's just chaos, but it's fun chaos, and I can't wait to try it out.
7912000	7916000	Hopefully on a more powerful PC they can actually probably run that game.
7916000	7920000	Well, thanks modders for making that available, right?
7920000	7932000	And seriously, if this mod team can optimize the game enough to have multiple people running around in it, could the developer maybe shorten the load time some? Maybe?
7932000	7935000	Maybe.
7936000	7942000	Alright, let's talk about a game that, you know, I don't think we've really talked about enough when it comes to 2015 games.
7942000	7946000	And I finally picked up my copy of this game, and I will play it in the next couple weeks.
7946000	7950000	Cause I've heard nothing but great things about Rise of the Tomb Raider.
7950000	7958000	And of course Rise of the Tomb Raider was an Xbox One exclusive, and so it kind of limited the number of people who I think were able to play that game.
7958000	7963000	But, some folks have been waiting for the inevitable PC release or even the Playstation 4 release.
7963000	7972000	Well, I got nothing on the Playstation 4, but apparently Rise of the Tomb Raider due for the PC in January, and that's according to the Steam listing.
7972000	7974000	How many times are we going to bring up Steam on the night show?
7974000	7990000	Square Enix not confirmed the date yet, however they did mention back in July that PC and Windows 10 editions, which I think that's kind of the same thing, but that's what they said, would be early 2016, and the PS4 version would be late 2016.
7990000	8000000	So apparently, January would be early 2016, and it's after the holiday period that I'm sure Microsoft wanted that exclusive arrangement for the Xbox One for.
8000000	8010000	So, there you go. There is a Steam page up, and it shows everything there for Rise of the Tomb Raider, all the marketing text, so we'll see.
8010000	8015000	We'll see if this shows up closer to the end of the month, and I'm sure a lot of people will be checking that out.
8015000	8021000	I've heard a lot of really great things about that game. I will check that out hopefully in the next week, if not the next two weeks.
8021000	8027000	Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vognetware.com, echoing Rise of the Tomb Raiders. Good stuff.
8027000	8031000	Alright, let's go on, DarkSakura.
8031000	8040000	Oh, yeah. Well, you want to talk about shitty? It's not getting paid. You know, it's even more shitty? Not getting paid on Christmas.
8041000	8049000	So, basically, that's what happened with the employees who worked for Firefall developer Red5.
8049000	8052000	They found a letter instead.
8052000	8061000	Hi, team. I regret to inform you that Red5 currently does not have the funds necessary to meet our payroll scheduled for today, Friday, December 25th.
8061000	8071000	Due to this, there will not be payroll paid this week. Red5 and The9, our parent company, is currently working to resolve this during the holidays as soon as possible.
8071000	8076000	We are hopeful we'll be able to resolve this and update the team immediately.
8076000	8088000	And it was confirmed, they actually, Red5 did promise to pay, but there's no notice on if they actually have by now.
8088000	8097000	So, let's hope so, but that probably means that Red5 is pretty much going to be in the red.
8098000	8102000	SSG100MaddenChat says, what a bunch of grinches.
8102000	8109000	Well, if you can't pay, you can't pay, but even so, you should have like some sort of credit to pull from or some other.
8109000	8115000	Yeah. This doesn't seem legal. Is Red5 here in the States or are they overseas?
8115000	8116000	They're in Oklahoma, I think.
8117000	8123000	That just, I mean, if you leave a company, don't they have to pay you within like 48 hours or something?
8123000	8127000	It seems very strange that they can just be like, oops, payroll doesn't happen today.
8127000	8133000	I don't know if they were left with any other, I'd have to check the laws on that one, but I mean.
8133000	8135000	I mean, if there's no money, there's no money, I suppose.
8135000	8136000	It's a contract regardless.
8136000	8137000	Yeah, yeah.
8137000	8142000	You know, at will or nothing, they give you something that says you will be paid on X and X.
8142000	8143000	Right.
8143000	8146000	You know, in the amount of whatever your pay rate is.
8146000	8147000	Right.
8147000	8154000	So, that could technically be a massive breach of contract. So, regardless.
8154000	8160000	Well, that is a really cruddy way to have, especially on the holidays.
8160000	8164000	I mean, I realize some timings can't be controlled, but it's still kind of one of those.
8164000	8170000	You got to look at the executive management at Red 5 and be like, how did you let it get into this situation in the first place?
8170000	8177000	So, well, our thoughts with the frontline employees there who are most affected by this.
8177000	8181000	And Dungeon Busters in chat saying, yeah, Firefall's development has been pretty rocky.
8181000	8185000	Hopefully, they find a way through it. Hopefully, a miracle financer or something.
8185000	8188000	That comment from live.vognetwork.com.
8188000	8193000	And Dark Soccer, I believe you are actually about to step out on us here too?
8193000	8195000	I am. Probably in a minute.
8195000	8197000	Because you've got work things going on, so.
8197000	8203000	Yeah, I'm just, got to be up, you know, stupidly dirt early in the morning.
8203000	8209000	I understand. I understand. Well, did you, before you head out, do you want to give us your final thought for the night?
8209000	8218000	It's going to get, it's slightly political, but I'm just going to say this.
8218000	8227000	For everyone who complains about things going on in the country, if you don't get out there and put some effort into it, they will never change.
8227000	8234000	For all the people who say, X person can't win, if you don't vote, they won't win. That's it.
8234000	8241000	There is an old adage that's not even political. It's just, if I always do what I've always done, I'm always going to get the same result. So.
8241000	8248000	Well, then there's also Einstein, you know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
8248000	8251000	Is that how we keep doing this show for 14 years?
8251000	8257000	Well, we haven't expected different results. So, you know, if we suddenly expect, oh, next week's show will be famous.
8257000	8259000	Yeah, we're going to be famous. We're going to make money.
8259000	8266000	Yeah, that shit ain't happening. So, but anyway, um, yeah.
8266000	8274000	Also though, um, probably starting next week is I'm planning on just doing random, um, Twitch streams just for shits.
8274000	8280000	We'll see if that happens, if I can get my headset working. So, cause it's been kind of antsy with my new sound card.
8280000	8289000	All right. Good luck to you. I know that's, that's something I want to do more of in 2016, but I said that last year and look how well that went, but I'm in a much better, I'm in a much better place this year than last year.
8289000	8295000	I would love to do streaming if, you know, my talking in the living room while my wife is doing whatever would annoy her.
8295000	8305000	I, I will say this much for 2016, I do want to get into the streaming things, but my, my, my first priority is getting podcast number two off the ground.
8305000	8310000	And that's all I'm going to say about that for now. All right. Uh, let's move on with some more stories.
8310000	8315000	Have a good night, Dark Sakura. And, uh, thank you as always for being here and good luck with work in the morning.
8315000	8322000	We'll see you next, uh, in two Sundays. Holy shit. You suck for going to Disneyland, but at the same time, bring me back a pin or something. Okay.
8322000	8333000	All right. Yay. Thank you. And give hugs for Victoria and all that. I will. All right. All right. Uh, let's get into some other, uh, stories. Loki.
8333000	8342000	This is extremely exciting. Fantasy Star Online 2 is finally coming to the West as anime. As an anime. You wooed too early.
8342000	8344000	No, I wooed anyway.
8344000	8357000	Yes. Unfortunately, even though they do have an English version of the game available in Asian regions, they're not bringing it over here, but, uh, they will be putting out the anime. So there's that to look forward to.
8357000	8369000	You know, we had to cut some stories for time last week. And one of them was actually about how PlayStation, uh, or PlayStation Fantasy Star Online 2 is coming out for the PlayStation 4 in Japan.
8369000	8382000	And, uh, it was going to be an opportunity for me to say, what the fucking hell, Sega? Why do you keep withholding this shit from the States? And now this is even getting worse. Okay, so we're getting the anime now? And we still can't get the game?
8382000	8388000	They probably will bring the game out over here, because what the hell is Sega releasing for console, aside from, like, a Sonic game?
8389000	8399000	It seems like if they've already got an English version of the game available, that would be an easy, that'd be pretty easy. Just bring it over.
8399000	8417000	Well, uh, speaking of Sonic games, uh, there very well could be a Sonic game on the way for this year. I mean, I guess that seems kind of obvious, but, uh, Crush 40, uh, music that, uh, appears in different Sonic games, and, you know, Crush 40 goes right along with the Sonic series.
8417000	8428000	Uh, and, uh, they were talking on Facebook, and actually said something in a comment on Facebook, which then got deleted, so you kind of have to wonder, did they say too much?
8428000	8432000	Well, thanks to the internet, the comment's been preserved for all the time, and the comment was,
8432000	8444000	We are planning a few performances for 2016 to commemorate the anniversary of Sonic. We might participate in writing new songs for the anniversary game. Stay tuned.
8444000	8455000	Well, then the post was deleted, but it made a lot of people go, what's the anniversary game? After all, this year is Sonic's 25th anniversary, uh, so maybe there's something special, maybe-
8455000	8456000	Hopefully good.
8456000	8465000	I feel like if they say an anniversary game, it's going to be like Sonic 1 with new HD graphics. It's the same game you played before.
8465000	8469000	Well, it's, like, anniversary almost seems like Sonic Generations at that point, I think.
8469000	8470000	I guess that's true.
8470000	8476000	I mean, that was kind of as close to, like, a new-meets-old type of thing, but, I don't know.
8476000	8477000	Yeah.
8477000	8478000	Hopefully something good.
8478000	8487000	I guess we will see what comes of it, but I'm sure- Will a Sonic game be released this year? Of course it will. It's Sega. There's gonna be something.
8487000	8495000	SSJ100MattInChat says, it's going to be Sonic 25th anniversary edition with friends. Oh, yay, I can play-
8495000	8496000	With even more friends.
8496000	8505000	With even more friends. I can now replay Sonic 1 as all of Sonic's shitty friends, and maybe it'll be on the Wii U and there'll be amiibo for all these characters.
8505000	8507000	Amiibo for the shitty friends.
8507000	8512000	There is a Sonic amiibo, so why not all the shitty friends as well? We'll see. Anyway.
8512000	8514000	Let's get to the mailbag.
8514000	8526000	Or not, because nobody sent us an email this week, but usually you would send your emails to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
8526000	8529000	I'm not even supposed to be here today. I'm leaving.
8529000	8532000	That's why I said bye to you before the mailbag, because I'm like, there's no email.
8532000	8533000	Yeah, whatever.
8533000	8536000	I may as well say something while I'm still here waiting for my computer to shut down.
8536000	8540000	Alright, so no emails. You should berate the listeners into sending emails.
8540000	8542000	Do it!
8542000	8543000	Participate.
8543000	8545000	Do the thing. Make it happen.
8545000	8548000	At orangeloungeradio.com if you want to.
8548000	8551000	Rob, we need an email that's just called Fuckin' Do It.
8551000	8553000	And it redirects to the mailbag.
8553000	8557000	No, because then it would just be like Shia LaBeouf memes coming through. Do it!
8557000	8563000	No, I wasn't even listening to- you know, I've never actually seen one of those, except for like little shitty screen captures that are on Tumblr.
8563000	8567000	Of course, if it's a meme, of course it found its way to Tumblr at some point.
8567000	8569000	I love the sticker for my computer.
8569000	8571000	Yes, it's very rainbowy. I like it.
8571000	8573000	I have the Rainbow Apple sticker on my Mac.
8573000	8576000	Alright, look. We need to get to the FUs of the week.
8576000	8577000	I have an FU.
8577000	8579000	Well, then I better cue the music.
8593000	8596000	Starting off with the one we already said goodbye to.
8596000	8599000	Hey. FU. That's it.
8599000	8601000	Oh, that's it? F me? Oh.
8601000	8608000	No, um, FU to feeling like I'm tired, but having endless brain energy.
8608000	8612000	So, FU to a busy mind. With no outlet.
8612000	8614000	Alright. Loki?
8614000	8620000	You know, it's weird. I had a really specific FU driving over here today, but I don't remember what it is now.
8620000	8623000	Because I got too angry at the old people driving really slow in front of me.
8623000	8627000	But there was something else, and I'm trying to think what it was.
8627000	8630000	Something in general that was bothering me.
8630000	8634000	But I don't remember, so it's going to have to wait for another week instead.
8634000	8638000	We're just going to have to say FU to old people who are driving really fucking slow on the road.
8638000	8643000	And, um, uh, yeah. I guess that's it.
8643000	8645000	And, um, yeah.
8646000	8651000	Alright, um, FU to the fact that my holiday break seemed so short this year.
8651000	8653000	And that's probably because I've been spoiled in years past.
8653000	8656000	Because my old company would give us the time off between...
8656000	8660000	Well, they didn't give it to us, but we pretty much always took the time between Christmas and New Year's off.
8660000	8662000	And I wasn't able to do that this year.
8662000	8666000	And don't get me wrong, I love the new job, and I don't mind having to work the extra time.
8666000	8669000	But, yeah, it just kind of shut the...
8669000	8673000	I don't know, it just feels weird having only had a few days off here during this holiday period.
8673000	8675000	But I know, you know, cry me a river.
8675000	8679000	I know some of you out there are working retail on holidays and so forth.
8679000	8681000	So, I probably have nowhere to complain.
8681000	8684000	But, just, you know, I kind of got used to it over the past few years.
8684000	8686000	And that changed this past year.
8686000	8690000	So, I'm kind of like, oh gosh, I'm so busy at work this next week.
8690000	8691000	It's going to be crazy.
8691000	8694000	And I'm sure a lot of people are in that mindset, too, coming back from the holidays.
8694000	8699000	So, FU in advance to the craziness that is sure to be next week.
8699000	8701000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
8701000	8707000	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8707000	8708000	All one word.
8708000	8709000	Let's get to Loki.
8709000	8718000	Alright, so there was, I guess, a new lightning talk by Failoverflow.
8718000	8724000	It's a hacking team that was responsible for some of the hacks on PlayStation 3.
8724000	8731000	Now, during the 32nd Chaos Communication Congress, they were showing off Linux on a PlayStation 4.
8731000	8741000	And, you know, basically what they're developing right now is it's a kind of a spinoff of FreeBSD.
8741000	8751000	And it's, they're basically trying to utilize all of the hardware on the PlayStation 4 to even maybe possibly run actual PC games on it.
8751000	8755000	Like modern PC games and maybe even use it like as a Steam box.
8755000	8763000	So, they're not sharing like the, you know, exploits on how to hack the PlayStation 4 yet.
8763000	8772000	But they're saying that it's so easy to do that basically people will bring their own exploits and they'll have this Linux version that'll be available.
8773000	8778000	But it has been shown that they can do that, so they're working on Linux kernel patches.
8778000	8783000	And they're not releasing the exploits, but they're saying certain other people will.
8783000	8788000	Hmm. It'll hit the internet any day now and then it'll be impossible to take off.
8788000	8795000	This is very interesting considering the PlayStation 3's controversy where you could have Linux on it and then they patched it out.
8795000	8800000	But some people never grabbed that patch, so are running Linux on PlayStation 3s to this day.
8800000	8801000	So, interesting.
8801000	8802000	Interesting.
8802000	8806000	And Dar Tetsuya in chat says, I don't think there's been a Sony system yet that they haven't hacked.
8806000	8811000	Tigerclaw gives us a link here and I thought for some reason this was in our show world tonight, but it's not.
8811000	8817000	But it's right along the same vein as the Linux on PlayStation 4, but that is the Windows 95 running on a 3DS.
8817000	8818000	Did you see that one?
8818000	8819000	Yeah.
8819000	8821000	Somebody was running Windows 95 on a 3DS.
8821000	8827000	I mean, it wasn't, I don't think I actually saw a desktop come up, but it was kind of checking the boot table and all this stuff.
8827000	8829000	It was kind of weird to see.
8829000	8837000	But I mean, the technology in a handheld device kind of exceeds what we had in computers back in the mid-90s.
8837000	8838000	Oh yeah, got it.
8838000	8843000	So, I mean, think about what's in an iPhone or an Android device. I mean, that's...
8843000	8848000	They had multi-core processors and stuff running it, like, you know, over a gigahertz and everything.
8848000	8853000	And, you know, at one time we had a processor running at 20 megahertz.
8853000	8856000	16 megahertz was considered lightning fast.
8856000	8861000	And, you know, with a whopping 4 gigs of RAM, or 1 gig of RAM.
8861000	8862000	Yeah, or 512k.
8862000	8864000	512k, yeah. So, I mean...
8864000	8871000	I feel like Windows 95 ran on my 486 100 megahertz machine, which was blazing fast at the time.
8871000	8876000	And it's like, that's nothing compared to what you carry around in your pocket these days.
8876000	8877000	It's crazy how...
8877000	8878000	Got a Pentium.
8878000	8882000	Think about it. And the desktops you have now are going to be nothing compared to 20 years from now.
8882000	8883000	That's what growing up has taught you.
8883000	8886000	Not even 20 years. Probably like 5 years, 10 years.
8886000	8895000	Probably. And so, yeah, it wasn't much, but it's just kind of that novelty of an entire PC operating system running on a DS like that.
8895000	8902000	Wouldn't it be crazy though? Because they're saying it's so close to a PC that they're getting 3D acceleration working.
8902000	8907000	And they're just having some issues with certain things, but they're...
8908000	8911000	I mean, they could possibly get this. They're actually running PC games on it.
8911000	8913000	I mean, that's kind of crazy.
8913000	8917000	I mean, that... There you go. Cheap Steam Box. $400.
8918000	8922000	Alright. Well, last but not least on our show world tonight.
8922000	8931000	Kind of a sadder story as I'm sure many of you heard in this past week that Lemmy from Motorhead passed away suddenly this past week.
8931000	8938000	And I mean suddenly the poor guy was diagnosed with cancer and then passed away from it like two days later.
8938000	8942000	It was crazy. So a good old hearty fuck cancer for all of that.
8942000	8947000	But why would I bring this up on a video game podcast?
8947000	8953000	Well, because it has kind of had talk of the Koopa Kooplings circle around again.
8953000	8960000	And this is actually from Nintendo product manager Dave Brooks who mentioned that music has always been a big part of my life.
8960000	8964000	I've been a DJ for years and have been a music collector for even longer.
8964000	8967000	When I first saw the group of seven Kooplings, music was on my mind.
8967000	8974000	The hairstyle on one of them reminded me of Ludwig von Beethoven for some reason and Ludwig von Koopa was born.
8974000	8981000	Next was the one with the glasses. That has to be Roy Koopa in homage to Roy Orbison who almost always wore glasses.
8981000	8987000	Then Wendy O Koopa or Wendy O Williams and Iggy Koopa or Iggy Pop.
8987000	8994000	One looked like a Loudmouth so he was Morton Koopa Jr. from the Loudmouth talk show host Morton Downey Jr.
8994000	9000000	And then there was Larry. There's no real world equivalent. He's not Larry Mullen Jr. from U2 or Larry King. He just looked like a Larry.
9000000	9006000	But that brings us to Lemmy. In addition to being a great name, it's perfect for a video game character.
9006000	9012000	This Koopling struck me as being the kind of character who would do his own thing no matter what anyone else thought.
9012000	9016000	I think it was those crazy eyes. Lemmy Koopa was in the crew.
9016000	9026000	So that being posted by Nintendo product manager Dave Brooks in honor of Lemmy passing away this past week.
9026000	9028000	So rest in peace.
9028000	9033000	What's kind of sad is Dark Soccer and I before the show were kind of going over that list.
9034000	9042000	It was like, wow, all of these people are just because you know Wendy O Williams and that's different than the Wendy Williams that's on TV. How you doing?
9042000	9047000	Wendy O Williams was a punk rock and she tragically committed suicide several years ago.
9047000	9052000	So like all those people in that list, many of them have passed. Iggy Pop I know is still alive.
9052000	9056000	But yeah, very, very tragic. So there you go.
9056000	9062000	William Ritterface in chat says, I remember hearing somewhere that he knew for a while and that he played through it. Interesting.
9062000	9066000	And Tiger Claw points out and Natalie Cole died as well. Yeah, tragic loss.
9066000	9075000	And although nothing to do with games per se, it does lend to that old adage that these things unfortunately tend to come in threes.
9075000	9079000	Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line though if you want to give us a call.
9079000	9084000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9084000	9089000	Our Skype is fixed by the way. I talked about this a little bit on Bobby's show, but I guess I didn't get into it here on OLR.
9089000	9098000	But you know, I was bitching and moaning and complaining about Skype not working the past couple weeks because I decided to upgrade to the latest version and it broke and it wouldn't connect.
9098000	9102000	And I tried to revert to old versions and they wouldn't connect.
9102000	9107000	Well get this you guys, do you know what the fix ended up being for this? All I had to do to fix it?
9107000	9114000	And remember, we run Windows XP on the show computer in here and you might be thinking like, isn't that kind of old?
9114000	9120000	And the answer is yes, it is kind of old. But I'm very much of the old adage, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
9120000	9130000	We've been doing this podcast for 14 years, so XP works with Shoutcast and Audition and everything we need to run the show, so I don't tend to upgrade things.
9130000	9138000	But when Skype always nags you, upgrade me, upgrade me. Inevitably I one day have a moment of weakness and I click yes and I paid for it.
9138000	9146000	So what ended up being the solution? Well I'm sitting here thinking, alright I'm just going to have to do it, I'm going to have to upgrade the damn computer to Windows 7.
9146000	9154000	But then I was, or even possibly 10 if it would run it, I wasn't sure and I was even looking at maybe getting some new parts for the machine to compensate.
9154000	9164000	But it ended up, I did a search on some various forums and I had done this the past couple weeks but I tried again this past week and somebody said,
9164000	9173000	do you have Internet Explorer 8 installed on your machine because the latest version of Skype requires Internet Explorer 8 or newer?
9173000	9186000	And sure enough, on this computer I only had Internet Explorer 6. Now you might be screaming at me, Rob, why on earth are you using Internet Explorer 6 in the year 2016?
9186000	9199000	And my answer is, I wasn't ever using Internet Explorer. If I have to actually explore the Internet, we use Firefox here on the show computer, I use Chrome on my personal computer, I don't really use Internet Explorer ever.
9199000	9210000	So why would I upgrade it to a newer version? It would be nonsense. But that ended up being it. I was able to find a website that had, because I didn't want to upgrade all the way to,
9210000	9217000	because actually in XP it wouldn't upgrade. I would try to go into the upgrade thing and it would be like, sorry, support for Windows XP has ended.
9217000	9230000	So finally I went into an archive site that has old versions of operating stuff and I actually found a copy of Internet Explorer 8 and I downloaded it and installed it and Skype worked right away.
9230000	9245000	That's all what it was. William Murderface in chat says, it's also not getting security updates anymore. Yeah, I know all that about XP, but again, I'm pretty sure this machine can run Windows 7.
9245000	9255000	I just have to make sure it doesn't screw things up. You know what I mean? Again, this works right now. I don't want to shut down the whole show because I have a botched upgrade.
9255000	9261000	So I'm just nervous about that kind of stuff. Anyway, we are getting a call on the line, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9261000	9270000	The first caller of 2016. Woohoo! Our first call. What's up, DJ Rom? Not much, Rom. How are you?
9270000	9286000	I am doing well. I mean, it's that whole like, oh bummer, I gotta go back to work tomorrow. But you know, I like my job and I can't sit around the house all day doing nothing because believe it or not, that's kind of what I did Friday and Saturday and that got really old.
9286000	9291000	Well, you were at home relaxing. I was at work, so you know, fun stuff.
9291000	9298000	That's why I try not to complain too much because I know there are people out there working hard on the holidays. So how was that? How'd that go for you?
9298000	9304000	Pretty good, but then again, I really have nothing bad to say about my job because I absolutely love it.
9304000	9318000	Good. I think it's important to love your job. So at least hopefully more people are starting out 2016 enjoying it and if you're not enjoying what you're doing, you can always try and look for something better. There's nothing wrong with trying. So my advice.
9318000	9321000	But anyway, what did you call in about tonight?
9321000	9328000	I want to talk about something cool that happened at my job yesterday, but before I get into that, I just also want to say happy birthday, big boy.
9328000	9331000	Thank you. It's not actually my birthday, but it's my birthday show.
9331000	9333000	But close enough.
9333000	9337000	Close enough. It was my half birthday the day after Christmas, so that's close enough, right?
9337000	9339000	Even better.
9339000	9343000	Well, thank you for that. I appreciate that. What else is on your mind?
9343000	9347000	We had another charity event at my job yesterday.
9347000	9350000	Nice. For what this time?
9350000	9352000	Hearthstone.
9352000	9357000	Oh, get out. That's pretty cool. What's going on with that?
9357000	9378000	Well, it was held by another esports group called Esports Hero Inc. and we set up the theater area of our store for about 32 players, but it got jam-packed pretty quickly, so pretty much we were raising funds for Extra Life and as well as playing that awesome card game, Hearthstone.
9378000	9381000	That's really cool. So it was another Extra Life fundraiser.
9381000	9383000	Yeah, pretty much.
9383000	9389000	Cool. How long did it go for? Was it like an all-day, all-night thing or was it just during the business hours?
9389000	9406000	It started early in the evening. This was around 6, but they changed the plan, so it started around 4.30, 5 o'clock, and it went for the next four hours, but unfortunately I wasn't able to stay for the whole thing because I was already working towards the end of my shift.
9406000	9415000	Now, does your store have like a Twitch channel or some type? I mean, maybe you have an internal thing with your company where people can watch all this stuff go down?
9415000	9434000	I don't think we have an official Twitch channel, but all the Twitch streams are run by other people, so like Esports Hero, they have their own Twitch stream that they want, and when we did our first Extra Life charity, that was held by Extra Life NYC.
9434000	9442000	It was their Twitch stream, and then when other people came in, we patched it over to each of their streams so they could have fun with that too.
9442000	9446000	Got it. Well, that makes sense that the people who are sponsoring it run it on their own stream.
9446000	9449000	Hey, can I ask you a completely random question about your work?
9449000	9450000	Sure.
9450000	9458000	Because you know, in the past couple weeks, I finally went out to the damn movies, which I haven't done in like over a year. So they had this commercial and it was so interesting.
9458000	9465000	Because that's what they do now, they show commercials at the movie theater, because as if paying 13 bucks to see a movie wasn't enough.
9465000	9476000	And so they have this commercial where all the employees of the Microsoft store start, like they walk down in front of the Apple store and they start singing Christmas carols or something.
9476000	9482000	And then there's, I don't know, there's all these little kids there too who I don't think are employees, but they were probably all paid anyway.
9482000	9489000	But yeah, so I just, and I was like, ooh, can I see Rama? Is Rama going to be in this? Or were they all paid actors? I don't even know.
9489000	9492000	But did you, do you know what commercial I'm talking about?
9492000	9499000	Yes, and I just want you to know, I'm getting very giddy about this because this is a fun story I like to tell if I have the time.
9499000	9508000	Well, we got time tonight. Our phones aren't exactly lighting up, so please, if you want. I know telling about work stories can sometimes be sensitive, but whatever you feel comfortable with.
9508000	9515000	It's cool. So just so everybody knows, I work at the Microsoft flagship store on Fifth Avenue. I'm a flagship services advisor.
9515000	9525000	So pretty much you bring your computer in. I try to fix it in 15 minutes. If not, it goes in the back and we fix it and you come back in two days fixed and you'd be happy and you go about your way.
9526000	9541000	So here's the thing. In the beginning of, I believe, November, middle of November, email went out to all of the Microsoft stores, flagship, full line and specialty, especially like the little mall kiosks you see.
9541000	9549000	And they were asking for all the employees to submit a 30 second demo of them singing their favorite Christmas song.
9550000	9558000	So I decided not to do it because I'm tone deaf and if you don't believe me, ask Mako-chan. She can verify this.
9558000	9559000	Fair enough.
9559000	9578000	So that Sunday, they filmed the commercial in our store. I was nowhere to be seen because I was in back of house fixing computers, even though I've had people message me saying they swore up and down they saw me in the commercial somewhere. I'm just like, no, I was back of house.
9578000	9582000	No, that was another tall black guy that you saw the commercial somewhere.
9582000	9599000	That was probably my friend's stretch. But they did film the commercial in the first floor. Now, later in the day, word traveled up towards the back that they were going up to the Apple store and we're like, why aren't you going to the Apple store?
9599000	9619000	We didn't even know that part was happening. So pretty much what you saw in that commercial were all Apple employees from the Fifth Avenue flagship and people wearing the Microsoft shirts. Those are employees from not just the New York City stores. Those are from people from all over the country that they were flown in for this commercial.
9619000	9626000	Oh, so they were in fact, they were employees, not actors, but they were the cream of the crop singers.
9626000	9627000	Yes.
9627000	9637000	Oh, interesting. And probably half the people listening have no idea what we're talking about, but maybe, I don't know, I assume if I saw it before Star Wars, a lot of the other people probably saw it too.
9637000	9647000	I saw it too. I also shared the commercial on my personal Facebook and I've had people share it to me asking if I've seen this. I'm just like, y'all are a day late and a dollar short.
9647000	9661000	Now, I will say this, I wasn't convinced I saw you, but I was definitely looking for you the minute I realized what it was, because it's not very obvious at first what it is, but the minute I realized what it was, I'm like, oh, is Rama in there? Is he singing somewhere?
9661000	9666000	No, because if I was, I probably would have shouted that all over the place.
9667000	9677000	That's true. That's a good point. I appreciate that. All right, well, I'm glad we could talk commercials and so forth. Thank you for giving us the scoop on that little commercial there, but I thought it was cute. It was a cute little holiday thing.
9677000	9686000	Yeah, definitely. And when you and Alan get the studio PC up and running for Windows 10 standard, let me know. I can hook y'all up.
9686000	9695000	Well, I absolutely appreciate that because, yes, that was one other thing. I was like, I don't really want to pay for Windows 7 right now and Windows 10.
9695000	9706000	Well, I'm just saying, well, we get benefits for working at Microsoft, so I can hook you up with stuff.
9706000	9726000	I appreciate that immensely. I really do. So maybe that'll be something we do in 2016. Who knows? Especially, there's been a lot of demand to incorporate more video into the show. I don't know. We'll see, because having a fancier OS and more oomph in the computer system would allow us to do that. So that is, let's say it's not off the table. We'll see.
9727000	9744000	Let me just say this real quick. I'm going to get out of here. Brad from Poco which says 10 is free. Here's the thing. If you're already running Windows 7 or Windows 8, the upgrade to 10 is free. If your computer is running XP or Vista, you have to purchase a retail copy to get to 10. That's how it works.
9744000	9750000	I did look into that. I was like, oh, maybe I can upgrade to 10. And I was like, oh, yeah, you can't do it from XP. You can only do it from 7 and 8.
9751000	9758000	Right. So you have to go from XP to 7 and then from 7 to 10. Either way, you're still paying for a copy of Windows.
9758000	9769000	And when you go from 7 to 10, you pretty much keep everything. Because when I did it on my home computer, I got to admit, it was really easy. And I liked that it would save everything for 30 days and that I had a panic button if I didn't like what it did.
9769000	9776000	But I ultimately ended up keeping it. But it really kept everything the same. But they pretty much tell you, if you go from XP to 7, you're going to lose a lot of stuff.
9776000	9779000	You're going to do a clean installation of everything.
9779000	9788000	That worries me a little bit because if you saw this computer and the way it's held the show together like duct tape for the past 14 years, you would probably cry.
9788000	9802000	Trust me, trust me. I mean, my beast of a machine that's running Windows 7, I was hesitant for running to upgrade to 10 because I'm like, I don't want to do the upgrade and then find out 20 minutes before my show that nothing's working.
9802000	9805000	And I'd be screaming to the heavens.
9805000	9817000	If I do something like that, and it's a big if, it would probably be like when there's a week with no show. Like in February, although that would be a really bad time because I'm going to be in DC for MAGFest for most of that.
9817000	9826000	But there'll be some other case in 2016 where we won't have a show for a week. Maybe Dark Soccer and Loki will be gone one weekend or something. And that'll probably be the time I choose to upgrade the computer. But we'll see.
9826000	9827000	There you go.
9827000	9831000	Alright, well buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in another caller too. Thanks so much for calling.
9831000	9833000	Awesome. Take care, bro.
9833000	9834000	Alright, you too. Bye.
9834000	9835000	Bye.
9835000	9842000	Yeah, Brad from Pod Culture in chat says, yeah, 10 is great. And DarkTacuya says, I'm glad I switched from 8.1 to 10 on my new laptop.
9842000	9851000	Yeah, that was, I remember now, that was my, a few of the week it was. 10 keeps fucking up my tablet drivers. And the reason, you know, or my touchpad drivers.
9851000	9860000	So, like now whenever I'm moving around and if like I try to right click or click on anything, the cursor fucking jumps all over the place. It's way too sensitive.
9860000	9863000	It's so interesting to me, the opinions on 10. People really love it or they hate it.
9863000	9876000	I just don't like that it keeps updating my shit. Like I had everything perfect and then like it goes and redoes everything. Like the last time I updated it was like I reinstalled Windows and all this shit is broken or back to the way it was again.
9876000	9880000	Rama's suggesting in chat the latest 8.1 drivers. Maybe you can, I don't know.
9880000	9883000	Well, I'm on 10, so.
9883000	9886000	But I think the point is 10 will still recognize the 8 drivers.
9886000	9890000	No, I understand that. I just have to reinstall everything again or uninstall whatever. Because they keep putting.
9890000	9892000	It can't be as bad as these Skype issues I had.
9892000	9896000	Because they keep installing two sets of drivers for that and it fucks it all up.
9896000	9901000	We got another call coming in, so we got to get to this. But I do want to give you a chance for last minute stories after this. But first we have a call on the line.
9901000	9903000	Hi, you're on Orange on the Train. Who's this?
9903000	9905000	Chugga chugga chugga choo choo!
9905000	9908000	Train takes 2016, bitches.
9908000	9915000	Oh my gosh, I'm so happy we get to start off the new year with you, Jim Sally on the Jim Sally train. What is up, my friend?
9915000	9918000	Not too much, man. I got really cold here in the last week.
9918000	9920000	You don't say?
9920000	9927000	I heard you guys had fucking snow on Christmas Day. In California, Northern California, there was snow on Christmas Day.
9927000	9932000	I went to fucking Tilsonburg, where my wife comes from. No fucking snow.
9932000	9939000	Actually, when you hear about that, you're probably hearing about Lake Tahoe, which technically is in Northern California, but it's also on top of a mountain.
9939000	9941000	Down here in SAC, no snow.
9942000	9950000	I think the only time it snowed that I can remember in the last ten years, it looked like Mother Nature just went achoo!
9950000	9953000	And that was the snow that fell. We don't get...
9953000	9959000	Even you see what's going on in Portland right now and all that, we don't get anything like that. That just doesn't happen here in the valley.
9959000	9964000	But we're in a valley, we're at sea level, so it doesn't lend itself to those type of snowstorms.
9964000	9970000	But yeah, when you see White Christmas in Northern California, I think they were showing that because of El Nino.
9970000	9973000	The East Coast was having a huge heatwave, right?
9973000	9983000	So not a lot of areas had a White Christmas, but here in California, it actually has been, by our standards, our California standards, really fucking cold.
9983000	9991000	It's been something like 20 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, which I know you're probably laughing at right now, but for us, we're not used to that.
9991000	9997000	When you live here, you get used to the 105 degree Fahrenheit days of heat and all that stuff.
9997000	10002000	You just learn to deal with that, but you never learn to deal with 20 degree cold and all that stuff.
10004000	10009000	Fuck dude, I live in 8 hours. I live 12 hours north of Buffalo.
10009000	10017000	And when I drove down south, I had my winter tires on, I had my fucking studs in, I was ready for winter and I didn't see a flake of snow.
10018000	10023000	My little girl, my little four-year-old girl, she looked at me when we were halfway home and she said,
10023000	10030000	Daddy? I said, yeah, little girl? She said, is Santa Claus mad at me? I said, honey, why would you say that?
10030000	10034000	She said, Daddy, he didn't bring any snow for me this year and I just wanted snow.
10037000	10041000	It was fucking, it was heartbreaking, man. It was fucking heartbreaking.
10041000	10048000	Aw, well, I'm sure there will be plenty of snow. He's just a little late in bringing the snow because he's going to bring a lot of it in February.
10048000	10052000	I've only got a lot of it now. When I got home, there was a lot of it here. It was so nice to come home.
10052000	10056000	There was a little bit of snow on the ground and the whole family's in the big gigantic Jim Sally truck.
10056000	10061000	And I said, honey, I said, look at that grassy field. And she said, baby, you do it. I said, yes, I'm going to do it.
10061000	10065000	And the little kids say, what's going to happen? And Daddy just starts doing donuts in the cornfield.
10065000	10068000	Oh, fucking donuts in the cornfield for Christmas.
10069000	10073000	And by the way, Jim Sally actually has on his Skype icon a picture of him and his children.
10073000	10080000	And you guys are just, you guys are so adorable and you look like you're teaching him something or I don't know the way you're kind of posed there.
10080000	10082000	So it's this adorable picture.
10082000	10084000	I can't even see my own picture.
10084000	10086000	It's probably in your Skype setting somewhere.
10086000	10091000	Oh, dude, that's me. I'm making them snacks. I like to fucking feed them vegetables and shit in the daytime. They're vegetable bowls.
10091000	10093000	That's good. Vegetables are healthy.
10094000	10102000	Yes. By the way, I just want to point this out because SSJ in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, just keep the snow away from MAGFest weekend.
10102000	10108000	Oh, God, do I agree. I do not want to deal with fucking airport delays. Try to get in and out of Washington, D.C.
10108000	10114000	And I do. Oh, my God. Like I bitched enough at PAX East. Like, don't do that shit to me.
10114000	10119000	I'm kind of paranoid about that for MAGFest, but I'm not going to rent a car in D.C.
10119000	10127000	I will just fucking Lyft or Uber or whatever they use out there to the hotel or fucking ugly bag somebody to pick me up in the snow.
10127000	10129000	I just Uber it, man. I'll be done with it.
10129000	10131000	You deserve it.
10131000	10134000	Well, what's on your mind tonight? What do you want to call in about?
10134000	10138000	I was going to reveal Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year.
10138000	10141000	Please. What was Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year?
10141000	10148000	It's very important for me for everyone to realize that Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year doesn't mean it came out in 2015.
10148000	10153000	It just means it's the game that I enjoyed playing the most in 2015.
10153000	10156000	That's OK. We all set the rules that work for our lifestyles.
10156000	10161000	Dark Sakura picked Dragon Age, and she's allowed to do that.
10161000	10170000	Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year for 2015 is Mass Effect 2.
10170000	10172000	Mass Effect 2.
10172000	10177000	That should be the game of the year every year. I mean, when P.T. is ineligible.
10177000	10183000	Mass Effect 2, which I believe they gave away on PlayStation Plus a couple months ago.
10183000	10189000	But OK, why Mass Effect 2 now? What would it be about five years after its release?
10189000	10192000	What made that your 2015 game of the year?
10192000	10197000	Well, originally I started I Keep Hearing You and Dark Sakura.
10197000	10200000	Tatsuya. Talk about it all the time. You know Jamie.
10200000	10201000	Of course.
10201000	10210000	Of course, I never played it on the 360. And sure enough, I had a bunch of Christmas money and there was the trilogy and it was fucking 20 bucks brand new for all three games.
10210000	10217000	I said, ship that to my house. And I had a lot of shit go down this year. I had a lot of shit go down this year in my life.
10217000	10225000	A lot of fucking lonely nights at home. Fucking sometimes I would I would kind of escape in that shepherd reality, you know, I made my little character.
10225000	10230000	And the nice thing, too, if people don't know about the Mass Effect games, like you make one character in game one, that's your fucking character.
10230000	10236000	Like you carry that bitch through the whole all three games. And I carried her through and we got to Mass Effect 2.
10236000	10241000	And it was mind blowing how many side characters you could have played with you.
10241000	10244000	And each side character had this fucking really awesome little story.
10244000	10247000	And you didn't have to do it, but I fucking did every single little side story.
10247000	10252000	Some of them I got on my side. Some of them didn't like me so much because my chick was a bit of a ruthless bitch.
10252000	10256000	But hey, that's who she was. You know what I mean? She needed to save the universe.
10256000	10267000	That is such a good point about what makes Mass Effect something that part of the reason why we obsess over it is because you do get so invested in that character.
10267000	10275000	And you're right, that character that you make in Mass Effect 1, you transfer them and all that decisions, if you want, to Mass Effect 2 and then Mass Effect 3.
10275000	10280000	Some of the customizations of the face might weirdly change between the games.
10280000	10285000	But for the most part, your character is your character and the decisions you make certainly have a huge impact.
10285000	10297000	Especially, and I'm trying to keep this spoiler free for a five year old game, but especially some of the decisions you make at the end of Mass Effect 2 have huge consequences for what's going to happen in Mass Effect 3.
10297000	10308000	Holy shit, it was unbelievable. I will say, when I got to Mass Effect 3, it was a little bit, I don't know, it didn't quite have that fucking pop that Mass Effect 2 had.
10309000	10324000	Yeah, I love Mass Effect 3 for what it is, but I also, I understand to a point the disappointment where when you're carrying that character from 1, 2, and 3, that the original ending of 3 really hinged on one decision that you made at the very, very, very end.
10324000	10329000	And that's why the extended cut DLC, which hopefully you were able to see...
10329000	10330000	Yes, I heard all that.
10330000	10341000	Okay, good. Because that incorporates much more where you can see the effects of other decisions you made will be incorporated into the ending and that's what made it so much better is that you weren't just seeing one decision, you were seeing all decisions.
10343000	10350000	Yes, I did get all the extra content, even the online from Mass Effect 2, which is passable. I wouldn't, I don't know.
10351000	10359000	It seems like something they slapped on because they were told that they had to have so many check marks underneath the new options for the next game.
10359000	10361000	There wasn't anything.
10361000	10372000	I like the multiplayer, but it's kind of died out now a few years later. There's really not a lot of people playing it anymore and the people who are playing it are uber. They're too extreme, you know, so...
10372000	10375000	By the time I got to it, yeah, it would have been pretty thin.
10376000	10377000	Alright, well...
10377000	10386000	For the year too, so now I got this awesome trilogy copy of Mass Effect 3 sitting on my desk that I'm never going to play again. It's old.
10386000	10400000	So if anyone wants it, send me a fucking Twitter. Send a Twitter to Jim Sally on Twitter or Jim Sally on Facebook or Jim Sally's iPod at gmail.com.
10400000	10415000	And I will put all the names in the ballot and my birthday's at the end of the month and I'll randomly pick a name on my birthday and you'll win an autographed copy of the Mass Effect trilogy for the Xbox 360. I'll autograph it. I'll write whatever you want on it.
10415000	10416000	I love it.
10416000	10422000	And send it to you. You can enjoy Shepard for all of her goodness too that she had in here, right?
10423000	10429000	I love it. It's like the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants except it's the Sally Hood of the Mass Effect 3 or Mass Effect trilogy.
10429000	10435000	I think that's great that you're passing the game forward to others who maybe haven't experienced it yet, you know?
10435000	10442000	And with Andromeda, a lot more people are going to be talking about Andromeda after E3 this year. So now's a good time to check it out, I suppose.
10443000	10449000	Alright. Well, Jim Sally, my friend, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but it's always a delight to hear from you. Thanks so much.
10449000	10453000	Rob, I love you, man. You guys take care, okay? Take care, man. I miss you, buddy.
10453000	10457000	Alright, I miss you too. Have a great 2016. We'll talk to you again.
10457000	10458000	Later, brother.
10458000	10459000	Alright, bye.
10459000	10464000	Alright, I think I am going to go ahead and close up the Skype line now over at our Skype line.
10464000	10468000	If you didn't get through, fill up that mailbag. You heard how sad it was tonight.
10468000	10472000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
10472000	10476000	Check in with Loki real quick before we wrap up for the night for any last minute news.
10476000	10477000	No.
10477000	10479000	I looked hard and nothing.
10479000	10486000	I did have to really kind of scrape the barrel to throw together a show for tonight because it was still technically a holiday week.
10486000	10492000	But as we continue into the next week, we're going to be back in full swing and I think we're going to start getting more and more news.
10492000	10497000	PAX East, actually no, that's always out this year. It's going to be more like April.
10497000	10502000	So I don't know when the first, maybe Game Developers Conference will come up in a couple months.
10502000	10504000	That's when we start to get a little bit of an idea of what's happening.
10504000	10511000	I mean, Game Developers Conference, again, not a trade show and not the big bells and whistles you see at those types of shows.
10511000	10516000	But we have had minor announcements. I believe PlayStation Home was announced at GDC one year.
10516000	10521000	So we may get something from that and I think things are going to start to wrap up as we get back into the game releases and so forth.
10521000	10525000	Oh, thank you. Everybody in chat is shouting Consumer Electronics Show. Thank you.
10525000	10532000	That is, I often forget about that one because there isn't a huge focus on games per se.
10532000	10536000	But we have had, like Microsoft announced Game Room at Consumer Electronics Show.
10536000	10544000	So we may see more, I know, I know a lot. But still, we may see something, little slivers of things come out of Consumer Electronics Show.
10544000	10548000	Especially with the VR stuff. We were talking about the beginning of the show, VR and AR.
10548000	10552000	We may get an update on the HoloLens. We may see a little more about that at CES.
10552000	10557000	So that is really soon. I think that's next week, actually, or two weeks.
10557000	10565000	I'd love to go to that one of these days, but I've already got a filling up calendar of expos to go to this next year.
10565000	10569000	So it's going to be pretty crazy, but I'm excited about it.
10569000	10572000	Thank you guys, of course, for being here, as always.
10572000	10577000	And we will be back in seven days to do this all over again.
10577000	10582000	I'm hoping to book some guests, too, some more indie developers to come on and talk about their games.
10582000	10588000	If you are or you know someone who wants to pitch a product here on Orange Launch Radio, a game that we should be checking out,
10588000	10592000	you can feel free to contact me, Rob, at vognetwork.com.
10592000	10594000	That's Rob at vognetwork.com.
10594000	10603000	I would prefer to spotlight things that actually have something out there that the listeners can go play and go check out.
10603000	10605000	So hopefully your game is to that point.
10605000	10609000	But yeah, I would love to get more developer interviews on here and so forth.
10609000	10612000	So anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10612000	10616000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10616000	10620000	Help us spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice,
10620000	10625000	because we can't talk about what they're saying if we aren't hearing the voices.
10625000	10630000	So we want to continue to bring you more voices throughout 2016.
10631000	10640000	If you really can't find anybody to tell, we also do really appreciate five-star reviews on podcasting websites such as iTunes or Stitcher Radio.
10640000	10642000	Those reviews go a very, very long way.
10642000	10648000	I can't tell you how much, especially on iTunes, the weight of those can really affect how you display on there.
10648000	10655000	So if you've never ranked the show on iTunes, we'd really appreciate you taking two minutes to go write a quick five-star review and say,
10656000	10660000	That brings us to the final thoughts for tonight.
10660000	10665000	Loki, good to have you back. We'll see you next week. Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10665000	10669000	Yeah, Fallout 4 for 17% off on PlayStation Network, $49.79.
10669000	10672000	Oh really? I think it's cheaper on Steam right now with Steam sale too.
10672000	10675000	You can probably buy it cheaper, yeah. I don't know.
10675000	10682000	I was looking to see if they sell Need for Speed on there. I was thinking about getting it, but probably not.
10682000	10685000	It's not selling anymore, so definitely no right now.
10685000	10691000	I don't really have a lot of final thoughts as well. I just want to get to playing some more games this week, some more new stuff.
10691000	10698000	I still have Rise of the Tomb Raider I got to check out, Undertale sitting in my Steam library, and I still need to check that out.
10698000	10703000	Hoping to do some more live streams and play some more games in 2016. Let's make it a great year.
10703000	10711000	Have a good one everybody. Thanks for listening to Orange Launch Radio. Have a great week. We will see you next time for 627. Bye.
