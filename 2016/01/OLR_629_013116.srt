00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, two groups have tried to register trademarks that have been a part of geek and gaming culture for many years, both being met with significant outcry and opposition. We'll tell you about each of them and get your take along with your calls and more, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 629 for this January the 31st of 2016.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know how we are already at the last day of January, but here it is. We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, live with you guys at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And if you are listening live, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where SHO 100 Matt says, January really flew. Yes it did, and here we are, pretty much by the time people hear the podcast version of this, it's going to be February, and we're in MAGFest month. I can't believe it, we were just talking to Bobby about that a little bit before the show tonight.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Anyhow, my name, Rob Roberts, you can follow me on Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E, joining you from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-hosts. Say hello over there to Techmaster Loki!

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. I see you plotting your next move. I'm not plotting my next move, I was just seeing if what I took down actually took down what I thought it did.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's all good. So you and I are sort of the reasons why there was no show last night, or last last night, last week. There was no show last week, sorry about that, you guys know I hate missing shows.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I was, I was pretty sick actually. If you did hear Bobby's show, I ended up doing a call-in, and I was kind of like right on the last stages of battling something sinacy.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I was like, me doing a three hour show, not really going to be a lot of fun, so I don't think that's going to work for me. And then Loki, you had a sick kid, right?

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, my youngest was throwing up.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So that's no fun. So there was no show last week. And then here's the weird part, is that unfortunately we don't have DarkSock right here tonight in studio, because even though she was fine and good to go last week, and I guess would have done this show solo for all we know, she was unable to make it at the last minute tonight.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She had a situation come up, so she was not able to be here tonight. But she even said on the phone to me, she was like, I don't want to be known as the flake queen, and I was like, I will make very clear, you are not the reason last week didn't happen.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So DarkSockra gets a pass on last week, but she gets a mark on this week, no I'm kidding, she's fine.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So sadly, no DarkSockra joining us tonight in studio, but we do have, and I'm really appreciative here, filling in at the last minute in studio tonight. Say hello everybody to Shane, Shane Alinko.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't talk right now, I have more wine to drink.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, so can we talk about this a little bit?

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So he is a perfect replacement.

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He has a perfect replacement for DarkSockra this week. So you, probably not even like three months ago, were that guy that was like, I don't drink wine, wine is stupid.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not how it goes.

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Alright, then you tell me how this goes.

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The way it goes is that I've had wine in the past, I liked it because it's part of Sangria. And I like Sangria.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's true, I like Sangria too.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's pretty good.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's the best thing to have with the Brazilian barbecue, in my opinion, yes.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But like wine in general, I just, you know, wasn't really feeling. But then, you know, Flaco Jones and his wife, they went and got some wine from a winery, and they're like, Shane, try this.

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And so I was the wine tasting guinea pig, even though they knew they liked him already. It's like, what will Shane do? It's like a React video basically.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We're going to talk about React videos. We actually would not be able to make one of those potentially. We'll get into that later.

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So the whole thing is, like, spoiler alert, all wine tastes like shoes. That's what I figured out. I dislike wine a whole lot. Some white ones are pretty good.

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You like the rosé.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, that. That was okay. Like, oh, and then I got yelled at because I mixed Martinelli's Sparkling Cider in one, and Flaco Jones's wife was like, you need to leave right now.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But it made it taste good. But if it's a red wine, it tastes like a shoe.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Various types of shoes.

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I noticed that you had this thing, like you tended to like the sweet wines.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I just like, if I'm going to drink alcohol period, and it's not a shot, it has to be sweet.

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So I was telling you, I said, Shane, I know a winery that makes, like, they specialize in sweet wines. I drive out there to get my wine there from the winery. You'll like this.

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And you were kind of like, you know, whatever, whatever, Rob, you're never right.

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's true.

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But then you came over and just before during Bobby's show, I poured you a glass of wine.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I was like, you know, don't pour too much because I'm not going to want to drink it.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're not going to like it. And now you're in this room.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And now I could drink it all day. Like, I found a water replacement.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So yes, Shane Alinko and I are drinking wine.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, and wine hits so hard pretty quick too.

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We're going to have to finish off the bottle somehow.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, just put it in front of me. It'll be gone before the show's over.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
As long as you're safe to drive or you're crashing on the couch, I don't know.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I would just crash somewhere, either in the road or on the couch.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't joke about that. That's not funny.

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I wouldn't be texting. I'd be drunk.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Anyway, well, I will say this, though.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That winery I almost bought because they make a rosé.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It probably would be pretty good.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It would probably be pretty good.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do they make red ones? Because I don't know if you could have, like, shoes that taste sweet.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They do make red ones, but they aren't sweet.

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, well then, yeah, there would be no point in getting those.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Anyway, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Martin's in our chat room tonight and says,

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Red wine is something you need to learn how to appreciate.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Like, nobody likes beer the first time. They try it either.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I still don't like beer.

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, still don't.

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't appreciate drinking shoes. It's just not my thing.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Fuck wine. Fireball.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, that would be fun too, though. I don't mind that.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you going to mix fireball with the wine?

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, because this is like drinking really delicious, like, apple juice almost.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, one of my friends hates this wine because he says it's just cool.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why are they your friend?

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right, let's talk real quick. We're going to get into video gaming news

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and last week's news set to Holik and everything we missed and everything.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I do want to give Shane Olinko an ample chance because a lot's changed since the last time you were here on this program.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, I got an iPad Pro.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You did. And it's nice. And you've been playing games like...

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, yeah. Music games are so good on this, except I don't care for ReRave. I'm sorry.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sorry, Kyle Ward. You're hot, but I don't care for ReRave.

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And I think Shane is wrong in that department that ReRave is plenty fine.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I actually think it's better on my phone than on the bigger screen.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, so you just think the size...

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, I don't have a problem with the game. I think the game is fine, but I don't like it on the bigger screen.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, okay.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I didn't really like it in the arcade either. I think it's a great phone game, though.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Interesting. I don't think Kyle can be too mad at you since she still likes it somewhere.

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But I thought it was fine. But I have heard complaints like, ironically enough, Ingressors.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I know some that play on a tablet that have data on the tablet.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And they don't like it as much because when they try to do the glyph and stuff, it's too big.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, yeah. That would be really hard to do really quick.

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have heard that sometimes a bigger playing service can be an issue.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah, but like DJ Max Technica Q on this, which they don't even support anymore.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It hasn't had a new song pack, I think, since 2014.

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And Sidus. Love Sidus on this game. So good. Those are my most played games on here.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, but besides your iPad, you have...

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I got more Power Ranger toys.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You did. And now you have a podcast.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I do. Oh my gosh, I'm so tired of podcasting right now.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We have done eight shows in 19 days.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We is who?

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Me and Spike. Captain Spike from Game Buoy.

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Awesome. So you guys now have... Tell us a little bit about this show. What is it? It's a Power Ranger show.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a Power Ranger show. We try to stay super positive because there's a lot of negativity in any sort of fandom.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's also got gay elements because, surprise, we're gay.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And we just talk and have a good time. We review episodes. We talk about news.

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Lately, our past few episodes have been nothing but the most recent season up until yesterday for America, which was Dino Charge.

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And we just rushed to get through the first 20 episodes so we could start talking about current episodes.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So yesterday was the season premiere. So starting this week, we will have current shows to talk about.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let me ask this question. I don't personally feel this way, but I have to ask tough questions.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Power Rangers is a kids' show. What do adults have to say about a kids' show?

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Apparently two and a half hours worth sometimes.

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What do you get out of Power Rangers being in your 30s?

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's just a superhero show. I don't really see it that different than watching the Avengers or watching X-Men.

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It might be more geared towards kids, but it's still superheroes and it's fun.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And sometimes they do put things in there for adults that kids won't pick up.

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Or it's just neat. It's not like, I don't know. I can't stand SpongeBob, but people my age and older love it.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So you can always find reasons to like something that may not be in your age group.

119
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But screw that. It's your choice to what you like.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
5th Dream in chat over at live.hognetwork.com brings up Pokemon as a kids' game.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Is it?

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Here's the thing though. Keep in mind we're celebrating the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.

123
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So if you're 30 and you love Pokemon, it's because you were probably playing it as a kid.

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's true. And also, I don't mean to be a jerk or just to say, are you sure you're dumb?

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But the Pokemon World Championships, those are streamed on Twitch.

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How many 6-year-olds are watching Twitch? I mean, there probably are some.

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But I don't know. Last year when the World Championships were on, I was glued to Twitch.

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I could not quit watching. It was so good.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And this year it's in San Francisco, so I want to go down there.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sorry, I'm getting the comments from chat that my mic is dying, so I just switched out.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't know what's up with the green mic I've been using, but I've switched that out there, so hopefully that doesn't happen again.

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The joys of doing live radio. What can you do?

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't know.

134
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I guess something might be wrong with the wire.

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And with all the mix and match that goes around here in the studio, I wouldn't be surprised at all if the wire is just somehow on its last leg.

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So anyway, sorry about that. But I don't even know what I said now.

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It was about Pokemon being kids or adults. And Pokemon Go coming out. Is that really going to be...

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, 6-year-olds do have cell phones now, but I expect a lot more adults will be playing that than kids.

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, I think it's going to be a big family thing. I think you're going to have a lot of 30-somethings playing it with their kids.

140
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You brought up Flaco and Mrs. Flaco earlier. They'll probably... I just assumed they'd play that game maybe with their kids. Maybe.

141
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know if that's something them specifically are into, but that's kind of an example where you have the 30-somethings who grew up with Pokemon will be playing that with their kids.

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's kind of like, and you're going to hate this example, but I don't care. I've been having a lot of wine today, so I'm just going to say what I think.

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
How many bottles have you gone through?

144
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's kind of like the audience I see at Rocky Horror Picture Show these days.

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I already hate this example.

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The audience at the Rocky Horror Picture Show, we are fortunate that we sell out a lot of the shows we do here in Sacramento.

147
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Which, by the way, we have one coming up on February 13th that I'm hosting for you locals here in SAC.

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But a lot of the audience I see now is people that are in their 40s when they were going to the movie when it first came out, like in theaters.

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Or even people in their 30s that went through it in the 90s and so forth, bringing their teenagers to experience it for the first time.

150
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So it's interesting to see how that generation handoff happens.

151
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And the reason why I bring up that example, it's more than just games. It certainly happens with movies, too.

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think even Star Wars and the success of Episode 7 is a lot of the parents, perhaps, taking their...

153
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And the parents are experiencing it like they were kids and bringing their own kids.

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And that's just throwing out the prequels, like most people do.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And you know, Labyrinth is getting a reboot, supposedly.

156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is that real, though?

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If it's real, you know, whatever kid I choose to kidnap, I will take to Labyrinth and be like, this is what I grew up with, too.

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There you go.

159
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Screw you, Toby! You're staying here!

160
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm not dealing with your fucking ass.

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you actually going to have your own Labyrinth, perhaps? Are you a goblin king in training?

162
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's creepy.

163
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I still think it would have been cool to follow the comic books for the sequel.

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, the manga?

165
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, the manga.

166
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, I never read those. I was like, they're ruining Labyrinth, probably, but they're probably actually good.

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I just was like, I'm so a purist about Labyrinth, and it can't be touched.

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Alright, one tangential topic, and then we'll get into video games for sure.

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
One?

170
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
One. Can David Bowie be replaced as the Goblin King, though?

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No.

172
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, I don't think he can. Like, whoever is going to...

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If they were to remake it or do a sequel or whatever, whoever's going to step into that role is damned.

174
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's why they just can't do it until we have the technology to just...

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
To bring him back?

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Bring him back.

177
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, that would be okay, too.

178
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Actually, there's one person. One person I would be okay with.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Who?

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Tilda Swinton.

181
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I've seen that, and I don't know who that person is, but it's a she, right?

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, Tilda Swinton. But it doesn't matter. She played Bob Dylan in some movie.

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But you have to be musical. Like, you have to also...

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She can do anything. You have this gigantic iPad.

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And I'm talking...

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It does an internet. Look up Tilda Swinton right now.

187
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't. I'm talking about Power Rangers stuff with people.

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's way more important. But you just have to get some random pop star.

189
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Like, it could be somebody from One Direction to be...

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, what is wrong with you?

191
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I've had too much fun.

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We'll just get David Hasselhoff. It works, right?

193
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Shut it down.

194
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, twist! What if Jennifer Connelly became the Goblin Queen, and then it follows somebody new?

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I guess that's alright. Jennifer Connelly's pretty awesome.

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, yeah, but she was in the first...

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, duh, I know that.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know if you know that. You had a lot to drink.

199
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Or what if she gets kidnapped and the grown-up Toby or whatever has to go save her?

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That would be cool. But who would be the villain at that point?

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think they had a queen in the manga.

202
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, did they?

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't really read it. I bought it. I think I bought it for Dark Sakura, actually, but...

204
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, well then they could just get Lady Gaga since she was an actress now, too.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, that would work.

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, Tilda Swinton is playing a character in the Doctor Strange movie.

207
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know what a Doctor Strange is. Is that a Doctor Who film?

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's Marvel. It's a Marvel universe thing. No.

209
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But Tilda Swinton could be Doctor Who as well. I'd be totally fine with that.

210
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I've never seen that either, so whatever.

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My god, you've got so much to catch up on.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Nope. Power Rangers.

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
SSG100Matt says, we have the science to make a hologram, David Bowie.

214
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That is out there.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But do we have the science to make his codpiece?

216
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Did you?

217
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's like the secondary character in that movie.

218
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We're still perfecting that technology.

219
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Did you see the Splatoon concert that happened?

220
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
No, but I want to.

221
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It was all hologram with the sister. Like, literally...

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are we talking about that later at all?

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I think. I don't know. It might have been on the list somewhere.

224
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because, although I'm just gonna cheat anyway.

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's fine.

226
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like, I heard that was so good, and they had like respawn points at the concert,

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and they had like all the weapons, and apparently we're getting the Squid Sisters as amiibo.

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, that's pretty weird.

229
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That got data mined.

230
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Of course we are!

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
At least it's...

232
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Cha-ching!

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Well, I want more Splatoon amiibo. That's awesome.

234
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I love Splatoon, and I love the amiibo, and they're hilarious.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Alright, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, only like 20 minutes into the show.

236
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But I want to talk a little bit about what we missed last week with Sickness taking over Sacramento and OLR Studios.

237
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We missed last week's show, so let us quickly recap.

238
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Last week's news, Setaholic.

239
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Last week in the gaming universe, there were some big time rumors about the NX leaked from a GfK survey.

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And it wasn't the fact that the rumors were out there, because, you know, another week, another set of NX rumors until Nintendo clarifies something.

241
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But it's the fact that the mainstream media was running like crazy with these rumors.

242
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Of course they are.

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Specifically, the 900p rumor of the system.

244
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And since 900p is less than 1080p, clearly it must be bad.

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But, I mean, if the NX is a handheld and a console system, which I'm almost starting to accept as fact at this point, it's coming up so often.

246
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Would it make sense that 900p is the resolution of the handheld?

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Doesn't seem like rocket science to me. I don't know.

248
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, it makes sense, except, you know, a lot of other handhelds are not that, and, you know, I want to say it's...

249
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't they have 1080 on, uh, the Vita?

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I think so.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Speaking of other news from Nintendo, Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow coming out on Virtual Console, but there will be no save and restore feature.

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So you can't grind, you know, one area over and over and, you know, try to get a mutation, and if it goes wrong, reset it.

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But there will be online Pokemon battles.

254
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Also, David Gator leaving BioWare after 17 years last week.

255
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Is Dragon Age fucked? I don't know. Stay tuned. I don't think that's right.

256
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He was already off of Dragon Age at this point, though, so if they were kind of screwed over, that already was in motion.

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And really quickly, even though the music ran out, the commentary ran that over, I'll say there's also a 100-game Atari collection on its way to Steam.

258
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This looks to be based off the iPhone or iPad Atari collection that's already out there, but Atari Vault apparently was supposed to show up at PAX South this weekend.

259
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I haven't heard a lot about it, but that was something that came up last week when Atari announced it.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So there you go, last week's news set to Holic.

261
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Anything else you guys wanted to say on the NX thing, since I was trying to fit in all that news a minute and a half?

262
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't really care what the resolution is. I just hope it's, you know, modern specs.

263
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, that's the only thing that matters.

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's not do what we did with, I mean, it worked okay for the Wii because you had a unique control system, did not work very well for the Wii U.

265
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No.

266
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's just catch this shit up.

267
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm finding the handheld being a little bit lower resolution. I don't even know, what's the resolution on the Wii U gamepad? I'm not really sure.

268
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not that great.

269
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's not that great, but I believe some Wii U games will run 1080p 60 frames a second.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm fine, who cares? Oh, it's 100 less pixels. That's not going to be so noticeable.

271
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'd rather have 60 frames than 100 more pixels.

272
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'd rather have Nintendo fix some of their, I'd rather have Nintendo brace online a little more.

273
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll trade you 180ps for better online ecosystem. Whatever 180p is worth.

274
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Which they are trying to kind of move towards, it seems, so they're just very slow about it.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Incredibly slow about it.

276
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Alright, well we'll see. I mean, again, this is just rampant speculation until Nintendo themselves clarify something which I really don't anticipate to happen until E3.

277
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I know a lot of folks are saying, oh, but if the handheld is coming this year, Nintendo has to say something before the fact. Do they?

278
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm not so sure they have to.

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Which is interesting because as part of that whole rumor and what's gaining steam there, do you remember the very first episode of the year of predictions?

280
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I actually said, they'll sell the handheld this year and they'll sell the console next year.

281
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It looks like that is actually happening. Not to talk myself up too much, but let's be real, I called that.

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Potentially. We won't know until E3, for sure.

283
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know. We'll see. I mean, I just hope it's good.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah. Maybe the fact that the Wii U releases have been very, very quiet and they've really...

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't want to say they've artificially stretched out their calendar, but I do feel like Mario Maker got pushed back, Star Fox got pushed back,

286
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Zelda got pushed back. It's almost like they took a lot of the stuff they had for 2015 and really pushed it back to fill out 2016.

287
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And granted, probably give us some better games in the long run.

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, and they have to do that too because the reason why is they don't have the third party support anymore.

289
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Even the companies that used to support them aren't really doing it anymore.

290
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But maybe they've taken a lot of the resources that would be developing games and now they're all developing for NX right now.

291
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It could be that. I think a lot of it's just not seeing the sales and it's just not worthwhile to them to develop a Wii U version of the game.

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But hasn't Wii U broken at least 10 million at this point? It seems like there's enough of them.

293
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's not a flop. It's not a total flop. It's not like a freaking N-Gage or something.

294
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's just the Wii U is... it's alright. It's not a Playstation 4, but it's alright.

295
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And at least if you're releasing something at retail, there's not a lot competing with it on that platform. So you got that going for you, I guess.

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Alright, well that was last week's news. We're going to start to transition into this week and what's going on in video games.

297
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We will get to the news from this week, but we do always at the top of the show like to go around and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

298
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And how was your gaming week? Shane, you're the guest. We'll start with you tonight. How was your gaming week?

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It was fine. I've played an ungodly amount of Final Fantasy Explorers. No, seriously, everybody I know is like, oh, we're just now getting into two-star quests and three stars.

300
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm all by myself at seven-star quests, because it's basically Phantasy Star Online with a little bit of Monster Hunter, and it's just a lot of fun to me, so I don't want to quit playing it.

301
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What is it about the game that keeps you going on it?

302
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's Phantasy Star Online with a little Monster Hunter, and I can't quit playing it.

303
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And why Phantasy Star Online? What about that draws you to the game to keep playing?

304
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's just a fun little beat-em-up where I get to level. Well, you don't really level up your character. You get like ELs, which is, I don't remember what the E stands for, but the more quests you do, the farther you progress in the main quest, the more your levels go up.

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's just hack and slash, run to an area, kill a boss, kill this many enemies. I don't know, it's fun. It's a great time waster, and my little character is adorable.

306
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Do you play a lot online? I know we played online a little bit this week, but...

307
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, just with friends.

308
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You don't play with strangers?

309
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Not yet. I will probably do that eventually, because all my friends, again, aren't where I'm at, and I can't get any farther right now because my gear kind of sucks.

310
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And that's where the farming aspect comes in, because you make all your gear.

311
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Do you just have to grind old stuff over and over to make...

312
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, because you need materials from specific bosses or enemies, and some of the bosses have different parts you can break to try to get items, and it's tedious in the Monster Hunter way, but I still have fun with it.

313
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And that's really it for Explorers.

314
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And I've been playing, you know, my music games on my iPad, a little bit of Diablo because of the seasonal characters, and that's it. I don't play any other games right now.

315
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

316
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Well, let's see, this week I played lots of Fallout 4, so I had that, and then of course Lego Avengers came out, so I've been playing that to unlock characters for my son to play as, mainly just trying to get through everything.

317
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I finished the first two, well I finished all the story missions, or most of the story missions, the main ones that they have in there, so now they have the free kind of open world gameplay stuff unlocked so they can play that.

318
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And it's got a lot of really obscure characters in it.

319
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Originally my kind of gripe about the game was that instead of going with original voice actors for the characters like they did with the last one, which I thought they were great.

320
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I mean they had Troy Baker doing Loki and stuff, which I thought was fantastic.

321
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They instead went with the movie sounds, the movie clips basically, they kind of took the audio from the movies and just spliced it up to do the voices for the characters, which is fine.

322
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And at first I didn't like it, but then kind of watching what they did with it was kind of funny, because there will be different things like dialogue from the movie, and the stuff that they have going along with the dialogue is really silly.

323
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So it kind of plays off each other, although some of the little one liners that they have throughout the game are kind of annoying and very repetitive, because they only have a small library of clips to choose from.

324
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Aside from that, the game looks good. I had a lot of fun with it. The cars drive like absolute shit, so they completely fucked the cars over. They're so weighty and just annoying, but they did that.

325
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't know, they have some pretty interesting characters though, like I got Fing Fing Foom unlocked, and just like the little missions you have to do to unlock these characters are pretty silly, and plus he gets really huge and my son loves that.

326
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Aside from that, I played a little bit of Ingress, not so much as I have been, because I'm on that new schedule where I don't have a lot of free time, so I played a little bit of that, mainly on my commute to and from work.

327
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And aside from all of that stuff, I caught up on a lot of the awesome games done quick stuff, so I watched.

328
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, that's right, because they archive everything.

329
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, they archive it, and I haven't been able to, I didn't catch it live, so I was watching the speedruns for Kaizo Mario 3, for the Legend of Zelda Link to the Past reverse boss order run, which is pretty awesome.

330
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The Mario Maker hard levels, and they had the blind hard levels that they ran, there was also, I'm trying to think of the other run I watched, I want to go through the Final Fantasy one that they had, I think it was Final Fantasy IV.

331
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It was IV, they did IV right at the end.

332
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It might have been IV, yeah, so I got to watch IV, mostly a lot of the Mario ones, and the Taskbot stuff, I was watching some of that, but I find it so entertaining compared to just like, I can watch a channel of that.

333
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I am, I'm watching a YouTube channel of that, but I'm just saying that stuff is really interesting, I'm surprised they can't put that on TV, I guess a lot of people might not be interested that long or something, I don't know, but I find it really interesting at least.

334
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So that's it, that's pretty much what I did this week.

335
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Awesome. Well my gaming week, I've been playing a lot of Diablo III because of the seasons, I am just shy of Paragon 400 for the season, that means I'm already further progressed than I was last season.

336
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And you remember last season I talked about what an ungodly level I was at, you know what's really pushed things along this season? The fact that they give you a full set of set gear, essentially right after you hit 70, I mean you have to do some achievements to get it, but it's manageable.

337
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And yeah, that really propelled what I was able to do and has made this season crazy competitive. Some of the record holders and people that are doing really crazy stuff out there, already above Paragon 1000.

338
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You know, Extrofer's partner plays a lot, he's like Paragon 700 something, so I mean I feel insignificant next to all them, but I'm having fun with it and that's the important thing, it's actually something Alan and I do together a lot.

339
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Usually after he gets home from work we'll play Diablo and keep trying to push a higher and higher level rift that the two of us can do. We just did a 57 last night and I think that's the highest we've ever done as a duo.

340
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I think the highest we ever got last season was 53 or 54, so I mean yeah it's kind of crazy to see that progression. I don't know if Diablo's going to keep raising the ceiling like that, I'm hoping they're going to announce a new expansion sooner rather than later, I really hope that's in the cards for Diablo.

341
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But having a lot of fun with that. Season play, not available on consoles because online on consoles has already been exploited and they can't really do the same thing there that they can do on PC.

342
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I also went back and visited some retro stuff on Wii U Virtual Console because I had some things to catch up on, namely Metroid Zero Mission. I finally had to download and play some of that.

343
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If you think about it, that was the last 2D Metroid game they made. God, I miss that game. I just miss those style of Metroid games. I liked Other M more than most people did, but it's still not the same thing as those old 2D Metroid games. I never got into Prime.

344
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Prime is really good though. I do, I especially like Prime 3, but I just can't love them the same way that I love the 2D games.

345
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I wish they would do, was it Retro Studio is the one doing the Donkey Kong game? Yeah.

346
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, so get Retro Studio to do a new 2D Metroid using that engine that Ubisoft has for their hand drawn. Oh yeah, that'd be pretty cool. Like the top light stuff.

347
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, like a really beautifully done 2D game. You know what actually kind of game reminds me of that would be like Wario, was it Wario Land Shake or something like that? The one that they had that was all hand drawn that looked really awesome and nobody bought.

348
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't even remember.

349
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It was like a hand drawn 2D Wario game that was on the Wii and it looked really pretty, but no one bought it unfortunately, because it's Wario and not Mario.

350
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well the WarioWare games are fantastic. Yeah, we need another WarioWare game. I'm surprised we haven't seen one of those in a while. The last one they had was really shit though, wasn't it? Oh no, it was so much fun, especially the multiplayer. The Wii U one?

351
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, but the game itself was not the same caliber as the rest of them. But maybe that'll be an NX thing, who knows. Anyway, also on virtual mode. Yeah, it'll come out with F-Zero too. Fingers crossed.

352
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Also on Wii U along with Metroid Zero Mission, it's Super Mario Bros. Advance 4, but it's actually Mario Bros. 3, but because it has all the e-reader levels already unlocked in it.

353
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because they just used save states and I think they used a save state where all the e-reader levels had already been scanned in. And so that's the one that kind of loads by default and so you actually have access to all the e-reader levels.

354
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So it's almost like you're playing Mario Maker but with Nintendo made levels. And so that's kind of fun. So if you've never played Mario Advance 4, I think it's worth a look. The only thing that throws me about that game otherwise is that it's hard to play Mario Maker on your TV.

355
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Then go play Mario Advance 4 on your TV because the proportions are different so the levels don't look the same. Even though they are the same, they don't look the same. And so it kind of throws you a little.

356
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
They have the Mario Maker levels. Someone's already made the Mario Maker or levels in Mario Maker.

357
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The e-reader levels, yeah. I'm not surprised to hear that.

358
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What about the ones that they had on, was it like a Hudson version of Mario or something like that? There was a Hudson version of Mario that came out that had levels that weren't in gameplay elements that were in the normal Mario games but it never got released.

359
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I don't remember that.

360
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, I was on PC or something. We had covered it a long time ago.

361
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Wasn't it the people that made Commander Keen tried to do a PC port of Mario 3?

362
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:49,000
No, no, no. It's not Mario 3. I don't remember what the hell it's called now. I just remember the graphics were really kind of funky looking. It was a PC or not an actual IBM or anything.

363
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Hey, chat room to the rescue. Dark Tetsuya says the PC-88 Super Mario Bros. special.

364
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's what I meant. Yeah, so I'd be interested to see some of those levels. Hey, how about we add that version of it to Mario Maker? That'd be cool.

365
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That would be cool. And then lastly on Virtual Console, just completely randomly versus Excitebike because it was on sale. So I got it cheap and I forgot how different the arcade version is.

366
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But I remember playing the arcade version but the interface looks different and has the competitive element. Yeah, different.

367
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And then the last game I've been spending a bit of time with this week is also Final Fantasy Explorers on the 3DS. But only a bit.

368
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, I'm one of those people that's at the two and three star level, not where Shane is at.

369
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Well, and the problem, I'm jumping in and taking over your week. The problem with the game is that it gives you tutorial quests at the very beginning of the game to get you accustomed to it.

370
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
However, what they don't tell you is that up until you get halfway through, maybe even towards the end of the three star quests, it's still a tutorial.

371
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And that's very slow going. But once you get past that, it's just so much fun. So play it more.

372
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I don't dislike the game. And I know Shane knows where I'm going to go with this. No, I don't. I already forgot. You do.

373
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't dislike the game by any means, but here's my biggest problem with the game. It should be on Wii U. I really think this game would be so much better if they'd just done it for Wii U.

374
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And I'm really trying to think, why did they make a game like this? Because they wanted to capitalize on the Monster Hunter crowd.

375
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because even if it's only slightly like Monster Hunter, all the really popular Monster Hunter games are handheld.

376
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And if you'd let me finish, I would have said... No, no. I took care of it. It's fine.

377
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Well, and I understand. The 3DS, especially considering this game was really for Japanese release, we didn't get it until way later.

378
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And it was really for that market. I understand it in those terms that, okay, it's a little different. And yes, when you bring in the Monster Hunter, although there is a Monster Hunter game on Wii U, but it also sucks.

379
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes, but one. And how many are handheld? 50 million.

380
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Or I should say the demo sucked. I will give you this. It's now making me curious that maybe I need to go back and re-evaluate Monster Hunter on Wii U.

381
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It did the same thing to me, but I know, because I have it on my 3DS, I know if I play it, I'm going to be like, this is still not a game for me. Back to Explorers.

382
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But I just wish Explorers was on Wii U. I think it would just... Because it's so weird to me, playing it on 3DS, there's no 3D.

383
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It does start to, like if you have a lot of stuff going on on the screen at one time, it does start to, you see the performance issues a little bit.

384
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And I mean, it does online pretty well. I mean, for all jokes about it.

385
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I haven't seen any disconnects or anything like that.

386
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah, me neither.

387
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Why is it not on the Wii U? Because it wouldn't sell as well on the Wii U.

388
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
That's true.

389
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And honestly, that's not a lie. And I get that.

390
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And apparently, it's like selling really well here. People are having a hard time finding it.

391
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh, is it? Oh, interesting. Well, they probably underestimated the demand for it.

392
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Probably.

393
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I mean, I know the Fantasy name goes a long way, but it's not just the name. It's the class design.

394
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And, you know, there's a very big sense of familiarity.

395
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And that's why I also wouldn't want to do Monster Hunter, is because this has magic and stuff.

396
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Monster Hunter really doesn't have that. And Monster Hunter is more, I feel like, hardcore.

397
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
This is a game like Fantasy Star Online, where I can just sit back and have fun.

398
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Look at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

399
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
AkumaJP says, Monster Hunter minus monthly fee equals heaven.

400
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's the monthly fee. Yeah, there's no fee or anything to play this game online.

401
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Oh, I didn't... Does our Monster Hunter here have a monthly fee?

402
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Not the Wii U one, for sure. I don't think it has online.

403
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But here's the funny thing. I wonder if this Final Fantasy Explorers will outsell Monster Hunter here in the States.

404
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No. Monster Hunter does well here, too.

405
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
In the States?

406
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, it does well. It doesn't do as well as in Japan. But it does well here.

407
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Okay. Well, that's fair.

408
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Monster Hunter, the 3DS one that came out, what, last year for us?

409
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You couldn't find physical copies anywhere when it first came out, too.

410
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So, I think it's that genre that is picking up steam here.

411
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Interesting.

412
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Which is a perfect time for PSO2 to come out, might I say.

413
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Thank you.

414
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Sega PS4 release, please.

415
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Thank you.

416
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
My one, maybe, complaint is that it does feel a little repetitive.

417
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But I get that's what a Monster Hunter game is all about.

418
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But it is like, okay, I'm going through the same area again, except now this person's here.

419
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Or I'm going, and now these monsters are here.

420
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And it is a little bit like, or at least it's varied.

421
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like, at least I'm not in the same environment on every map.

422
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But, I don't know.

423
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Well, then, if you also take into account the monster stuff, where, you know, you got your little followers.

424
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Like, because I just learned this, because I was trying to get a couple of them.

425
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
They all have their own unique stats, and some will be better.

426
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So, you'll always want to, like, capture and make them.

427
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And then see what they offer you stat and ability-wise.

428
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And then if they kind of suck, you'll go capture another one until you get one that you really like.

429
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So, it's really, there's a deep customization.

430
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, and the spells and abilities, you customize those through.

431
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And that's so in-depth.

432
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It is neat.

433
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah.

434
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
How do you, how do I explain this?

435
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Well, okay, I can do it.

436
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Easy.

437
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay, go for it.

438
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So, I have, I play Blue Mage because it's blue.

439
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And I learned the classic spell, Bad Breath.

440
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And in Final Fantasy, that puts all these status ailments on you.

441
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Well, I did what's called a mutation to it.

442
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So, not only does it do that, but it also has a chance to cast death on the enemy to kill them immediately.

443
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Or it can also put stone on them so they freeze in place.

444
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And it all says freeze, so they freeze in place.

445
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And how did you mutate?

446
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
These, I don't remember what it's called. Crystal something or other.

447
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Crystal Surge.

448
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Crystal Surge, yeah.

449
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Which are arbitrary, and that's the thing that throws me about that whole process.

450
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But that's how you, I guess that's how they keep the gameplay varied.

451
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Otherwise, you're just gonna figure out a way to constantly bring up the ones you want to mutate your spells.

452
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So, like, you start off with Cure and you want to put Haste on it.

453
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Well, you can Crystal Surge it and maybe you'll get the one that has Haste, maybe you won't.

454
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But if you cast Cure while you're under a Crystal Surge, you have a chance to proc that mutation and then you go learn it later.

455
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You go learn that spell, then you have that Cure, we'll just call it like Cure 1, because that's what they do.

456
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And you proc a Crystal Surge that does Float.

457
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And if that, you know, shows up in your list and you use it and you use that Cure 1, now you have Cure plus Haste plus Float.

458
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay, Bob Coffee is a Monster Hunter fan that looks like in our chatroom and giving some insight on the series.

459
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Bob Coffee says, Monster Hunter starts out bad until you understand it, then kill some big-ass monster.

460
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Monster Hunter 4U is online.

461
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And Bonds006 says, there are some Monster Hunter clubs here in New York.

462
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
A group of friends meet bi-weekly on Sundays at Nintendo World NYC and play their Monster Hunter games.

463
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Average about 8 people or more meet males and females.

464
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, like I said, it's doing well here too, so we're catching up to that genre.

465
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Alright, so I...

466
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I need more wine, I'm already almost done again.

467
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I like Final Fantasy Explorers, I don't love it like Shane does, but...

468
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Shane super loves it.

469
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Maybe I'm not far enough in yet.

470
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't think you're far enough in, that's the thing.

471
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I keep getting distracted by Diablo 3 and try to push further in that.

472
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, just sit down and play more Explorers and once you get a little farther, and I can come help.

473
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I mean, like, my EL is like 77 now, which is really high, so I can help.

474
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But then, I don't know, here's the thing, don't take this the wrong way.

475
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Nope, already took it the wrong way, because that's how you started it.

476
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I had more fun fighting the Adolans by myself, because I felt like I was actually learning the fight and what to do,

477
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
as opposed to when I was doing them with you, and it was like, oh, they're dead, because Shane killed them.

478
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That's how I feel when I bring out my Black Knight, because I'll sit back and die,

479
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and he'll just go up there, because he's one of the monsters you can get, and he just owns everything.

480
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'll be trying to break a certain part off of a monster, but I can't because he already killed it,

481
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
or I'm trying to encase it and get its power.

482
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Five minutes ago, he killed it, and I'm just, you know, winged it.

483
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
God damn it, you stupid Black Mage, I told you I could fucking do that.

484
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, I mean, that was the thing, I finally learned what Ramuh was doing when I had to fight him by myself.

485
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
When we fought Shiva, I had no idea what the fuck was going on.

486
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, I still don't know Shiva.

487
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And I actually learned, oh, the little red circle under you means that move is targeting you,

488
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and so you want to keep running, so if it's an AOE, you're going to run out of it.

489
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That whole time, like, I didn't figure that out until you weren't there.

490
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, maybe if you played more and got to a point where I wouldn't kill things in, like, two hits.

491
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The circle means I fire my most powerful spells at it. Oh, it's dead.

492
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
All right, some quick housekeeping tonight.

493
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Sadly, even though we were out last week, we will be not here the week of, what is it, February 20th?

494
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't remember the exact day, that's a Sunday, but I will be at MAGFest in the Washington, D.C. area,

495
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
National Harbor, to be exact, February 21st.

496
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
We will not be here with the show, because I'll be at MAGFest.

497
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If you're going to be at MAGFest, be sure to stop by our forums, vognetwork.com,

498
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and say hello in the MAGFest thread we have there, because there will be some sort of, like,

499
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
official, unofficial meetup, official in that it's vog-official, but unofficial in that we really,

500
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
we have nothing to do with the con itself.

501
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
We are going, as fans, we're not doing a panel, we're not doing anything, we're just going to have fun.

502
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So, but we want to meet up with some of our listeners and such while we're there.

503
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We'll really have our fingers and toes crossed for our buddy YYR that maybe he'll have a booth,

504
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
because that would be a great meeting spot to help promote the things he's working on,

505
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I think his multitasking game, and so forth. So we have our fingers crossed for him.

506
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
But anyway, we're going to be there, well, I'm going to be there.

507
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Sadly, low-key, Dark Soccer, not going to be there. Shane, definitely not going to be there.

508
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
No, I don't even know what you're talking about.

509
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Music and games, it's going to be fun. You're going to miss out.

510
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Maybe I'll take you to Rock Edge, which is like the West Coast version of that that's happening in a couple months.

511
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
No.

512
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You're a hater, don't be a hater.

513
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And Bobby Black Wolf, our pal from Bobby Black Wolf Show will be there.

514
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Some of my other indie podcast friends will be there, like a couple of my friends from Koopa Club are going to be there,

515
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
or at least just one maybe, just one of my friends from Koopa Club is going to be there.

516
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And yeah, so we're going to have a good time at MAGFest, looking forward to that very much.

517
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
That's really it for housekeeping, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, also Facebook,

518
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

519
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Let's get into some news for the week. We're going to start off with Loki.

520
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Alright, so Sony has decided to create a whole new subsidiary company to house their entertainment portion of Sony under.

521
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So this is going to be Sony Interactive Entertainment, or SEI I guess, LLC.

522
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And it'll be incorporated on April 1st. No, it's not a joke.

523
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And I don't know how they're structuring everything, but I guess under that they're going to have hardware, game software, the PlayStation Network operations,

524
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:53,000
also PlayStation Vue, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Music, and their original content as well.

525
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So it's kind of almost like the movie, the kind of video movie side of things, or the TV I guess on their services, combined with, you know, the other entertainment stuff.

526
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So it's all the stuff that you can find kind of on their interactive platforms.

527
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So, OMG, PlayStation is now an American company.

528
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That is kind of interesting.

529
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
PlayStation is no longer a Japanese company, it's an American company.

530
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That just means we're going to get another PlayStation experience then. Hey, that was so fun, I can't wait.

531
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's not going to be in Japan, it'll be here again.

532
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Well, they never did them in Japan anyway.

533
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Well, now they have more reason to do it here.

534
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah, and they'll be based out of San Mateo, California.

535
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Which is a beautiful place.

536
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Which is, to be fair, where it seems like most of the activity has been happening for PlayStation's arm anyway.

537
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And most of the folks you see getting up on stage at events and things like that, it seems like PlayStation's been slowly moving that direction ever since the PlayStation 4 was released anyway.

538
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I mean, I don't know, I'm not going to claim to know enough about the business side of things here on OLR as to why a company would make a move like this.

539
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's restructuring, you think?

540
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, I guess you always hear about that with big companies. There's a restructuring going on to help with cost savings and blah blah blah.

541
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Maybe it'll help make the numbers look better or something?

542
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Maybe.

543
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
If they're like, one department's doing well and the other department's not doing so well, lump them together and kind of averages everything out? I don't really know.

544
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Dungeon Buster, with some insight here at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, says they're basically consolidating all of their PlayStation stuff into a North American headquarter.

545
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
They're doing it to cater to what they apparently see as their biggest market.

546
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Cool.

547
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I don't know, they're doing pretty well so far, so I don't really have much to complain about.

548
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Well, it's not like they're doing awful in Japan.

549
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
No, they're not doing awful in Japan.

550
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Remember, the Vita is still a thing in Japan.

551
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I wish it was more of a thing here, but they just don't want to make a bet.

552
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
They're saying they're going to change that.

553
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:03,000
They should change that. Or come out with something, I mean, come out with another handheld once the NX comes out or whatever.

554
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'd be interested to see another handheld from them. I thought the Vita was okay.

555
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Even still, the dual analogs seemed like a great idea. It just didn't feel right.

556
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And the backtouch thing is kind of annoying.

557
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And the touch screen just didn't really utilize that well, I think.

558
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And they always, every single time they do a handheld, they screw themselves over with the memory cards.

559
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Oh god, yes. And they're stupid proprietary memory formats.

560
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Just fuck it. Who cares? Who cares? Just use a standardized format.

561
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I got a 32GB memory card for my 3DS that was like $17.

562
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And then you can't even get a 32GB for a Vita for under $50? Or even maybe higher than that, I think?

563
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't remember. I bought a 16GB one when I got the PlayStation TV.

564
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I had some way back when I actually had a Vita, but I don't remember what I have now.

565
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Still haven't really done anything with the PlayStation TV either, but I keep accruing free games with PlayStation Plus.

566
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Here's some perspective from AkumaJP in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, who's actually in Japan,

567
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,000
who says, PlayStation 4 is not really a thing here. No JRPG means no Japanese users. Vita is doing well here.

568
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And this might be an opportunity to bring up, because I don't think it's in our show world anywhere else,

569
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
but it definitely was something big, I think, that came out today or last night, and that is the Final Fantasy XV event had happened.

570
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And they were showing some new gameplay from that, and then they announced a release date of a release date, I think?

571
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Well, it's a release event, so they're going to announce the release date on March 30th, I think.

572
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So we have a release date of a release date. March 30th is the big event, or what have you.

573
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But didn't we have a pre-release date of a release date of a release date before this?

574
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Because they said it was going to be spring, in which they would announce the release date, and now we have a release date for the release date.

575
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Alright, awesome. But that is a big JRPG that's going to be coming for the PlayStation 4.

576
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And I'm totally down with that. I can't believe it.

577
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't know if that's necessarily going to turn things around.

578
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I hope it's good. The demo's alright.

579
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm interested. You know, with Final Fantasy, I'm probably going to check it out no matter what.

580
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Did you watch the footage?

581
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I saw it just a little bit.

582
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It was actually interesting. It doesn't look like the same game that the demo we had before.

583
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The demo was kind of hard to figure out what to do in. Like, the combat system really confused the hell out of me.

584
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And I never played it when they redid it, kind of. I didn't play it. I don't know if it has a new combat system.

585
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I hope they were mentioning they had the turn-based thing. I love the turn-based combat systems.

586
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I don't know why everybody wants something differently. I thought, I love those games.

587
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I love going back to the old 8-bit games or 16-bit games that had the turn-based system.

588
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I don't see a problem with that.

589
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Or a slight variation, like 12 had. 12 was great because of that. I like 13s as well.

590
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm going to our chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

591
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
AkumaJP adding a little more, saying, yes, wait until Final Fantasy XV. That is when PlayStation 4 gets its mojo back for the Japanese users.

592
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Final Fantasy VII Remake is another one.

593
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,000
The VII Remake looks pretty sweet. Especially if the combat system and everything is good in XV, I'm down with VII using that same engine.

594
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah, because VII just kind of looks like, here's Final Fantasy VII in the XV engine.

595
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I think it just looks like you're playing Kingdom Hearts and Goofy's going to come run out of nowhere.

596
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Or he'll be dressed up like Barret. And then Donald will be, I don't know, Red XIII.

597
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I do want to see a new Kingdom Hearts with the Marvel and LucasArts.

598
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Well, there is a new Kingdom Hearts coming at some point. Someday. We don't have a release date.

599
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
How fucking badass would that be? Fucking fighting the Heartless and shit with the Hulkbuster and shit in the background.

600
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Okay, first off, fuck and shit are not going to be in a Kingdom Hearts game with Disney.

601
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They should be. I mean, they're really, there's the whole Miramax side of Disney that they're completely ignoring.

602
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Pulp Fiction world?

603
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Pulp Fiction world? Kill Bill? I mean, we could totally do this. I don't understand why that's a problem.

604
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Tarantino has enough fucks and shits for everybody.

605
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Alright, well something that, a series that has me screaming fucking shit an awful lot is the series Five Nights at Freddy's.

606
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And this is in part to Shane's bidding, by the way, as he convinces me to play these games. And then I get really scared playing them.

607
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
They're really good, though.

608
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But, there's a new game in the series, but it's not really like the other games. It's Five Nights at Freddy's World.

609
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Now, this was something big that happened in the news last week while we were out, is that the game ended up getting pulled from Steam.

610
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And it was because it was getting some pretty bad press that the game didn't feel complete to a lot of people.

611
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And I didn't play the game, so I don't know. Did you check out Five Nights at Freddy's World, being the big fan you are?

612
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:12,000
No, I did not because I just felt like other people would play it for me first and then I would make a decision.

613
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And they did.

614
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Why did it get released early?

615
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Well, he always releases everything early, so that wasn't a surprise to me.

616
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And I understand the complaints people had about it after watching it, so I'm glad I didn't buy it necessarily, but I still think it has the potential to be a good game.

617
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And the foundations were there, mostly.

618
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Well, Scott Cawthon ended up posting on Five Nights at Freddy's for Steam page because they ended up pulling Five Nights at Freddy's World saying,

619
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Hi, I wanted to make a post about the fate of Five Nights at Freddy's World.

620
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I was not satisfied with the reviews and ratings it's getting, so I've decided to remove the game from Steam.

621
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I've asked Valve to make it so that the game can be refunded regardless of the amount of time it's been owned, meaning that anyone can get a refund at any time.

622
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm going to work on Five Nights at Freddy's World and polish it up.

623
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I've been creating a fully 3D overworld for the game.

624
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
When I'm ready to update, I will replace the demo currently on GameJolt with the full game.

625
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
From this point forward, the game will always be free.

626
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I appreciate your support. I encourage you all to refund your Steam game, even if you enjoyed the game, and download the new version when it's available on GameJolt.

627
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Now, I just want to point out real quick that it did have an overworld this game.

628
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It was just in the Atari-style graphics that Scott has been known to do for his other games when it was a mini-game or sometimes story aspects in the other games.

629
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It was just not a 3D world, which we had seen kind of previously in one of the trailers.

630
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Wow, you can't fault him for doing what he did. At least he's offering refunds. He's not hosing everybody.

631
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
He's like, hey, sorry, I feel it needs more work. Here's your money back.

632
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I think he just got way too excited for it. This is what he's known for. People like his stuff for various reasons.

633
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Everybody was really excited to play it. He just wanted to get it out there.

634
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It was missing a few things that maybe he didn't really think at the time were going to matter.

635
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
They would still get some enjoyment, but people are hypercritical.

636
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
With all respect to the guy who's had an amazing amount of success with a really good idea in a very short amount of time.

637
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I've said on this show, Five Nights at Freddy's is probably the biggest indie game since Minecraft.

638
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Of course, now we have Undertale. Still, there's not a lot of indie games that are fortunate enough to ride that kind of wave that Five Nights at Freddy's has.

639
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:43,000
This guy has found a lot of success in a short amount of time. In some ways, he's probably learning to deal with a lot of that, if that makes sense.

640
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm not faulting him for having the bad game, making a mistake, releasing it early, and so forth.

641
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Part of me wonders if maybe now is the time for him to look at maybe partnering up with somebody, like a publisher or something, that maybe can help him set some of these parameters so he doesn't do that.

642
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:06,000
But, okay, he made a mistake. He fessed up for it. The weird thing about this is I feel like the pendulum has now swung from one extreme to the other.

643
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It's gone from, okay, you really released a game early and asked people to pay money for it when you shouldn't have and it wasn't really ready.

644
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Okay, you made a mistake there, but at least he owned up to that mistake. So maybe he could have done what Warner Brothers did with Batman.

645
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
We're pulling the game and we'll re-release it when it's ready, that type of thing. But now I kind of feel like the pendulum swung to the other extreme.

646
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Like, I fucked up so badly, I'm just going to give it away for free. And I almost feel like, well dude, you don't have to go that far.

647
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
He's doing that to keep the good will because he is just a single person making these games.

648
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:48,000
He's probably doing well enough to where he's just like, whatever, who cares. I just wanted to make this. If you don't like it, well, it's free.

649
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
He couldn't have the same clout as Warner Brothers saying, we'll release it later and you have to pay for it still.

650
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Now he already took their money, but now he's like, okay, here's it back. I'm sorry, as an apology, this is just going to be free for everybody.

651
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And that just is like, you're awesome. Thank you.

652
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
But I think it would have been fine if he said, you know what, if you want to get a refund, get your money back, you can.

653
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Otherwise, we're going to try re-releasing this game and it'll be 20% off or something when it comes out.

654
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You know what I mean? Like, I think you could still get away with charging money for it and be okay because Warner Brothers fucking did it.

655
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
If you followed his stuff, he seems like one of the nicest guys out there.

656
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Sure.

657
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And this doesn't seem, I mean, this seems like-

658
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And I'm not saying this to be mean to him or anything.

659
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,000
No, no, no. But this just seems in his character that this is not actually surprising what he's doing with the refunds and going to release it for free.

660
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Because that's just the sort of person he is based on everything I've ever seen about him and his posts and stuff.

661
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So he's still a jerk for not unlocking the box in Five Nights 4 because we're never going to know what's in that box.

662
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Going to a chat for some feedback over at live.vognetwork.com.

663
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SHO 100 Matt says he got full of himself and didn't think it needed the amount of QA as he normally did.

664
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Dungeon Buster says he should have held it back until it was done to avoid all of this.

665
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
There are other indie developers under the same pressure, but they had the good sense to hold back despite the backlash delays might have caused.

666
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I agree he owed up to it and is going to re-release it as a free game, but wow, it's a situation that could have been completely avoided.

667
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Kaijuto says maybe he has ADD. A lot of gamers have that.

668
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I think those are all just too harsh on him honestly. I think he just got excited and wanted to put it out there.

669
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And it just wasn't what people wanted and it was missing some key things.

670
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
This is going to sound harsh, again I'm not picking on him, but he made a rookie mistake.

671
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
He's a rookie.

672
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Exactly, and I think we kind of forget he's a rookie. He's not on that level that you think Warner Brothers should be at and so forth.

673
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So maybe that's why I'm saying the pendulum is swinging too far to the other direction because I'm like, give the guy a break.

674
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:00,000
He's probably getting a lot of this all at once and he just ended up that over-eager guy that announced something before it was ready.

675
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So, I don't know.

676
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I still don't think it was about getting money from people for an unfinished product.

677
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I think in his mind that it was basically a finished product, but I don't think he probably has any play testers either to really see, oh you're missing this key thing.

678
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
He probably doesn't trust anybody.

679
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
No, I wouldn't. With something like that, since it is kind of a huge franchise all of a sudden, I wouldn't trust anybody.

680
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Yeah, it's tough. It's probably a lot all at once. I hope he's doing okay.

681
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I'm sure he is. He's probably sitting on his money couch drinking his money wine and we'll be fine.

682
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Heading over to Beyonce's old house to hang with Notch and they can laugh on their money pit.

683
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:48,000
No, but all that joking aside, maybe, and to be fair in my pendulum experience, maybe that's what he had to do to relieve himself of that burden.

684
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And just be like, okay, now that I've given it away, I am not going to be sad about this anymore because I know I'm doing the right thing.

685
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Maybe that's what it ultimately boils down to. And if that's what he had to do for his own well-being, then cool. I support that.

686
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I think in the long run, what will be seen from this story is that he was somebody who made a game that owned up to his mistakes and then gave people their money back and let everybody play it for free.

687
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's not going to be seen as a greedy developer that tried to take people's money by releasing an unfinished game. I think that's the moral of this story.

688
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Alright, well let's move on. Shane has been good enough to fill in for Dark Sakura's stories tonight, even though you have no idea what she volunteered to read about tonight.

689
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Yeah, so there's one later I really don't want to read.

690
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But this one's okay, right?

691
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
This one's fine. So remember there's this thing called E3 and it used to be really cool, but now it's just garbage?

692
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It's like this big place where they have video games.

693
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's you saying this and not me, wow.

694
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Well, I've been to what's considered E3 ever since it turned to garbage.

695
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Well, hold on, let's back up a minute. Because I think anybody who's been following the news this week knows what this is leading to. Why did you call E3 garbage? Why are you calling E3 garbage?

696
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Because it's nothing but media appointments now and big open spaces where you might see like, okay, the last time I went to E3 I was over in the Activision area.

697
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And literally Activision's area was a big screen that had Call of Duty on it and that was it. Everything else was behind for press.

698
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I don't even remember why I was at the last E3 I went to, but before I've been there as industry because I worked at Konami and I got in for other things.

699
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:48,000
But they had games out you could play, it was super fun. But Activision, this last E3 I went to, whenever that was, was just a big Call of Duty screen and that's it.

700
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
If you weren't somebody that had an appointment, you couldn't do anything in Activision's booth.

701
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And that's the same for most of the booths, though some had some games out, but everything was still basically by appointment.

702
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I will say this much, and I've had my gripes about E3 and they're not all that dissimilar from what Shane is saying.

703
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
My favorite booth at E3 the last year I went was the IndieCade booth.

704
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh, you probably went a year after I did.

705
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah, it was all the independent developers showcasing their game. You know why that was my favorite booth?

706
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Because you love indie stuff.

707
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That I could walk up, play a game, talk to the developer right there, ask any question I want, and get a decent answer.

708
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's like the indie ones didn't have a script to stick to or whatever. Everything else is so watered down by publicists and everything.

709
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It's like there's not a lot of, I mean, okay, you can have the status of I played this game early, woohoo, you played the on-rails version of something.

710
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And now a lot of stuff you can't even play anymore. Like when we went to do Assassin's Creed, they played it for us. That was the year, that was Unity.

711
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Remember, didn't we go to the Civilization thing and they were just like, we sat in a booth or a theater and they just showed it on screen and played it?

712
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Which I didn't mind because it was Civilization.

713
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I was like, I don't know, this game is boring.

714
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Shut up, I love Civ. I didn't mind that because I love Civ.

715
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I was gonna just interject, because of something Loki said earlier, I did get to play DJ Hero on the 3DS and that never came out and that does make me happy that I got to experience that.

716
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I hate you so much.

717
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It really wasn't that good, so you're not missing anything. But I did have an exclusive track on that demo.

718
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, except for hands-on, anything you could see about an appointment will be on the internet in HD within 12 to 18 hours.

719
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That's pretty true. There's always swag though too.

720
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Not so much anymore.

721
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Well, I'm sure not anymore.

722
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Again, mostly from the indie stuff. The appointments I had where I was seeing things like, you know, Hex was...

723
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I understand that we have packs and stuff that kind of fills this void, but can we just get like an indie 3 type convention that's just all indie games?

724
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I think you just said it.

725
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah, but I don't like packs. I don't want to go to packs.

726
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
IndieCade does have a convention of their own in LA, to be fair.

727
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Anyway, what was the point of this story?

728
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I don't know. We just don't like E3.

729
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But we're not the only ones apparently, kind of.

730
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
EA decided that this year they will not be on the E3 floor.

731
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
They're going to do their own thing across the street.

732
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It's going to be called EA Play, and it's actually going to let fans go and play their stuff.

733
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Which, I mean, Mass Effect.

734
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Like, I kind of want to go to go play Mass Effect.

735
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But they're saying, no, we still support the Entertainment Software Association. Nothing like that.

736
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
They want fans to get a hold of their games and not have that information be filtered through the media.

737
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Which is great, because that's kind of...

738
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I kind of can't believe I'm going to pat EA on the back, but...

739
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
EA's not that bad, oh my god. Quit playing into stereotypes.

740
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
No, I'm not playing into stereotypes with EA.

741
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Because they're the ones that came up with the stupid...

742
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Well, they came up with the whole online pass thing.

743
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So, no, I'm not giving a pass for that.

744
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
But this is totally separate.

745
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You're not going to give them an online pass, right?

746
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm not giving them an online pass for that.

747
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
But this is totally separate.

748
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I like these events where they have consumers able to play their products and stuff.

749
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
It's kind of like how E3 was, like, way a long time ago.

750
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And also...

751
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Technically, no. Consumers were never able to get into E3.

752
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

753
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Really? So those little kids I saw running around E3, they weren't consumers?

754
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Those were industry...

755
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
They were midgets, okay?

756
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
They were little people that...

757
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
They have a disease that they don't age...

758
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You guys, the rules were paper thin before.

759
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
We all know that, but technically...

760
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I'm going to get a comment or an email if I don't say...

761
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Technically, it was never a consumer show. Wink.

762
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But what I'm saying, though, is they're going to get...

763
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I think more impressions or better feedback from having their consumers play their games.

764
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Because their consumers...

765
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
The media is just going to say, oh, this is great.

766
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And then right up the story it says, oh, this is great.

767
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
No matter what it is.

768
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Because they got free time with whatever game.

769
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yeah, I mean, they're going to have the new Titanfall this year.

770
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
They're going to have Mass Effect.

771
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh my gosh.

772
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I want to go to not E3.

773
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I want to go to EA3 or whatever.

774
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I have this real concern that Shane is going to try to talk me into this stupid road trip.

775
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It won't take much.

776
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I'll be like, hey, guess what?

777
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Mass Effect.

778
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Let's go.

779
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Hey, guess what?

780
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
We drove all the way down there.

781
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Mass Effect's not there.

782
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
It'll be in video form only.

783
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I would be so mad.

784
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'd leave them there.

785
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's a trailer that's on YouTube where I...

786
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It'll be the same trailer from last year.

787
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'd leave them there.

788
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I'd be like, you can take a Greyhound bus from downtown LA.

789
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Get home.

790
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
That'd be hilarious.

791
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
This is great, though.

792
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Every company should do that.

793
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And then...

794
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Do you think this could be...

795
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Just throwing it out there.

796
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Do you think EA could be trying to strong arm E3 into going public?

797
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Because maybe for all...

798
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,000
As much as we complain about EA in the past, all these complaints are years old issues.

799
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Online pass, charging for cheat codes.

800
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
This is an EA of several years ago.

801
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
People change.

802
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's fine.

803
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So could EA maybe be getting a read?

804
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Could EA be hearing shows like this?

805
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Obviously they're not listening to this one.

806
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
But could they be hearing shows like this?

807
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And we're not the only ones to sit here and go.

808
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
E3 is not what it used to be.

809
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Maybe they're looking at the Sony experience thing where they did that.

810
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Or any of the foreign ones like Tokyo Game Show and Gamescom.

811
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Don't those have public data?

812
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Could they be trying to strong arm E3 into going public?

813
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
No, I don't think so.

814
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I mean, didn't Activision...

815
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
No, Activision bowed out, was it last year?

816
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
They did, but they didn't hold a competing event across the street.

817
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Like that's...

818
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I mean, yes, Activision did do this.

819
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So this isn't like unfounded or whatever.

820
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
But Activision did not do something across the street.

821
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Maybe they just didn't want it.

822
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
The closest thing they did was they had that arena that they rented out for DJ Hero.

823
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And they had like Rihanna and Eminem.

824
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But that's not the same thing as Come Play Our Games.

825
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Why I think they're doing is they're pulling a NUYA where they just don't want to pay for the space there.

826
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
But they're paying for something there.

827
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
They're having meeting rooms.

828
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Well, I understand that they're having meeting rooms.

829
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But they're not paying for floor space, which is probably really expensive.

830
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's probably maybe cheaper to rent a space next door and have the press walk us across the street.

831
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
What Shane is saying is kind of accurate.

832
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Is that you go to Activision's booth, it's just meeting rooms.

833
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Konami had nothing but meeting rooms.

834
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Well, they shouldn't have anything this year at all.

835
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Yeah, I know. LOL.

836
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
But I want to say the last year...

837
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Take their slot machines.

838
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,000
The last year I was at E3, EA had like maybe some kiosks with like one or two games.

839
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
But the big bulk of their booth was meeting rooms.

840
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
E3, again, just not what it used to be.

841
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
If you don't have booth appointments, don't go to E3.

842
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It's a waste of your time.

843
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Yeah.

844
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Man, remember like one of those years at Konami, it was like, let's go sit in the room from Silent Hill 4.

845
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
This is awesome. I think that was like all of our first years.

846
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
That was the very first year all of us went.

847
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Like, you go there now and everything is so sterile looking and vacant.

848
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It's like, you used to have to be kind of packed in to walk around E3.

849
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Now there's all this free open space because they just have like a monitor up with videos.

850
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And then there was also the very awkward wrestling ring with the Rumble Roses cosplayers.

851
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And like the very awkward photos people were taking with them.

852
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It was brilliant.

853
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
SSG100Matt with a thought.

854
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I think they want to manage their own space themselves and not be micromanaged by the space of E3 and having to compete with others around them.

855
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Well, you know, they don't have to compete because there's nothing really going on on the floor.

856
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Hey, at least Suya's not going to be there next year or across the street next year.

857
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So, you know, that's one lesson.

858
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Remember the really last great E3 when it was like, I think it was Sega and NC Software.

859
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Like, they both had stages and they were just like blaring music at each other.

860
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It got so loud. That was fun.

861
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:03,000
This is why the line to do anything Nintendo is like 17 hours long because they're one of the only boosts where you can walk up and play games.

862
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
But it's like, you know, everybody at E3 has literally nothing else to do but do that at Nintendo.

863
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
To be fair, Sony and Microsoft also always had a good showing of games out on the floor there.

864
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:22,000
But now even Sony, like you said, is moving to their own pretty successful event that they do.

865
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So hopefully this just makes the Entertainment Software Association realize their show kind of sucks and they need to do something about it.

866
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Maybe one last question. Was E4 All just ahead of its time?

867
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
What is that? I don't even know what that is anymore.

868
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That was the replacement show.

869
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Okay. Do you remember when E3 moved to the Santa Monica airport because it was the disaster?

870
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I wasn't going at that point.

871
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It was the year after the disastrous Sony press conference and they got all that negative press.

872
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And a lot of companies got negative press that year.

873
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
But that was also the last good year to go.

874
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And they all threatened to pull out of E3 because of all the negative press.

875
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And so the ESA said we're going to really lock it down.

876
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
We're only going to let this many people in and we're going to do it at the Santa Monica airport.

877
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
However, they were under contract to the city of Los Angeles that they would do these yearly events.

878
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So what they did instead is they had this event called E4 All that was open to everybody.

879
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And All Games, the network this show used to be on, I know had a presence there because they did a booth there.

880
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Yeah, I remember that.

881
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I didn't go because the timing was different and I couldn't do it.

882
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Didn't they have the record holders for the different arcade games and stuff like that?

883
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah, and I remember the guys on All Games Interactive were in with Twin Galaxies.

884
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So I feel like they collaborated on something.

885
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Sorry guys, my memory is fuzzy. Some of you guys probably remember this better than I do.

886
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But the point of the story is that was the replacement show that they did for E3 but not nearly as many developers.

887
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I think Nintendo was there one year, Microsoft was there the other.

888
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But it wasn't like they had that huge buy-in that E3 had.

889
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Was it maybe ahead of its time?

890
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Why don't we just get rid of E3 period? Let everybody do their own things and it's great.

891
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Don't you think that might spread things too thin though?

892
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
No, because right now what does E3 accomplish besides announcements? Nothing. I do not care.

893
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I like watching the press conferences. Can we just have the press conferences? Let's just do press conference day and we're done.

894
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Yeah, that's fine too. But E3 otherwise does not serve a purpose like it used to anymore, I feel like.

895
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So get rid of it. Or completely retool it.

896
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Can we do what they did that was a 2006 where it's like, hey, Capcom, perfect example, Capcom.

897
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Hey, we're going to have these games and these demos out on, you know, you can go play them on the show floor or you can play them at home.

898
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
You know, they had Lost Planet and they had fucking, it was MotoGP 6, I think.

899
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And there was some other game that was in there as well. There's like three games that they had demos for.

900
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
It wasn't necessarily just Capcom, but they had one other one.

901
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I remember that though.

902
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And I thought that was like the coolest thing. It's like, this is sweet because I'm not going to be able to get to play this on the show floor.

903
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
And like Nintendo, the past couple of years has done, hey, you can't get to E3, we'll go to like a Best Buy.

904
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And we're going to have games. You don't like that? I thought that was great.

905
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah, I understand to go to the Best Buy and stuff, but it's like limited.

906
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Come to Lion Con, have the same experience.

907
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It's limited Best Buys and stuff. Just put a fucking demo on your goddamn online service.

908
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,000
It's like, gee, if only we had a fucking online storefront where we could offer demos to people for the play.

909
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
No, instead you go to Best Buy. Not all Best Buys, just specific ones.

910
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Alright, alright. We gotta just make early access for everything.

911
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Alright, we gotta move on for time, so let's get to the next story, Loki.

912
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Might as well just send you the Blockbuster video to go play Mario Kart.

913
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That'd be awesome.

914
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I remember doing that too. It was pretty awesome.

915
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Anyways, so Steam right now, they have the whole market for early access kind of to themselves.

916
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But, thankfully, Good Old Games, they're going to be launching their own service as well.

917
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:15,000
It's similar to early access, but they're going to have a little bit more of a curated experience.

918
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So, basically, they want all gamers on GOG.com to have access to these titles that they have to offer.

919
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:30,000
But, they want to do it right, carefully evaluating each and every game, offering a 14-day refund policy,

920
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
and providing GOG Galaxy support with update rollback and more.

921
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Basically, they said refunds will be eligible to anyone in the 14-day window for any reason.

922
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And they'll be taking requests also for additional inclusions as well.

923
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And the games will kind of be a part of this.

924
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Starbound, Ashes of the Singularity, Project Zomboid, TerraTech, and the Curious Expedition are going to be the first few games that are offered that.

925
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And they're being offered also without DRM still.

926
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So, I think that's a good idea.

927
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And also to kind of commemorate the program they're going to be launching, doing some discounts as well.

928
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And that's going to be effective until February 2nd.

929
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Do you think you might participate in this early access?

930
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Participate in it? Like, what do you mean? Like, put my game up there?

931
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah, or no, no, I mean like...

932
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Whenever I get done with that?

933
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Get one of the games that are on there.

934
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I don't really buy anything through good old games.

935
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Not to say I don't have anything in the library and stuff, but I'm not really buying stuff on Steam either.

936
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Okay, I take that back.

937
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I am still padding my stupid account with games I'm never going to play, but...

938
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Did you get the latest Humble Bundle? Because it's all Civilization games.

939
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
No, I didn't because I have a lot of those already.

940
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Just saying. If you have not seen the latest Humble Bundle, it's like all Civilization games.

941
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It is all Civilization games.

942
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Shame you didn't buy it.

943
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
No.

944
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I have, but see, and I was going to, but I have Civ III complete already and I have Civ V.

945
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And I just didn't need more Civilization games. I still haven't played Civ V.

946
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
There's no such thing as not needing more Civilization games.

947
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
There is. It's called being sane.

948
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I mean, I guess if I was really into it, this might be worthwhile, but I just don't want to pay for something I'm not going to...

949
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Okay, ha ha ha. I'm not going to pay for something I'm not going to play.

950
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
That's my entire Steam library, so I can't really say that.

951
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I just don't want to make that same mistake currently.

952
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I don't know.

953
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Alright, well, moving on. This is a game that didn't have an early access program, but it did have a Kickstarter.

954
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And Kickstarter said that the game would be out in April 2015.

955
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Well, yet again this past week, Mighty No. 9 was delayed again.

956
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:57,000
This was after they said that February 9th would be the release date, and I almost want to say they said in that announcement, no more delays.

957
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Well, guess what? Now they have pushed it back to spring 2016.

958
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Naughty Dog did the same thing with Uncharted.

959
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
We're done delaying it. Here's a delay.

960
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
The reason for the delay is rooted in bugs inside the network modes, and specifically problems with matchmaking.

961
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
There are two large reasons for this problem, one of them being the large number of platforms supported,

962
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and the other stems from the fact that the engine we're using is no longer being updated,

963
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
which means adjustment for matchmaking and online code are being made manually,

964
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
miscalculations on the part of us, the development staff.

965
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So, I mean, we'll get into this a little later in the Fugu question of the week, but what do you guys think at this point?

966
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I just don't care.

967
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I'm kind of at that point, too, where I'm like, it'll be out when it's out. I don't even listen to their days anymore.

968
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I don't really care. I hope it's good. I mean, that's really all I care about is I hope it's good at this point.

969
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I have so many other things I'm wanting to play or work on or that type of stuff that this isn't even on my radar really right now.

970
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I know it's coming out, but I'm not like, ooh, I can't wait to play that.

971
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I would rather just have a real Mega Man game at this point.

972
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Mighty No. 9 has not really captured my interest since they announced it, and the more I see of it, actually the less excited I am for it.

973
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Yeah, I'm kind of with you on that.

974
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It's just, it's like, I don't know, like a generic Mega Man game that maybe some random,

975
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
oh, this is like a Mega Man game they would put in the Mega Man block on awesome games done quick,

976
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
but it's one of those knockoffs that's really not that great.

977
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It's Mega Man PC. I don't know if you ever played Mega Man PC. It was Mega Man, but it was just different. It was off.

978
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You know, there's a franchise that would benefit from like a Mario Maker-esque type game, like a Mega Man thing,

979
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
where you can design your own bosses. Yeah, design your own bosses.

980
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I don't know how you do that, but all right.

981
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Oh, easily.

982
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Attack patterns.

983
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Yeah, attack patterns and also just, you know, your imagination. Do you not have imagination?

984
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
No, I do not.

985
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
All of yours would just be like Drag Queen Man or something.

986
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:11,000
That sounds awesome. Oh, my God. I would make a Mega Man game that's just you battle contestants from RuPaul's Drag Race.

987
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Oh, it's terrible.

988
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Oh, my God. Okay, now I'm on board.

989
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Edit this out. I did not say that.

990
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Oh, my God. You are going to play my game and it's going to be called Lip Sync for Your Life.

991
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Is it going to be amazing?

992
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
No.

993
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Day one. It's on Kickstarter today.

994
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I could not back it. You're right.

995
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Come on, though. You could fight like, oh, God, what could you do? You could fight Sharon Needles would be a boss.

996
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
She had like needles that she could show.

997
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah, she could have like actual needles.

998
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Oh, my gosh. Let's just stop this. This is not a good conversation.

999
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Or you could have Latrice Royale who would just like wave her head and like it would cause these like waves to go out.

1000
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
No, this is all bad.

1001
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
This is good. I love this. I love this.

1002
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Serena Cha-Cha could throw a little Puerto Rican flags at you.

1003
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I'm so done. So done.

1004
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Yeah, this idea sounds terrible.

1005
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yeah, I don't want this game to be made.

1006
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Fine, then let's go to the next story.

1007
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Well, Sony tried to trademark Let's Play.

1008
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Thankfully, the USPTO, which stands for Words, decided, no, you don't get to do that. The end.

1009
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
The USPTO stands for Words?

1010
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I mean, it stands for some sort of words. I'm not sure.

1011
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I think it's Patent and Trademark Office.

1012
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
But you missed the US, which is probably United States.

1013
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I think so. I think it's pretty safe to say that's what it means.

1014
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It could mean anything, though, because I didn't finish reading the article.

1015
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
But thankfully, I know a little more about what's been going on, because we've been talking about this on the show previously.

1016
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I know you have, so go ahead and talk about it.

1017
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Some people are wondering like, why are you talking about it again? Because...

1018
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
They actually rejected it this time.

1019
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Yes, this is the actual rejection now that happened this time.

1020
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Before, it was just like, was it Ubisoft that was getting mad about that? No, that was a different...

1021
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
No, it was the whole internet was getting mad about it, actually.

1022
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Ubisoft and EA were getting mad about something. It was a ghost. That's what they were getting mad about.

1023
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But it's also a trademark thing. That's why it got mixed up in my head.

1024
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:14,000
You can't trademark ghosts. Ghosts have been around way before you and Ubisoft.

1025
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Well, on a related note...

1026
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
EA made ghosts. I've never heard a ghost until EA said something about it.

1027
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Yes, EA did make ghosts. When they killed all those different companies they purchased.

1028
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Konami, too.

1029
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
On a related note, because a couple weeks ago when we had our last show, we talked about this Let's Play thing.

1030
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
We were reading a blog post from this ryanmorrisonlaw.com.

1031
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yep, the game...

1032
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Yeah, and I've actually been reading more of his stuff.

1033
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Now, I think I might want to invite him on the show if he's willing to do it. I don't know.

1034
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Because now, again, I'm looking at this guy's blog, and he did a whole piece on it, and I had no idea that this was...

1035
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Because it's kind of related, but did you know that... Do you know who the Fine Brothers are?

1036
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Yes, I watch them all the time.

1037
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yes, I watch all the different videos and all the reaction videos.

1038
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That's what they do. They're all the reaction videos.

1039
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
No, I meant people reacting to their announcement, yes.

1040
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
It's the Don't You Feel Old videos, because it's kids playing 8-bit games, and they're going,

1041
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
This is stupid.

1042
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
They had one for the songs from classic games, and I couldn't even get all of them.

1043
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
But some of the kids got more than I got. I was surprised.

1044
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Okay. Well, did you know that they registered a trademark for the word React?

1045
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I think that's dumb, but I see where they're coming from, because almost all of their videos are something reacts.

1046
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah.

1047
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Something reacts.

1048
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
But they didn't invent that idea.

1049
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
No, but lots of things get trademarked where people don't invent ideas.

1050
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That doesn't make it right.

1051
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It doesn't! I'm just saying, like that Edge thing from a long time ago. Edge trademarks.

1052
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1053
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Okay. I can talk in lengths about this, because this is all I've been reading up on the last few days.

1054
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Please! Please!

1055
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Alright, so basically the Fine Brothers, they came out with this brand new thing that they're coming out with called React World.

1056
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It's basically, you and I, we can go ahead now and make our own reaction videos.

1057
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And we can do that by going through their licensing system, and they are going to give us basically just the graphics and whatever.

1058
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And we can film it, and then they get a portion of our revenue from our ads.

1059
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
They monetize it basically once we've done it.

1060
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Hey, I have an idea. How about podcast hosts react to this trademark announcement?

1061
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:32,000
So they basically did this, and they're also trademarking all their different show names, which are, you know, Kids React.

1062
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Teens React.

1063
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
They already have Teens React. They already have two of them.

1064
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
They have Teens React and Elders React already trademarked.

1065
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Oh, okay.

1066
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And so the other ones that they're doing, like Kids React.

1067
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Which is weird, if they haven't done Kids React, because that was their first one.

1068
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Well, Kids React is, there's a few other ones that they're trying to trademark.

1069
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Aside from that, there's also like the Try Not to Smile.

1070
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The law guy actually outlined some of these.

1071
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Celebrity Reacts, Adults React, Parents React, Kids vs. Food, Lyric Breakdown, People vs. Technology, and Try Not to Smile or Laugh.

1072
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Yeah.

1073
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Shane would do pretty well at that.

1074
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
So they had all this stuff that basically the system then.

1075
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And they touted it as like, they're not corporate, you know, they're totally going the opposite direction as corporate Hollywood.

1076
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:22,000
And they're bringing the community together because these videos are going to be so impactful that 100 years from now, people are going to wonder like, what did those people think about stuff from earlier than that?

1077
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Oh my gosh, 100 years from now, I know that if I were around then, I would wonder what kids thought about Nyan Cat.

1078
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Because that was my first one I saw.

1079
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I basically thought that this is a great thing, and so that's where it is.

1080
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And of course, people are fucking pissed because they're like, listen, you didn't invent this shit, the React videos have been around forever.

1081
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And of course, the Fine Brothers are just saying, oh well, this is just to protect our shows, we're not actually going to try to tell you that you can't make your own reaction videos.

1082
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Except that they are, because they are pulling takedown notices.

1083
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And a lot of people in chat are bringing up the fact that they are doing season to season.

1084
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:05,000
They're doing season to season on people that are reacting to this video, which is fucking ironic because they're saying, oh, you can't use our content without our permission.

1085
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Except that they're doing the exact same thing to the other videos.

1086
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It's all under fair use.

1087
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
One of the takedowns was for Ellen or something like that.

1088
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:21,000
No, Ellen Show did their own Kids React. It wasn't even called Kids React.

1089
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:30,000
She had some kids on her show, and then she does this quite often with different things where they will show them, here's a phone from the 80s, here's what a cell phone looks like, what do you think this is?

1090
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And they're reacting to it. They didn't call it anything.

1091
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And they got fucking butthurt about it and went on their social media pages and everything and said, we need you to fucking tell Ellen that it was our idea first and they should have contacted them.

1092
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Here's the thing, because I remember in the 80s that there was a show on TV that Bill Cosby hosted. I don't even want to go there with him, but he was in fact the host.

1093
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
There was a show he hosted called Kids Say the Darnedest Things, and it was on CBS.

1094
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And that was what that show was. So I'm sorry, they didn't invent the React thing. This was on TV.

1095
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And that was a remake, I want to say, of a show that's even older than that. So they didn't invent this.

1096
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Of course they didn't invent it, and they're not inventing it. They're not copywriting it. They're trademarking the word React, which is just as bad as, you know, King trying to trademark Saga.

1097
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:33,000
They're doing this in the guise that they're protecting their brand, but at the same time they're going to use it, even though they're saying they're not, they're going to use it to bully other people that are doing these style videos.

1098
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And to protect your brand, instead of trademarking these words, why don't you just put your name in front of everything? Like, the Fine Brothers presents Kids React or something there.

1099
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Now we know it's yours. If it doesn't have that Fine Brothers presents, then it's not something you don't.

1100
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Well, most people don't know who the fuck they are anyways.

1101
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Dungeonbuster with an interesting comment or chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying,

1102
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:06,000
As it pertains to their specific product line. You can still make Apple Super Soda or Apple Mega Pie. The Fine Brothers want to do the same thing, but React seems incredibly broad in the context of the medium it refers to. Yeah, I think that's the problem.

1103
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It's a genre. It's not, it's a genre of video. It's not, like, I don't have a problem with, I mean, it's kind of borderline. I do sort of a problem with them, you know, trademarking their show names.

1104
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But it's fine in the, if they're doing their show names where it's like, Kids React, I still think it's a bit generic, but trademarking Just React is where I kind of have a problem with it because they're going to abuse this shit.

1105
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:43,000
They've already, they've already shown that they're going to abuse this shit. They took, there was somebody that had a video that was reacting to their announcement that had four views and they had ten subscribers on the channel and got a takedown by this group.

1106
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And I mean, they're censoring the comments on their Facebook page. They're censoring the comments on the videos. It's just, it's, it's ridiculous.

1107
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It doesn't make you feel good that they're doing this for their purposes.

1108
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:02,000
No, it's completely backwards. Here's how it should fucking work is you want to make some good content. They're doing already, they're doing fine already.

1109
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:12,000
What they want to do is have people make content from other parts of the world because they don't have the time to translate this into native languages or to, you know, do these different videos around the world.

1110
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And this way they get that content out there, kind of spread their name or whatever, and they don't have to do, put in really the work to it and they get paid basically just for this.

1111
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
But you shouldn't have to fucking license this stuff. You can do this on your own.

1112
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Yeah. Bonds006 in chat says, Donald Trump wanted to have trademarked your fired line when he had, you know, the TV show, which I just, just on a tangent, first off, you know, fuck that guy.

1113
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But second off, Celebrity Apprentice is coming back and they're not going to say you're fired. You know why?

1114
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Because Arnold Schwarzenegger is the leader of the border.

1115
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Oh, I can't wait.

1116
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
So you know it's going to be, you're terminated.

1117
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Can they do that? Can they pay for it?

1118
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I think a part of the, it's the same people that, it's Mark Burnett's, the same people that do Survivor.

1119
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
No, no, no. But I'm sure that that's like a trademarked like phrase. So can they...

1120
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I think if they say your employment has been terminated, they can probably, they can use the word terminated.

1121
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Probably then, yeah.

1122
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
But that is, that all doesn't even matter. The important part...

1123
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Yeah, he would say like your hasta la vista.

1124
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,000
The important part about the new Celebrity Apprentice, this is crucially important.

1125
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
One of his advisors is going to be Tyra Banks.

1126
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
That sold me on the show right there.

1127
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
What?

1128
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Tyra Banks is taking the Ivanka Trump role.

1129
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And so it's Tyra Banks.

1130
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Oh, yes.

1131
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Because top mom's done.

1132
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It's going to be fucking crazy.

1133
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
This show is going to be the best. I'm so excited.

1134
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tyra Banks.

1135
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Yeah, Tyra Banks crazy and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1136
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
It's Warren Buffett and Steve Ballmer. I think of the others.

1137
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
It's nice because it's like actual, like it's not just Donald Trump's whole fucking clan.

1138
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Like it's actual other people. Like when the show was first on and it was Donald Trump,

1139
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
but he had two other people that weren't his fucking family.

1140
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah, the old guy and Carolyn.

1141
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Yeah, Carolyn.

1142
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And it wasn't, the show was actually pretty good at that time.

1143
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah, it was.

1144
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
All right.

1145
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
SSJ100Matt says, I can't wait for the panty party episode. Me neither.

1146
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
No, seriously though, if you want to, there's a lot of stuff on Reddit about this whole thing.

1147
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I recommend the video from one of my favorite channels, Film Cow, I think sums it up the best.

1148
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
With Merlin the Fish, where he's just like a million fucks on both your heads or something like that.

1149
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's seriously, it's ridiculous. The whole concept is ridiculous.

1150
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:34,000
They even put up an update video basically saying that we're terribly sorry that you didn't understand what we're meaning to do by this.

1151
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
That you're confused by what we want to do with this.

1152
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
No, we're pretty, we're pretty on board.

1153
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Actions speak louder than words, guys.

1154
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah, we know what you're doing with this, but to kind of bring it all back, sorry, on this long tangent train here.

1155
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Ryan Morrison actually has offered his services pro bono to any YouTubers out there.

1156
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And he will, he's going to fight this to block this from being trademarked.

1157
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
What a nice guy.

1158
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
So, good for him.

1159
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Good for him. Alright.

1160
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out to a game store near you depending on where you live.

1161
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Starting with the US, Loki.

1162
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Alright, so very soon we're going to be getting, let's see, this weekend.

1163
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Nitro Plus Blasters Heroines Infinite Duel for PlayStation 4, that's a game by Xeed.

1164
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Mega Dimension Neptunia 7, also on PlayStation 4.

1165
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Hey, there's your Japanese RPGs.

1166
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Hey, here's another one.

1167
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth on PlayStation 4.

1168
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Also this week, XCOM 2 coming out on PC.

1169
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And, is that it?

1170
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Let me just take a look.

1171
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I think, I think that might be it.

1172
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
It's probably still a slow week.

1173
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
That is it. Alright.

1174
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Moving on and looking at Japan.

1175
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Japan this week on the PlayStation 4 has Naruto.

1176
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It's that time of the year where there's a new Naruto game.

1177
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That's every week in the year.

1178
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 comes out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

1179
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Nothing on the Wii U this week. It's still kind of a dry spell over there.

1180
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:24,000
On the PlayStation Vita, there is Sangokuko Senke Omode Geshi CS Edition is out on the PlayStation Vita.

1181
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And that is the big release for this week.

1182
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And on the 3DS this week, really nothing.

1183
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
The next big release is Shin Megami Tensei 4 Final, but that is not until the 10th.

1184
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
So, kind of a slow week in Japan as well.

1185
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Shane, are you good to do the UK dates? You got those?

1186
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Sure, I think so.

1187
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Alright, what do you have coming out in the UK?

1188
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So, on February 2nd or 2nd of February according to this because it's Europe.

1189
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Sorcery! Parts 1 and 2.

1190
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Comes out on Mac and PC.

1191
01:29:51,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And then on 5th February 2016, you've got Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth on PS4 and Vita.

1192
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And then XCOM 2 on Mac and PC.

1193
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And that's it.

1194
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

1195
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
And then the classic game of the week, which for some crazy reason we're letting Shane do tonight.

1196
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
So, let's get to those last couple stories. Loki.

1197
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Alright, so this is interesting.

1198
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So apparently there is a petition out there to try to get Danny DeVito to do the voice of Detective Pikachu.

1199
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:34,000
And it's very brief basically saying there are a number of us that feel Danny DeVito would be a prime fit for the voice acting role of Detective Pikachu.

1200
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
We want to make this happen.

1201
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:43,000
And so you can sign on the petition and apparently there is about 8,000 signatures already.

1202
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:54,000
You know, it wasn't until watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia that I realized that Danny DeVito is a national treasure for us.

1203
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
So, I am totally on board with this.

1204
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I think, I mean, if we could bring up the video it would be awesome.

1205
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I really think if we could find that, it's hilarious, the video that they had for that.

1206
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And I'm trying to see if we can...

1207
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Was it linked within the original story here?

1208
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:20,000
It wasn't. If you go to the story that we have and show it there on the side, there's a link to a second story.

1209
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
It's more evidence that Danny DeVito needs to be the voice of Detective Pikachu.

1210
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Oh, okay. Here we go.

1211
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Yeah, click on the...

1212
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
You got it. Here we go.

1213
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Alright, so just...

1214
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Just with the trailer is pretty funny.

1215
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I can't believe this! I just can't believe this!

1216
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I am not a human being! I am an animal! Cold-blooded!

1217
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Alright, I get where this is going. It's pretty funny. It's pretty funny. It just works.

1218
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I don't know who came up with that.

1219
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
This just is so good.

1220
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Alright.

1221
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
S.H.O. and Hunter Matt says, if they can't get Danny DeVito I would settle for Nolan North.

1222
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I would settle for the other obvious voice and I can't believe nobody is talking about Gilbert Godfried.

1223
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
No.

1224
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
The voice of Pikachu.

1225
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
No, we don't want annoying.

1226
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
No, that's like mouth or whatever.

1227
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Mouth.

1228
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Mouth.

1229
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
We don't want annoying, we want amazing and that's why they picked Danny DeVito.

1230
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
That would totally... everybody in chat is like giving me a collective no.

1231
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Yeah.

1232
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Good job, chat.

1233
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You know that'll be Nintendo's response.

1234
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:57,000
We couldn't get Danny DeVito but we heard the internet campaigning for a famous celebrity so we got Adam Sandler to be the voice of Pikachu.

1235
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I'd still play the game but with no sound.

1236
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
S.H.O. and Hunter Matt says, Tim Curry. Mic drop.

1237
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
No.

1238
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
He can do anything.

1239
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Nope. Nope.

1240
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Still just needs to be Danny DeVito. I'm on board with this.

1241
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I would also settle for Glenn Howerton.

1242
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Howerton.

1243
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Tilda Swinton.

1244
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Dennis.

1245
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
No, Charlie.

1246
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Charlie.

1247
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Charlie actually.

1248
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Charlie Day would be pretty good.

1249
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Tiger class says, how about Betty White.

1250
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Betty White can voice Jigglypuff.

1251
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Let's just have the whole cast of It's Always Sunny doing the voices in that game.

1252
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Yes.

1253
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
They'll move it from Boston to Philadelphia because it takes place in Boston.

1254
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So, yeah.

1255
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Let's do that.

1256
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Alright.

1257
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I'm moving on from this lank fest of dream games.

1258
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Alright.

1259
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Let's talk about Super Mario Maker which had some unexpected downtime this week.

1260
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
There was an emergency maintenance that happened in Super Mario Maker.

1261
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Yeah, I know. I went to go play it and I'm like, uh, I hate you.

1262
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Do you know what happened?

1263
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Apparently there was some type of bug in the game where you could download a level.

1264
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:08,000
You could recreate the level in the editor, basically, but add something to it.

1265
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Like, say, a flight power up or something else that would allow you to beat the level in a record time.

1266
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
So people were beating levels in, like, three seconds.

1267
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And in a nutshell, that's what the exploit was.

1268
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
But what was really interesting was that they actually went to...

1269
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Because they didn't want to put the exploit out there because they knew tons of people would use it.

1270
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:34,000
So they went to LinkedIn and they found one of the treehouse guys on LinkedIn and sent a message.

1271
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And the treehouse guy said, oh, yeah, we're aware of this and we're working on it.

1272
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
And the game was down the next day or whatever.

1273
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
But then this is the hilarious thing.

1274
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:48,000
They had an unlisted video that they had sent to the treehouse guy that then all of a sudden got a YouTube, like, copyright takedown.

1275
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And that's the most insulting part of it is that Nintendo did a takedown on the video that ratted out the problem that the game was having.

1276
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
It was unlisted, so nobody had it.

1277
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I'm sorry. You can't tell us of bugs in our own game unless you are one of our Nintendo content providers.

1278
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
That's right. That's right. How dare they? How dare they?

1279
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
All right. We're going to go take a trip down memory lane.

1280
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
We're going to go to a time when games weren't so damn buggy.

1281
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Geez, imagine how hard it's going to be to do reaction videos to Nintendo games.

1282
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
You're going to have to, like, sign all sorts of agreements to do that.

1283
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
The classic game of the week.

1284
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Dark Sakura usually steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats ought to be playing this game this week.

1285
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
But she ain't here.

1286
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:42,000
So Shane is filling in this week and is using this opportunity to push the agenda on a game that he never shuts up about that he thinks all of you guys should be checking out, if you haven't yet.

1287
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So Shane, and I thought for sure Dark Sakura had done this before, but we consulted the wiki and it wasn't there.

1288
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And since we're still not 100% sure, we're just doing one of the games in the series and not the original.

1289
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
All right, so here it is. Shane, what is the classic game of the week?

1290
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Suikoden II, because it's the best RPG ever made.

1291
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
And you used to go by the name Miklotov online.

1292
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Yep, which is where this came from, Suikoden II, it's the Blue Knight.

1293
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Yep, the Midas Hilda Knight.

1294
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:20,000
But anyway, this game came out in 1998 in Japan, 1999 here, and 2000 in Europe.

1295
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I specifically remember going to get this game when it first came out and they had, like, tons at Best Buy.

1296
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I was like, oh, that's mine. And so I was very happy because this game is super rare to find.

1297
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
But basically it is a sequel to Suikoden I, takes place a few years later.

1298
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:45,000
You play as the unnamed hero who, I think it's Ryo if you go by canon names,

1299
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,000
but Suikoden is a game all about political drama and big armies fighting each other.

1300
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It's amazing. I don't really know what to say about it because I just love it so much.

1301
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I'm not going to get into the history, but it's a game where you've got six people in your party.

1302
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You do Unite attacks where multiple people fight together.

1303
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
You also have one-on-one duels, which kind of work as a rock, paper, scissor format.

1304
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And you've also got these massive battles.

1305
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
So in the first game, it was also just rock, paper, scissors. It was kind of boring.

1306
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,000
In this game, it still has a rock, paper, scissors element, but now you also have a grid that you move around on,

1307
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:31,000
almost like a very basic strategy RPG. Those were really fun, those big battles.

1308
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Basically, this story is you, your adopted sister, and your friend get caught up in the middle of the war,

1309
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
and you and your best friend get kind of split onto two different sides.

1310
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And you go through the story, basically building up an army to take on the side that your best friend has joined.

1311
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And there's plot twists abound, there's some crying that's going to happen if you play it,

1312
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
but it's a really great, great story.

1313
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And this is one of those games that came out with a really bad localization.

1314
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Side note, because insight that I have, when I worked at Konami,

1315
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:16,000
a few of us really pushed to get approval to bring out the collection.

1316
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
This game also came out in a collection on PSP in Japan of 1 and 2.

1317
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
We didn't get it here in the States, I forget the reasoning, but we pushed to get the game out,

1318
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:34,000
and we were going to redo the text for 2 to make it make more sense.

1319
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
That ultimately got shot down, so there's that.

1320
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Didn't you yourself work on the localization for...

1321
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Five.

1322
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Five.

1323
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And I was the go-to Suikoden guy for five, so a lot of decisions on naming conventions were handed off to me.

1324
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:59,000
So I guess a disclaimer, ethics, with this classic game of the week, you did kind of work on this series eventually.

1325
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Yes, on a couple of them, but five being most notable.

1326
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
So this game has a really bad translation.

1327
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Your best friend, they spell his name three different ways throughout the game.

1328
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
There's J-O-Y, J-O-E-I, and J-O-E-Y.

1329
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Basically it's Joey, but that's just kind of sad.

1330
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,000
If you had played the first game and did all the collecting of all the characters,

1331
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and you brought over your save file and gave you some extra stuff, which was nice,

1332
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,000
there was also a mini-game that was a lot like Iron Chef,

1333
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,000
where you would have a cooking competition and they would rate your dishes and you'd pick out ingredients.

1334
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
It was really fun, too.

1335
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:49,000
But this game is probably the most well-regarded in the series.

1336
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Personally, for me, it's the best, even though I worked on five.

1337
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I still don't even consider that the best.

1338
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
This is by far the best in the series.

1339
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Now the series kind of doesn't do anything, which is really sad.

1340
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I'm sure it'll get a pachinko game at some point.

1341
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
You can pick this up on PlayStation Network.

1342
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:17,000
It came out on the network in America in 2014 and in Europe in 2015.

1343
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Otherwise, if you want a physical copy, I haven't checked eBay prices in a while.

1344
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I have two, because that's just how big a fan I am.

1345
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
But they used to go for hundreds of dollars.

1346
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
They may still, just because, you know, collectors.

1347
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
But just pay the six bucks and get it online on the PlayStation Network.

1348
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
It's totally worth your time, and you won't regret it.

1349
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And if you do, well, then you don't have good taste in games.

1350
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Sweet Coding 2.

1351
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So confession, Shane, I don't think I've really played this.

1352
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Well, you don't have good taste in games.

1353
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Well, I did play one.

1354
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
One was great.

1355
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
But I felt that I needed to finish one before I played two.

1356
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
No, you don't need to.

1357
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
There are some characters that return.

1358
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And like I said, if you bring your save file over, you get some extra stuff.

1359
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Like, you do get the ability to recruit the hero from the first game, which is nice.

1360
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
But you don't have to.

1361
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,000
It's not super required, and I can fill in any, you know, plot holes that you don't understand.

1362
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
But there won't be many.

1363
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Maybe one of these days we'll do a live stream or something. That'll be fun.

1364
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Yes.

1365
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
All right.

1366
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
But, oh, and nobody, you don't need to play four. Nobody needs to play four.

1367
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Four is not a great game. It's not because of the story.

1368
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
They just tweaked it too much, and five went back to what it should have been, and five is great.

1369
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Three is really good, even though it's got some tweaks that I don't agree with.

1370
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
But two is the best. And then one and five are tied.

1371
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And then three. And four doesn't exist in this series.

1372
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
All right, all right, all right.

1373
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And don't play the tactics game. It's not good.

1374
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
There it is, the classic game of the week, Sweet Coding 2.

1375
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
You know, this also got a spin-off card game in Japan.

1376
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It came out on Game Boy Advance. I own that.

1377
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Do you?

1378
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Yep, and they had two Gaiden games, too, which were text adventures. I own those as well.

1379
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Why do you think Konami just never brought it back?

1380
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:12,000
They tried to revive the series with a DS version and a PSP version called Tier Craze.

1381
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It was, like, watered down Sweet Coding.

1382
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I never played the PSP version because that one didn't come out here, but the DS one did.

1383
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
And it just wasn't well made. It didn't have the same charm as these ones did.

1384
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
So I guess all the people had already left that made these games anyway.

1385
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
So, like, the main designers were gone. The people that made the music were gone.

1386
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
The writers were gone. It's good ol' Konami.

1387
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Was that a surreal experience for you to actually localize, you know, a sequel, essentially, to one of your all-time favorite games?

1388
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Yes.

1389
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Was that a real surreal experience?

1390
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:58,000
That was super exciting. That was probably the best, most exciting thing I did at Konami was be on the team that did that.

1391
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Your credits are actually in Sweet Coding 5.

1392
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Yeah.

1393
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
That's cool.

1394
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I think we had a team of five that localized the game.

1395
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
How fun.

1396
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Yes.

1397
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:12,000
All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, Sweet Coding 2. I've said that, like, three times now, but I'm trying to get Shane to shut up about it.

1398
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Is it Sweet Coding 2?

1399
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yes, it is.

1400
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Let's talk about some more.

1401
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:21,000
We got to go to a break because we're running long already. When we come back from the break, we're going to have Fugu Question of the Week.

1402
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:29,000
We're going to talk a little bit about Saints Row for Loki, Street Fighter 5 for you fans of that, and, ooh, a Mistwalker game for me because I like Mistwalker stuff.

1403
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
So we'll be back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.

1404
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, January the 31st, episode number 629 of our show, already in progress, back after a week off due to unexpected sickness on the part of myself and Loki's kid.

1405
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:03,000
And this week, we have an absent Dark Sakura that filling in tonight is Shane, who is trying to negotiate with me during the break to do the classic game segment all over again because he was reading-

1406
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Yeah, I found more stuff. Oh my gosh.

1407
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Okay, I'll give you 60 seconds. Hurry.

1408
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Okay, so apparently Sweet Coding 2 was written first before Sweet Coding 1 because in 1993 slash 94, the writers were hired to make a game for an internally developed console from Konami.

1409
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:32,000
That was scrapped, and then the PlayStation came out, so they were going to make a game for that, but they decided to make a prequel to Sweet Coding 2 first so they could get a better grasp on game development.

1410
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:44,000
So Sweet Coding 2's story was first in conception before Sweet Coding 1, which kind of makes sense because 2 is such a better game even though 1 is fantastic.

1411
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Okay, there you go.

1412
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Oh my gosh, that was breaking news to me.

1413
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Can you-

1414
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
From like 15 years- wait, how many years? Like 20 years ago now?

1415
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Over 20.

1416
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
For 20 years ago, that's breaking news.

1417
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
You're old, Shane. You're getting old.

1418
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
No, I'm not.

1419
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
So-

1420
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I'll never get old.

1421
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:08,000
So, can you imagine if Konami had their own console? Like, especially with everything that's going on now, can you imagine now if they have been a player in the console industry at this point?

1422
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
It would have been such a different outcome, I think.

1423
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Maybe. Maybe.

1424
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I don't think we'd be with just pachinko machines and health clubs.

1425
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Probably not. Alright, Shane and I, by the way, are still enjoying wine, so if we seem especially excitable tonight, it's probably-

1426
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I'm also hungry.

1427
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
The wine is partially to make. So, there you go.

1428
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Alright, let's get back into some news. We're going to do some rapid fire news, then we're going to get to the FUGL question of the week. Loki.

1429
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Alright, so this is pretty cool. So, apparently, and I'm not positive this is the game that they were working on previously, because I know that they're making some sort of like burnout extreme sports thing, but there's this new game coming out by the team that did burnout.

1430
01:45:48,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I guess at least some of the team, and it's called Dangerous Golf, and it's kind of- it's by Alex Ward and Fiona Sperry, who came up kind of with the Burnout series or worked on that, and it's a game where you're trying to break as much of the level as you can before you put the ball in the hole.

1431
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:31,000
So, it's just you blow shit up with your golf ball, which I think is pretty awesome. So, they kind of have some of the elements that you would see like in the crash mode in Burnout, where it's like the crash time or something like that, but I think in this one they're calling it something a little bit different, like a- what was that here?

1432
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:51,000
It was different tricks you can perform in there. What did they call it? It was like ball time or swing time or something. Smash breaker is what they had. So yeah, you accrue enough damage and then you earn a smash breaker, which is like the crash breaker, I guess, and it allows you to do even more damage.

1433
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I'm down. It looks good. I can't wait to play that. Pretty much play anything that they make from the people that made Burnout. Let's get a new Burnout game. How about that?

1434
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:18,000
PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live are going to be getting some new games for February in their services. So, for example, PlayStation Plus, your free games that you're going to be getting, Helldivers on PlayStation 4, Nom Nom Galaxy, and Nova 1-11.

1435
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:37,000
On PlayStation 3, Grid Autosport, and then also Helldivers, Nova 1-11, and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, which is pretty awesome. And then on Vita it would be Helldivers, Lemmings Touch, and Nova 1-11. I kind of want to try Persona 4 Arena.

1436
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
There was a Lemmings game not that long ago.

1437
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Apparently Lemmings Touch on the Vita.

1438
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
I had no idea that Lemmings made a comeback at some point.

1439
01:47:46,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I want to say the last time I saw a Lemmings game on a Sony platform was part of the PlayStation Mobile stuff. So I don't know if that's the same game they're talking about, if they just ported it over, or if it's just... I don't know. I used to be really big into Lemmings at one time.

1440
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Yeah, Lemmings was one of those huge, quintessential 90s computer games.

1441
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Lemmings 2, man, I used to play the shit out of Lemmings 2.

1442
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I've never played a Lemmings game. It didn't look interesting.

1443
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
They're puzzle games, basically.

1444
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I love puzzle games, but that didn't look interesting.

1445
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Lemmings 2 was a little bit more fun, I thought. I don't know.

1446
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Anyways, on Xbox platforms, so we've got for Xbox One through February, the whole month of February, Hand of Fate.

1447
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And then the second half of February, you get Styx, Master of Shadows on Xbox One.

1448
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Then Xbox 360, Sacred Citadel for the first half of February, and Gears of War 2 for the second half.

1449
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:48,000
And of course, being that everything is backwards compatible, that they're releasing on the service, those will be playable on Xbox One as well.

1450
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And then, finally, they have made the announcement of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutants in Manhattan.

1451
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It's going to be the new Platinum Games take on the Turtles series, much like they did with Transformers recently.

1452
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
And it's supposed to be coming out on all major platforms. It looks pretty awesome.

1453
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I was going to say, it actually looks pretty awesome from the trailer.

1454
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Yeah, it's going to also have four player online co-op, so I am definitely down for that.

1455
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
That might be fun.

1456
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
So, want to check that out.

1457
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
That was the best part of the old school pizza parlor game.

1458
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Oh, God, yeah.

1459
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Ninja Turtles arcade game was the fact that it was four player co-op, except nobody ever wanted to be Raphael.

1460
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Really? Because all my friends would always go for him. Nobody wanted to be Donatello.

1461
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Really? But the Psy had such a close range.

1462
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Yes, but it's the factor of Raphael's so cool.

1463
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Raphael's cool. I was always Donatello or Leonardo.

1464
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I was Leo because he's blue.

1465
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Of course you were.

1466
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
But it looks pretty cool, and hopefully they'll be coming out a little bit later this year.

1467
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I want to say it was scheduled for the summer, so maybe I'm assuming around the time that the new movie comes out.

1468
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I think that's coming out this summer, so we'll have to wait and see.

1469
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
All right. Moving on to another EA-related story.

1470
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
EA may have actually told us how many Xbox Ones are out there.

1471
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You might remember that Microsoft kind of stopped releasing those sales figures.

1472
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
We know that Sony has sold about 35 million PlayStation 4s, so using some math,

1473
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:26,000
when the chief financial officer of EA, Blake Jorgensen, said that there are 55 million units out in the wild,

1474
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that means there's probably just under 20 million Xbox Ones compared to the 35 million PlayStation 4s.

1475
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Again, I don't think that seems that bad, but it's not exactly a close race either.

1476
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
So, I mean, but, again, both systems have their strengths and weaknesses.

1477
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
It's still pretty early in the console lives, too. I mean, we're just two years in.

1478
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
That's something important to consider as well, is that PlayStation 3 had a really rough start.

1479
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
At least, I remember that. And, you know, then by the end of the cycle, it made a lot of headway.

1480
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
And there's good games on the platforms now. There's still probably people waiting for some of those,

1481
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
like, big anticipated games that come out that they were, you know, hyping up since the launch of the consoles.

1482
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
So maybe there's people still holding off on those.

1483
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I own both, for what it's worth. I realize that's an expensive thing to do, but...

1484
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Yeah, I don't have an Xbox One. I definitely like Crackdown.

1485
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Crackdown will finally crack you down.

1486
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I don't think so, because the console's expensive. I'm not going to buy a $400 console for Crackdown.

1487
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
It might come down in price again before...

1488
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Well, it's going to have to be more than Crackdown to get me to purchase that.

1489
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I do like the fact that it's all backwards compatible. I don't really want to pay for Xbox Live, though.

1490
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I actually undid my auto-renew for that, too.

1491
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Alright, well, speaking of a company that you usually tie to Xbox, although now they're everywhere,

1492
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
including PlayStation, Bungie is having a big change.

1493
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Harold Ryan, who's been the studio president for 15 years, has actually stepped down this past week.

1494
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
COO Pete Parsons is going to be taking over the company moving forward.

1495
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
And of course, Pete Parsons is talking about Destiny right off the bat in this announcement,

1496
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,000
saying, I want you to know my number one priority at Bungie's is, and always has been,

1497
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
to deliver great games that we can all share together.

1498
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I also believe you have yet to see our studio's best work.

1499
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
My new role here at the studio will be entirely focused on fulfilling that promise.

1500
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So we'll see what comes out of Destiny probably later this fall when the inevitable next expansion is out.

1501
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I seriously need to play that. I have it at home. I have Destiny and I have Watch Dogs.

1502
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I have played neither of them. I have had those for two years now, almost.

1503
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Well, not two years. I got them last year, no, the year before last, when I got my console.

1504
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:53,000
And I just haven't touched them at all. I don't know. I just don't want to sink that much time into Destiny.

1505
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Alright, well, also, I guess there was some rumors going around this week that there was going to be possibly some add-ons

1506
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:06,000
that were coming to Destiny, some microtransactions that could have ammo involved,

1507
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
that there would be, you know, because they were selling the level boosts and so forth,

1508
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
and that there was going to be these ammo packs that were going to be microtransactions as well.

1509
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,000
However, Bungie did end up responding to this, saying there will not be paid ammo drops in the game.

1510
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
So that is not something that is on their radar.

1511
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So, I guess they're going to stick with what's working for them in Destiny right now,

1512
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
because people seem to be feeling a lot better about that game than they did a year ago.

1513
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I need to go back and revisit it. You know of all people who is super into Destiny right now,

1514
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
is my former co-host from Horde House, Extifer, is like super into Destiny right now.

1515
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
He plays online. They do PvP and everything. And so I was kind of surprised to hear that,

1516
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
because, you know, I tried to get into Destiny, but then to be fair, I didn't really do the Taken King.

1517
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I didn't get into the expansion at all. I guess I was a little late.

1518
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
But I'll wait for the inevitable price cut as they prepare for the next expansion.

1519
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Then maybe I'll get into it. We'll see.

1520
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Okay, what do you have for us, Shane?

1521
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Well, this story is just terrible.

1522
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Remember, Dark Soccer was originally going to do these stories, so this will list for her.

1523
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Yes, please keep this in mind.

1524
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Well, you know how much she loves Hadaful Boyfriend.

1525
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Yes, and I don't understand that either, and I don't understand this.

1526
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:27,000
There is a dating sim on Steam Greenlight, and you're a human that dates cats.

1527
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
There's really nothing more to be said that's appropriate.

1528
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
So let's move on to the next story.

1529
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
What's the game called?

1530
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I think it was like Perfect Date or something is what it's called.

1531
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Yeah, so bad.

1532
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
It's called Cha-Ching.

1533
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
It's called Never Getting My Money.

1534
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
It's called The Internet Loves Cats a Little Too Much.

1535
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Oh, so gross.

1536
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Anyway, a better story is that at the Video Game Awards, there was a commercial for this Tron game called Tron Runner.

1537
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Which I got on Steam Early Access.

1538
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Yes, it's apparently like ten bucks there.

1539
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:15,000
But it's coming out on February 16th for PS4 and Xbox One as well.

1540
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
In Early Access?

1541
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It's coming out then.

1542
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Oh, so then they're going to be done.

1543
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Yeah, this is a full, real launch. Again, February 16th.

1544
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
It'll be twenty bucks, but right now it's still ten dollars on the Early Access.

1545
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
So if you're going to play on PC, that's the best way to do it.

1546
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It's got some nice contributions to the soundtrack from Giorgio Moroder and other people I've never heard of.

1547
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Oh, that ties into, there was a leak a while ago.

1548
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I know, boo!

1549
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Well, I will say, Tron Runner has a really neat atmosphere to it. It's a cool game.

1550
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I just want a movie.

1551
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Well, I want a movie, and I also dream someday that they will do, I would love to see Rockstar Games now.

1552
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
They did a really awesome adaptation of The Warriors.

1553
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Imagine an open world Tron game, like the Grand Theft Auto engine.

1554
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Of course, it makes me think of The Matrix Online, which didn't end up so great.

1555
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Well, The Matrix Online was like, that's like early, I mean, think of how long ago The Matrix Online was.

1556
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
You played a little bit of that.

1557
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I did play part of the beta of that. I thought it was okay.

1558
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
For what it was.

1559
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I wasn't going to pay for that. I mean, it was cool.

1560
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I mean, I think, I liked, was it The Matrix, or Enter The Matrix was fucking awesome.

1561
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I just, I'd be fine with another Matrix game, to be honest.

1562
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Sorry, I zoned out. I was reading the next story because I hadn't read it yet.

1563
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
But the next story, because Tron's awesome, we could talk about Tron for forever.

1564
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Apparently, you know, politicians like to use music in their campaigns, and nobody's ever happy about that.

1565
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Like, everybody gets mad when they use their songs for campaigns.

1566
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Well, the creator of the...

1567
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Unless, you know, they ask for permission first.

1568
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Yeah, which never happens, so that's why.

1569
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
They always forget that.

1570
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Because we want our politicians to steal stuff for their campaigns, because that means they're a good leader.

1571
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:28,000
One of the people that's, you know, politicking around right now, Rand Paul, apparently used a Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego song.

1572
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
The one from the show that was on PBS.

1573
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Doo-wop, doo-ba-doo-way-ooh.

1574
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Come on, everybody knows that song.

1575
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Like the theme song?

1576
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
It was probably like an attack ad on somebody else.

1577
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Yeah, it was an attack ad.

1578
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
On who?

1579
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Marco Rubio.

1580
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Oh, because he's not in the Senate, he's around campaigning, right?

1581
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Yeah, something like that. Anyway, it got sent to with a cease and desist letter.

1582
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Where in the World is all the gaming content?

1583
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Somebody, I guess the website Politico said that it actually sounds like the song may end up falling under fair use.

1584
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
But it still sucks, and I should probably not do that.

1585
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Can we get like a Carmen Sandiego movie? I mean, because I thought the TV show was pretty cool.

1586
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Wasn't there a rumor that Jennifer Lopez was going to be Carmen Sandiego?

1587
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Oh, fuck that. She is not, I don't think she'd be a good Carmen Sandiego. Although, I would see like Angelina Jolie, I think could be a good Carmen Sandiego, I think. I don't know.

1588
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:38,000
The person I can't remember their name, that was in the second Ocean's Eleven movie, why can't, Ocean's Twelve.

1589
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Why can't I remember her name?

1590
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
How about Ashley Judd? Whatever happened to her?

1591
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:49,000
She, no. The one I'm thinking of is better. I just don't remember her name. She married a really old guy. Didn't she, I think she married Michael Douglas.

1592
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Anna Nicole Smith? Oh, Catherine Zeta-Jones.

1593
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Yes, she would be a good Carmen Sandiego.

1594
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Alright, maybe. It's been a while.

1595
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Yes. The end.

1596
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I liked my idea of Anna Nicole Smith as Carmen Sandiego.

1597
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
That's sad. That's not good.

1598
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I know, I miss her.

1599
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I miss her so much. Alright. Anyway, let's get to the Fookle question of the week.

1600
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Found her! She's right there, dead. I'm sorry.

1601
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
You're a horrible person and should feel horrible.

1602
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Sorry, I needed a minute to collect my emotions after how horrible Loki just was.

1603
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:36,000
We're going to get to the Fookle question of the week. Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and ask a question and get some answers.

1604
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
So this week we asked about Mighty No. 9.

1605
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Mighty No. 9 was delayed for another time. This has pushed the game back from the originally anticipated April 2015 timeframe and even comes after the promise of no more delays.

1606
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:57,000
What are your thoughts on the issue? Do you tend to shrug off delays as a necessary thing or do you feel that when taking Kickstarter money is involved, delays are unacceptable?

1607
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Or are you somewhere in between? So we just want to know, like, what are your thoughts on the issue?

1608
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
So going over to Facebook where Hitstun says, I'm okay with this, meaning the delay.

1609
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I'd rather the game be delayed and complete than rushed and unfinished. I have plenty of other games to tide me over until this one is released.

1610
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Fabrice A says, I'm just fine with this. I'll wait just a little longer. It's only a game. No one has ever died because a game was delayed.

1611
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Sorry, I'm laughing because 5th Dream in chat says, Mighty No. 9 months late.

1612
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Andy R says, Necessary evil. Yeah, it sucks when a game I'm excited for won't be out as quickly, but I'd rather have a good game, the one that's terrible and needs patches after launch.

1613
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Chad B says, We pretty much accept big budget games that have big publishers behind them delaying games, so it seems to me that expecting a much smaller studio to never delay a game is unreasonable.

1614
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I didn't back Mighty No. 9, but to me the only extra responsibility that exists because the game was backed on Kickstarter is the backers should be getting updates on why it was delayed and what is being done, which to be fair is happening, for better or for worse.

1615
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Redertainment says, Delays happen in every industry. Whether it's making a game, building a house, or shipping things across country, inevitably something will happen during the process to cause a delay in the project being completed.

1616
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:14,000
The key is making sure that delays and budget overruns don't become the thing that people think of when they think of the project.

1617
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Sadly, that may be happening with Mighty No. 9 if this goes any further. Mighty No. 9 might be the big dig of the gaming industry.

1618
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Winston H on Facebook says, Delays do happen and it's understandable. However, if we look at games like Duke Nukem Forever to be released, it did poorly. I'm not saying you should rush a game, but hype can only last so long before people stop carrying.

1619
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Final Fantasy XV being another example of taking too long. It's been in development for ten years.

1620
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Degenerate Johnny says, When I hear the word delay for a game, I'm somewhat relieved. It's communication from the developers to the fans that the game is not ready for official release.

1621
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:10,000
It's also comforting to know that the game will be complete as the developers intended and not because the public wanted it faster.

1622
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Games take time to fully develop by some studios. As a matter of fact, Hex Shards of Fate just brought down their beta status three years after the Kickstarter.

1623
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:28,000
This delay gives me confidence that Mighty No. 9 will be released and as a completed game instead of an incomplete game. Hitman, Loki and I looking at you.

1624
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:37,000
And lastly, Earpster says, If a delayed game is the difference between getting something broken that needs to be patched, looking at you PC Arkham Knight.

1625
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I love that everybody's calling shit out in their comments. And something that works right out the box, then delay it every time.

1626
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Delays are disappointing and frustrating, but looking back over the years, I have a hard time telling you which of my favorite games were pushed back a month or two.

1627
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:06,000
And lastly, let's go over to Google+, where Act Def says, People will probably quote this already, but like Miyamoto once said, a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.

1628
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And Martin replies, I believe in games being delayed if it means we get a better and more polished product. Games get rushed to market too much lately, which is a far bigger problem.

1629
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Games are released unfinished and fans have to wait for months to get a playable patched experience. That being said, sometimes continuous delays are indicative of a major development problem.

1630
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Just look at Duke Nukem Forever type development trajectories. That is not good for a game either.

1631
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:41,000
I apologize, I cut off part of Act Def's thing here, I didn't see the more button, because I've been drinking. But Act Def also said, people are pissed about it and with good reason.

1632
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,000
But in the end, if a game turns out good, I don't think people will mind that much at all.

1633
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Those are comments from Facebook and Google+, and it sounds like for the most part, everybody's pretty understanding, saying, hey, I would rather you take the time to get this right than put out something half-assed and unfinished.

1634
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:04,000
So, I pretty much tend to agree. I do think the Kickstarter element lends an interesting perspective to it.

1635
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:11,000
And I think it's going to make people, I think in the future, I think other Kickstarters will pay for this Kickstarter's problems.

1636
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Which is unfortunate, but I think it's just a reality. But I do agree with the perspective that as long as you're updating people and being very transparent with the reasons why,

1637
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:31,000
which, to be fair, the developers are doing, then that is the extra step you have to give that maybe Sony doesn't have to give when they bump Uncharted back a little bit, because nobody's paid money for that yet.

1638
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Besides maybe a $5 pre-order, but that's a whole nother Oprah.

1639
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Alright, let's-

1640
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Did you say that's a whole nother Oprah?

1641
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Yes, I did. Have you never heard that expression?

1642
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
No, I'm glad it's just not from my drinking.

1643
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Alright, another Oprah. Alright. Do you have anything you want to add to this chat, Shane?

1644
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I wasn't paying attention. I was looking at Power Rangers stuff. It was about delays.

1645
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
On Mighty No. 9.

1646
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Miyamoto's quote isn't relevant anymore.

1647
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Oooh.

1648
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
It's a pretty mighty statement.

1649
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,000
A Mighty No. 9 statement? Well, then I wouldn't say it yet, because it's not out.

1650
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:12,000
No, it's a solid quote. I'm not trying to be mean.

1651
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
That's a first.

1652
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I feel like that quote came from a time when everything was still cartridge-based and you didn't get updates.

1653
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Now, if a game gets put out and people complain that it's not working or it's broken, patches come out.

1654
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:38,000
And it's not ideal. It's not even good. But a rushed game does not necessarily mean a bad game anymore.

1655
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:49,000
That happens with so many games nowadays. It's sad that it does, but if it's a game I really care about and the fundamentals are there,

1656
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I may not mind if it's rushed and has some problems, because it'll get a patch.

1657
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And if it doesn't get a patch, then I've been burned and I'm not going to support that series again, probably.

1658
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
But that's a chance to take.

1659
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I don't know how I feel about the whole post-patch thing.

1660
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I don't like it, but it happens.

1661
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Patches are better when it's adding stuff to the game. Like when Final Fantasy XIV gets a content patch, which, by the way, there is a content patch already dated, which they needed to do.

1662
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
They also dated it a month way too late.

1663
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:29,000
But then Diablo has been getting some regular patches. That's good patching. Patching like Arkham Knight had to do to fix the game in the first place.

1664
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Yeah, but I mean, I assume at this point Mighty No. 9 is playable. It might not have the online features that they're having issues with, but it's playable.

1665
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
The base game is there. The online features are not going to change anything if they patch that in.

1666
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:56,000
It's just like, oh, now we have leaderboard support or whatever else. So if they released it now, it's still going to be the same game minus those online features they're having problems with.

1667
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:06,000
So they could put it out and patch it later. They're not going to be like, oh, we're taking the extra time to do the online features and totally revamp the game so it's actually a good game.

1668
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Alright, let's get back into some other news. Loki.

1669
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Alright, so this is kind of cool. I was interested to see a little bit about the new, or I guess the cancelled Saints Row game.

1670
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:26,000
This was one that I was actually anticipating on purchasing or got me to purchase the 3DS originally, but it never came out.

1671
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:34,000
So this game is Saints Row Undercover. It was actually a PSP game. It was also ported over to the 3DS at one time.

1672
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:56,000
And it's never made light of day. It's pretty unfinished. But what's kind of nice though is they actually released the playable ISO for the game and you can actually download it and play it on either a PSP emulator or a modded PSP.

1673
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:10,000
So if you want to check it out, you can go to unseen64.net and slash Saints Row Undercover and actually download the ROM to go ahead and play that or the ISO.

1674
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:22,000
And they give you kind of like the example of it. And I think it's pretty cool looking. You know, I used to play a lot of like Grand Theft Auto, Liberty City Stories, and Vice City Stories on PSP.

1675
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:34,000
So I'm kind of familiar with a lot of those games and everything. And this looks similar to that. I haven't actually played it yet. I'm assuming it's probably a little bit more rough around the edges since it's not finished.

1676
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:43,000
But it looked promising. And hell, I mean, this even looks promising. I wish they'd kind of do like even like a Vita game or something like that would be pretty awesome.

1677
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Dart Tetsuya in chat says, I love unreleased prototypes getting released stories. Yeah, me too. Especially when they're, you know, free. Like in this case.

1678
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Yeah, and Volition was the one that released it too, which is pretty amazing. I mean, they're the ones that actually said, here you go. I mean, you know, I think it's pretty awesome.

1679
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:13,000
And they have like a whole bunch of other stuff that you can they put out there as well, like the design documents for it, like a guide to play through and everything. That's pretty awesome.

1680
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
So props to them. I hope that they're working on another Saints Row game.

1681
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
That's kind of a fun little insight into how things work, you know?

1682
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Definitely. I will definitely be checking this out and downloading it. I watched a little bit of the video that they had for it. It was really buggy, but it's to be expected with a game that's not finished.

1683
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:38,000
All right. Well, moving on to some stories about Street Fighter V. Are you excited about Street Fighter V, Shane? You played it at all?

1684
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I've played it. I played the beta. I played it at PlayStation Experience. My excitement's kind of waning though, I think.

1685
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Why is that?

1686
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:55,000
My experience with it so far, I really liked IV, just the way it played. And this one, it just doesn't feel the same to me, which I know they're probably going for.

1687
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,000
But I don't know. I'm not feeling it as much. We'll see when it actually releases.

1688
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
All right. Well, some new information came out this week that there's some updates on the story mode.

1689
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Street Fighter V story mode. In the story mode, each character is going to have their own storyline. There's going to be illustrations by a famous Capcom artist, Benghis.

1690
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I hope I said that correctly. I'm not as familiar in the fighting game scene. Sorry, guys.

1691
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:26,000
But it's going to be illustrated by him, and I remember seeing some of that in the beta. That kind of gave it a comic book feel, which was pretty cool.

1692
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Also, Street Fighter V is going to have a cinematic story expansion, which is via a free update this June. So here's an example of patches.

1693
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
But you're getting the game, and that's what people want to play.

1694
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Interesting. I don't know if you're in chat, but a lot of folks were talking about what you were saying there, Shane.

1695
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Were they mad?

1696
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Some disagreement.

1697
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Well, that's fine. They can disagree with me all they want.

1698
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Anyway, the cinematic mode in June. The mode will tell an overall narrative which takes place between Street Fighter IV and III through rendered cutscenes.

1699
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:07,000
They actually released a little trailer about that. By the way, there is one final beta test that just ended about an hour ago.

1700
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:12,000
And that was something you could play, but it's too late to talk about it now, right?

1701
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Also, there will be a post-release character in March.

1702
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Street Fighter V will include a download pack that's going to have Alex, Guile, Balrog, Ibuki, Juri, and Urien.

1703
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,000
They will be in the game later, but we don't know who comes when.

1704
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:39,000
By the way, don't forget you can actually unlock characters with in-game currency, but there's also going to be a $30 package that unlocks each one as they appear.

1705
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
So, it depends on how much you want to play the game.

1706
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
There you go.

1707
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
At least it's optional. I don't mind as long as they have a way to do it in-game and it's not ridiculous like,

1708
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Oh, I'm sorry. You're going to have to wait another four hours before you get enough currency to...

1709
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Oh, I'm sure it's going to be something ridiculous.

1710
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I don't know. Yeah, Heroes of the Storm. It takes you a long time to get the gold to unlock a character.

1711
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Well, yeah, but this is not the same company, so I don't know.

1712
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I'm not familiar with how Capcom does mobile games if they do have a lot of those and how they market it that way,

1713
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:19,000
but it sounds like this is just going to be something that if you don't want to wait for everything to unlock, you can just unlock it.

1714
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Alright, let's move on to Shane.

1715
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Okay, so a Utah representative has introduced a new bill that amends Utah's criminal code to include doxxing, swatting, and denial of service attacks.

1716
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
So, you know, you could get in trouble for that.

1717
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:45,000
So, if you doxx somebody, it's a Class A or B misdemeanor depending on if it's your first offense or not.

1718
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:58,000
And doxxing is where you publish people's personal home information on a website or somewhere that's not normally available.

1719
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I was going to say, don't get me wrong, something needs to be done about this phenomenon, so I can't believe I'm going to say this, but good job, Utah.

1720
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:15,000
But at the same time, some things are sometimes supposed to be publicly accessible, like if it's a politician or something.

1721
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Yeah, but this has to do with the intent also. So, if the intent is to annoy, alarm, intimidate, offend, abuse, threaten, harass, frighten, or disrupt,

1722
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:30,000
it says electronic communications of another. So, it's a little specific there.

1723
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:39,000
But it's A or B depending on if it's your first offense or not. However, if you do it against a minor, it's a third degree felony, just like that.

1724
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Swatting, you automatically get a third degree felony for swatting somebody.

1725
02:13:47,000 --> 02:14:02,000
If the person you swat is injured, it becomes a second degree felony, and the person convicted will have to cover the treatment of any injury, including psychological, that are caused by the offense.

1726
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Finally, denial of service is the only one to actually be fully defined in this bill, apparently, but if you are found guilty, it is a third degree felony.

1727
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:21,000
So, of all places, Utah really jumping on things that should be tackled by every state at this point.

1728
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:30,000
SSJ100Matt says, good, these are all douchebaggery things that go on on the internet. It's a starting point. If it works well, then it will be quickly adopted across other states.

1729
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Hopefully it does, but I also don't see people in Utah really falling under this style of harassment. I would say if a place like California or New York did it, I think it would carry more weight.

1730
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Well, what happens when, let's say you're the guy in California, if a person from Utah doxxes you, then that person can still get in trouble because it's Utah law where they committed the crime, right?

1731
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I don't know, it doesn't tell me.

1732
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I think that's how it works. Maybe I need the lawyer guy's opinion, but I think that's how it works because the crime was committed in the state of Utah.

1733
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:12,000
But if I'm in Utah, but my doxxer's in California, I'm not sure this law would apply.

1734
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Which is again why this should just be nationwide.

1735
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Well, it's a start. If it goes well, and obviously you want to make sure it's not, you know, like I said, there are some reasonable reasons why you have strangers' addresses publicly, but yes, intent is a lot of it.

1736
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
So, all right.

1737
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Now if they could get something for like Xbox Live and people that are like 12 and chat and like punish them, that'd be great too.

1738
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Like I said, those are the ones that need to be spanked by their mother.

1739
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
So anyway, let's move on. Loki.

1740
02:15:50,000 --> 02:16:06,000
So, they're finally getting rid of the Wii Street View, which I never understood as, like, that was what they were selling the Wii U on as, hey, you can go on Google Earth or Google Street View and use your Wii U tablet to look around.

1741
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Who gives a fuck? I mean, seriously, but it was something that they had. It was its own app and they are getting rid of it.

1742
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:21,000
So if you want to actually check it out before they get rid of it, do so before March 31, 2016.

1743
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Well, I used the Wii Street View thing once or twice. It was kind of one of those, huh, that's kind of neat sort of things.

1744
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:40,000
But it runs way faster on my PC. The Wii U internet is so slow. It takes forever to load anything. So I think it just works better on the PC.

1745
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:52,000
It works pretty good for watching YouTube videos. Well, sort of. Although I did have an issue because I was playing some Thomas videos for my son that my boxy is like, no, I'm sorry, I can't play this whole thing.

1746
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:59,000
And then the TV video for some reason just stopped working on the Wii U.

1747
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:05,000
It totally set until I reset it again. But it's just like, oh, sorry, it'll only play on the gamepad.

1748
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
It's weird. Yeah, it was really strange.

1749
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:19,000
S. Jonah and Matt backing up a story here talking about the whole law in Utah. S. Jonah and Matt says, if it's a felony, I think a person can be extradited to that state. Not a lawyer, just watch Law and Order.

1750
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Oh my gosh, but I watch SVU, so this has nothing to do with like sex crimes or little kids or rape, so I don't get to...

1751
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
You watch more Law and Order than anybody I know.

1752
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Yeah, I probably have seen every single episode of Law and Order.

1753
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,000
How about Criminal Minds? We just got into that. Well, not just into that.

1754
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Only Law and Order. If it doesn't have bum bum.

1755
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I do watch some of the Chicago series, though, that they have on NBC now, like Chicago Fire and Chicago PD.

1756
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:58,000
But that doesn't really deal with courtroom stuff. That's more like, oh, somebody got shot in the head and here's a picture of it, so let's go catch them.

1757
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Did you ever see the Law and Order episode that was loosely based on Anita Sarkeesian?

1758
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Oh yeah, that was a terrible episode.

1759
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Well, it was an absolute terrible episode, and my wife liked to be an asshole and rub it in my face and go, yep, see, this is what happens when you're a gamer.

1760
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Here's the thing with Law and Order, quick tangent. Law and Order, when they rip stories from the headlines, they do it pretty poorly for the most part.

1761
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:33,000
They should just come up with their own stories. Those are better. I think the only one that was good that got ripped from the headlines was the Rihanna Chris Brown one.

1762
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Because in the end, the chick that was supposed to be Rihanna was murdered by Chris Brown.

1763
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,000
That's not good.

1764
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
But it was good for the story.

1765
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:55,000
But here's the thing that was funny about that. It was so cheesy, it reminded me of hackers, like 90s hackers, where this is what hacking looks like. No, it's not.

1766
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I forgot that this was the thing. Brad from Pod Culture in our chat asking, what about Law and Order UK? Yes, it's a real show. Wasn't Jon Barrowman on that one? I could be wrong.

1767
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
No, Jamie Bamber.

1768
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Oh, that's it, it was Jamie Bamber, the other extremely good looking UK guy.

1769
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:20,000
And also, what's her name? Amanita from Sense8? The one girl's girlfriend. She was on that show as well.

1770
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Oh yeah, she was one of the Doctor's companions too.

1771
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I don't know that stuff.

1772
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I saw some of them. Because it was basically just the same stories. I'm pretty sure the season I watched was pretty much the same stories, just done over there.

1773
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Didn't really care for it as much. But I'm not usually a UK show person, except for Downton Abbey. Love Downton Abbey. That is like the best. I've watched it all, I will watch it again.

1774
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Downton Abbey is so good.

1775
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I wondered when you'd sneak that into this show.

1776
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I will sneak it into everything.

1777
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I talk to Shane just about every day, and so for the past two weeks, I'm hearing nothing but, Downton Abbey is so good.

1778
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
It is so, so good.

1779
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I don't know if I could go out, Rob, because I have four episodes of Downton Abbey I'm going to watch today.

1780
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
That's pretty much it.

1781
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I can't play Diablo. How am I going to watch Downton Abbey if I play Diablo with you?

1782
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I know, because I couldn't focus. I had to rewatch an episode, because I was trying to watch when we were playing one night. I was like, this is not working for me. I have to go back and watch it from the start.

1783
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I still have to finish Sense8 if they're getting a second season. Yes you do.

1784
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
They're filming.

1785
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I will get on board with what Shane says about that show, because that show is amazing.

1786
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Sense8 is so good. It's a little slow though, at first.

1787
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,000
It is, but then by the time it ends, you're like, oh, this is what Heroes Reborn should have been.

1788
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:44,000
I still think Heroes Reborn is passable to pretty good, not usually all that bad.

1789
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Better than season two.

1790
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Better than season two and three. And better than most of four, except for the end.

1791
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Kaijuto says, I like Law and Order North Korea. Is that a thing? I don't think that's a thing.

1792
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,000
That's a thing that would be interesting. Believe it or not.

1793
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Hey, you know what else would be interesting? I would be all about this, because I like Mistwalker Studios and some of the stuff they did.

1794
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:16,000
You know, they did The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and a game I never shut up about called Lost Odyssey.

1795
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I missed that game.

1796
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Which needs, let me say that again, needs to be on Xbox One backwards compatibility.

1797
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Like, is anybody listening?

1798
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I'm disappointed. I thought I still had it. I guess I must have sold it back or something, but I swear I still have that game.

1799
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
But I can't find my discs.

1800
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Anyway, even though I doubt Lost Odyssey is ever getting a sequel, which is kind of tragic, it is still good to know that Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is the boss of Mistwalker, is working on a new game for consoles.

1801
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:55,000
And if you don't know that name, you can kind of thank him for a little series called Final Fantasy.

1802
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
I've never heard of that.

1803
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,000
He was one of the lead creative folks on that game before he went to found Mistwalker.

1804
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Which might explain why Final Fantasy games have changed a bit in the last few years.

1805
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,000
But anyhow, so Mistwalker does have a new game in development for consoles.

1806
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:20,000
He offered a sneak peek showing some concept arts and just a little bit of detail when he was talking to students at the University of Hawaii's West Oahu campus.

1807
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Mistwalker's headquarters, by the way, are in Hawaii as well as Japan.

1808
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
What a rough place to have students.

1809
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,000
I mean, I get that Hawaii actually has a pretty decent gaming presence because of its proximity.

1810
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:38,000
It's actually a really big Japanese tourist destination as well as the U.S. because Hawaii is only half the distance for the folks from Japan.

1811
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
So, Hawaii is a very popular Japanese destination, so there's a lot of studios there.

1812
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I know Konami used to have an office in Hawaii, of course.

1813
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,000
And I think there's some other companies there, too.

1814
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
But anyway, some of this, of course, leaked to Twitter.

1815
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:58,000
But then, actually, the whole presentation was on YouTube at one point, although it has since been taken down.

1816
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
So, I don't know what happened there, but it disappeared.

1817
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
So, yeah, we know it's going to be for consoles.

1818
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:11,000
It's going to have that sketchy style that you're kind of used to seeing from Sakaguchi, and the graphics will be in 3D.

1819
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I'm assuming this is something we're going to hear out of E3.

1820
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Tinfoil hat.

1821
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I wonder if it's an NX game.

1822
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Because Mistwalker did put out that game on the Wii that they finally did release over here, and it was kind of one of those last great Wii games.

1823
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
What was it?

1824
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
The Last Story. It was part of that Operation Rainfall thing.

1825
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Oh, okay.

1826
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:39,000
And Blue Dragon was on 3DS. I don't know, I could see that a little more than I could maybe PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

1827
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Because Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon were Xbox exclusives, because that was Microsoft's part of their ploy to be like,

1828
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Look, we're cool, we're hip, we're in with the Japanese RPG crowd, look at us.

1829
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:59,000
It's a shame that Microsoft bought that, because Lost Odyssey on a different system would have actually sold.

1830
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Yeah, so fortunate.

1831
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
But anyway, there you go.

1832
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
It could be on, like, Lost Odyssey 6 by now.

1833
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I'm sad now, thinking about that.

1834
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Although, I don't know, the first game did kind of have a definitive ending, I don't know.

1835
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Well, just like Final Fantasy does.

1836
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:21,000
That's true, it could have been a different character that was immortal or something.

1837
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I don't even remember the story of Lost Odyssey, I just know that the little memory things you find were just so depressing.

1838
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Yeah, it's like you're crying every five minutes playing that game, and then at the end of disc one, you're just like,

1839
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I cried as hard as I did at the end of Dancer in the Dark.

1840
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Alright, anyway, let's get to the mailbag.

1841
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Every week, you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read your emails here on the show.

1842
02:24:52,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Dark Soccer usually dives in the mailbag to read your emails, but as she is absent tonight, I will be taking her place and reading the emails tonight.

1843
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
We do have a few, so sit back and hold on.

1844
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
First up, we have Martin from Belgium saying,

1845
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Greetings Sky, Dark Soccer, and Loki. I want to talk to you all about acceptance of video gaming for adults in everyday life.

1846
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Recently, one of my colleagues asked me what I like to do in my spare time.

1847
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,000
When I mentioned video games, I got some funny looks from some fellow colleagues, even those my age. I am 29.

1848
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
The same happens with my parents.

1849
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:26,000
When I played Fallout 4 for a couple of hours on end over the Christmas break, my dad asked me,

1850
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Don't you ever get tired of that? However, my parents watch TV for hours as well.

1851
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:52,000
It is clear to me that video gaming is still seen as childish or useless activity that adults should not engage in.

1852
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I thought we were getting past this, but we are not.

1853
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:59,000
By contrast, watching movies, TV, sports are accepted ways of spending your free time.

1854
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Objectively speaking, these activities are just as useless and time-wasting.

1855
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Yet, when I am among non-gamers, I feel reluctant, even ashamed, to mention that I play video games.

1856
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I feel people will think I am immature or weird.

1857
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
This makes me a bit angry because I know it is nothing to be ashamed of.

1858
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I think games are still misunderstood as a medium due to ignorance.

1859
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:26,000
On the other hand, when I found out recently that some friends of mine play video games as well, this led to us bonding over it.

1860
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,000
What are your opinions on this?

1861
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:33,000
When do you think video games will finally get accepted in the mainstream the same way TV is?

1862
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Maybe it will take another generation of kids having grown up with them to make this happen.

1863
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this.

1864
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Join the podcast, as always, Martin.

1865
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:48,000
What do you guys think? Video gaming being shamed by some generations?

1866
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:59,000
My perspective on this has always been, well, this is something that is slowly going to get better as more and more people are growing up with video games.

1867
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:07,000
The 30-somethings that are having kids today, we all grew up with Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System as the norm in a household.

1868
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Whereas maybe your parents give you the strange look because they didn't maybe have that all around.

1869
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:17,000
But I don't know. What are your thoughts on this, Shane? Do you think...

1870
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Do you think...

1871
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Do I think...

1872
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I don't know.

1873
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Do you think that there's a way... I mean, I feel bad for him because he says he's embarrassed or whatever and part of me is like, well, fuck them if they don't like it.

1874
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:39,000
That's, I mean, that's basically it. I mean, it's with any hobby. Not everyone's going to always understand everything.

1875
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Yeah, maybe sports is more widely accepted, but that's, I mean, again, that's still going to be specific to specific circles you run in.

1876
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Do you like sports, Rob? Do you care about them?

1877
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Hockey's okay, but all my hockey-loving friends went out to whine with me yesterday and they were even talking about stuff where I'm like, well, that sounds cool, but I don't...

1878
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Because they were talking about the all-star game and the whole vote for the guy that isn't actually one of the better hockey players and all the drama that went on with that.

1879
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:15,000
But apparently he's a really nice guy. So anyway, so I couldn't really follow a lot of it, but I just kind of smiled and nodded. Oh, neat. That sounds neat.

1880
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,000
I just think it doesn't matter if it's accepted or not. If you like it and it's not illegal...

1881
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Did your mic go off? You're suddenly not coming through.

1882
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
No.

1883
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Oh, that was weird. Go ahead.

1884
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I think that if you like it and it's not illegal and it's not hurting anybody, then who cares if it's accepted or not? Everybody's going to have likes that aren't accepted or popular, so who cares?

1885
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Well, it's kind of like you and Power Rangers.

1886
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Exactly.

1887
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I don't quote unquote get it and I don't like Power Rangers the way you do, but I don't have a problem. It seems to make you happy.

1888
02:28:50,000 --> 02:29:02,000
And the toy hunting and all that stuff is something you really seem to enjoy. And the fact that you have now finally started your own podcast, that part of it makes me very happy and excited for you because now that's something we both have in common.

1889
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Yeah. So it's exactly that same thing. So I wouldn't even worry about it. So what if they don't understand?

1890
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:17,000
You don't understand why your parents can just sit there and watch TV for hours on end.

1891
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Unless they're watching Downton Abbey, then maybe you should learn to understand.

1892
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Oh my gosh. Spend some quality time with them if they're watching Downton Abbey. You will not regret it. It is so good.

1893
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Dungeon Buster says, I don't get why people play certain things, but why give them grief over it?

1894
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Kaijuto with an interesting perspective here that you may not want to hear. Video games will get respect when the loud majority of gamers stop acting like self entitled assholes.

1895
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:50,000
I don't know if they'll get respect, but I would like that just to happen. Because it is really annoying.

1896
02:29:51,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, grownups watch Disney movies. Fuck everything else. Do it loud and proud, but do what you enjoy. It's not hurting anyone.

1897
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:04,000
If someone thinks something you do is stupid, find out what they do. Realize they are stupid.

1898
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Exactly. Or maybe instead of realizing they're stupid, find out what they do. Maybe you'll like it.

1899
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
I'm not a big sports guy. I love watching baseball.

1900
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,000
But even that probably took something. Did you always love baseball?

1901
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
When I was a kid I did.

1902
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I thought that was something you got turned on to as an adult.

1903
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:37,000
No. It just resurfaced. But like last night I was hanging out with Flacco Jones and his wife and Extifer and we were like there's nothing we could watch on TV because the kids were up.

1904
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:43,000
But then Flacco Jones and I were watching college basketball and got into that because I forgot, hey, college basketball is really fun.

1905
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:52,000
So you may think it's stupid, but then just give it a shot and I guess everybody needs to do that.

1906
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Then we wouldn't have this problem that your emailer said, I don't remember your name, I'm sorry. I'm on like my fourth glass of wine.

1907
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:01,000
It was Martin.

1908
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Yes, Martin.

1909
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Or like wine. Just try it.

1910
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Except for reds.

1911
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,000
They taste like shoes.

1912
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Moving on.

1913
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Raginator emails us. Hi all, it's Raginator again. I just want to give everyone a quick heads up.

1914
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:26,000
There's a strong possibility I may break down and buy my new PC slightly ahead of schedule, meaning that I might buy it next month rather than waiting until April if only because, to be honest, I'm getting just a tad impatient waiting and saving up.

1915
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Assuming that I do go this route, it'll mean that I'll have a little less money to work with and hence I won't be able to buy quite as nice of a PC, but the tradeoff will be that I'll be back to my usual routine that much quicker.

1916
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Even if I do this, my internet won't be turned back on until March 1st, but still, any thoughts?

1917
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I would say you do have to kind of weigh the pros and cons, and I think, again, I thought we talked about this a couple weeks ago when you emailed about how much power should you put in your computer.

1918
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I think you need to figure out what's the acceptable computer, and not the bare minimum, but the acceptable computer for the games you want to play.

1919
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:12,000
You, I know, email the show a lot and talk about the trading card games like Magic the Gathering, so figure out what kind of system you need to play those games and get that, and then I think you'll be fine.

1920
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Although, you've mentioned wanting to play Final Fantasy XIV, which you might need a little bit beefier of a computer to play something like that, so I think you need to figure out what are the games you want to play most of all, and make sure your computer can play at least that and maybe a little extra, just so you're ready for whatever comes next.

1921
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:53,000
I would say just wait. Wait till your original plan, because if you're saying April at that point, that would be two months before E3 comes rolling around, and they're going to announce stuff that you're going to see is really cool, and if you skimped on your computer because you couldn't wait the extra couple months just to make it better, you might be kicking yourself later and have to pay even more to play those new games that you see.

1922
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I think that's a good perspective on it as well, is that if it's only two months, eh, that's not that big a deal, right?

1923
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:10,000
By the way, Fifth Dream in our chat wants to know, why does Shane know what shoes taste like? That's the question of the night. How do you know what shoes taste like? Do you have like a shoe fetish thing?

1924
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:21,000
No, that's gross. No, it tastes like the way rubber soles smell. So that's why I say it tastes like shoes.

1925
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Is it kind of like, that's how you know what gasoline tastes like? Because it has such a strong smell, it probably tastes like that.

1926
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:36,000
If you know what it smells like, you know what it tastes like. Because your taste is tied in with your smell. So that's how you know what something tastes like.

1927
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I'm sure I know what the taste of dog shit is, based on the smell of dog shit. Doesn't mean I've actually munched on dog shit.

1928
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:48,000
So the point of the story is, you've eaten gasoline.

1929
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Oh, I wish, thanks. I love the smell.

1930
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,000
That's like an episode of My Strange Addiction.

1931
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Yeah, it probably would be. Like I say, gasoline and coffee are the same thing. They both smell really good, but they both are probably disgusting. Well, coffee is disgusting, but I'm sure gasoline is too.

1932
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Moving on. From YYR. Hello, LR. Last week Rob mentioned the Super Nintendo era and all of its classics as being the sort of thing we might never see again.

1933
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I agree, and the reason has to do with both the colossal market and the changing way we absorb our entertainment.

1934
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:29,000
If you think back to the Nintendo and Genesis and Super Nintendo and perhaps even a generation or two ahead of that, you'll remember that we had our games drip fed to us.

1935
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Game development was expensive and so was building cartridges. When a new game came out in the 90s, people noticed because only a few games came out each week.

1936
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Just as an aside, the NES artificially limited that too because they limited publishers as to how many games they could put out in the year.

1937
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:49,000
And it's Ultra. Yeah, which is why we have Ultra Games, which was just Konami's side company basically.

1938
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:58,000
But they did that to prevent what happened on the Atari 2600 where everybody was fucking making 2600 games and it was all this commercial garbage.

1939
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:07,000
E.T. didn't kill the industry. Oh my gosh, remember I guess when Konami made so many games they had to have a different label for them? That's ridiculous to think about now.

1940
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, it was possible to play every new game and trivial to at least be aware of every release. I could make recommendations to people on platforms I didn't even own.

1941
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Hop on Steam and you'll find that approximately 80 new games released in the last 7 days. This is in January.

1942
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:31,000
We now literally have thousands of choices at any given moment, not even counting the games we grew up with and can go back to at any time.

1943
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:38,000
The huge market means that there is literally something for everyone. If a game isn't the best possible fit for your taste, there is most probably something else that is.

1944
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:43,000
New genres are seemingly coming out of nowhere and indie developers are covering bases we don't even know about yet.

1945
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:49,000
If you add all this up, we get this fact. The days where we are playing the same games together are pretty much history.

1946
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:54,000
That I think is one of the defining differences between current gaming and several generations ago.

1947
02:35:54,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Because if you ask 100 random gamers in their 30s to put together a Super Nintendo Top 10 list, I would imagine that many of them will look similar.

1948
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:10,000
If you ask 100 random gamers in their 30s to put together a Top 10 of 2015 list, I anticipate 100 different lists without much in common.

1949
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,000
I don't know if I get your point, but I don't know if I would totally agree with that.

1950
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Because Jamie and I had some really similar lists for 2015. Or no, Shane and I. I don't know.

1951
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Yeah, you, me, and Jim all had like two of the same games on them.

1952
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:36,000
But I do get the point. I'm not trying to dismiss the point. I'm just trying to say I do feel like there are some games that still kind of buck the trend and everybody knows about them.

1953
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Even if they haven't necessarily played them. Like even Undertale from the indie side. Everybody knows about that game even if they haven't played it yet.

1954
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:48,000
So, you know, there's still some of that. Fallout 4, everybody fucking knows that happened, right?

1955
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:55,000
So, I mean, just, you know, again, I don't disagree. I'm not sure it's as black and white as that.

1956
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:04,000
It's kind of like what's happening now with TV. After an episode of my favorite series aired, I used to be able to discuss it with friends or folks at work the next day.

1957
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Nowadays, whenever I ask friends if they saw the latest Gotham or Blacklist or what have you, they either say, what's that? Or, oh, I haven't downloaded it yet. Or, is that on Netflix?

1958
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Everyone gets their entertainment individually and I think games are moving in the same direction. There is more choice than ever, but it's always going to feel different from the way it did years ago.

1959
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Get off my lawn, YYR.

1960
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Hmm. It was an interesting email. It's definitely changed a lot, especially with the cartridge.

1961
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:40,000
PC development has always kind of been there, but there wasn't a place where you could, you still had to go to a store to buy PC games.

1962
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Even though there was a ton of stuff available on PC, Commodore, and all that stuff, you still had to go to a store and buy them.

1963
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Now you can get it all at your fingertips. And that's the common thread between Steam and Netflix, is that you can consume as you want.

1964
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:04,000
We're becoming that instant gratification society. So, anyway, I still like that perspective, so thank you for the email.

1965
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:09,000
We have one last email tonight from ActDeft.

1966
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Hi, it's your friendly neighborhood Mexican and avid amiibo collector, ActDeft.

1967
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:26,000
It's been a while since I've written an email, but after listening to the last episode and Loki's rant about amiibo, before anyone starts calling me a fanboy, let me state that I do agree with what Loki said to some extent, and his points are totally valid.

1968
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
But at the same time, I cannot help but probably play devil's advocate and defend my passion.

1969
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,000
As we all know, the amiibo craze started with the Smash amiibo, which are probably the most complete amiibo there is.

1970
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:43,000
They work with a lot of games unlocking stuff, not to mention that training amiibo in Smash is really fun and also a competitive scene.

1971
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:51,000
I personally know because I've participated and hosted tournaments locally, and know of other players that do it too. I really don't see anyone having problems with these amiibo in particular.

1972
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:58,000
The Mario Party amiibo also work with most of the games. They're pretty much like the Smash ones, but only with Mario characters.

1973
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Since amiibo can only hold one game info or save stored in them, and Mario Party having a somewhat important usage of amiibo, I can see why these are created.

1974
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Especially for people that wanted to play both without erasing their amiibo data from another game.

1975
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Granted, I can see why people see them as cash grabs, gold and silver Mario, but in the end, if you're not into collecting these, you can easily forget about them.

1976
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:24,000
The rest of the amiibo work pretty much the same, to be honest, unlocking, saving progress, and custom characters.

1977
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
They're not all that different and work with their respective game, including Shovel Knight.

1978
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Of course, many have a problem with the Shovel Knight amiibo unlocking an important mode in the game, co-op, but I don't see it as one.

1979
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Shovel Knight is, for the most part, a single player game.

1980
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Also, it started as a Nintendo console exclusive, and yes, I know it also came on PC at the same time, but it was console exclusive.

1981
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Not to mention that people kind of got mad that the Nintendo version of Shovel Knight didn't get an exclusive boss or level like Sony's or Microsoft's.

1982
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:55,000
So the amiibo came in place, and what better console to adopt co-op than on Nintendo's, king of same-couch multiplayer.

1983
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:06,000
And again, this amiibo works like all others. It's not only a method of unlocking co-op, but you can also save a custom Shovel Knight character that it levels up and gets custom powers and such.

1984
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:12,000
I think the amiibo is fantastic, both in how the figure looks, but also how it works in the game.

1985
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Though I see why anybody would be mad about it. Not everyone wants to pay 13 bucks to have access to something that should have probably been in the game as free DLC or something.

1986
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:25,000
But I still think the amiibo has that added value that makes it worth paying for it and using it on the game.

1987
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:30,000
And again, the figure looks really great, and thankfully it's not hard to obtain either like most amiibo nowadays.

1988
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Well that's it for this email. Sorry if it was long, but I had to speak out about this. Thanks for reading.

1989
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:44,000
P.S. Like seriously, have you seen the price of some of the amiibo on Amazon? Specifically the Animal Crossing ones. They're crazy cheap. Like holy fuck.

1990
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
That's from MacDeft.

1991
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:52,000
I got a whole bunch of Animal Crossing amiibo this week actually. I bought the entire second wave.

1992
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Because I had to have Blathers and Celeste, and you know I had to have Resetti, so I was just like what the hell, I'll get Kix too.

1993
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Yeah, you're missing the best one, which is Kix.

1994
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Yeah, so I was like what the hell, I'll get him too. So I bought all those amiibo this week.

1995
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Loki, anything you want to say to that? I don't know. You were the one that had some strong feelings on amiibo?

1996
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I still think that the amount of use they have for the amiibos is pretty limited. I understand that you can use them in other games, but their uses are basically unlocking something.

1997
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:34,000
It's unlocking some items or something. It's not like, I think very innovative I guess.

1998
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:43,000
To me it reminds me of some of these systems when they launch, like the portable systems or even with the Wii and stuff, where they don't really know what to do with them.

1999
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:53,000
And so they just kind of use it in a very generic kind of gimmicky way. And that's sort of what I'm seeing with these amiibos. They're not really being used in a meaningful way.

2000
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:01,000
The training partners are pretty cool in Smash, but aside from that I don't really see the point with a lot of them.

2001
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:09,000
It's cool if you want to collect the characters because they look nice, but it's not really adding a lot of functionality to games I think.

2002
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Alright, well that's going to do it for our emails this week. You should send us some emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

2003
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:26,000
We're going to get to a couple more news stories here and then your calls at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

2004
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:34,000
But first, we have to get to the FUs of the week, where we rant. Why? Because we get ranty sometimes.

2005
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Shane, since Jamie's not here, do you want to start us off tonight with your FU?

2006
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Sure, FU to you and your show role.

2007
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Why?

2008
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Because you left off a very important story for the day.

2009
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Well then you can put in the last minute stories.

2010
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Alright. Loki?

2011
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:24,000
My wife still insists it's the stomach flu, but seeing as I didn't throw up, I didn't have any other symptoms, I just got very sick all of a sudden and that was that.

2012
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I'm blaming the food that I ate during lunch because I kind of felt eh after that.

2013
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:35,000
So yeah, on Tuesday I ate some food from McDonald's and it was pretty disgusting as usual, but you know, it's quick.

2014
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:42,000
And so driving home I felt very, very fucking nauseous to the point where I'm like, oh shit, I better pull over because I'm going to vomit.

2015
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:51,000
And so I pulled over to like a gas station and apparently at that point I was like getting almost to the point where I'm passing out from the nausea.

2016
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,000
And so I actually fell over into a parking lot and kind of scraped my leg up and stuff doing that.

2017
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Wow.

2018
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:02,000
But then it passed. It just went away. I didn't like throw up or anything. It was just really weird.

2019
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
But I blame McDonald's for that and so I'm not eating McDonald's anymore.

2020
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I'm glad I'm not the only one that's like randomly fainting and passing out.

2021
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Well it wasn't fainting. It wasn't like I was just very disoriented, like dizzy and just, I was trying to make, I was trying not to throw up in my car and so I stepped out and I was like, okay, I'm going to go use their bathroom to do that.

2022
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I'm like, there's no way I'm going to get over there. So I like walked over the curb, but I just, my balance was just not there and so I kind of, you know, I don't know, didn't like fall and hurt my head or anything, but I just, I did scrape my knee and that was about it.

2023
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:38,000
It burnt my pants, which sucks because I don't really have a good pair of jeans anymore.

2024
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Aww.

2025
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Well I bought some today, but you know.

2026
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:57,000
My FU of the Week goes to the fact that I've been like sick for about a week now and it caused me to miss last week's show and I'm feeling a little worn down even after, like I'm like, okay, we're at the end of the show. It's about time for this to wrap up because I'm feeling a little worn down.

2027
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:04,000
But a big thank you to the fact that Sanrio just walked out in the kitchen and she's never here during the show. This is, this is a first.

2028
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:19,000
I guess she thinks that because Alan just got home, Alan has something for her. I don't know. But Alan had a treat for me, that's for sure. He just brought into the studio red velvet Oreos and I'm going to make Shane try one. Do you like red velvet?

2029
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,000
It's just red chocolate.

2030
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,000
It's just red chocolate, but you got to try one.

2031
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,000
The Oreos are just cream cheese.

2032
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:31,000
And Alan says the Oreos are just cream cheese, so. Alright, let's get to a story real quick so I can rip open this bag of Oreos. Loki.

2033
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Alright, so TBS is going to be bringing E-League, which is, I think this was originally announced by Shaquille O'Neal during the game awards.

2034
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And so it's going to take place. They're going to have two seasons throughout the year. They're going to last ten weeks long and consist of like a six, six regular or six week regular season.

2035
02:45:51,000 --> 02:46:05,000
And a bi-week and a one-week wildcard qualifier around two weeks playoff. And the first season will feature, I guess, Counter Strike Global Offensive.

2036
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:15,000
And they're going to have some of the, I'm not sure if they're going to have some of the actual people in there. I don't know how they're setting up the teams or anything for that.

2037
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:25,000
But apparently it's going to debut on TBS as well as other digital platforms May 24th. I don't know.

2038
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:41,000
Neat I guess. I'd be kind of interested to see what it looks like and how they're setting up the teams. If they're just using existing Counter Strike CSGO teams or if they're going to have like create their own teams for this league type thing.

2039
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Okay. I hope they don't screw it up on TV.

2040
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I don't know. We'll see.

2041
02:46:50,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Alright. One more story for you guys. And I don't, why is this making the rounds again? I swear to God, we talked about this ad nauseam on the show like ten years ago.

2042
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:08,000
But for some reason, this is all around the blogs this week. And I think for some reason we have the Huffington Post to blame for this, I think is what's going on here.

2043
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:22,000
But apparently it is, is it confirmed? I don't know. I guess the people that were credited with writing the music for Sonic 3 have revealed that Michael Jackson did help out on the soundtrack.

2044
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:27,000
So this, is this like their archives that you're getting this news from?

2045
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
It's their blog.

2046
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:34,000
I'm trying to see what this is from here real quick.

2047
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:44,000
No, Huffington Post ran it on January 25th. So they ran it this week and they ran this whole thing about trying to conclusively prove that yes, Michael Jackson did work on this.

2048
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:53,000
And I thought we had finished this years ago that yes, it was done. But maybe it was just that we had some really strong evidence.

2049
02:47:53,000 --> 02:48:05,000
And so it was just like yes, we pretty much decided it. But now the actual people that made the music in Sonic came out and said yes, we did use samples made from Jackson's beatboxing.

2050
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:11,000
We chop it up, we use it in his cues. There were other signature Michaelisms and so forth.

2051
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:16,000
So I think that's the fact, the fact that it is actually confirmed, that's the news.

2052
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:23,000
And that they had this interview with some of the people behind the game. But we always knew, didn't we guys?

2053
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Yes, from the news about it a long time ago.

2054
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Alright, so that's all I'm going to say on it then. I am going to open up the phones. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2055
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. Meanwhile, we'll get to some last minute stories and Shane, you seem deeply offended that there's something missing.

2056
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:46,000
It's somebody's 17th birthday today.

2057
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Uh oh, who's?

2058
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Silent Hill 1.

2059
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Oh, I didn't even realize that was a game that had come out in January.

2060
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Yep, January 31st, 1999. It's Silent Hill's birthday. And let's celebrate it by not playing any recent games because they weren't good.

2061
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Except for P.T. by your tongue.

2062
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Which, that's Silent Hill's...

2063
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Well happy birthday Silent Hill, rest in peace.

2064
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Yeah, pretty much. We miss you a lot. Like a lot.

2065
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Why don't we, in tribute, watch the second movie? Wouldn't that be a great way?

2066
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,000
No, that is such a bad movie.

2067
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,000
I have yet to see the second movie.

2068
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Don't watch that.

2069
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
I still want to do it. I still want to see it.

2070
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Alright, again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, I'm looking at our chatroom for some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

2071
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:45,000
MXC is trying to say, the article is trying to prove that his music is in the final game. Well, I think they actually interviewed the folks and got the conclusiveness that yes, he was a part of that game.

2072
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,000
I've got some...

2073
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Last minute story, Logan?

2074
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Yeah, it's stupid. I don't even... Just looking at this, I'm like, this is stupid.

2075
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,000
That's okay, you've heard this show.

2076
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:06,000
This is totally, like, this is totally rumor, okay, but there is a rumor for the NX that, guess what, Super Smash Brothers will be a launch title.

2077
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Launch title? I don't know about that. Launch title's pushing it. I mean, maybe they'll adapt the 3DS or Wii U version, but I don't know how people would feel about that.

2078
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,000
No, it's too soon.

2079
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Granted, Smash Brothers has been on every Nintendo console, home console anyway, since, what, Nintendo 64, because there was a version on 64, GameCube, Wii, Wii U.

2080
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
So, I mean, it's in better shape than, say, F-Zero.

2081
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
Cry, cry.

2082
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:44,000
So, I think it's inevitable there will be one on NX at some point, but I don't think that necessarily means right away. It seemed too soon.

2083
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Yeah.

2084
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:52,000
And even in chat, Kaijuto says, doubt it. Dr. Tetsuya says, I don't know if I buy that either.

2085
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:57,000
And Orangewrite says, I think the only way is that if it's a straight up port of the Wii U version.

2086
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Well, you know, they didn't, they never really did name that game. It's just Super Smash Brothers for Wii, Wii U, excuse me, and Super Smash Brothers for 3DS.

2087
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,000
So, they could just do Super Smash Brothers for NX, or whatever, obviously, they're not gonna call it NX, but whatever they call it.

2088
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:17,000
So, this is pretty cool. There's someone working on a mod for Fallout New Vegas to add multiplayer to the game.

2089
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,000
This always happens with Bethesda games.

2090
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:32,000
They did the same thing for Skyrim. I don't remember what the progress is on that, but this one they've got now for New Vegas. I mean, I guess it's kind of the same type of thing, same engine, basically.

2091
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Alright, one more call for phone calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

2092
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:47,000
So, the ever eloquent grandpa from Hoard House and the Starboard Power Coupling podcast just texted me, because you were just talking about birthdays, right?

2093
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:58,000
So, he just sent me this meme, and it says, it has a picture of Nintendo 64 cartridges, and it says, Nintendo 64 turned 18 this month, now you can legally blow the cartridges.

2094
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:00,000
That's funny.

2095
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:09,000
That, of course, and the ever eloquent grandpa, Starboard Power Coupling podcast, where he goes by Captain Matt, but he'll always be grandpa to me.

2096
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:17,000
That's very good timing. In fact, I'm even gonna tell him. I just read this meme on air. See what he has to say for that.

2097
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Is that it for stories, you guys?

2098
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,000
I think so.

2099
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Alright, I'll put out one more call for calls. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype. Call for calls.

2100
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Uh, let's see. Act F says, Super Smash Brothers for Game Boy next.

2101
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Darktacuus says, didn't someone make that already?

2102
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Yeah, I think they did like a demake of that.

2103
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I know the Game Boy systems didn't have them, but now the 3DS handheld has one, but there you go.

2104
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:50,000
AkumaJP in chat says, news, Mario will be on the NX.

2105
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Well, you know what's interesting about that though? Would they necessarily do a 2D Mario?

2106
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Because Mario Maker I sort of see as kind of the final, I mean, now you can make all the 2D Mario games you want.

2107
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,000
I mean, it would have to be something kind of different.

2108
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:08,000
No, because you would still need like new elements. It's just rehashing the old elements.

2109
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
I guess.

2110
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,000
But they also said that they were moving away from the 2D Mario now.

2111
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Well, I mean, but Mario games can also be Galaxy.

2112
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Can we get a new Paper Mario game? Super Paper Mario is fucking awesome.

2113
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Mario 3D World was pretty cool.

2114
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:25,000
So Super Paper Mario 2 would be awesome.

2115
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Alright, well our phones are not lighting up. I guess the callers are shy tonight. I don't know. Sometimes we don't get them.

2116
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
So I've closed up the Skype line. No calls tonight. Sad face.

2117
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
I guess too many people were watching Grease live.

2118
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Or that's what happens when we take a week off is that people forget we're here.

2119
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
So that's why I hate missing a show, but it is what it is.

2120
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight. We really appreciate it.

2121
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:52,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2122
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.

2123
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Maybe your friend will want to call into the show next week.

2124
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:04,000
So, you know, help us spread the word because we don't have any big website or ad campaign to back us up.

2125
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:06,000
So we really appreciate the word of mouth.

2126
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought here in studio.

2127
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Shane, I want to thank you for being on the show, filling in last minute.

2128
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Being enthusiastic, wine probably helps.

2129
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:19,000
And filling in the last minute with Dark Soccer Stories. Thank you so much for being here.

2130
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Welcome. Except for that cat story. You're not welcome for that.

2131
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
You didn't really read it anyway.

2132
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Because nothing needed to be read about.

2133
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Good luck with your podcast. I'm seriously happy for you on that. That's really wonderful.

2134
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Thank you.

2135
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Do you want to tell people how to listen to it?

2136
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:42,000
It's called Ranger Pride. You can find it on Twitter. Our Twitter is at Ranger Pride Cast.

2137
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:49,000
C-A-S-T. It's also on iTunes. Just look up Ranger Pride. And we will have a Facebook soon.

2138
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:56,000
We start our weekly episodes next week. And we'll be talking about the season premiere of Dino Supercharge.

2139
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Possibly among other things.

2140
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:03,000
But we have like eight other episodes you can listen to now. With episode five being like the absolute best.

2141
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,000
But it's like a two hour show.

2142
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Because you interviewed one of the other Ranger podcasters.

2143
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,000
Yes. Yes we did.

2144
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Awesome.

2145
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,000
You know I listened to the first. I haven't listened to anything but the first episode. I listened to a part of it.

2146
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:21,000
And I. Up until the part where you were discussing the episode I was like alright. This seems kind of fun. This seems cool.

2147
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:27,000
So. I don't know. Maybe you might convince me to watch an episode of Power Rangers at some point. Maybe. Maybe.

2148
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Again. You've done it before.

2149
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,000
I did. I watched the trains one. But that wasn't. You don't talk about that because it's a Japanese one right? Or do you?

2150
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Well no. Not yet. We may at some point. But the trains aren't coming over here.

2151
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
So we're all. Me and Spike are pretty depressed about that.

2152
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Aww. Let's just not bring it up please. Sorry. Sorry about that.

2153
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Let's do a cross licensing thing with Thomas the Tank.

2154
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,000
See. Thomas the Tank engine is like popular. I don't get it. But whatever.

2155
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Thomas the Tank. I mean. I swear to God. I've watched enough of that to like know way too much about that show.

2156
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Like they have their own like their own like sentient beings. But they have people that drive them.

2157
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:11,000
And so. Are the drivers just fucking retarded. Because they go like through. They have the dumbest fucking ideas.

2158
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,000
All the time.

2159
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Alright. Shane. Did you have any last thoughts. Final. Final thoughts for us tonight.

2160
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:25,000
I'm still hungry. But those Oreos were pretty good. Like I'm gonna get another one.

2161
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Alright. Regardless if you say I can or not.

2162
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Shane. You're pretty agreeing with me tonight. You like the wine. You like the cookies.

2163
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Well. Two for two tonight. The wine is just amazing.

2164
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,000
The wine's making it more agreeable.

2165
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
That's true. Probably. Probably right. That's probably right.

2166
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Then I'll have to be like. What's a game Shane hates. I'll be like. We'll play this game and you're gonna like it this time.

2167
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Yeah. We're gonna play Ni No Kuni and you're gonna really enjoy it this time Shane.

2168
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Okay. Can I get wine.

2169
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Alright. Thank you for being here.

2170
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:56,000
My final thought for the night is. I'm sad we didn't get any calls. But act deft is true in chat.

2171
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:01,000
That we did have emails to compensate for tonight. And my voice is about hit it's end.

2172
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
So I'm ready for tonight's show to end. But thank you all for being here and listening. I really really do appreciate it.

2173
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:08,000
And I'll hopefully be at 100 percent next week.

2174
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Loki. Last but not least. Your final thought tonight.

2175
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:18,000
My final thought is I was just playing my game during the break and I don't really know where I'm going with it anymore.

2176
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:22,000
So I think I'm just gonna finish what I have and just be done with it.

2177
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Because I had like good ideas for it and it just unfortunately it's. It's not quite what I wanted it to be.

2178
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:34,000
And so I just want to work on something else at this point. Just get it done.

2179
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Alright. That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back next week to do it all again.

2180
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Hopefully Dark Soccer is better and she's with us next week. I'm sure she will be.

2181
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:48,000
So stay tuned for that. And East Coast look out. I'll be seeing you in a few weeks at MAGFest.

2182
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time.
