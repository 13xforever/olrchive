00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
Another year of making your gaming memories come true has finally arrived. We're getting this year started with the explosive mod announcement everyone has been waiting for, an homage to a recently departed Rockstar, and more.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
OLR 2016 starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:50.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight live on January the 3rd of 2016, our first episode of 2016, with episode number 626 of our show.

00:50.000 --> 01:01.000
Joining you here live in our studio in Sacramento, California are myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me in the studio, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I need a wheelbarrow.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
A what? A wheelbarrow?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
For what? What are you going to haul out of here?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Roll me around the house, because I'm all full of udon.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Oh, because you've been eaten.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Noms.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Usually dinner time, right before OLR.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
So good.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Hey, guess what? Tonight is episode 626, right?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Chicken butt.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Tonight is episode 626. It's my birthday. It's my birthday show.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh yeah, I got you something.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, yay! Cool, I got a present for my birthday show.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I got Loki something too.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
What? Hey, Loki doesn't get presents on my birthday show. Alright, while she's digging, I will also introduce over there, Techmaster Loki.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Hi.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Hi, happy birthday to both of us, I guess, right?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I guess, yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Oh, this must be like a holiday thing.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh, sorry.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
I'd love to. Oh, cool. I'll take Loki's present as well, since Dark Sakura just threw it at me.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I threw it to him, and physics intervened.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
First off, since this is radio, I'll just say Dark Sakura put a little penguin sticker, and she made out the card to the whole family.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
She put to Rob, Alan, and Sanrio.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Which I love that, so.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I might have just put Matt and Ellie on there, but I don't know how well your kids read.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
They don't read very well, but that's alright. I can read too.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Aww, thank you for the card, it's very lovely.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Welcome.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Yay, there, that was great radio, live on air, opening gifts.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
We need to read your cards to people.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Good times.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
When I hear a story, once upon a time, I peed on your tree just now. Hope all of your holiday stories are happy.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
Mine says jingle all the way, and then when you open it, it says nobody likes a half-assed jingler.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
Now, if this had been Grandpa from Hoard House that had got me this card, I'd open it up and it would say nobody likes a half-assed, and that would be crossed out and it would say ginger.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
So, if you know Grandpa and his sense of humor.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
There it is.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Although I was thinking like a dingle or something.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Alright, so did you have a good New Year, Dark Sakura?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Well enough.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, I know you guys had a little festive get together, play some games and stuff.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Yes, we played games.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yay.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I hurt myself.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
That's always a good way to ring in the New Year with video games.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
And pain.

03:04.000 --> 03:13.000
Have you seen that meme that's floating around the internet where it says the gamer on New Year's Day and it's like 11.50 PM and dude staring at the computer gaming.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
This is 11.59 PM, dude staring at the computer gaming.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And then midnight, he's holding up a firework and then 12.01, back to the computer.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
So it's like, you know, I think a lot of you guys probably saw this on Facebook.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
We turned on the ball drop.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Do you?

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
And then got tired of looking at Carson Daly and all these other people who we had no idea who the fuck they were.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And I was like, why aren't we watching Kathy Griffin?

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
I actually have to admit, I was a little surprised at the thing I went to that we didn't have Kathy Griffin and Anderson Cooper on.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Because I sort of thought that was kind of like required television on New Year's Eve these days.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I love them.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, they're pretty awesome.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Rest in peace, Dick Clark.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I mean, you know, you had to pass the baton to somebody.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
He's passed it to two fabulous people.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
That's right. Even though technically he passed it to Ryan Seacrest, but you know, screw him.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Uh, Loki, you've been gone for a couple weeks.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
I know you did like a late holiday thing, so that's why you missed last week's show.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
But you're back, even though you sound a little sick.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, I'm back with my kid's disease.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
That's always fun.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
It's just a chest cold now. It's like, you know, it's on its way out.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
When the kids get you sick.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Did you have a good New Year too?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I was playing my son's video game.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah? What's your son's video game?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Disney Infinity.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh, okay.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, so now we have a figure thing now.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Did you get the 3.0 yet or are you still working on 2.0?

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Well, technically we have 3.0. He got from Santa 2.0.

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
But I downloaded 3.0 because one of the figures that Santa brought for my youngest son was Olaf.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And that's a 3.0 figure, so you kind of need it in order to play that.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
So it was like, it was on sale. It was like $17 or something.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
You know, so they only play in the toy box anyways.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
He's like, I want to do the levels.

04:51.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm like, fine. So he has a ton of characters that Santa purchased used at GameStop because they had a sale for, you buy two and you get three free.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh my, oh that's pretty good though.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah, and they're like $7 to $10 each. It's like, dude.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
They have a ton of those. But I got to admit, even I want some of those Disney Infinity figures.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Like, I think I've caught a little bit of the Star Wars mania. Have you seen the new movie yet, Loki?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Still haven't seen Star Wars yet?

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
I haven't been to the theater to see it, but yes.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Uh oh, shame on you.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Hey, no, no. I wanted to go to the theater to see it, but realistically that's probably not going to happen for a long time.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And so I wanted to see it before it got spoiled for me on the internet.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
I will try very hard not to judge. I can understand.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
I would still, I still very much want to go see it in the theaters, but it's just, I've managed this long without seeing the spoilers.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
And like I started seeing spoilers, like actually what it was, it was a spoiler on Facebook.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Like the headline was the spoiler. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Like I got to watch this now because this is going to get only worse.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah. So, so you watched it.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
So everyone watched it.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
Well, I got to say, I caught a little bit of the Star Wars mania from, from all that, even though I was never, you know, super into Star Wars.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
I hate saying I was never into Star Wars because that makes it sound like I hated it. I didn't hate it.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Well, I didn't like the prequels, but nobody did.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
I appreciated the trilogy for what it was.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
And, but you know, I wasn't like, oh my God, foaming at the mouth crazy about seeing the new one, but I got to admit it was really good.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
And there is a part of me where it's like, okay, I do kind of want, I want a Poe figure really, really bad.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
And I do want a Kylo Ren and I want Rey and you know, I'm Finn. I want all the new characters because they're all really cool.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
So there's a part of me that's like, oh God, do I want to get into this Disney infinity thing?

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
But I can already like feel the eyes of Alan's judgment because just the other day I took a picture of my updated amiibo collection.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I'll be the first to say it's pretty fucking disgusting. My amiibo collection.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Let me just put it this way. You're not a child. You're probably not going to find much in this game.

07:03.000 --> 07:10.000
I mean, you can design levels and stuff and you can make like intricate stuff like that, but the gameplay is pretty kind of meh.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
It's a little bit boring. I still was leveling up my, because I also purchased a figure to go along with it.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
I also purchased a Sam Flynn. So I was leveling up my Sam Flynn character.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, I got to see and thank thanks to you. I have a Tron figure that I have to have to work on in the game.

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
So we'll see. I don't know. Going to a chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
And if you are listening live Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show,

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
we encourage you to head on over to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com is where you can chat along with us.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
Or if you're old school, you can use IRC and go onto the game search, because that's all the website is, is a fancy front end for IRC.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
So you go to IRC and you get on the game search network and we're in channel VOG, V-O-G.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
And there's actually some chatters wishing me a happy birthday. Thanks you guys, except it's not really my birthday today.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
But it's episode 626. My birthday is June 26. That's why I was saying it was my birthday show. So it's not really my birthday.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
If there was any consolation, there was a really kick ass Deadpool trailer on Christmas.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
There you go. I guess. I don't know what that has to do with my birthday, but Ryan Reynolds, I guess, maybe.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Deadpool?

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
I'll see the Deadpool movie. That looks like it's going to be fun. We'll see.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Let's see, looking at some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
Shehulk is in our chat saying, it is actually a great era for movies right now with Star Wars and the Hateful Eight in theaters and 70mm.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
You know, I know we're a video game show and not a movie show, but let's be real, the two go hand in hand an awful lot.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
And I got to kind of agree. There's a lot of buzz around movies this year. Probably more so than games, let's be real.

08:53.000 --> 09:03.000
Or this, excuse me, this last year. I have to get used to the whole concept of 2016 now because you know I'm that guy that's going to be still writing 2015 on his checks for a month.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
The two times a month I have to write a check.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
But anyway, this era right now, this end of 2015 was really, really good for movies, I think.

09:13.000 --> 09:21.000
And I don't know if it was as good for games as it was movies. Not to say all the games sucked, but I just feel like we've had some bigger.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
And we were talking about this a little bit last week's show. We've had some kind of bigger years for games.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
I feel like a lot of the stuff that could have really pushed this year over the top got delayed to 2016, but I guess that kind of happens every year, right?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
And so it goes.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
But I will agree that movies have helped subsidize the entertainment an awful lot there.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
And Bobby Blackwolf in chat, yeah, I knew I was going to get called out on that, says, Rob writes checks?

09:44.000 --> 09:54.000
Are they ones his body can't cash? No, there's certain things I still have to write checks for. Like the landlord doesn't take credit card. I have to do checks for that still.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Why would you pay your rent with credit card?

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
I've heard of people doing that as far back as when I was in college. Some people did that.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
That just strikes me as kind of irresponsible.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Money's money. Well.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
But it's money you don't own.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
I mean, like, what about like debit card, credit card? That's what I mean.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah, that's what I mean. A lot of people would do with that. Well, and if times are tough, I've heard of people doing it.

10:17.000 --> 10:25.000
But anyway, that's another issue for another time. But yeah, so there are still the reasons to write checks, but it's very, very, very few.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
Let's see. Going to our chat for some more comments. One more over at live.voggenetwork.com.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
Brad from Pod Culture giving a hearty, Fuck Deadpool. He's Green Lantern.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
It's true. You have him in both universes, DC and Marvel.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah, except the Deadpool movie is actually going to be good.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
We'll give him a chance. We'll give him a chance.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
Alright, since we were just talking about 2015, you know, last week on the show, we had a pretty full house here.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
We had myself and Dark Soccer, Flaco Jones and Shane Olinko were here in studio joining us.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
We had a nice little round table talking about our favorite games of 2015, but with Loki being gone, we were not able to hear his picks.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
So I wanted to give Loki a chance to go over his favorite three games of 2015. Out of curiosity, did you hear last week's show?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Nope.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
So you don't know what we picked. Well, we'll tell you what we picked as you reveal yours here.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
So let's start with number three. What was your favorite, third favorite game of 2015 and why?

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
You know, honestly, that's the thing. I couldn't remember three games I played during the year.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
I mean, I played, I remember I played the last few months, but like, what was I playing earlier this year?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
I think I was working on my game for a lot of time.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
You were. You were working on your game a lot. If you go back to the gaming weeks and so forth, would you come up with something?

11:36.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, I mean, I guess. God, if I had to pick a third game, I would say Just Cause 3, maybe. I mean, honestly, it's going to be a good game.

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
I just can't play it right now because the load times are ridiculous, but I love watching people play it and the videos and the glitch views are fucking crazy.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And I think it's hilarious.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
You do love your glitches.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Oh my God. Now that's where we'll get to my number one pick.

12:04.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, I mean, I love, love that game. Just Cause 2 is pretty fun and just watching what they're doing with 3 and I do want to get more into it.

12:15.000 --> 12:25.000
And it was one I was looking forward to most of the year. I'm just, you know, once I was playing it and trying to grind through some of the missions and taking three minutes between each one, I'm like, dude, this is ridiculous.

12:25.000 --> 12:33.000
I got to just stop playing this until they fix this. And maybe they have. I don't know. I haven't gone back to it. So that would be my number three.

12:33.000 --> 12:44.000
All right. So, uh, so Just Cause 3 is Loki's number three. And as a reminder, uh, mine was Everybody's Gone to the Rapture was my number three and Dark Soccer's I believe was Undertale if I remember right. So there we go. So there's our threes.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
So Loki, how about your number two favorite game of 2015?

12:48.000 --> 12:56.000
My number two game and like, I don't even know if it's my favorite, but it's the one I've been playing probably the most. Ingress.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
I knew it. I called it last week. I fucking called it last week. By the way, we predicted what your top three would be.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
All right. All right. Fair. Okay. So Ingress and your top three.

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
And it's only because I've been playing it quite a bit. Actually this week I've been pretty, you know, lethargic with it. I just haven't really wanted to do anything.

13:12.000 --> 13:24.000
Like, in fact, I was like driving over here today. I'm like, oh, hey, there's a field. And I'm like, yeah, but my, my bursars are in a capsule. Well, I've got some level six ones. Tap, tap. Yeah, fuck it. I just don't want to do anymore.

13:25.000 --> 13:34.000
I'll hack this instead. Um, so yeah, I mean I played quite a bit of that and it's got me out to visit many parks.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And cemeteries? Have you done cemeteries?

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
I haven't done cemeteries yet, but lots of parks. And now I don't have any time to do it because my schedule's changing again.

13:42.000 --> 13:50.000
So I'm going to be working Monday through Friday and off on the weekends. Whereas I had Thursday to kind of do whatever the hell I wanted. I don't have that anymore.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
So real life sucks sometimes. Yeah, you do.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh well. So that's that. And then of course number one's going to be Fallout.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
I think I already got ruined. So number two for Loki was Ingress. My number two was Rocket League. Dark Soccer's number two was Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, if I remember right.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Alright, so your number one, as if this is going to surprise me at this point, Loki.

14:10.000 --> 14:22.000
Fallout 4. Because that's what I've been playing the most of recently. And it's entertaining. I find this as entertaining as Skyrim. I mean it's just taking up a lot of time.

14:22.000 --> 14:35.000
And like Skyrim, thankfully they have perks to allow me to walk around fully encumbered because I'm just picking up every piece of garbage on the ground and carrying along with me.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
In case I need it. I'm like a hoarder in that game.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
The weight restrictions in those games always bother me because in the same way I have to hoard everything.

14:44.000 --> 14:55.000
You get perks though and eventually you can get to where you can actually fast travel with being over encumbered and also you can use your action points to move.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm just used to the vast majority of JRPGs where every character is bringing around a bottomless pit or something to carry all the items in the world.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
So that's why I always do that.

15:06.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah, I mean in Skyrim I used to have to make multiple trips and I'd have to glitch it to just get an armor that would have like plus carry 99% or something like that.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
But this one I can't because it's on console so far.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
So right now I'm just kind of doing that.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
I mean there's glitches where you can get your companions to carry extra stuff for you but I just don't want to.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
This works just fine.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Because I've been playing that. I haven't really played much through the story.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
I do want to go back and play it again as a complete asshole this time and just kill everybody.

15:36.000 --> 15:43.000
Especially the Minutemen kind of bother me so I'm just going to go through next time just with I don't give a fuck what you want.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Oh hey, settlement. Kill everybody. Just kind of go through that way. That'd be fun.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Alright, so there it is. Loki's favorite game of 2015, Fallout 4.

15:52.000 --> 16:02.000
I feel like for what an event game that was and how many lists that game is making, I have to admit I haven't touched it yet because I know how it's going to go with Bethesda.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
There'll be a game of the year edition next year that has all the DLC included that's on sale.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I'll wait for that one. I don't have to be first in line for Fallout.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
I still think you're going to get enough out of just the vanilla game. I don't think it's really a big deal.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
That's fair.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
You know, even if it's like Skyrim, their DLC is kind of hit and miss.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
I mean, some of us are like, well, I don't really need that.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
So I wouldn't go out and buy, I don't know, I would just, I'd buy just the vanilla game. I think you're going to spend enough time in it as it is.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
Alright, fair enough. I would say Dark Soccer, we did a pretty good job predicting Loki's list because I'm pretty sure we predicted Fallout 4 as well.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Well, there's just very few games I played this year. I'm like, I was trying to think, well, what the hell did I play?

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
So before I tell you what we picked, any wild guesses what myself and Dark Soccer picked for our number one?

16:48.000 --> 16:56.000
For our number one? I don't know. I'm guessing Dragon Age Inquisition.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
She did! She did!

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
And then for you.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
The DLC. The DLC in Dragon Age Inquisition.

17:02.000 --> 17:11.000
And then for you, um, gosh, it's going to be, oh, shit, no, I know what my number three was. It wasn't just cause.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
It was Mario Maker, but, you know, never mind.

17:14.000 --> 17:24.000
Well, let's see, for you, I would say probably, I don't know, maybe like Splatoon, but I don't know if it's Splatoon.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
I would say maybe, um, no, cause Diablo 3 came out so long ago. I'd probably say Splatoon.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
Splatoon, close. You should have went with your first gut voice and went with Mario Maker. That's why I picked for my number one.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Well, no, that was my number three, I think, actually, cause Mario Maker's pretty fun.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
Good job, though! You predicted ours about as well as we predicted yours. I think I said the Lego game he'd been playing would be on his list.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
Well, the Lego game, no, that's funny enough. The new one's coming out in a couple weeks, so I'll be playing that, actually.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
And I didn't include that, cause I think that I included last year, cause we're still playing it then.

17:59.000 --> 18:08.000
But, dude, my son's put like 200 plus hours in that game already, in the Lego game. Like 230 hours, I think, was the last time I looked at that.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Wow.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
So, I mean, that's ridiculous.

18:11.000 --> 18:22.000
Alright. Well, as we transition from 2015 into 2016, a big thing we like to do usually in the first episode of the year is talk about our predictions.

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
We opted tonight not to do List List, which I know may disappoint some people, but we don't have any other extra people here in the studio with us tonight.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
So, we thought we'd just do this a different way tonight. We'll bring back List List at some other point this month when we have a guest here in the studio about some other topic.

18:37.000 --> 18:48.000
But I thought we'd talk a little bit about 2016 predictions, cause, you know, a lot of stuff from 2015 has been delayed into 2016, and this is shaping up to be a really interesting year in games.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
One that could be pivotal, actually, and we'll talk about that in a minute here.

18:53.000 --> 19:03.000
So, I'm gonna open up the floor to any predictions that my co-hosts or myself may have, but I do have, first off, I have like five kind of topics I wanted to talk about first before we open it up to that.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
So, one big thing a lot of people are talking about, and by the way, I open this up to our chatters as well.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
If you want to comment along with these, I definitely will read some of the comments in our chat, live.voggenetwork.com.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
Alright, first thing I want to talk about, Nintendo NX obviously won't be its final name, but you hear a lot of buzz about it.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
My question is, do you guys think it will happen this year, and what is it?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Nintendo NX, will it happen this year, and what is it?

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
I'm just expecting my bar of, you know, what they're coming out with to be extremely low.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
It's gonna have a stupid name, because for some stupid reason they have these weird naming conventions.

19:40.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm hoping it doesn't. I think it's gonna be just simply kind of like Wii U with a detachable gamepad that runs on some.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I think that's as basic as it's gonna be.

19:50.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm kind of with you. I kind of think that the gamepad this time is going to be fully detachable as a gaming device.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
And this might be why we don't hear a lot about the 3DS's successor.

20:06.000 --> 20:14.000
Because I have this weird, funky feeling, and again, this is a Predictions episode, so we have our tinfoil hats in full swing.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I have a feeling the two are gonna be sold separately.

20:16.000 --> 20:25.000
I think you're gonna have your main desk NX, if you will, that will play the games, and you can have a classic controller or whatever and play the games on that.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
And then you can also have a portable Nintendo, and the two will link together for some features.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
But it's not gonna be as essential, so to speak, for the system as it was on the Wii U.

20:37.000 --> 20:44.000
And that 3DS or whatever the successor is, that handheld device, not only will it function with the desk one, but you will be able to take it wherever you want.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
I kind of think that, and they're gonna be sold separately, and that's how they're gonna mask how expensive it really is.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Well, yeah, I mean, that and not selling the power supply with it.

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
I would hope that they would do something exciting. I'm just, I just don't expect that anymore, unfortunately.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
Do you think it will make this year? You know, we have supposedly a Zelda game on the horizon.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
No, I think it'll be spring of 2017.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
So we could have a console release in the spring, which we don't see very often.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
It was initially announced for fall, but it's gonna get pushed to the spring.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
I think something really funky will happen where the desk comes out in the winter, and the handheld comes out in the spring.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
They don't release at the same time, so they can pull your money twice.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
I just have this weird feeling that's how it's gonna break down, but we'll see.

21:31.000 --> 21:41.000
And the reason, again, the reason why I'm saying this and where I'm getting this from is I'm going back to way back when they first revealed the NX, and they were kind of talking about that ecosystem for Nintendo.

21:41.000 --> 21:54.000
I just sort of think they're gonna try to bring the handheld, which they've always been very dominant in, and the living room consoles more together into one system.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I think that's what's gonna happen.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
Darsakha, any predictions on your end for the NX? Do you think it's gonna happen this year, or what do you think it is?

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
I think they'd like for it to happen this year, but I don't know that it will.

22:08.000 --> 22:26.000
I think it's gonna sit in limbo, and I also think that the goofy name thing, the convention will stay, but that's also been a positive marketing ploy in the case of the Wii and the Wii U, is the fact that, yeah, the name sounds goofy, but you don't forget it.

22:26.000 --> 22:35.000
It instantly sticks it in the head. It's something that you've got a connotation to, so I think that Nintendo's seen success with that plan and will keep going at it.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I don't know. That's just any name, though.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
I think for Wii, it worked. For Wii U, it didn't, and because Wii U's name was too similar to Wii.

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
But I think the silly name thing, for as much shit as we gave the name Nintendo Wii when they first announced that, yeah, for what you're saying, I think that worked.

22:52.000 --> 23:00.000
But I think I could see them doing a silly name thing for the new console, but it's not gonna sound anything like Wii. It's gonna be completely different.

23:01.000 --> 23:11.000
And if it is these two things coming together, it's gonna be something like, I don't know why, but the image I get in my mind is like Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
They're gonna be like complimentary things.

23:14.000 --> 23:22.000
Can we, like, drop the Miis already? Does anybody give a shit about the Miis anymore? Because they're not utilized in most games.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
The Miiverse is kind of...

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
They were all over Smash Brothers?

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Yeah, Miiverse is kind of a thing. I don't know if the Miis are done.

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
I like the Miis. I play the stupid little Mii Plaza thing all the time. So yeah.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
Alright, Kaijuto in chat says, Miis forever. I love the Miis. Let's see some other comments here.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Sjoan Hunter Matt says, Nintendo will finally announce that must-have game to make people upgrade to the new 3DS.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah, the new Zelda game.

23:46.000 --> 23:55.000
Dungeon Buster says, if you combine the dev kit and production rumors from Foxcon late last year, they point to 2016 as the year it could come out, but that's a lot of heavy speculation.

23:56.000 --> 24:06.000
Dungeon Buster also says in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, if I recall correctly, Iwata said over the summer at a shareholder Q&A to wait until this year's E3 for more information on NX.

24:06.000 --> 24:14.000
Yeah, I think for sure we get a name and whatever the twist is about. This is Nintendo's little twist. What a twist!

24:14.000 --> 24:27.000
We're going to get that at E3 because Nintendo is going to want to put it in front of developers soon enough where they can start developing for it because they definitely want third parties on board with whatever this is because we all saw what happened with Wii U.

24:27.000 --> 24:40.000
The question is, does that necessarily mean it comes out over the holiday in 2016? I don't necessarily think so because if you think about it, Wii U was announced E3 20...

24:40.000 --> 24:53.000
Sorry, I'm getting my ears fuzzy, but it was the E3 the year before it actually came out and that was because they wanted designers to be thinking about how am I going to use this tablet and the second screen, that whole thing to its full potential.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
And we have that probably to thank for things like Zombie U and some of the...

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't know, I remember when I first saw it, I was like, eh, that's kind of dumb.

25:03.000 --> 25:17.000
I like this name, She-Hulk in chat says, it will be called the Nintendo Power. That would be a cool name. I love it, but I don't know. I still think it's going to be something where there's two names that complement each other, if that's even going to be right.

25:17.000 --> 25:28.000
Well, speaking of Nintendo, here's my second topic on Nintendo, Nintendo Mobile. After a long resistance to mobile gaming, Nintendo is going to enter that market this year.

25:28.000 --> 25:36.000
And I think we've heard, what, four to five titles planned for this year. The first one we know is Miitomo. We've heard a little, little, little bit about that.

25:36.000 --> 25:52.000
How do you guys think mobile is going to work for Nintendo? Do you think it's going to be huge for them? Do you think it's going to tank? It's going to get lost in the shuffle? Do you think they need to not be doing this and should be focusing on their, you know, whatever NX is?

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
What do you guys think? Nintendo? Mobile? How do you think that's going to go for them? Loki?

25:57.000 --> 26:12.000
I think it's just, what is it? It's going to be about as popular as it is now. I think that the mobile space, I mean, if people want to play Nintendo products, they're going to play those on Nintendo devices. I think that's kind of what their mindset is.

26:12.000 --> 26:34.000
There's a lot of different properties out there on the mobile space. Like, I asked my coworker all the time, like, what the hell are you playing? I mean, oh my God, it's like Panda. I don't even know what the fuck it is. It's some puzzle, one of the billion puzzle games out there, but like, there's that many brands out there. It's just a big mess.

26:34.000 --> 26:45.000
And don't get me wrong, Mario on like a mobile device would be pretty cool, except no buttons, so, you know, I don't know. I just think it's not going to make a huge difference either way.

26:45.000 --> 26:53.000
I'm going to make a pretty bold prediction here, and maybe I'll be right, maybe I'll be wrong, but this is what my gut is telling me, and I'm going to say it.

26:53.000 --> 27:07.000
I think Miitomo is going to be kind of a flash in the pan. Like, it's going to get a ton of downloads initially, and a ton of people are going to look at it right out the gate, but then I don't think it's really going to have the staying power. I think people will kind of move on to other things.

27:07.000 --> 27:18.000
Pokemon Go, I think is going to be the biggest cellular phone game of all time. I think Pokemon Go is going to be the biggest money-making game ever released. I really do.

27:18.000 --> 27:36.000
And I just, my gut, and it has nothing to do with my own ingress and the fact that the company is, I just, I say that because Pokemon has been a big reason for the Game Boy and the DS and those systems to do as well as they have.

27:36.000 --> 27:49.000
I think you don't really want to underestimate the power of Pokemon in that regard. And I think the fact that they're coming out with something that's going to get people out there moving around and, you know, something kind of the family can do together.

27:49.000 --> 27:59.000
It's going to be, we know it's going to be a kid visiting graveyards. I have a feeling, again, don't go ingress one to one with Pokemon Go. They're going to change it up a little, we'll see.

27:59.000 --> 28:15.000
But I think they're going to really get that family element there. And, you know, when you consider that, what are some of the biggest mobile phone games we've had to date? Candy Crush, the OMG Pop, what the hell was that, Draw Something, what, Trivia Crack maybe, Flappy Bird.

28:16.000 --> 28:31.000
You know, I think Pokemon Go stands to obliterate the shit out of all those things. I really do. I might be wrong. You know, maybe the whole real world aspect of it, in fact you do have to get up and move around and can't necessarily play in the house, may hold some people back.

28:31.000 --> 28:42.000
But maybe Niantic's thought of that and maybe there'll be something you can do without going out and necessarily moving around. So, I mean, we'll see. We'll see. That's just what my gut tells me. I might be wrong.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
DarkSoccer, anything you care to comment on Nintendo going mobile?

28:47.000 --> 29:02.000
It's about time. I mean, honestly enough. They've seemed resistant to it for the longest time. And I think it's bound to happen. Now's a good time as any.

29:03.000 --> 29:19.000
And I do want to make sure I make this clear because if I don't clarify this I'll get an email or a tweet correcting me on it. I do realize technically Pokemon is not Nintendo, it's Pokemon Company. However, come on, I still associate the two very closely together.

29:19.000 --> 29:27.000
And the success of a game like Pokemon Go would only stand to benefit Nintendo. So that's why I still loop it in with Nintendo.

29:28.000 --> 29:35.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Kaijuto says Rob is talking crazy right now. Maybe.

29:36.000 --> 29:47.000
Let's see. Dungeonbuster says a new mobile Golden Sun 2. You know, we don't know what those other mobile games are going to be. Are they going to be related to existing IPs like Mario, Zelda?

29:47.000 --> 29:55.000
Although, I don't know. I think a platformer, I don't think is the best thing for a phone. Or is it going to be dormant IPs like I think we've all said on the show before.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
Advanced Wars would be a great thing to have come back on mobile. You know, we'll see. Let's see.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
SSG100Matt points out Pokemon Shuffle is huge on other devices though. Talking about another Pokemon game that's doing pretty well.

30:10.000 --> 30:18.000
Let's see. Dungeonbuster says there will be five mobile titles total if I remember right. Miitomo is the first so there should be four more to see where they go.

30:18.000 --> 30:31.000
That is assuming they don't get pushed back another year. And I think already, like weren't we supposed to have the, didn't they have that whole press conference in the first place to say we were going to do a mobile phone game this year being 2015 and that's not happening.

30:31.000 --> 30:38.000
Here's Miitomo, it's the first one next year. So, things always get pushed back in gaming. Always. Always, always, always.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
Alright, let's move on to my third topic. Third out of five. I think this is going to be a big one next year.

30:45.000 --> 31:05.000
Virtual reality. I mean, we are looking at the imminent launches of things like the Oculus Rift, the PlayStation VR, possibly Microsoft's Hololens, 2016, which we can go over the whole VR AR thing but you know why I'm lumping it in the same bucket.

31:05.000 --> 31:21.000
This stands to be a huge year for that sort of gaming but my question is do you guys think it's going to be successful? How do you guys think 2016 is going to treat virtual or augmented as the case may be reality gaming? Loki?

31:22.000 --> 31:32.000
I'm really behind it but I don't think it's going to do well. I think it's going to do as well as well as connect. Everyone's going to get hyped about it. It's going to come out, kind of underwhelmed.

31:33.000 --> 31:53.000
I mean, I think it's a great experience but the cost of entry is really high. We'll see what it comes out with, what the price is going to be but when you keep having the guy behind Oculus saying, yeah it's going to be expensive, the cost of entry is just going to be a big factor there.

31:53.000 --> 32:04.000
You're going to run into PlayStation 3 type problems where I don't want to spend $500 on this, especially when there's not a lot of software out there. Why do I need this? That's going to be the big convincing factor.

32:04.000 --> 32:17.000
Maybe the Samsung Gear VR might do a little bit better. I can see that doing better because the cost of entry is a lot lower plus it runs on mobile devices but unfortunately I don't think it's going to do that well this year.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
If I give it a couple years though, maybe it'll take off. But right now, does it launch? I don't know.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Dar Sakura, any thoughts on VR gaming in 2016?

32:25.000 --> 32:39.000
I pretty much agree it's going to go the way of the Kinect. I mean, it's a neat concept. Some of the games have been really fun. I just don't know if it's going to stick. They'd have to really do something to make it really uniquely different to make it stick. So, holiday time maybe?

32:40.000 --> 32:58.000
My personal thoughts on this. When you're talking about Gear VR, you know what's funny? I really do think this. If Apple were to do that, they would know exactly how to tell people why they need it, and it would be huge. I don't know if they're going to go that direction or not. We'll see. That's my thought when it comes to that.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah, and that's the thing. It would take something...

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Apple knows how to tell people, you need this.

33:02.000 --> 33:08.000
Well, a lot of people that buy Apple products don't necessarily... they're like, ooh, shiny, and they'll buy it.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Not necessarily.

33:10.000 --> 33:18.000
That's my general impression. But yes, their products, though, kind of help push that market, so that could help.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Anyway, that's just a side thought.

33:21.000 --> 33:37.000
Even the PlayStation 4, when the PlayStation VR comes out or whatever, that I think could help if the cost is low enough. Because in that way, the console's not that expensive, and hopefully the device isn't that expensive. That's a lot better than buying over a thousand dollar PC plus this.

33:38.000 --> 33:52.000
PlayStation VR is really tough to call, and it really hinges on, are they going to have Wii Sports? And I don't literally mean Wii Sports. I mean, are they going to have that game that makes you have to get the VR?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
The system maker.

33:53.000 --> 34:08.000
Exactly. You know, like, Wii Sports sold the Wii. Say what you will about the other fantastic games on Wii, like Zelda and all that other stuff. Wii Sports sold the Wii. If PlayStation VR has Wii Sports, I could see it stands to do very, very well. It is really, really tough to call.

34:08.000 --> 34:17.000
Obviously, I'm hearing a lot of good feedback, and you might remember a few weeks ago, we had Shane Alinko on the show, who was at the PlayStation Experience, and was completely sold on PlayStation VR.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
So if they can get people to kind of do that and try it for themselves, I think PlayStation has the chance to do very well.

34:23.000 --> 34:40.000
Well, and that's the bizarre VR game that I played. That was great. I mean, it was really fun. But, you know, I could see having something like that be more of a smartphone type thing. You know, something that you can maybe unfold, attach your smartphone to it, and then play.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
You know, they even have View Master things for iPhone now.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah. Oh my gosh, right?

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
Yeah. But, I mean, I see that being a thing, but it'd have to be something portable, you know.

34:53.000 --> 35:11.000
So PlayStation VR is still really hard to call, but I think it stands to do well enough. I think what's going to be most important about PlayStation VR is that I see these really interesting things when I read random news articles, as I sometimes do on things like, I don't know, Business Insider, Yahoo, Google News.

35:11.000 --> 35:28.000
And I see a lot of these, you know, industry, and I mean like finance industry, kind of talking about is this cycle of gaming consoles, is it going to be a shorter cycle than what we're used to? Meaning, can the PlayStation 5 possibly come out in 2017 or 2018, which would be a pretty short cycle?

35:28.000 --> 35:37.000
And I kind of think no, because I think PlayStation VR is going to augment the life of the PlayStation a little bit. But again, it has to have those must-have games.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Yeah, I don't think they've pushed the hardware to the...

35:39.000 --> 35:48.000
I don't think they have either. And I think, I kind of don't know why some of those stories report on that the way they do. I think things like PlayStation VR just stand to extend the life.

35:48.000 --> 35:57.000
So PlayStation VR, I'm going to say it does well enough. I just don't know if that mainstream game is there yet, but that could change in the coming months.

35:57.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, that's all it takes is one thing to get people hooked on it. And I mean, I really do hope it does well. I'm definitely excited about it, and I want to get in on that stuff. I don't have a PC to run Oculus, but I would like to build one.

36:09.000 --> 36:27.000
And that's, you segue into my thoughts on Oculus Rift, is I really like it, but I kind of think you just called why. I don't think it's going to be huge. I think it's going to be more of a cult nerd thing, which isn't bad. There's a lot of cult nerd things that still make a lot of money.

36:27.000 --> 36:35.000
I just don't know if I see it being super mainstream, and I think it's because of cost. You have to have the right computer to run it, you have to have the...

36:35.000 --> 36:47.000
If they were able to do some sort of breakout box, like they're doing with the PlayStation VR, where it offloads a lot of the processing, that could help. I think if you could get it to run on just average devices.

36:47.000 --> 37:01.000
But again, that's just a little silly prediction I'm throwing out. And again, I say Facebook is an interesting player in this, the way that I was actually talking about Apple a second ago. Facebook may have a magic way to kind of convince people they need Oculus.

37:01.000 --> 37:17.000
One thing Oculus Rift has that other companies don't necessarily is that Facebook is in front of the majority of Americans every single day. Every single day, we're checking Facebook.

37:17.000 --> 37:31.000
I obviously know that I don't have a Facebook, but realize the majority of folks do have that and are tuned into it every day. So Oculus Rift has a great platform to be talked about on. But we'll see.

37:31.000 --> 37:54.000
And I would love a HoloLens once it's up to what they're showing us. Obviously right now there's that really narrow field of view, but as soon as it becomes to that full field of view where they're kind of making it seem like it actually is, then I'm on board with that. Because that looks awesome. It's just right now, not there.

37:54.000 --> 38:11.000
Now here's my thoughts on HoloLens. And this may sound a little cruel, but I think it's going to fucking tank. And I think my reason for that, and it's not an anti-Microsoft sentiment by any means, I just think at this point we've already talked about two people getting into the game and I think HoloLens is going to be last.

38:11.000 --> 38:27.000
And yes, I know it's AR versus VR, but I think they're going to be too late to the game. Microsoft has a track record that they won't support something if it doesn't catch on in that first year. Hello, game room. Hello, Kinect. Hello, and so forth.

38:27.000 --> 38:50.000
I just, I mean, then again, to be fair, the Xbox division is under different supervision now. And maybe that will give HoloLens a better chance. And if HoloLens has their version of Wii Sports, then of course it's going to do fantastic. I just feel like it's going to be not enough too late. But that's how I feel today. My opinion may completely change by the end of the year.

38:50.000 --> 39:05.000
I just, I'm very skeptical, thank you, Kinect, on what they show me on stage versus what the actual product is. Especially, especially now, when even up until right now they won't fucking admit that that narrow field of view is there.

39:05.000 --> 39:17.000
Instead they do all this bullshit with this stupid rig on a camera that makes it look like it's fucking amazing. And the fact that they're going up to launch with this shit is why I'm skeptical about this.

39:17.000 --> 39:28.000
It's, you know, it's just like the fucking Kinect videos where I'm going to scan my skateboard in and try on virtual clothes and shit. That fucking never happened. It didn't happen when Kinect 1 came out. It didn't happen when Kinect 2 came out.

39:28.000 --> 39:44.000
I think you do raise, as mean as you're getting right now, I think you do raise a good point that if they don't advertise it the way it's actually going to be, that's going to only hurt them in the long run. I think that's something for everybody. This is not exclusive to Microsoft. This is something Sony needs to take notes on and so forth.

39:44.000 --> 39:55.000
Anyway, let's see, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com for some comments. Tiger Claw says, do you think the whole VR thing is going to be overcrowded? One of those VR headsets is bound to fail and only one or two will survive.

39:55.000 --> 40:07.000
Yes, and that's why I'm saying I think Hololens may not do it, but we'll see. Because Bobby Blackwolf in chat says it's also not primarily for games, the Hololens, it's more for businesses.

40:07.000 --> 40:29.000
And that ended up being Kinect's kind of little twist that ended up making that interesting. I kind of think that Oculus Rift is going to be way more for the business end than we think right now on a video game podcast, but AR versus VR, there's going to be some different things that Hololens does.

40:29.000 --> 40:43.000
I could maybe see that. I could see maybe the technology could go interesting places like arcades and theme parks and things like that. But I mean, we'll see. We'll see. Let's see other comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

40:43.000 --> 41:02.000
Let's see. SSG100Matt says, Loki rant level is at 8 of 10. Let's see. Tech 2030 says, I'm so done with console cycles. I'm all PC when it comes to the type of experiences that are on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

41:02.000 --> 41:12.000
Some things are exclusive to those consoles, though, that you have to give up in order to stay with PC. But he's certainly not the first person to give that perspective.

41:12.000 --> 41:23.000
In PC, they just don't really make cycles. It's more of just upgrades in hardware and upgrades in demand by games. I mean, they don't just advertise that. It's not like, ooh, this is a new generation. I mean, it's just gradual.

41:23.000 --> 41:39.000
Alright. Couple more quick ones here and then we'll move on. Number four out of five that I have. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. How will the exclusives look in 2016? I think I'm actually going to kind of say, how does the games look in 2016 on these consoles? What do you guys think, Loki?

41:39.000 --> 41:52.000
There's not a whole... I mean, I'm excited about a few things on PlayStation 4, really. I was only excited about Crackdown on Xbox One and I don't know at this point this far into it that I'm really going to pick up an Xbox One before Crackdown.

41:52.000 --> 42:01.000
I say that now, though, but I don't know. I just don't think that's going to be there. That's going to be enough to get me over to Xbox as well.

42:01.000 --> 42:15.000
PlayStation 4. I mean, they've got No Man's Sky, which looks pretty cool. Also, that new game event. I forget what they call it. The tech robot dinosaur thing. I mean, that looks pretty cool.

42:15.000 --> 42:34.000
I don't know. And also the stuff that they haven't announced yet. I mean, obviously, I'm kind of interested to see what they have coming out. But a lot of the stuff that's supposed to be coming out in 2016 is stuff that has been kind of pushed and pushed and pushed. At this point, I'm not all that excited about it. I mean, I don't know.

42:34.000 --> 42:44.000
For me, personally, I'm only worried about how fucking crowded the holidays are going to be this year. It's going to hurt some games that could stand to do really well.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
I don't think they're going to be that crowded because anything that's crowded in there is going to get pushed to 2017.

42:48.000 --> 42:58.000
I think, you know, you have all the things that you just named. Microsoft did a really good job of delivering exclusives this year and I think they'll do it again in 2016.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I think it'll be Crackdown, Quantum Break. I'm really looking forward to it.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Yeah, Quantum Break looks pretty good.

43:02.000 --> 43:17.000
But I know Mass Effect is on the horizon for this holiday as well. I think EA is going to deliver on that. You all know that probably for Dark Sakura and myself, that's going to be the gaming calendar for at least a month, if not three. If not an entire year, right, Dark Sakura?

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
She's laughing at me.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
And rolling my eyes a bit.

43:22.000 --> 43:29.000
Any of your thoughts on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One releases and how that's going to look this year compared to previous years?

43:29.000 --> 43:41.000
I have no fucking clue. I'm looking forward to Andromeda. I don't think we're getting an Xbox One. Dan wanted the Forza thing, but that boat sank.

43:41.000 --> 43:59.000
To be honest, I mean, most of our gaming has been on our Wii U and my PC and my Mac. So I kind of think that they're going to have to do something really amazing, I think, to bring more people in.

44:00.000 --> 44:16.000
Interesting, too, because I'm thinking about that comment that was just said about I don't get into PlayStation 4 and Xbox One because I have PC. Well, Wii U, hardly any of that you're going to get on PC. Although we do have a story later on tonight. It's kind of interesting. But anyway, I digress.

44:17.000 --> 44:30.000
My thought for this year in game releases is it's going to be a very crowded year, especially if the NX does release this holiday. It's going to be an insane holiday. If the NX releases this holiday, it's going to be crazy.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
You thought you couldn't play everything this year. This next year is going to be insane.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
It's okay. Because it won't be in stores.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Because you won't be able to find it.

44:40.000 --> 44:50.000
Because there will be a shipping issue. They'll be held up in customs or fucking, I don't know, turtles not swimming fast enough across the ocean.

44:51.000 --> 45:10.000
And I swear to God, we did everything we can, but the demand is so high, we just can't possibly make enough. Every fucking time, Nintendo. Come on. You've been singing that story since, what, 2006? Come on. It's been like ten years now. You should figure this shit out by now.

45:10.000 --> 45:20.000
You know, one interesting word that hasn't come up with Nintendo yet during this whole conversation is Amiibo. And that has really changed Nintendo. For better or for worse.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
Yeah, they sell a fuck ton of figures that do absolutely nothing in games.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
But, Loki, I've got to admit, I love the figures.

45:28.000 --> 45:37.000
Yeah, that's cool. And the figures are cool, and they're profitable, and they're going to keep doing it because it makes tons of money for them. But support for the game, eh, whatever.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
But I like my Animal Crossing Amiibo.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
I like that it's a dippy little costume in Mario Maker. Whatever, cool. I like that.

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
Okay, well, those are some expensive fucking DLC costumes. It's like an 8-bit costume that really means nothing.

45:52.000 --> 46:06.000
Loki, I'm not buying it for that. I'm buying it for the figure because I genuinely like the figures as a Nintendo nerd my entire life. I just think, like, have you seen the Palutena one? It is so well done. It is so, it's an awesome figure. I truly believe that.

46:06.000 --> 46:21.000
So, anyway, Loki's looking at me. Alright, lastly but not leastly, number 5 on my list, and I had to ask this one, for 2016, what's it going to look like for Konami in 2016?

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
Will they save themselves, or what happens in 2016?

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
They'll be gone. That's it.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
They'll be gone?

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
They'll have nothing coming out, so there's really no reason to bring them up, and no one's going to give a shit about them. I mean, that's it.

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
All that's going to happen is going to get drowned out by the fact that Kojima's going to have some really fucking amazing game. There you go, exclusive for 2016.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
And, um, that's it.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Well, yeah, add Kojima's game to the list of shit coming out. Actually, I don't think Kojima's game will be up until 2017.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
Well, probably 2017, but whatever. It's still, though, that buzz will be there, and everyone will just be like, what the hell is wrong with you, Konami?

46:53.000 --> 47:02.000
They're going to guarantee Sony closes, or opens, or puts in a very sweet spot in their E3 press conference, whatever Kojima's working on.

47:02.000 --> 47:08.000
They will blow the lid on that, because six months is enough time for them to get a little pre-rendered trailer out.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah, I mean, that's going to be pretty awesome, but I just don't think anyone's going to give a shit about them anymore.

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
And even if they are still making games, it's just like, there's other companies out there that you don't fucking give a shit about anymore.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
Like, does anyone talk about Majesco? Does anyone talk about fucking Atari?

47:24.000 --> 47:32.000
No, because they've fucked over their customers with their shitty-ass games and policies, and no one gives a shit anymore about them, so they don't talk about them.

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
And Konami, if they don't have anything coming out, big like Metal Gear Solid, no one fucking gives a shit about Pro Evo. I mean, yeah, that comes out, and that's cool.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Maybe in this country, but in Latin America, Loki.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
Okay, people who like football, that's fine. They may like that game and everything, but...

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
No one fucking gives a shit about Konami. I mean, at this point, it's like, why should I give a shit about them?

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
I'm not hoping that they turn around. They're too far gone at this point.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
Darsakra, any predictions for Konami in 2016?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Pachi-slot!

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Many, many Pachi-slot.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
It's Silent Hill, and it's Metal Gear, and it's everything that stabs us in the heart.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Fuck.

48:16.000 --> 48:27.000
My thought, and this is a wild shot in the dark, but this is just where I see it going, I think Konami will spin off the computer entertainment division.

48:27.000 --> 48:39.000
I think they'll keep their slot machine and the arcade and the machines and all that. They're gonna keep that, but I'm gonna say they sell the home entertainment division, and Sega buys it.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
And that's what happens in 2016.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
What money does Sega have?

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
Well, Loki, it's not gonna be very expensive to buy what Konami's selling.

48:51.000 --> 49:01.000
I'm sorry, I don't think Sega would buy anything like that. They don't have any money to spend on that kind of crap. They don't make anything from Sonic. So, I don't know.

49:02.000 --> 49:11.000
Alright, there it is. Some comments over at live.vognetwork.com. Rama says the money will come from Sega Sammy.

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
You know who would buy that? Probably it's like Deep Silver. They're the ones that purchase the remains of companies.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
I don't think a Western company buys it. I think a Japanese company buys it. That's why I went for Sega.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
And William Murderface pointing out the Total War games make decent money.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Yeah, but not enough to purchase Konami.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Again, I don't think the going rate's gonna be very high.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
Well, if the going rate's not very high, then a company that makes a lot more money is gonna outbid them.

49:36.000 --> 49:43.000
Let's see, but a lot of folks more focused on the Kojima thing. Dark Tetsuya is saying the Kojima Productions game, that's gonna be epic.

49:43.000 --> 49:52.000
Let's see, William Murderface says if I were Kojima and Konami did that, I would sue the shit out of them, and I think that is referring to the Kojima themed pachinko machine.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
Well, you couldn't have a Kojima themed pachinko machine, but you could absolutely have a Metal Gear themed pachinko machine.

49:57.000 --> 50:05.000
But then again, this year is also gonna be, what is it, fucking Shenmue 3. Remember, that's this year.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Oh, you think that'll actually come out this year?

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Maybe.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Nah, 2017.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
Updated E3, maybe a playable thing. 2017 at the earliest, I think.

50:14.000 --> 50:22.000
Alright, before we move into our gaming weeks, any random fun predictions you guys want to throw out there for 2016? Anybody?

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
In gaming. And I opened this up to the chatters as well over at live.vognower.com.

50:26.000 --> 50:38.000
I want a new Animal Crossing, like a real one. Just how much fun I've had with Amiibo Festival. They've got the assets there. They could easily do another Animal Crossing for the Wii U, and I think we'll see it this year.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Nah, I think that'd be for the NX at this point.

50:40.000 --> 50:47.000
You know, with what I predict or threw out there about the NX, imagine if you could play your village on the TV and then you could take it with you wherever you go.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
You know, that could make for a very interesting launch title for NX. We'll see. Loki?

50:53.000 --> 51:07.000
I don't know. I mean, something Minecraft related, maybe? I mean, they've got that IP now. I mean, they released it on Wii U and that's okay. Will we see a sequel to Minecraft?

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Minecraft 2?

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
Isn't there supposed to be a Minecraft movie coming out at some point? I mean, the Minecraft story mode is okay.

51:14.000 --> 51:26.000
I don't know. I kind of hope that they finish patching the PC version, the Windows 10 version, because that client is fucking rocking. Just, you know, keep up the good work. That's all I'm saying.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Get the features. Get them in there.

51:27.000 --> 51:37.000
Yeah, get the features in there, because the client is amazing. I love it. Because my PC's not very fast. My laptop runs awesome.

51:38.000 --> 51:53.000
Alright, looking at our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com for some crazy predictions. Brad from PodCulture saying, Nintendo cuts a deal with Sega and the NX is the Dreamcast 2. If only. Can you imagine launching with a Mario and Sonic game?

51:53.000 --> 52:10.000
All I hope, I mean, as much as I dig on the game, because I think that they've really gone in a stupid direction and it's so, I still can't help but play them. I really hope there's another Saints Row game coming out soon, because I do love that series.

52:10.000 --> 52:22.000
It's just, I love the characters in the series. Just, it's really, just try to come into your own game. Stop fucking knocking off Crackdown at this point. I mean, come on. Just make your own game out of it.

52:23.000 --> 52:34.000
Alright, we're a good 50 minutes into the show, so I think that's plenty of time for a kickoff topic. So, let's get into our gaming week. So, we're going to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

52:34.000 --> 52:43.000
And then we'll get into the weekend news, which, as you can imagine, was a little bit slower than usual, but we still have a few things to talk about. But first, our gaming week. StarkSoccer, how was your gaming week?

52:43.000 --> 52:56.000
A little busy. I mean, I played, we had Animal Crossing, Amoeba Festival. I'm still playing Happy Home Designer. We played some Super Smash Brothers. I've totally lost some of my Kirby skill.

52:56.000 --> 53:18.000
What else did I play? A little bit of Dragon Age Inquisition. Not too much. Yeah, really just that. And if you want to go for non-video. Oh, actually, no, we did play some Black Knight 2000, because I was playing some pinball and some jackpot. So, there you go.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Okay. Loki, how about your gaming week?

53:22.000 --> 53:34.000
Bobby's saying, don't make the game the fans want. Make the game that I would consider good. Hey, I considered Saints Row the Third good. It's just when they went fucking crazy with the superhero powers that they make any fucking sense.

53:34.000 --> 53:44.000
Saints Row the Third was pretty good, except for that they, like, knocked off the bad guy super quick. And that's, I didn't like that. I thought they could have done a little bit better, but whatever.

53:44.000 --> 54:00.000
Anyways, this week, or I should say the last few weeks, I played quite a bit of stuff. So, first off, of course, played Ingress, so did that. And then, I played lots of Fallout 4. I'm not really playing through the story portion, but there's so many side quests and everything that I've been just kind of busy doing all that.

54:00.000 --> 54:24.000
And I've got, let's see, I've got Kate as my companion, who's completely maxed out as far as, you know, and then I get her perk or whatever. So, I switched to Nick Valentine, who's like the synth detective guy, which is pretty awesome. So, I'm switched to him. And then, I don't know, I'm just carrying a shit ton of garbage with me.

54:25.000 --> 54:35.000
Like, I'm just dragging the Commonwealth in my pockets. It's ridiculous. So, you know, because I'm like, I'm over-encumbered anyways, I'm like, what's it going to matter if I just...

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
It's video game logic, it's fine.

54:36.000 --> 54:58.000
You can carry 350. You're carrying 5,000. So, whatever. So, I've been playing that. And then, Eric, who wanted me to download Earth Defense Force 4.1, I did that. And then, he couldn't play, so I'm stuck playing that game now by myself.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
I like that such a bad thing.

55:00.000 --> 55:17.000
It's Earth Defense Force. This one's extremely cheap as far as the way the enemies act. I mean, it's even worse than 2017. Which, that's just the game. But it is frustrating sometimes. Like, it's like, here, let me ramp it up to hardest. I should be able to beat that. And they'll just get swarmed by everything.

55:17.000 --> 55:24.000
But that's the game. It's insanely hard. So, whatever. But I've been kind of bouncing around with that a little bit.

55:24.000 --> 55:40.000
I downloaded a game called Laser Life on PlayStation 4, which is the new game from the guys that did Bit Trip. So, it's like this Rez amplitude-type music game.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Oh, really?

55:41.000 --> 55:55.000
And it's used like the analog sticks to move these two lasers around the screen. And then, there's like circles or whatever objects you have to hit with lasers. And you pull the triggers to the beat.

55:55.000 --> 56:04.000
And so, you have to do that. And then, you're like syncing memories of this dead astronaut or something. I'm not really sure what the story is. But they've got that kind of going along with it. It's a little trippy.

56:04.000 --> 56:13.000
The other thing I don't like about that, though, is it's hard to line up your lasers with whatever the targets are because it's very hard to tell perspective-wise where they're at on the screen.

56:13.000 --> 56:24.000
So, that's a little bit frustrating. And also, with the analog sticks, it's really hard to kind of like, okay, I need it to be kind of half this way and a little bit up. It's just too hard to be accurate with it.

56:24.000 --> 56:45.000
But I did pick that up for like three bucks. So, whatever. I mean, that's cool. I played quite a bit of Disney Infinity 3.0. My son's been playing the Toy Box stuff because he got 2.0. He doesn't want to play any of the levels. He wants me to play the levels. I'm like, no, you're playing the levels. I mean, the game is for you. You're playing those levels.

56:45.000 --> 57:01.000
I'm like, come on. You should be doing that. But he has a ton of fucking characters. We got him so many characters. He's got almost all the Avengers except for Hawkeye and Hawkman.

57:01.000 --> 57:19.000
Hawkeye and Falcon. That's what I'm thinking. So, Hawkeye and Falcon. I was searching all over the place for the Spider-Man set because that's really hard to find. I'm trying to pick up a lot of the 2.0 stuff now because it's dirt cheap and they're closing it out.

57:19.000 --> 57:35.000
And so, he wanted Spider-Man. And so, I finally found the Spider-Man set. And then I picked myself up a Sam Flynn because I thought it was cool. And then he wanted a Yoda. So, he has a Yoda now too. And then my youngest son has an Olaf.

57:35.000 --> 57:51.000
So, overall, he's got, I think, probably 15 characters already within a week. I almost bought another five the other day because they were so cheap. I was like, I kind of want to do that. But he was like, I don't really want these characters. I'm like, okay, fine.

57:51.000 --> 58:04.000
Because they had Baymax and stuff like that. And I was like, oh, sweet. I can pick up that. And you have more characters to play as. But I'm like, oh, man, if I pick these up, my wife is going to be fucking pissed. So, when are you buying more of those four?

58:04.000 --> 58:14.000
So, but, I mean, it's hard to, you know, complain when they're like five bucks each. I mean, seriously. So, he's been playing quite a bit of that. I played some of it just to level up the character.

58:14.000 --> 58:40.000
And then finally actually getting to figure out how to actually use the Toy Box mode. I played some of the pre-made stuff. They had one that was kind of a knockoff of Splatoon that you play. So, that was okay. But, I mean, they can't really get that involved and deep. It's not like LittleBigPlanet or LittleBigPlanet or Mario Maker and stuff. I mean, you're very limited on what you can make in the game. But it's fun.

58:40.000 --> 58:51.000
I'm sorry. This comment from our chat is too hilarious over at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby Blackwolf says, Loki is like the George Lucas of Saints Row. Don't make the game fans want. Make the game that I would consider good.

58:51.000 --> 59:07.000
Well, yeah, that's what I read earlier. But, yeah, I mean, so. I would make a game that's a cross between Saints Row the third and Saints Row two. I mean, I thought those were great games. And you get the guys involved with, you know, the gentleman in the row. And I think you get a pretty good game.

59:07.000 --> 59:21.000
It's the problem. The problem is they went with the whole matrix. It's the matrix problem is what I call it. They made Neo too fucking powerful too quickly. How the fuck do you go from there? Now the world, they fucking destroyed Earth and they...

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Spoilers.

59:22.000 --> 59:36.000
Well, come on. That's Saints Row the fourth. They destroyed Earth and fucking went to hell and in like another completely separate game. And they're traveling through time now. It's not fucking Saints Row anymore. It's a completely fucking different game.

59:36.000 --> 59:54.000
They wanted to make a fucking space game or just knock off. I don't know what it was. But, like, it's not so much that Saints Row four was bad in that sense with the superhero powers. I'm fine with you having the crazy powers and stuff. But they just recycled the fucking third game all over again. That's all they did was recycle everything to make another game.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Alright, alright, alright.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It was an expansion that they made into a full game. That's all it was. That's my problem. But I still wanted another one.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Um, no.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Okay. My gaming week. Actually, not a lot of new stuff, but I've been playing like a lot of just stuff that I have. Like, you know, a lot more Baume & Essie 14 because I play that a lot. Diablo 3. I got Prap of the Rappa on PlayStation 4. Prap of the Two, excuse me, on PlayStation 4. And I was playing a little bit of that. So I kind of appreciate the whole PlayStation 2 classics. And I actually never did have that disc. Somehow I completely missed that game.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I have like two of them.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Isn't that weird that I just didn't have it? But I do now on PlayStation 4. So I was playing some of that.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:49.000
The only new game that I really checked out this week was on Steam. I checked out a game called Distance, which is like a racing game.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But it kind of reminds me of a cross between the Tron Runar game with the look of it being all very neon and like Blur, I guess a little bit. Remember how Blur was kind of like, that game was really underrated, I think. I just don't know why that game didn't do better.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Distance kind of reminds me of that look a little bit. So it's early access, though, so it's hard to tell exactly what the full picture is going to look like for that game.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And I think it's weird that you control it with a keyboard because that only is going to allow so much for controls.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:30.000
But okay, I enjoyed what I was playing with it. It's fast and you do absurd things like flying over ramps and you fly up onto another track and so forth.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So I'm liking how I'm getting all these fast racing games lately to fill in my gap since I don't have F-Zero with fast racing Neo on Wii U.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I have to show that to you at some point, Loki. It's kind of fun. You got to see that. So yeah, fast racing games. So Distance was new when I played that.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I also went back on Steam and I revisited a game and this came out probably a couple years ago at this point. I don't know why I randomly picked it up, but I did.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And it's a game called Before the Echo, which is a music game. And I believe it used to be called Sequence, but there was something with the rights holders to that.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I think Sequence is like a card game making company or something. They make Skipbo or one of those games, I think.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
So basically, the makers of the computer game, Sequence, had to change the names. They call it Before the Echo.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And it's kind of like you're playing DDR step mania because you're not really dancing. You're using your fingers.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But the interesting thing about it is you have three different grids that you're having to cycle between.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So it's like you can do the step pattern in the mana well to regain your mana, but then you have to go over to the spell one to cast a spell.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Or you want to go to the defend one to hit those buttons or you're going to lose hit points.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It's kind of an interesting mechanic. It's not just straight up finger-finger revolution. It's a little more strategy into it as to when do I cast my spells and so forth.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So yeah, I just was randomly playing that and having a good time with it. So check that one out.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And that was pretty much my gaming week. I feel like I've played a lot of games, but not a lot of new stuff that's worth talking about.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
MMO playing will do that to you. And of course I play Ingress as well, but I don't know. That's just kind of a given.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I've told every story I'm going to tell with that game. I hit level 13 in the past week.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Cool. I got my silver fueling one. The one for MU or whatever.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Good job.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I don't know. Everyone's like, I kind of wanted to go. Everyone did this big ole, they have different missions in the game. A lot of them they create banners.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So all the little icons for all the missions make giant banners. So there's one that's like, was it the Sacramento Enlightened one?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
60 missions.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Yeah, it's ridiculous the amount of missions.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I haven't done it yet either. So when you decide that you want to do it, I'll go with you. And maybe we can drag Alan into it if he's off work.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
That would be fun. I mean, I just don't know.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
It takes five hours. So you have to plan. But let me know because I still need to do that one too. It would be fun.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Alright, so that's it for our gaming weeks. So we have some housekeeping and then we'll get into the news for the week.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Housekeeping is follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. And we are also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
As well as Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And there will be no live show in February on the 21st, I want to say it is.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
There will be no live show on the 21st of February because I will actually be back east. Yeah, it's the 21st.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I'll be back east at MAGFest. We'll try to tape something earlier in the week so that way, you know, because we had a lot of gaps in November and stuff.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Just due to various goings on. So I hate missing shows. So we'll try to fill that in.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Well, speaking of missing shows, all of you will be deprived of me next week.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Party! Party! No, I'm kidding. We'll miss you.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yes, with everything you throw. Will your aim improve?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Yeah, well, considering where you're going, I have the right to be hateful and jealous. So you know what? Deal with it.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Last week of Bucket of Meat.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
At Disneyland. Because you don't know what you're talking about when you say Bucket of Meat.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It's the Big Thunder BBQ. They serve all of their food in these little metal buckets. Hence, Bucket of Meat.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Sounds delicious.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It's amazing.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Do you get to eat it on the ride? Because that'd be cool.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Some people have.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It's going away because they're bulldozing it to make Star Wars land.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Technically, you can take like a go box and you can eat your ribs on the ride.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Maybe one of two good things will come out of this. One, they'll move it to California Adventure. I mean, why not? That'd be great.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Two, Victoria will steal me a bucket.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Two, perhaps they'll have Bucket of Jar Jar in Star Wars land.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And you can actually eat the flesh of Jar Jar Binks.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That would be poisonous. It'd be like eating Fugu.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
A lot of people have seen that story floating around Facebook. I'm sure about everything they've got to close at Disneyland.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Either temporarily or permanently to make room for Star Wars land.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Well, the thing is, I actually do like the ranch there. But someone has decided to adopt all the animals there and start caring for them.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yes.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But I thought it was, it's sort of getting rid of something that was part of, I think, Disney's vision, you know?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That you take care of, you know, it's educational on top of everything.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And that it provided, you know, a look into caring for animals and livestock and whatnot.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I know. I kind of liked it when it wasn't necessarily themed around a certain property lands.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
That's the thing that kind of bugs me about it too. And don't get me wrong, I love me some Star Wars.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And Star Tours is one of my favorite rides in Tomorrowland. But A, they have Tomorrowland for things like that.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And B, yeah, I'm kind of the same as way. I think if they're going to do a land centered around one movie, it should be a California Adventure or a new park or something.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You know, because California Adventure has Cars Land and that works out okay.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Aren't they talking about making a third park anyways?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Yeah, and that's why I don't understand why they won't do Star Wars Land there.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Unless the new park is going to be an animal, like a SeaWorld competitor type of thing where it's an animal like Wild Kingdom in Japan, in Florida.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Or maybe a water park. It may not be the same type of park as Disney and California Adventure.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I don't know. It's kind of like a lot of that's very nostalgic. It's like, you know, 50's Disneyland type stuff.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I feel weird about a Star Wars Land in Disney proper. California Adventure, they can do whatever because that's kind of the more modern park.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But I feel very weird about how they're getting rid of stuff to make Star Wars Land.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And again, that's no disrespect to Star Wars. It's just a weird thing to have a land for at Disneyland. Anyway.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
But I would be totally fine with them, you know, smoothing it over with me by creating some Tron specific rides.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Right? They could just move it over. The people mover turning into Tron bikes.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
The people mover. Because there was that whole little Tron part in there.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And they do have, let's not forget the Disney. Is it Shanghai Disney or something? It has a fucking Tron light bike ride.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
That was all over Facebook a few months ago when that opened. That looks fucking rad.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Or they should do one that's like, you know, Soarin' Over California. Let's just get rid of Soarin' Over California because it's fine.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
But do that as the actual gliders? The light gliders or whatever they had?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Actually, if I remember right, Soarin' is going through a big closure. If it's not now, it's coming up and they are redoing the movie.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:49.000
So it's going to be something new. So, I don't know. I don't think it'll be Tron because I think Disney is kind of distancing itself from that.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Why? It's so good!

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It'll be Frozen. It'll be the Frozen take flight.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Fuck Frozen. No, seriously. I mean, Frozen's an okay property. That's fine.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:07.000
But Tron is so good. I seriously was hyping up my son about the Tron figure and he wanted to play as him and stuff like that.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And I'm like, hey, let's watch Tron. And so he's like, no, I don't want to watch that.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'm like, why not? It's so awesome. He's like, no, I don't want to watch that.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
So I watched it anyways at the beginning of Tron Legacy. And then he watched some of the light cycle battles and thought it was cool.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000
But he still didn't want to watch it. But it's such a good movie. Why does that not get its own treatment and stuff?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Why are they just dumping on that universe? But, I don't know. Whatever other fucking movie they're making 80 billion of or something.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Cinderella 4 or something like that.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says, Soarin' over Hoth.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Look, I love Star Wars, but we need not to go the Frozen route with Star Wars.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
We don't need to do everything. Let's not forget, Disney has a lot of cool stuff.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Let's give everybody a little piece of something.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Alright, anyway. Let's move on. We gotta get into some news.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
We could talk Disneyland all night, but believe it or not, there was some video game news this week we gotta get to.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
There's no news. Unless it's Tron news.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
So, apparently, Activision is in talks to acquire nearly all of the MLG.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I'm not sure if a deal has been signed so far, but apparently they're very close to signing a deal if they haven't already done that.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And so that's the thing. We haven't really seen a confirmation yet.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000
According to the rumors, they're supposed to be paying about $46 million in cash and assuming all liabilities.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And, of course, they're supposed to be, I guess, some of the shareholders will be getting money from that.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I'm sure this is just to kind of help with, you know, getting some more exposure for Call of Duty. Definitely that would help.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
You know, they've been wanting to try to get that as an esports game and this will definitely help.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And, you know, Blizzard's mobile kind of helping get that a little bit going.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And, actually, a lot of the stuff Blizzard's been putting out would be kind of perfect for the esports scene.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Yeah, between Hearthstone, StarCraft, and Heroes of the Storm, they kind of have a lot of that stuff locked up.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And World of Warcraft arena mode is also very popular. And I think they're trying to get some of that in Diablo now.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Season 5 of Diablo is supposed to have this whole set dungeon thing that you can run and it's for a time.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And I wonder if that's something that they'll try to see what they can put in Diablo to make it more competitive, too.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Because right now, PvP in Diablo is nothing. It's there, but nobody plays it.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So, it'll be interesting to see maybe what they try to do with Diablo with that.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000
That's interesting. I mean, I hope that that makes maybe things come a little bit more mainstream.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Because I think a lot of people don't really realize that this exists, especially a lot of casual game players and everything.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It's weird, because when you say that, I agree with you, yet at the same time I'm like it's exploding online.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And the whole numbers for Twitch TV is sometimes outranking cable channels.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:20.000
You know, I think more people watch Twitch TV than were watching Heroes of the Storm on ESPN2 or whatever it was on.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It's just interesting to me.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I'm Bobby Blackwell following that up in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying ESPN fans know esports exists. They bitch about it.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000
But is that a conflict, though, with a game maker owning the game competitive branch as well?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Yeah, I can see some conflicts of interest, but it depends how they treat it.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Is it a conflict of interest for some of these cable companies that own certain things? I don't know.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I guess MLG isn't the only one out there, but you can certainly see where MLG will probably prominently feature the Activision products.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And maybe a little less emphasis on things that Activision doesn't do, like fighting games.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
If you don't like it, then I'm sure someone else will come out with a competitor.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Change the channel. If you don't like it, change the channel.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Bobby Blackwell, though, pointing out it would be worse if a company which sponsored a team also owned the esports federation.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Because then I guess you'd be getting into a little bit of the whole that you don't want to favor the competitors, because then it makes the sport look rigged, basically.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Alright, let's move on and talk about a game announcement from this week.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
An old game about to be made new again, sort of.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Final Fantasy IX has been announced that it will be coming to PCs and phones in the next year. Or this year, as the case may be.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I can't tell you how many times I saw the headline, and I was like, ooh, Final Fantasy XI!

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Because my brain just flipped it around. I'm like, well, no, it's IX.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Well, good news! Final Fantasy XI is already on PC.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:15.000
No, I understand that, but I thought they were going to be doing something new with it, like redoing it, doing an HD version, because I saw they're remaking, or remastering it.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I'm like, oh, yes, remastering XI. Oh, it's IX.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000
They will be pulling the plug on the 360 and Playstation versions in, what, like two months?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
It's your last chance to get those 360 achievements if you still need them.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Oh, god, no.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Well, apparently it's easier to, like, grinding to 75 is no big deal now.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It's weird. That game's changed a lot from when I first saw it.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Yeah, how times have changed. It's like, I can't get to 50, I can't do this stupid quest.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Somebody needs to help me do the goddamn quest so I can get to 65.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I don't want to fight, Matt. It's too hard.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Alright, anyway, where were we? Oh, yes, Final Fantasy IX, Loki, being remastered for PC and phones.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
My least favorite of the modern Final Fantasy.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Really?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Yeah.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I don't think I would use that strong, I mean...

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I'm just weird, though. I liked VIII, so, you know, whatever.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I'm just begging the listeners to fight me, but I think VIII's...

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
You guys know how I feel about VIII.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I like the story in VIII, but I just can't stand the gameplay elements, so I think IX is certainly better than VIII, in fact, by a lot.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I think there's some elements of IX that are better than VII, but anyway, I digress.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
You have a chance to rediscover your opinions for Final Fantasy IX when they release this.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Slightly better-looking characters in the trailer, so it looks like maybe some of the things that they had to compress to fit this on a PlayStation 1 disc, or three or four of them, however many it was on.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Maybe they have some uncompressed textures in there now.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Also, some of the things that are popular from the Final Fantasy VII PC release, as well as when it was ported to PlayStation 4, is auto-saving, achievements, and a high-speed mode, which I know a lot of people are using in Final Fantasy VII on their replays.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:11.000
This is notable, too, because this game, as Loki's kind of inferring, never really got the same attention level post-release that VII, certainly VII, and a little bit VIII kind of got, so now this is a chance to experience it again.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I find the phone element of this interesting, too, that they're going to release this on phones, because that means they're going to release it like this on phones.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
But then again, four CDs worth of data is what? Two gigs? That's no big deal for a cell phone game anymore.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I'm sure compression technology is a lot better than it used to be.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I know, so I'm sure actually running it on the phone is no big deal, so it's going to be very interesting. I probably won't bother playing it on the phone.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Oh god, no. Why would anyone do that?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:45.000
But I'll do PC, and who knows? If they do the PlayStation 4 version, because they port from PC to PS4 like they did VII, it could be interesting.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
By interesting being terrible.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I don't hate it like you do.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It doesn't look good. I had fond memories of VII and I played it on PC, and I'm like, oh my god, what the fuck?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Because your TV was different.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I understand that, but I'm just saying it does not hold up graphics-wise. I'm sure IX would be a little bit better, because the character models were way better, but it's just not quite the same.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Well, I'll give IX another look. It had some very interesting characters, I thought, in IX, so I'm going to give that a look when the PC version comes out.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I hope they do get a chance to enhance some of the graphics, but I have a feeling it's just going to be magic with rendering and uncompressed textures and things that'll make it look better.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I don't think they're going to go back and redo an awful lot, although they did show glimpses of the battle interface, and the battle interface did look different.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
So maybe they are putting a little more work under the hood than you would think.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Because Final Fantasy VII and VIII on PC were pretty much ports with just a few extra things.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So, we'll see.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Who likes fashion?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I like Project Runway.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
One day you're in, and one day you're out.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I'm sure we're all familiar with Louis Vuitton, right?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Is that the one that makes the handbags that all the middle-aged ladies are standing outside in a line?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Yeah.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Well, they've actually recruited a new model to show off the 2016 Spring Summer.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And it's me! It's me, you guys! I'm so flattered to be modeling bags.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So, the individual chosen by Nicolas Gasquere, I think it's Gasquere is the name, is Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Lightning is the new model for Louis Vuitton.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:54.000
This choice seems about four years out of date, but Lightning's cool. Why Lightning? That's such a weird choice.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Because apparently she is a hero, and they thought that she was perfect to show off the clothes.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And this isn't just reusing pictures of her with the clothes overlaid.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000
This is a collaboration with Square Enix's Visual Works studio.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
So, Square Enix is actually putting resources-

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
No Moreau was in on this.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Wow. So, I mean, granted, they're being paid by Louis Vuitton for it, but they're actually using resources to create these custom ads or whatever.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
There's like video and everything of her walking around in the clothes and posing in attack poses with her purse.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Is this in Japan only? Because I don't-

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
They put this out on their social media, like all of it.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Target audiences don't seem to overlap, like the kind of ladies I would see playing Final Fantasy XIII and the ladies I would see lining up outside of Louis Vuitton's store aren't usually the same.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Again, sure, of course there's some people that are into both, but not enough to spend money.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:05.000
It's not like this is the first time, because apparently they had a couple of characters modeling for Prada, and Square Enix worked with Rowan, the Japanese brand.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
So, I mean, it's neat. I like one of the outfits.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
However you want to spend those advertising dollars, I guess. I mean, might as well. It's better than burning them. I mean, sure.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Admittedly, I do think it's cool, and maybe, you know, even though I said, oh, but they don't overlap, maybe that's the whole effing point, is that maybe the idea is to try and, you know,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
here we are talking about Louis Vuitton on a video game podcast. I mean, when does that ever happen?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So, maybe the dollars were well spent to get their name out there with an audience.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
No, it's not well spent. Let's think about it. I mean, are our listeners going, oh my god, he mentioned Louis Vuitton. I'm gonna go buy a Louis Vuitton bag.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
No one fucking cares! It just doesn't make any sense. We're just pointing out that that's a really dumb way to advertise that.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I disagree.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Go ahead, because then I have a comment.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Because if you think about it now, with, you know, for all of us who were gamers when we were younger, now we are old enough that we, some of the lady gamers who've grown up are the target audience.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:12.000
You know, I could, in theory, go out and afford a Louis Vuitton bag. I could. I would not buy it, but I could.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And I think that it's sort of more taking a character that embodies an ideal and then applying that ideal as a branding point.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:31.000
That, you know, here we have a woman who is very petite, very pretty, but still a strong character, and they want to tie that in with their brand.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:41.000
So, I understand it from the marketing point of view. It actually is a neat gimmick. It's the same thing as Toyota using Hatsune Miku. So, not that big of a deal.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I don't get that one either, but whatever. I mean, if that's what they want to do, then that's what they can try.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
The big thing? People are talking about it, and that's what they want.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
But talking about something doesn't mean I'm going to go buy it.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
It doesn't matter. It's still publicity.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I was going to say, if you want a Louis Vuitton bag, just go to certain street vendors in the back alleys of New York City and you'll get one real cheap.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
L.A. too.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It's not legit. But the whole thing is, is that...

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
It says Louis Vuitton on it.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Us right now. We are right now proving the point of their marketing campaign. Not a single one of us in this room is going to buy one, but we're talking about it.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:27.000
That argument can be made that all this fuckery that Comcast does with their shitty service is actually good advertisement because we're talking about them.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:35.000
That doesn't make any sense. I understand that there's no such thing as bad advertisement, but it doesn't sell anything.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I get where you're coming from, but I actually think she's right because...

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Who is it that said this? Was it Paula Abdul or somebody that said, even if they're talking bad about you, they're still talking about you.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.000
And it's like, okay, how is Kim Kardashian famous? That whole thing. How is Kim Kardashian famous?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Oh, look at that ass clown Trump. I mean, the whole... He spews shit every time his numbers start to take a dip.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And what happens after that? Up goes numbers.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And you can get a toupee in the back alleys in New York City as well.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It doesn't change the fact that he's a shit spewing ass clown, you know, but it's proof right there.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Bonz006 in chat says Dunkin Donuts uses Domo. Is that true? That's kind of rad. I like Dunkin Donuts and Domo.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Let's just pick random company that use random Japanese icon.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:39.000
How about this though, Loki? I remember a time when if you were into video games, you were a nerd and it was the outcast and it was that part of society.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Now, the ultra suave fashionable handbags are going to video game characters.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And, you know, whether it helps or not or whatever, I still think that's kind of like... It's like a victory in a way.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000
It's like video games are mainstream with audiences we ever thought it would crack through to. Does that make sense?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.000
No. No, it doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry. It's because you make this choice to advertise this way.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
It doesn't mean it's like all of a sudden breakthroughs have been made in society.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Oh my god, we're accepted now. It's a choice. It's like if they use Friskies and Nancat or something like that.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
It just wouldn't fucking make any sense. At least that has a cat.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Wait, but Friskies did do that iPad thing for cats? What the fuck was that? Is your cat really going to know?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Alright, forget it. Forget it. I'm all out of evens. I can do nothing but can't right now.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
So, we're going to move on to the next story. Everybody's had their say. Next story.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:58.000
So, Valve, of course, they come out to actually talk about the issues that they were having regarding basically some cashing problems that were causing people to be able to see the account information of other people.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:08.000
During the whole holiday sale. And I guess in regards to this, they were doing something. They had an outside company that was helping them fight against some DDoS attacks.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:17.000
And they made a change to their cashing system that unfortunately caused some people to see the information on the accounts of other people.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And this included just some basic information. Their address and email address that they had associated with PayPal.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Last couple digits of the credit card number and that type of thing.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:45.000
But, of course, they were saying, though, that this didn't necessarily include the full credit card numbers, user passwords, or anything like that.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000
They didn't allow anything to be changed with this. They just saw your purchase history and that type of stuff.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Well, you missed it last week, Loki, because I had a Loki-level rant about what happened with the whole Steam thing.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:06.000
And at the end of the day, I was kind of throwing out there, isn't this in some ways worse than a credit card breach with somebody's private information out there?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Because some of us are very protective about that information.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So, I'm not going to rehash, because obviously things have changed with this announcement and so forth.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So, I've been getting some questions about, well, where's your head at now that Steam has finally replied to this?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And for one, there is a part of me that's like, well, it did take them a while to do it.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:32.000
But, I'm trying to be mindful, it was the holidays, it's realistic, nobody was in the office, and this was a vendor issue.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
At the end of the day, we can talk about the reasons why and all that stuff until we're blue in the face.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I'm glad Steam finally admitted something happened. I feel they explained it pretty well.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I mean, what happened, whether we agree with it or not.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
My question is, what are they going to basically do from here?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
I really would like to see how they can kind of prevent this from happening again.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And I understand, okay, well, if they're using this vendor or whatever and the person made a mistake there, mistakes happen, maybe there's not a lot that can be done.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But my throwback to that would be, why are you showing full addresses and this credit card information and all this in the first place?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Like, maybe Steam needs to evaluate what they're actually showing, the pages that they're generating in the first place.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
If they don't have a need to show the customer the full address and all that stuff, then don't show it.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Because I know every time I buy a game, I see my address and name. Do I need that?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And to be fair, I'm a little ignorant when it comes to business law and all that.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:40.000
So if there is a law that says they have to show that before I can run my card or something, then okay, I guess we've hit a wall.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
But if they only need to show, like, my zip code, I would prefer that.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Because I also know when I buy games on the Wii U, they don't show my full address, they only ever ask for my zip code.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So I kind of feel like maybe that, and so you kind of ask, well, Rob, what would you like to see done?

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:05.000
That's what I would like to see done is, why is the content of those pages, why do we have so many people exposed to this?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
The ability to edit my address should be a page I access extremely infinitely.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Yeah, I don't think that they need that on there. I mean, it's not that way through other, you know, if I'm purchasing on PlayStation Network or purchasing Xbox Live, I don't ever have to do that.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Yeah, I feel like I don't see that when I purchase on the other networks.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:31.000
So, yeah, but at least I'm glad they fessed up, there's something going on, and, you know, Steam will get my trust back.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I bought two games today, so I guess we're already back there.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:44.000
But I just, you know, I'm glad they are going to try to figure out who all's information was exposed and figure out, you know, what they're going to do.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I guess for the most part, you were probably seeing people's information in another country, so maybe there wasn't a whole lot you could do.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:01.000
But I just, I hope they'll offer credit monitoring or something to those affected people if they choose to do it.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Well, I don't know if they should do that, because it's really only two digits of the credit card number. I mean, that's nothing.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I have a feeling what's going to happen is that they're going to say, hey, because your information was exposed, we're going to offer you an apology package, you know, click here to redeem.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:32.000
And it'll be a copy of, what, Portal 2 and maybe some other Valve goodies. But in order to accept it, you're going to have to agree, you're going to basically electronically sign a clause that you won't participate in a class action lawsuit.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:41.000
I also, by the way, back to having a couple of the numbers being exposed, I wouldn't be too worried about that, because I do believe that the first four numbers have a credit card number just to identify the vendor.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I think it's always last four they show, though. But yeah, but anyway, I mean, like, and I talked about this last week, actually, the credit end of it, I'm kind of like, your credit vendors are there to help protect you from that kind of stuff.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I'm actually not even as worried about that as the whole name and address thing. But I've calmed down a little bit from where we were at last week. I do feel like we're able to move forward from this.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I just, my suggestion to Steam would be, please evaluate, do you need to be showing addresses? Why are you generating all this information on the page?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:24.000
If there's a legal reason to do it, then okay, I guess we're stuck. But I don't, again, I don't recall seeing my full address when I buy on Wii U or when I buy on PlayStation Network or Xbox One.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
So maybe Steam needs to adopt a similar policy. That would be where I'd like to see things move forward.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Anyway, JohnnyB7990 in chat says, I'd like to know what they will do also. I bought a few games over the winter sale.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Well, did you buy on Christmas morning? Because that would be the time that you would be worried if you were on the store when this was going on.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:54.000
So hopefully not. I hope none of our people got affected by that. My fingers are crossed for you guys.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000
And hopefully if your information was shown, it was shown to somebody who had no idea what to do with it.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Hopefully another honest person who said, you know, I probably shouldn't be looking at this and close the window. Hopefully.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Well, there was some like I read when it first came out, like there was a guy that had that happen. And that's kind of how the whole thing got kind of rolling is they saw that information.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:20.000
They actually contacted the guy. They said, hey, I saw your information. Just wanted to let you know what's going on.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Huh. Interesting. I wonder how that guy responded. Interesting.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase reward.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:40.000
All right. Well, moving on. Speaking of stuff going on on Steam, you know, they have this whole holiday sale that I think finishes at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Right. And they they did it a little different this time. They just had I may have bought Rocket League.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And that's OK. That's a good choice. We should play sometime. It's fun. They just had kind of like a big bucket of sales.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.000
They didn't really do the whole like hourly daily. They just kind of were like, everything's on sale. Go.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:04.000
It was kind of a lazy sale, but I think we're all OK with it because it was pretty easy to understand how the sale worked this year.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:13.000
You didn't have to be like, all right, buy the game when it's on a daily or a flash sale, but don't buy it if it's not on the like that kind of those rules were not really a part of it this time anyway.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000
But apparently there was a whole nother thing going on that people haven't really picked up on for the most part.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But thank you to gaming blogs. We're learning about it.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Apparently, the North Pole Noir Web comic that was unveiled through the different trading cards that you could get during the sale.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:38.000
There is actually a type of ARG that these cards are exposing. There's a whole Reddit even dedicated to this.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
It's the Reddit steam sale detectives. And I guess people are finding some crazy stuff about this ARG.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:54.000
So I guess there was a hidden password prompt in the steam store. And to make this visible, you would do like you type search and then you get a field that pops up.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And if you do this on the Hitman Codename 47 page and type a big long stream and hit enter, you get a dialog box that is something you put in the URL.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I mean, it's totally one of those ARG like it's really hard to figure out. And I don't think they've figured out the answer to the whole thing yet.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And who knows if Valve is going to say anything about it. Like, you know, I doubt that Half-Life 3 is at the end of it, but there could be something interesting.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Also, there was an achievement, I think, on some Valve designers profile that said something about ARG.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.000
So people are wondering if there isn't a hidden Steam badge or a Steam achievement tied to the ARG.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:41.000
But, since the sale is over at 10am tomorrow morning, who knows if anybody is going to get it. Or maybe the ARG will continue. We'll see.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Alright, moving on. DarkSakura.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Well, this is something that could be done in the previous Fallout games, but Fallout 4 made it really freaking difficult.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:34:01.000
That you could actually beat Fallout 4 without killing anybody. Or at least without you being the one that did the killing.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:11.000
And it almost broke the game because they really programmed it in to where you sort of have to go around, you know, killing people here and there and fighting certain enemies.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:23.000
But, this one guy pretty much went through it trying to get other people to do his dirty work for him. The guy's name is Kyle Hinckley.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And he basically beat Fallout 4 with zero kills in survival mode. By, you know, bumping up his pacifist stats and whatnot.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And then talking to other people and trying to charm them into doing the killing and many many many resets.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:49.000
But he also found certain mechanics in the game, how some characters were tied to the others.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:59.000
And how if your minions do kills for you, it counts as your kill. So he had to really be careful with it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And have basically talk other people into doing the killing or get different things to happen.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000
And it was pretty neat. The article's a good read. But the thing that I like is just how it goes into the mechanics of the game.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And how, you know, the game makers expect certain things to happen and when you don't do things exactly the way that they've programmed it into the game.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Or you found ways to circumvent it. It's sort of like the world doesn't know what to do.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:32.000
It's pretty interesting. I mean, lots of reloading and reloading and reloading. But he pulled it off, so kudos.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.000
It's interesting. I see this happen a lot in games that people take a bit of a pacifist approach.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I know we were talking before the show. It isn't really pacifist because he's having somebody else do the killing. But, you know, technicalities.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
He's sort of doing the purple man version.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Yeah, I see this happen in MMOs a lot. Especially when I was doing Hoard House.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:04.000
We'd always be talking about, oh, this player got from 0 to 60 without ever killing another character because they picked herbs to get the whole way there.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Because the crafting in the game gives you experience and all that stuff. So it's interesting how people will take these alternative approaches in games.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Make jewelry for social progression and profit.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Step one, pacifism. Step two, question mark. Step three, profit.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:33.000
One other thing that I do want to mention is that there was another one about someone going through and killing everybody in, I think, Fallout New Vegas.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And about how that kind of broke some of the mechanics, too, and left you with permanently immortal NPCs.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:49.000
See, this is how we know that Undertale is taking over gaming because you've got people taking the pacifism approach and people taking the genocide approach in other games.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Alright, in all seriousness, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and video games that are coming out to a store near you.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Although I expect it's probably still going to be a little empty this week, even though we do have folks getting back to work this week.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I don't know if we're going to have a very busy release calendar, but we'll start with Loki in the US.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Not a thing.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Not a thing.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Not a thing. Not a thing for a few weeks, actually.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
For a few weeks. I seem to remember we've had some-

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
January's pretty light, and it's been even worse the last few years, so yeah.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Well, didn't we get, like, wasn't Lightning Returns a January release a few years ago?

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
It was, yeah.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Borderlands had something in January at one point, didn't they?

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Borderlands, yeah. I think Borderlands 2, wasn't it? I could be wrong.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
No, Borderlands 2 was not. That wasn't so there. I don't think it was Borderlands. It wasn't Borderlands. It was, um...

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
There was something that came out, though, similar to that.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Yeah.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Maybe once in a while we'll have that random huge January, like, spend your gift card on me release,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
but it seems like we're not really getting that this year here in the States.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
They've delayed things far into 2016.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Well, going over to Japan, honestly, I see a very similar story.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Whenever I look at the consoles, I don't see anything as far as the living room console goes.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And even for the Vita, there's nothing out until January 14th, and that is true for the 3DS as well.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
It's an empty week in Japan. Happy New Year. Play the games you got.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Dark Soccer, anything in the UK?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Nope.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
This is a dry week for games.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Jack and shit.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000
This is a very dry week for games. Well, things will pick up again in Japan at least next week.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I don't know about the other regions, but this is usually the time of year where there's not much to say in this segment.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
So let's get back into some news. Loki.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Alright, so as we've been talking about a lot of delays, you know, I want to say that the Vive was delayed not too long ago,

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:46.000
and now we have the Oculus Touch, the gamepad, or virtually all the handheld motion controllers that are going to be coming out with the Rift,

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:56.000
are coming out now until the second half of 2016, and saying that they need more time to make it even more comfortable, reliable, and natural.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
So it could be a while.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And then along with that, though, you're going to get your launch game or packing game.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
They're going to be including the Oculus Rift not only will you be getting...

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000
they aren't supposed to be coming with the Xbox One controllers, but you're also going to be getting a game called Lucky's Tale,

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
which is kind of a cute little platformer game.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.000
And that'll be something that's coming out whenever the Oculus decides to make its way out.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Now Bobby's in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying that the Touch was always coming out for holidays 2016.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
This isn't a delay, it's just a reiteration, I guess.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Why do they need to reiterate?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000
For all you guys that were eager, just a reminder.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Wait.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
It's interesting.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Alright, I don't know.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Well hopefully...

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
To hopefully make you forget about the fact that you came out and said,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
oh yeah, I know what he says is going to be around this prize, but it's going to be a little bit more.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Hopefully games such as Lucky's Tale and the other games they put out again,

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
will make it worth it.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Alright, let's talk about SNK Playmore.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And this is, again, another story that involves Steam.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I feel like we have a ton of Steam stories tonight, but I guess that's where the news is at this week.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Well, SNK Playmore has actually been talking about how their Steam ports are helping the company out

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
and getting them back into making new games.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Back in November, SNK Playmore actually put out a statement saying that they're going to move away from the Pochi slot business

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
and go back into traditional game development.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And that's, of course, we love SNK Playmore for things like Fatal Fury, Samurai Showdown, and all that.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
So they're going to get back into that a little bit.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
And there was an interview recently with Famitsu.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.000
And in that interview, Yutaka Noguchi, who's the chief of the gaming division,

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:58.000
said that PC ports like the King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition help them back towards game development.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.000
And, of course, having the international recognition helps, too.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Even as of now, this is a quote, we're better known as a game company than as a Pochi slot company.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000
People still talk about us as a game company when we say our name.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So, that's all from the Famitsu interview.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So, interesting that the PC releases here in the States of those games kind of help them, I guess, show there's a market for it and the sales.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000
So, a lesson learned here. Konami, you should release your games on Steam, more of them.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Actually, they have been, though. I want to say the Castlevania, like the 3D Castlevania games are there on Steam.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Konami, you want to make some money? Well, actually, no, they're not going to make money this way because they have to license everything.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
But, imagine releasing the DDR games as PC versions.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Well, they did. A long time ago.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I know they had DDR PC, but that's not the fucking same thing.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
That gave us the gift of Mr. Spanky as a DLC character.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Yes, I know. That made no fucking sense. But, no, I'm talking about actually releasing the old games as PC downloads.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Make a USB game pad or something like that. That would be pretty cool.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I don't know. I don't know if it would work today. I feel like where we're at with technology is just a way different place.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Yeah, fine. I'll just pirate him instead, I guess.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:22.000
That's what it's going to take. Or, eventually, just get my own arcade cabinet once I have the room and can do that.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
The disposable income to do that.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Alright. Well, let's say an orange riot in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says DDR Infinitoss.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You know, there is that Beatmania 2DX Infinitoss thing that they're trying on PC.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
So, maybe it's not outside the realm of possibility. Who knows?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Well, the most modern DDR games run on PC anyways. They run on PC at the arcade.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Because people have leaked to PC clients.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Well, yeah. And that's how people were playing Beatmania on PC. Being little pirates downloading the ROMs and all that stuff.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Opportunists.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
We'll see.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Alright. Let's travel back to a more classic time.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Let's go back to when game companies were making games and less pachinko machines.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000
It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she says,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Hey. You. Play this. Because it's cool.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And Dark Sakura with a pick tonight that is a little more recent but still falls under that rule of 10 years older or more.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I did it on purpose.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And when I saw the game you picked, I was like, Oh my god. I remember talking about this game on the OLR to go edition.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And it's not exactly 10 years because technically, actually it is because the Japanese release was 2005.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Alright, Dark Sakura. What is the classic game of the week? Get ready for it, people. You guys are going to go, Oh my god. It's 10 years of all that.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Electroplankton.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And the reason why I picked Electroplankton in particular is because it was among the first releases in the US in 2006.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:18.000
It came out on January 9th, 2006 in the US. It had already been out in Japan in 2005.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:26.000
But Electroplankton, and there's really not a whole lot to say about it except it has one of the longest katakana names I have ever seen in my life.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Like Erakuto Parenkutom.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:40.000
So, anyway, Electroplankton is a kind of a participation game, I should say.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:48.000
It is an interactive music video game. And you have two versions of play. You have performance and audience.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And in performance mode, you basically tap on the little plankton or work with a plankton with the stylus and the touch screen and the microphone.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And then it lets you put down where you can play music with the plankton.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Audiences, basically, you just let them sing to you. The plankton make the music.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:19.000
You can't interact with them like you can in performance mode. But it's like a demo, kinda, so you can hear them make music.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Can we listen to it for a minute, Rob?

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Sure, of course. Let me try it.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And of course it stopped right as you said that. It's going in between stages.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Well, we'll get to the next stage and then we'll listen to it a little bit.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
But the thing that I liked about it is that the music was just really peaceful for the most part.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Here you go. This is like the plankton are swimming around like these little leaves, I don't know, in like a...

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Boy, every time we stop to listen to the music, it's a very non...

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
It's very relaxing, though.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.000
It's very, like, I could see Enya singing along to this.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:08.000
More like a little bit of ambience. But yeah, you're basically playing the music with your plankton.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Now, this game was developed by NT0, which also the game really only has the director's name directly on the packaging, which is Toshio Iwai.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:37.000
And this was a decision made by Satoru Iwata because basically Iwai created the game alone.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:48.000
The developers also had considered putting in a save function, but they didn't put it in because they wanted this to be something that you enjoy when you enjoy it.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.000
It has to be in the moment and more visceral than that.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So they were thinking that if you put in a save function, instead of it becoming a moment of enjoyment, it's going to become a tool.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:12.000
And that would also require more flash ROM storage, but they ended up dedicating that to the voice files for Vol Voice and RecRec.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:23.000
The game did make its first public appearance at the Game Developers Conference, and then later the 2005 E3, which we were there for, remember?

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I do.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I remember standing in line and playing the demo.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:39.000
It actually was released, like I said, on January 9th, 2006 in the US with kind of a limited sale outlet.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
It was online retailers and Nintendo World Store in New York City.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And some retailers had an option to get it. Like, remember Electronics Boutique EB?

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000
They had it in Canada, and it was released in Europe on July 7th, 2006.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000
They were going to do an Australian release, but apparently they didn't have enough room in the schedule.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000
It was censored out of Australia. The electroplank didn't look like little penises, so Australia censored it. Kidding.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Anyway, so on July 6th, 2009, Nintendo re-released this part of the DSiWare.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.000
And the instruments were available to buy separately for 200 Nintendo points each.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And then there were the different characters. There was Tracey, or Trappy, Hanenbon, Nanocarp, and Beatniss came out on July 11th.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And then Rugwreck and Lumi Loop came out on July 22nd. All the characters had various individual releases.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:50.000
And then in North America, all 10 of the electroplank didn't came out in November 2009.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:59.000
So basically, it got an 8 out of 10 from Joystick, and Nintendo Power gave it an 8.5 out of 10.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000
So it got really decent ratings, but one of the biggest complaints was the lack of the saving.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
You know, you could play your tunes, but there was no real way to save it.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.000
So the only way you could do that would be just to have some type of external recording device.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Or, you know, now I'm sure there's more ways of doing it, but when it came out, there wasn't really a way.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:29.000
In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, by the way, there was a stage called Hanenbo that was based on the Hanenbo feature.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
So, that's it.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:40.000
There it is, your classic game of the week. Electroplankton! Celebrating 10 years. Just long enough to be a classic game.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I do also want to mention that EY has done a number of different music-related games.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:54.000
He did Otoki for Famicom Disk. It's a music shoot-em-up.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Sound Fantasy, that was an unreleased game for Super Famicom. He also did that SimTunes, which is for PC.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Tenorion, which is a digital music instrument. And then Daigasso Band Brothers.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I don't think that he designed it, but it was another one that was sort of related for the Nintendo DS.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Alright, there it is. Electroplankton, your classic game of the week.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000
And I wonder how many times Dark Soccer is going to do that to us this year in 2016.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Remind us how old we are with these 10-year-old choices of games.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I'm going to drill that in.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Is that our first DS classic game of the week? I feel like it is.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
For the Nintendo DS. I feel like it is.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
It might be.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Just think, it's going to be a matter of time before Xbox 360 games are eligible. Blows my mind.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Yeah.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Wow. Alright. Maybe the chatters will get their wish of a Halo game when 360 games become eligible. We'll see.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Alright. All joking aside, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, we have more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid fire news.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
The FUGO Question of the Week. We're going to talk a little bit about Rise of the Tomb Raider.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:12.000
We'll talk about Just Cause 3 and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with our first episode of 2016 for January 3rd of 2016.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Episode number 626. And thank you guys who are here live listening to our show.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Thank you guys who listen to us on the podcast feed as well. We appreciate that.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.000
But I do know that going on live right now as well is the whole awesome games done quick marathon.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Which, you know, that always happens around the first or second week of January.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And they basically speed run games for a good cause.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:59.000
And through their Twitch feed and donation, they are raising money for, I believe it's Prevent Cancer Foundation is who they're raising money for this time.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And yeah, I think that's great and it's a fun thing to watch.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Kind of the different exploits in some games that are out there that help people beat it really quick.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So, DarkSakura, weren't you saying you and Dan were watching a little bit of that earlier today?

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:20.000
We were watching the Rayman Legends bit, which made me think of I want to be the guy.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
And then Dan was watching Kirby when I left.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Which he wanted to watch some of the Mario ones tonight.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:34.000
But yeah, I was actually a little surprised. I didn't expect it to start this week, but I guess there it goes.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Yeah, there it is. So, that'll be continuing. I think it's calendared through Saturday, although sometimes they do the kind of encore and it goes on even longer.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
And I thought it was interesting. I was looking at the calendar games they plan on doing.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
They actually have an indie block that's happening for about 24 hours of it is all dedicated to indie games.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:58.000
So, I thought that was really cool. And you have classics and new stuff. There's a really big range in there of games.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
So, very cool to see that.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Apparently, SHA100Matt in our chat over at live.voggenetwork.com says Notch dropped in and donated $8,000.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:16.000
And he does that too. Ever since he sold off Minecraft, he dips in once in a while to donate to these fundraisers.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So, let's see. Dartetsuya says Super Mario 64 just wrapped up.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I would imagine some of you guys have the video open in one window and you're listening to us and that's okay.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:31.000
I know some people listen to us while they play MMOs and stuff and that's fine. It's a radio show.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.000
We don't have video for a reason. We try to be accessible to those that for whatever reason don't have access to the video.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Some of you listen in the car. Some of you listen at work. So, it works. That's why it's Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Let's see. On a different note here in chat, JohnnyB7990 says Glad to be here for the first 2016 episode live.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I need to come here more often. Usually listen on Stitcher but live is always fun.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Well, thanks for being here. I appreciate that.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Yeah, live is a little more fun because then you can have an impact on the show and have your voices read.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Don't get us wrong. We appreciate all the listeners being on the podcast.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:12.000
We try to have other ways for you guys to interact too via the Fugu Question of the Week or through the email bag.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000
So, even if you can't be here live on Sunday night for whatever reason, there's always that.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:26.000
But, yeah, very different when you're here live because then you can kind of talk to other people about what's going on live on the show and the topics that we talk about.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000
In fact, we're going to get right back into some more topics right now with our rapid fire news. We'll start with Loki.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Alright, so there's a game going through Kickstarter right now called Slipstream and it looks very much like Outrun.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:49.000
So, they're only looking for $6,000 but the visuals are pretty much straight up art 90s Outrun type racing game.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
So, it's pretty awesome. And they even have a demo that you can play on PC.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000
And it's supposed to have 30 tracks and 4 cars and 8 original songs. So, go check it out.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Slipstream. Now, you may remember that they offered this, like, exclusive Amiibos for the whole Skylanders, their brand new Skylanders game with the turbocharged.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Well, now you don't need to necessarily buy the game to get those Amiibo figures. They will be sold separately at GameStop.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Hey, I got some good news. I saw them on the shelf at Toys R Us yesterday. GameStop may be having them some particular day, but Toys R Us, I don't know if they broke street or what happened, but I almost bought them at Toys R Us.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:45.000
But then I was like, I don't know. They were a little expensive. They wanted like $25 because it was really like two figures.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
It's like the Bowser and the plane, so I was like, eh, I gotta draw the line somewhere.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Now, do they unlock figures for Mario Maker?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
No, I think they function as normal Bowser and Donkey Kong Amiibos.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Oh, that's fucking lame.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.000
I don't think they do anything special. Except, here they have a switch, so you can actually switch them between Skylanders and Amiibo.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I don't know how that all works, but apparently there's some type of switch.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:21.000
So, at least that's what Shane was telling me, because again, I didn't buy them because I was like, eh, $25, that's kind of above the most I'm willing to pay for an Amiibo.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Exactly. But yeah, you can go check those out if that's something you're interested in.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:35.000
This is kind of cool. More characters or skins coming to Super Mario Maker, unfortunately still for only the 8-bit version of the game, or that skin.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:43.000
This time, Excitebike, and then you've got the Excitebike guy, and Birdo are coming, so you can check those out.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Actually, right now, because they're available on the 31st of December.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I got them both in Mario Maker, actually, since you bring this up.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And I like Birdo, because now you played levels to unlock these characters, right?

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.000
The Excitebike level was jank. I did not like it at all.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:09.000
If it's supposed to be Excitebike, it's not. It's like the conveyor belts and springs. I did not like that level at all.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:16.000
But the Birdo one was basically World 1-1 in Mario 2, done for Mario 1.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And so that was kind of fun, to play that. They called it NES Remix, but it had nothing to do with NES Remix.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
So yeah, it was kind of fun.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I think, one of the things I kind of miss from the Mario 3, and I think I know why they haven't done any other ones.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Although I really think they should. Remember how they used to have the actual slanted ground, where you can slide on it and stuff like that?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Yeah.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I really wish they'd bring that back.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:50.000
You never know! They've been slowly rolling out these random features in Mario Maker, like the checkpoints showed up after the fact.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:58.000
In Splatoon, they were supporting for a good six months after release, or so. Probably even longer. So you never know. Mario Maker may still have some of that stuff.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I tried going back and playing a little bit last week, I think. There's still not a whole lot there, and I'm not really motivated to make any more levels right now.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
We'll see.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Alright, well if you aren't playing Mario Maker on the Wii U, maybe you don't have a Wii U, you could try and play a different version of Mario Maker on the PC.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000
But you better hurry up and get it, because Nintendo's legal department is probably-

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
It's already on the PC, already on the internet. It's gonna be there forever.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Yeah, I know. It's there forever. But you can take a look at Super Mario Remaker. It's actually fan-made, and it's something that you can run on the PC.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:43.000
And there's a demo of it available now, which I think only has the 8-bit modes. It doesn't have Mario 3 or Mario World or any of that.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:55.000
But definitely they want to do a browsable level search system as they're adding to it. There's also your own costumes, and even in the little preview they have Homestar Runner as a costume.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:05.000
So obviously, crossing all these lines of copyright and so forth. But yeah, I'm pretty sure Nintendo will be siccing their legal team on it.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Apparently plenty of people have told this guy, and he's kind of sick of hearing it.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:21.000
But unfortunately, that's just the reality, is that Nintendo is making some good money off Super Mario Maker right now, so they probably don't want to see somebody outdo them on the PC.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:33.000
But hey, you know what? For what it's worth, I think it's really cool. And maybe Nintendo should talk to this guy about doing something for the official game, because he's clearly putting things in there that players want.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Like, what else was it? Oh, the slopes are in this game. Like, you were talking about the slopes in Mario 3? They're in this game.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Cool.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Yeah, it has some things that the regular game does not.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Let's talk about the Shovel Knight amiibo, because the Shovel Knight amiibo apparently went up for pre-order, but it was an error.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:58.000
And people were wondering, oh, does this mean the supply is short? What happened? Well, Shovel Knight amiibo went up for pre-order on Best Buy and Amazon.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Yacht Club Games actually came out and said they weren't taken down due to stock issues, but they shouldn't have been listed in the first place, saying,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:17.000
quote, the Best Buy Amazon pre-orders were not taken down due to stock issues, but because they should not have been listed for pre-order in the first place, stock should hopefully be plentiful at release, and refresh shipments will continue arriving frequently.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Luckily, I got in there while it was still open for pre-order, so I grabbed myself a Shovel Knight amiibo. I'm excited about that.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Because I like Shovel Knight. I think it's kind of weird that they're locking, because I think co-op mode is locked behind the amiibo.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Yeah.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That's a bit much to me. I don't know. All right.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I mentioned a minute ago about Splatoon still getting support all this time after its release, and the latest update on Splatoon, I think we've heard this before, is that January is going to be the last month of DLC.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:58.000
However, in a Famitsu interview, the producer of Splatoon, Hisashi Nogami, and the co-directors of the game, actually elaborated on what will happen in Splatoon in 2016.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:12.000
So, substantial updates, things like weapon, gear, stages, that all wraps up this month. However, balancing will continue, and Splatfest will continue to carry on with no end date as of yet.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I imagine even those will end at some point, but we're talking whenever the inevitable sequel comes out, because let's be real, this game's done well enough, there's going to be a sequel, or whenever we move into the next phase of the NX.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Interesting other comment in the interview is that they say it's difficult for players to remember which weapons are best suited for each individual stage. There's already so many.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Adding even more would exacerbate the situation. This is why they're dropping off DLC in January.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And probably these guys want to move on to make other games, including Splatoon 2 or whatever else may be in store on the NX or otherwise.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com stating, I'm glad no more DLC. It's good to have a game that's final with no more DLC.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:05.000
You know what though, I gotta say, kudos. As much as I had my issues with Splatoon in online mode, it narrowly missed my top three.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Loki guessing it as my number one game earlier in the show was a really good guess. I thought it had a tremendous level of support post-release, and I think that's really cool.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:29.000
By the way, on a note with Splatoon before I turn it over to DarkSakura, I did notice over on our forums over at live.vognetwork.com that Dark Tetsuya, and I think it was Kaijuto, are actually trying to put together a little Splat League.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:35.000
So if you want to get in and play some Splatfest with some other VoG participants, I think that's a fabulous idea.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Visit our forums over at vognetwork.com and get in touch with Dark Tetsuya and let them know you would like to be on that team and meet up for some online gaming. I think that would be fun.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:54.000
All right, and TigerCloud pointing out that Awesome Games Done Quick did the speedrun of the single player mode. That's right, that was earlier today, right?

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Splatoon is still very much in the limelight all these months after its release. You can't say that about a lot of games.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
All right, let's move on. DarkSakura.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:11.000
For folks who are still playing Killer Instinct, Tusk has been announced. We will be having Tusk before too long.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And they actually did address a request to have Idol and Gargos. They said that Idol is tough because, well, he had Satterlegs, a giant club, and only had two moves.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
And is really cheap. But hey, Tusk. That's cool.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Also, for Dissidia, there is going to be Ramza from Final Fantasy Tactics coming, quote, soon.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:49.000
It was teased in November but is going to be joining the cast pretty soon, they said.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Looks like they're aiming for a character every two months.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:59.000
And then there's going to be a Street Fighter V live action prologue, supposed to be coming in March.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:14.000
It looks like there's going to be the Street Fighter Resurrection, a live action mini-series, that's going to outline what Street Fighter V is going to be going on.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
It's the same team behind Street Fighter Assassin's Fist.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So there you go.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Alright. I don't think I ever talked about it on the show but I played a little bit of Street Fighter V while it was in the beta.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I'm looking forward to picking up the full game. It was fun when I got to play with it.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Alright, let's now get into the FUGL question of the week.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus community and you slam those words together and you get FUGL.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000
This week, in honor of Awesome Games Done Quick, because we know a lot of you have your eyes on that right now,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
we wanted to know, is there a game that you like to speedrun?

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Have you ever played a game with the goal of completing it as fast as possible and do you have any notable speedrunning achievements?

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000
So let's start over on Facebook with Fabrice A who says,

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I once held the world record on Sega Rally Championship for Sega Saturn.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I was really proud of myself at the time. I do want to hold a Sonic Marathon for charity.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
That's pretty cool.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.000
We don't have many world champions that listen to Orange Lounge Radio, current or former.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:32.000
SSG100Matt says, I haven't really speedrun anything myself,

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.000
but my mother has been speedrunning Super Mario Brothers on and off since the game came out on the NES.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.000
She doesn't have any records or anything but she's able to beat the game faster than I am able to.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:48.000
She didn't even know that speedrunning was an actual thing until I told her about it a few years ago.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000
That's pretty epic. I think you should get your mom involved with Awesome Games Done Quick.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I think they'd love that.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Although I know they probably have a crew that already does Super Mario Brothers probably like disturbingly fast.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I think it's always fun to watch the different generations get involved.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Retertainment on Facebook says, no.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
The only kind of game I can think of where I actively try to do things as fast as possible is racing games,

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
since that's the point. Fair enough, it is the point in a racing game.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
But interesting that racing games are also involved in Awesome Games Done Quick.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
They were doing a race on Mario Kart earlier,

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:27.000
so sometimes it's still about knowing all those shortcuts on Rainbow Road

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
to just get an insane time and all the little cheats and so forth.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Flaco Jones on Facebook says, when I was a kid it was Contra.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
As I mentioned on the show before, and he has talked about this on a previous episode,

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I would record my gameplay by running the Nintendo through the VCR and was clocking in 20 minute runs.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Being such a fan of Games Done Quick has inspired me to informally run some of my current favorite games,

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:58.000
most notably Journey and P.T., the latter of which can be a real pain during the super random final section of the game.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Hitstun over on Facebook says, I keep coming back to Super Mario 64 because it's awesomely broken.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.000
The 16 star route has plenty of fun glitches and shortcuts and finishes the game in under half an hour.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000
It's a great game for learning the basics of speedrunning.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Unless you know how to do the big jump and get up to the roof early.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
You have to elaborate.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.000
There's a particular wall jump in Super Mario 64 that will get you up to the roof early.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Oh wow. I'm sure that's something we're probably going to see in this unless it's banned for whatever reason.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Let's see, Degenerate Johnny says, I don't usually speedrun games because it breaks the story for me.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.000
However, I'm an intervention worthy achievement or trophy whore.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:57.000
So when Blizzard places an achievement for beating each chapter in Diablo 3 in less than an hour, I was up for the challenge.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000
I was able to beat the campaign pre-ROS, the expansion, in 3 hours and 23 minutes.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Now that I'm thinking about it, I might do a full ROS speedrun in hardcore mode. Good luck to you.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:14.000
And on Facebook, Haseo Sumeragawa says, I used to be able to beat Ocarina of Time in 12 hours.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Well, main game anyway was with two hours shy of the world record, but that's the only one I've really tried.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.000
That's still pretty impressive, I gotta say, so good on you for that.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Going over to our Google Plus page over at Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:38.000
We have one answer over there from Tech2030 who says, I haven't attempted any, but I've always been interested in speedrunning Metroid.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.000
The Super Metroid race is the best part of any games done quick marathon.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:50.000
And I'm sure they are going to once again do their save the animals and what do they call it?

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Leave them behind.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Fuck the animals.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Fuck the animals. Well, then you don't want to actually fuck the animals, but anyway.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Which is funny because if you only play the next game, the animals are all alive and they help you.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
That is true, so we know which ending is canon anyway.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.000
But doesn't save the animals always win? It'll probably win again, let's be real.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I thought last year these did fuck the animals.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.000
No, I don't think they did. They save the animals one every year.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get back into some other gaming news. Thank you guys for your responses.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Actually, quickly before I go back to news, anybody in here have a speedrunning thing of note they want to say?

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I can't really think of anything. I think the closest I've done, Mario Brothers 2, I have tried to do that as fast as possible.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:41.000
But I would imagine the fastest way to do it is by using Toad and I really can't play with Toad.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
You can princess over everything.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.000
That's, you know, and I can do princess. I can play with princess, but I don't think I know all the shortcuts and things yet.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Because I imagine in the last level there has to be ways you can shortcut over the walls and stuff.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
There's got to be things I'm not thinking of yet.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:02.000
But as far as running through to the warp zones and all that, that's probably a game I've sat down and said I'm going to beat this as fast as possible.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I'm honestly not a super big fan of speedruns myself, of doing them.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:14.000
But sometimes I'll find, when I'm playing a game, I'll find little shortcuts for myself just to get past annoying things.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:23.000
You know, like, for example in Dragon Age I've found cliffs I can jump down and get to where I want to go.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000
It's kind of hard when you have a free roaming game like that, but yeah.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Loki, anything you've tried to speedrun on?

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
No, not really.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Not big on the speed?

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Unless you count speedrunning or seeing how fast I can get people to disconnect from me from multiplayer games before Grand Theft Auto IV because I'm beating their ass so bad.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:46.000
In which case, I do hold some pretty high records for that, but other than that, nope.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.000
That's only Grand Theft Auto IV. That certainly doesn't transfer over the Grand Theft Auto V, but IV I was king.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Alright, let's get back to some other gaming news, Loki.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I would totally go back to IV, too. I really do want to. Maybe I should pick that up on PS3.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Anyways, speaking of games and multiplayer, one of the games I thought was pretty awesome, Just Cause 2.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:12.000
They had this multiplayer mod that was just fucking nuts on PC.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:22.000
It allowed up to a thousand players at one time, if not more, playing together on one map in a game that was basically just single player.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
And they're doing it again.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Just Cause 3 multiplayer. They haven't put out any sort of release date or anything like that or an ETA, but the mod team is working on it.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000
They had some early footage they showed kind of displaying some of the racing that they did and everything.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
I think it's going to be awesome.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.000
If it's anything like Just Cause 2 multiplayer was, it's a complete mess.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.000
It's just chaos, but it's fun chaos, and I can't wait to try it out.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Hopefully on a more powerful PC they can actually probably run that game.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Well, thanks modders for making that available, right?

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:12.000
And seriously, if this mod team can optimize the game enough to have multiple people running around in it, could the developer maybe shorten the load time some? Maybe?

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Maybe.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Alright, let's talk about a game that, you know, I don't think we've really talked about enough when it comes to 2015 games.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
And I finally picked up my copy of this game, and I will play it in the next couple weeks.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Cause I've heard nothing but great things about Rise of the Tomb Raider.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:38.000
And of course Rise of the Tomb Raider was an Xbox One exclusive, and so it kind of limited the number of people who I think were able to play that game.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.000
But, some folks have been waiting for the inevitable PC release or even the Playstation 4 release.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Well, I got nothing on the Playstation 4, but apparently Rise of the Tomb Raider due for the PC in January, and that's according to the Steam listing.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
How many times are we going to bring up Steam on the night show?

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Square Enix not confirmed the date yet, however they did mention back in July that PC and Windows 10 editions, which I think that's kind of the same thing, but that's what they said, would be early 2016, and the PS4 version would be late 2016.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:20.000
So apparently, January would be early 2016, and it's after the holiday period that I'm sure Microsoft wanted that exclusive arrangement for the Xbox One for.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:30.000
So, there you go. There is a Steam page up, and it shows everything there for Rise of the Tomb Raider, all the marketing text, so we'll see.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.000
We'll see if this shows up closer to the end of the month, and I'm sure a lot of people will be checking that out.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:41.000
I've heard a lot of really great things about that game. I will check that out hopefully in the next week, if not the next two weeks.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vognetware.com, echoing Rise of the Tomb Raiders. Good stuff.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Alright, let's go on, DarkSakura.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Oh, yeah. Well, you want to talk about shitty? It's not getting paid. You know, it's even more shitty? Not getting paid on Christmas.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:09.000
So, basically, that's what happened with the employees who worked for Firefall developer Red5.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
They found a letter instead.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Hi, team. I regret to inform you that Red5 currently does not have the funds necessary to meet our payroll scheduled for today, Friday, December 25th.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Due to this, there will not be payroll paid this week. Red5 and The9, our parent company, is currently working to resolve this during the holidays as soon as possible.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:36.000
We are hopeful we'll be able to resolve this and update the team immediately.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:48.000
And it was confirmed, they actually, Red5 did promise to pay, but there's no notice on if they actually have by now.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:57.000
So, let's hope so, but that probably means that Red5 is pretty much going to be in the red.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000
SSG100MaddenChat says, what a bunch of grinches.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Well, if you can't pay, you can't pay, but even so, you should have like some sort of credit to pull from or some other.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Yeah. This doesn't seem legal. Is Red5 here in the States or are they overseas?

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
They're in Oklahoma, I think.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:23.000
That just, I mean, if you leave a company, don't they have to pay you within like 48 hours or something?

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
It seems very strange that they can just be like, oops, payroll doesn't happen today.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.000
I don't know if they were left with any other, I'd have to check the laws on that one, but I mean.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I mean, if there's no money, there's no money, I suppose.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
It's a contract regardless.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.000
You know, at will or nothing, they give you something that says you will be paid on X and X.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Right.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
You know, in the amount of whatever your pay rate is.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Right.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:54.000
So, that could technically be a massive breach of contract. So, regardless.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Well, that is a really cruddy way to have, especially on the holidays.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000
I mean, I realize some timings can't be controlled, but it's still kind of one of those.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:10.000
You got to look at the executive management at Red 5 and be like, how did you let it get into this situation in the first place?

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:17.000
So, well, our thoughts with the frontline employees there who are most affected by this.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:21.000
And Dungeon Busters in chat saying, yeah, Firefall's development has been pretty rocky.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Hopefully, they find a way through it. Hopefully, a miracle financer or something.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000
That comment from live.vognetwork.com.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:33.000
And Dark Soccer, I believe you are actually about to step out on us here too?

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I am. Probably in a minute.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Because you've got work things going on, so.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Yeah, I'm just, got to be up, you know, stupidly dirt early in the morning.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I understand. I understand. Well, did you, before you head out, do you want to give us your final thought for the night?

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:58.000
It's going to get, it's slightly political, but I'm just going to say this.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:07.000
For everyone who complains about things going on in the country, if you don't get out there and put some effort into it, they will never change.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:14.000
For all the people who say, X person can't win, if you don't vote, they won't win. That's it.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:21.000
There is an old adage that's not even political. It's just, if I always do what I've always done, I'm always going to get the same result. So.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Well, then there's also Einstein, you know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Is that how we keep doing this show for 14 years?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Well, we haven't expected different results. So, you know, if we suddenly expect, oh, next week's show will be famous.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Yeah, we're going to be famous. We're going to make money.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Yeah, that shit ain't happening. So, but anyway, um, yeah.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Also though, um, probably starting next week is I'm planning on just doing random, um, Twitch streams just for shits.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:00.000
We'll see if that happens, if I can get my headset working. So, cause it's been kind of antsy with my new sound card.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:09.000
All right. Good luck to you. I know that's, that's something I want to do more of in 2016, but I said that last year and look how well that went, but I'm in a much better, I'm in a much better place this year than last year.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.000
I would love to do streaming if, you know, my talking in the living room while my wife is doing whatever would annoy her.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:25.000
I, I will say this much for 2016, I do want to get into the streaming things, but my, my, my first priority is getting podcast number two off the ground.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And that's all I'm going to say about that for now. All right. Uh, let's move on with some more stories.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Have a good night, Dark Sakura. And, uh, thank you as always for being here and good luck with work in the morning.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:42.000
We'll see you next, uh, in two Sundays. Holy shit. You suck for going to Disneyland, but at the same time, bring me back a pin or something. Okay.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:53.000
All right. Yay. Thank you. And give hugs for Victoria and all that. I will. All right. All right. Uh, let's get into some other, uh, stories. Loki.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:02.000
This is extremely exciting. Fantasy Star Online 2 is finally coming to the West as anime. As an anime. You wooed too early.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
No, I wooed anyway.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Yes. Unfortunately, even though they do have an English version of the game available in Asian regions, they're not bringing it over here, but, uh, they will be putting out the anime. So there's that to look forward to.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:29.000
You know, we had to cut some stories for time last week. And one of them was actually about how PlayStation, uh, or PlayStation Fantasy Star Online 2 is coming out for the PlayStation 4 in Japan.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:42.000
And, uh, it was going to be an opportunity for me to say, what the fucking hell, Sega? Why do you keep withholding this shit from the States? And now this is even getting worse. Okay, so we're getting the anime now? And we still can't get the game?

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:48.000
They probably will bring the game out over here, because what the hell is Sega releasing for console, aside from, like, a Sonic game?

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:59.000
It seems like if they've already got an English version of the game available, that would be an easy, that'd be pretty easy. Just bring it over.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Well, uh, speaking of Sonic games, uh, there very well could be a Sonic game on the way for this year. I mean, I guess that seems kind of obvious, but, uh, Crush 40, uh, music that, uh, appears in different Sonic games, and, you know, Crush 40 goes right along with the Sonic series.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Uh, and, uh, they were talking on Facebook, and actually said something in a comment on Facebook, which then got deleted, so you kind of have to wonder, did they say too much?

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Well, thanks to the internet, the comment's been preserved for all the time, and the comment was,

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:44.000
We are planning a few performances for 2016 to commemorate the anniversary of Sonic. We might participate in writing new songs for the anniversary game. Stay tuned.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Well, then the post was deleted, but it made a lot of people go, what's the anniversary game? After all, this year is Sonic's 25th anniversary, uh, so maybe there's something special, maybe-

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Hopefully good.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I feel like if they say an anniversary game, it's going to be like Sonic 1 with new HD graphics. It's the same game you played before.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Well, it's, like, anniversary almost seems like Sonic Generations at that point, I think.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.000
I guess that's true.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:16.000
I mean, that was kind of as close to, like, a new-meets-old type of thing, but, I don't know.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Yeah.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Hopefully something good.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I guess we will see what comes of it, but I'm sure- Will a Sonic game be released this year? Of course it will. It's Sega. There's gonna be something.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:35.000
SSJ100MattInChat says, it's going to be Sonic 25th anniversary edition with friends. Oh, yay, I can play-

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.000
With even more friends.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:45.000
With even more friends. I can now replay Sonic 1 as all of Sonic's shitty friends, and maybe it'll be on the Wii U and there'll be amiibo for all these characters.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Amiibo for the shitty friends.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:52.000
There is a Sonic amiibo, so why not all the shitty friends as well? We'll see. Anyway.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Let's get to the mailbag.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Or not, because nobody sent us an email this week, but usually you would send your emails to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.000
I'm not even supposed to be here today. I'm leaving.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.000
That's why I said bye to you before the mailbag, because I'm like, there's no email.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Yeah, whatever.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I may as well say something while I'm still here waiting for my computer to shut down.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Alright, so no emails. You should berate the listeners into sending emails.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Do it!

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Participate.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Do the thing. Make it happen.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:28.000
At orangeloungeradio.com if you want to.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Rob, we need an email that's just called Fuckin' Do It.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
And it redirects to the mailbag.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000
No, because then it would just be like Shia LaBeouf memes coming through. Do it!

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:43.000
No, I wasn't even listening to- you know, I've never actually seen one of those, except for like little shitty screen captures that are on Tumblr.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Of course, if it's a meme, of course it found its way to Tumblr at some point.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
I love the sticker for my computer.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Yes, it's very rainbowy. I like it.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
I have the Rainbow Apple sticker on my Mac.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Alright, look. We need to get to the FUs of the week.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
I have an FU.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Well, then I better cue the music.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Starting off with the one we already said goodbye to.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Hey. FU. That's it.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Oh, that's it? F me? Oh.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:28.000
No, um, FU to feeling like I'm tired, but having endless brain energy.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:32.000
So, FU to a busy mind. With no outlet.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Alright. Loki?

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:40.000
You know, it's weird. I had a really specific FU driving over here today, but I don't remember what it is now.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Because I got too angry at the old people driving really slow in front of me.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:47.000
But there was something else, and I'm trying to think what it was.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Something in general that was bothering me.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:54.000
But I don't remember, so it's going to have to wait for another week instead.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
We're just going to have to say FU to old people who are driving really fucking slow on the road.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.000
And, um, uh, yeah. I guess that's it.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
And, um, yeah.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Alright, um, FU to the fact that my holiday break seemed so short this year.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
And that's probably because I've been spoiled in years past.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Because my old company would give us the time off between...

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Well, they didn't give it to us, but we pretty much always took the time between Christmas and New Year's off.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And I wasn't able to do that this year.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And don't get me wrong, I love the new job, and I don't mind having to work the extra time.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.000
But, yeah, it just kind of shut the...

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I don't know, it just feels weird having only had a few days off here during this holiday period.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
But I know, you know, cry me a river.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I know some of you out there are working retail on holidays and so forth.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
So, I probably have nowhere to complain.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
But, just, you know, I kind of got used to it over the past few years.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
And that changed this past year.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000
So, I'm kind of like, oh gosh, I'm so busy at work this next week.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000
It's going to be crazy.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000
And I'm sure a lot of people are in that mindset, too, coming back from the holidays.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.000
So, FU in advance to the craziness that is sure to be next week.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.000
All one word.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Let's get to Loki.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Alright, so there was, I guess, a new lightning talk by Failoverflow.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:24.000
It's a hacking team that was responsible for some of the hacks on PlayStation 3.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Now, during the 32nd Chaos Communication Congress, they were showing off Linux on a PlayStation 4.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:41.000
And, you know, basically what they're developing right now is it's a kind of a spinoff of FreeBSD.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:51.000
And it's, they're basically trying to utilize all of the hardware on the PlayStation 4 to even maybe possibly run actual PC games on it.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Like modern PC games and maybe even use it like as a Steam box.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:03.000
So, they're not sharing like the, you know, exploits on how to hack the PlayStation 4 yet.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:12.000
But they're saying that it's so easy to do that basically people will bring their own exploits and they'll have this Linux version that'll be available.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.000
But it has been shown that they can do that, so they're working on Linux kernel patches.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And they're not releasing the exploits, but they're saying certain other people will.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Hmm. It'll hit the internet any day now and then it'll be impossible to take off.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:35.000
This is very interesting considering the PlayStation 3's controversy where you could have Linux on it and then they patched it out.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.000
But some people never grabbed that patch, so are running Linux on PlayStation 3s to this day.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000
So, interesting.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Interesting.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:46.000
And Dar Tetsuya in chat says, I don't think there's been a Sony system yet that they haven't hacked.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Tigerclaw gives us a link here and I thought for some reason this was in our show world tonight, but it's not.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.000
But it's right along the same vein as the Linux on PlayStation 4, but that is the Windows 95 running on a 3DS.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Did you see that one?

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Yeah.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Somebody was running Windows 95 on a 3DS.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:07.000
I mean, it wasn't, I don't think I actually saw a desktop come up, but it was kind of checking the boot table and all this stuff.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
It was kind of weird to see.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:17.000
But I mean, the technology in a handheld device kind of exceeds what we had in computers back in the mid-90s.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Oh yeah, got it.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:23.000
So, I mean, think about what's in an iPhone or an Android device. I mean, that's...

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.000
They had multi-core processors and stuff running it, like, you know, over a gigahertz and everything.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.000
And, you know, at one time we had a processor running at 20 megahertz.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000
16 megahertz was considered lightning fast.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.000
And, you know, with a whopping 4 gigs of RAM, or 1 gig of RAM.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Yeah, or 512k.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
512k, yeah. So, I mean...

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I feel like Windows 95 ran on my 486 100 megahertz machine, which was blazing fast at the time.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.000
And it's like, that's nothing compared to what you carry around in your pocket these days.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
It's crazy how...

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Got a Pentium.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Think about it. And the desktops you have now are going to be nothing compared to 20 years from now.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.000
That's what growing up has taught you.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Not even 20 years. Probably like 5 years, 10 years.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Probably. And so, yeah, it wasn't much, but it's just kind of that novelty of an entire PC operating system running on a DS like that.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Wouldn't it be crazy though? Because they're saying it's so close to a PC that they're getting 3D acceleration working.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:27.000
And they're just having some issues with certain things, but they're...

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
I mean, they could possibly get this. They're actually running PC games on it.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
I mean, that's kind of crazy.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I mean, that... There you go. Cheap Steam Box. $400.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Alright. Well, last but not least on our show world tonight.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Kind of a sadder story as I'm sure many of you heard in this past week that Lemmy from Motorhead passed away suddenly this past week.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:58.000
And I mean suddenly the poor guy was diagnosed with cancer and then passed away from it like two days later.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.000
It was crazy. So a good old hearty fuck cancer for all of that.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.000
But why would I bring this up on a video game podcast?

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Well, because it has kind of had talk of the Koopa Kooplings circle around again.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:20.000
And this is actually from Nintendo product manager Dave Brooks who mentioned that music has always been a big part of my life.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
I've been a DJ for years and have been a music collector for even longer.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
When I first saw the group of seven Kooplings, music was on my mind.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:34.000
The hairstyle on one of them reminded me of Ludwig von Beethoven for some reason and Ludwig von Koopa was born.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Next was the one with the glasses. That has to be Roy Koopa in homage to Roy Orbison who almost always wore glasses.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Then Wendy O Koopa or Wendy O Williams and Iggy Koopa or Iggy Pop.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:54.000
One looked like a Loudmouth so he was Morton Koopa Jr. from the Loudmouth talk show host Morton Downey Jr.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And then there was Larry. There's no real world equivalent. He's not Larry Mullen Jr. from U2 or Larry King. He just looked like a Larry.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:06.000
But that brings us to Lemmy. In addition to being a great name, it's perfect for a video game character.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:12.000
This Koopling struck me as being the kind of character who would do his own thing no matter what anyone else thought.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000
I think it was those crazy eyes. Lemmy Koopa was in the crew.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:26.000
So that being posted by Nintendo product manager Dave Brooks in honor of Lemmy passing away this past week.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
So rest in peace.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.000
What's kind of sad is Dark Soccer and I before the show were kind of going over that list.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:42.000
It was like, wow, all of these people are just because you know Wendy O Williams and that's different than the Wendy Williams that's on TV. How you doing?

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Wendy O Williams was a punk rock and she tragically committed suicide several years ago.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:52.000
So like all those people in that list, many of them have passed. Iggy Pop I know is still alive.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:56.000
But yeah, very, very tragic. So there you go.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:02.000
William Ritterface in chat says, I remember hearing somewhere that he knew for a while and that he played through it. Interesting.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:06.000
And Tiger Claw points out and Natalie Cole died as well. Yeah, tragic loss.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:15.000
And although nothing to do with games per se, it does lend to that old adage that these things unfortunately tend to come in threes.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line though if you want to give us a call.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Our Skype is fixed by the way. I talked about this a little bit on Bobby's show, but I guess I didn't get into it here on OLR.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:38.000
But you know, I was bitching and moaning and complaining about Skype not working the past couple weeks because I decided to upgrade to the latest version and it broke and it wouldn't connect.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:42.000
And I tried to revert to old versions and they wouldn't connect.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Well get this you guys, do you know what the fix ended up being for this? All I had to do to fix it?

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And remember, we run Windows XP on the show computer in here and you might be thinking like, isn't that kind of old?

02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:00.000
And the answer is yes, it is kind of old. But I'm very much of the old adage, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:10.000
We've been doing this podcast for 14 years, so XP works with Shoutcast and Audition and everything we need to run the show, so I don't tend to upgrade things.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:18.000
But when Skype always nags you, upgrade me, upgrade me. Inevitably I one day have a moment of weakness and I click yes and I paid for it.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:26.000
So what ended up being the solution? Well I'm sitting here thinking, alright I'm just going to have to do it, I'm going to have to upgrade the damn computer to Windows 7.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:34.000
But then I was, or even possibly 10 if it would run it, I wasn't sure and I was even looking at maybe getting some new parts for the machine to compensate.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:44.000
But it ended up, I did a search on some various forums and I had done this the past couple weeks but I tried again this past week and somebody said,

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:53.000
do you have Internet Explorer 8 installed on your machine because the latest version of Skype requires Internet Explorer 8 or newer?

02:32:53.000 --> 02:33:06.000
And sure enough, on this computer I only had Internet Explorer 6. Now you might be screaming at me, Rob, why on earth are you using Internet Explorer 6 in the year 2016?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:19.000
And my answer is, I wasn't ever using Internet Explorer. If I have to actually explore the Internet, we use Firefox here on the show computer, I use Chrome on my personal computer, I don't really use Internet Explorer ever.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:30.000
So why would I upgrade it to a newer version? It would be nonsense. But that ended up being it. I was able to find a website that had, because I didn't want to upgrade all the way to,

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:37.000
because actually in XP it wouldn't upgrade. I would try to go into the upgrade thing and it would be like, sorry, support for Windows XP has ended.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:50.000
So finally I went into an archive site that has old versions of operating stuff and I actually found a copy of Internet Explorer 8 and I downloaded it and installed it and Skype worked right away.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:34:05.000
That's all what it was. William Murderface in chat says, it's also not getting security updates anymore. Yeah, I know all that about XP, but again, I'm pretty sure this machine can run Windows 7.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:15.000
I just have to make sure it doesn't screw things up. You know what I mean? Again, this works right now. I don't want to shut down the whole show because I have a botched upgrade.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:21.000
So I'm just nervous about that kind of stuff. Anyway, we are getting a call on the line, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:30.000
The first caller of 2016. Woohoo! Our first call. What's up, DJ Rom? Not much, Rom. How are you?

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:46.000
I am doing well. I mean, it's that whole like, oh bummer, I gotta go back to work tomorrow. But you know, I like my job and I can't sit around the house all day doing nothing because believe it or not, that's kind of what I did Friday and Saturday and that got really old.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Well, you were at home relaxing. I was at work, so you know, fun stuff.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:58.000
That's why I try not to complain too much because I know there are people out there working hard on the holidays. So how was that? How'd that go for you?

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Pretty good, but then again, I really have nothing bad to say about my job because I absolutely love it.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Good. I think it's important to love your job. So at least hopefully more people are starting out 2016 enjoying it and if you're not enjoying what you're doing, you can always try and look for something better. There's nothing wrong with trying. So my advice.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:21.000
But anyway, what did you call in about tonight?

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:28.000
I want to talk about something cool that happened at my job yesterday, but before I get into that, I just also want to say happy birthday, big boy.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Thank you. It's not actually my birthday, but it's my birthday show.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
But close enough.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Close enough. It was my half birthday the day after Christmas, so that's close enough, right?

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Even better.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Well, thank you for that. I appreciate that. What else is on your mind?

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:47.000
We had another charity event at my job yesterday.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Nice. For what this time?

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Hearthstone.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Oh, get out. That's pretty cool. What's going on with that?

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Well, it was held by another esports group called Esports Hero Inc. and we set up the theater area of our store for about 32 players, but it got jam-packed pretty quickly, so pretty much we were raising funds for Extra Life and as well as playing that awesome card game, Hearthstone.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.000
That's really cool. So it was another Extra Life fundraiser.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Yeah, pretty much.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Cool. How long did it go for? Was it like an all-day, all-night thing or was it just during the business hours?

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:46.000
It started early in the evening. This was around 6, but they changed the plan, so it started around 4.30, 5 o'clock, and it went for the next four hours, but unfortunately I wasn't able to stay for the whole thing because I was already working towards the end of my shift.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Now, does your store have like a Twitch channel or some type? I mean, maybe you have an internal thing with your company where people can watch all this stuff go down?

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:14.000
I don't think we have an official Twitch channel, but all the Twitch streams are run by other people, so like Esports Hero, they have their own Twitch stream that they want, and when we did our first Extra Life charity, that was held by Extra Life NYC.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:22.000
It was their Twitch stream, and then when other people came in, we patched it over to each of their streams so they could have fun with that too.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Got it. Well, that makes sense that the people who are sponsoring it run it on their own stream.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Hey, can I ask you a completely random question about your work?

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Sure.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Because you know, in the past couple weeks, I finally went out to the damn movies, which I haven't done in like over a year. So they had this commercial and it was so interesting.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Because that's what they do now, they show commercials at the movie theater, because as if paying 13 bucks to see a movie wasn't enough.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:56.000
And so they have this commercial where all the employees of the Microsoft store start, like they walk down in front of the Apple store and they start singing Christmas carols or something.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:02.000
And then there's, I don't know, there's all these little kids there too who I don't think are employees, but they were probably all paid anyway.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:09.000
But yeah, so I just, and I was like, ooh, can I see Rama? Is Rama going to be in this? Or were they all paid actors? I don't even know.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:12.000
But did you, do you know what commercial I'm talking about?

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Yes, and I just want you to know, I'm getting very giddy about this because this is a fun story I like to tell if I have the time.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Well, we got time tonight. Our phones aren't exactly lighting up, so please, if you want. I know telling about work stories can sometimes be sensitive, but whatever you feel comfortable with.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:35.000
It's cool. So just so everybody knows, I work at the Microsoft flagship store on Fifth Avenue. I'm a flagship services advisor.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:45.000
So pretty much you bring your computer in. I try to fix it in 15 minutes. If not, it goes in the back and we fix it and you come back in two days fixed and you'd be happy and you go about your way.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:39:01.000
So here's the thing. In the beginning of, I believe, November, middle of November, email went out to all of the Microsoft stores, flagship, full line and specialty, especially like the little mall kiosks you see.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:09.000
And they were asking for all the employees to submit a 30 second demo of them singing their favorite Christmas song.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:18.000
So I decided not to do it because I'm tone deaf and if you don't believe me, ask Mako-chan. She can verify this.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Fair enough.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:38.000
So that Sunday, they filmed the commercial in our store. I was nowhere to be seen because I was in back of house fixing computers, even though I've had people message me saying they swore up and down they saw me in the commercial somewhere. I'm just like, no, I was back of house.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.000
No, that was another tall black guy that you saw the commercial somewhere.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:59.000
That was probably my friend's stretch. But they did film the commercial in the first floor. Now, later in the day, word traveled up towards the back that they were going up to the Apple store and we're like, why aren't you going to the Apple store?

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:19.000
We didn't even know that part was happening. So pretty much what you saw in that commercial were all Apple employees from the Fifth Avenue flagship and people wearing the Microsoft shirts. Those are employees from not just the New York City stores. Those are from people from all over the country that they were flown in for this commercial.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Oh, so they were in fact, they were employees, not actors, but they were the cream of the crop singers.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Yes.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Oh, interesting. And probably half the people listening have no idea what we're talking about, but maybe, I don't know, I assume if I saw it before Star Wars, a lot of the other people probably saw it too.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I saw it too. I also shared the commercial on my personal Facebook and I've had people share it to me asking if I've seen this. I'm just like, y'all are a day late and a dollar short.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Now, I will say this, I wasn't convinced I saw you, but I was definitely looking for you the minute I realized what it was, because it's not very obvious at first what it is, but the minute I realized what it was, I'm like, oh, is Rama in there? Is he singing somewhere?

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:06.000
No, because if I was, I probably would have shouted that all over the place.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:17.000
That's true. That's a good point. I appreciate that. All right, well, I'm glad we could talk commercials and so forth. Thank you for giving us the scoop on that little commercial there, but I thought it was cute. It was a cute little holiday thing.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Yeah, definitely. And when you and Alan get the studio PC up and running for Windows 10 standard, let me know. I can hook y'all up.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Well, I absolutely appreciate that because, yes, that was one other thing. I was like, I don't really want to pay for Windows 7 right now and Windows 10.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Well, I'm just saying, well, we get benefits for working at Microsoft, so I can hook you up with stuff.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:42:06.000
I appreciate that immensely. I really do. So maybe that'll be something we do in 2016. Who knows? Especially, there's been a lot of demand to incorporate more video into the show. I don't know. We'll see, because having a fancier OS and more oomph in the computer system would allow us to do that. So that is, let's say it's not off the table. We'll see.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Let me just say this real quick. I'm going to get out of here. Brad from Poco which says 10 is free. Here's the thing. If you're already running Windows 7 or Windows 8, the upgrade to 10 is free. If your computer is running XP or Vista, you have to purchase a retail copy to get to 10. That's how it works.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:30.000
I did look into that. I was like, oh, maybe I can upgrade to 10. And I was like, oh, yeah, you can't do it from XP. You can only do it from 7 and 8.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Right. So you have to go from XP to 7 and then from 7 to 10. Either way, you're still paying for a copy of Windows.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:49.000
And when you go from 7 to 10, you pretty much keep everything. Because when I did it on my home computer, I got to admit, it was really easy. And I liked that it would save everything for 30 days and that I had a panic button if I didn't like what it did.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:56.000
But I ultimately ended up keeping it. But it really kept everything the same. But they pretty much tell you, if you go from XP to 7, you're going to lose a lot of stuff.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:59.000
You're going to do a clean installation of everything.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:08.000
That worries me a little bit because if you saw this computer and the way it's held the show together like duct tape for the past 14 years, you would probably cry.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Trust me, trust me. I mean, my beast of a machine that's running Windows 7, I was hesitant for running to upgrade to 10 because I'm like, I don't want to do the upgrade and then find out 20 minutes before my show that nothing's working.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:25.000
And I'd be screaming to the heavens.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:37.000
If I do something like that, and it's a big if, it would probably be like when there's a week with no show. Like in February, although that would be a really bad time because I'm going to be in DC for MAGFest for most of that.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:46.000
But there'll be some other case in 2016 where we won't have a show for a week. Maybe Dark Soccer and Loki will be gone one weekend or something. And that'll probably be the time I choose to upgrade the computer. But we'll see.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000
There you go.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Alright, well buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in another caller too. Thanks so much for calling.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Awesome. Take care, bro.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Alright, you too. Bye.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Bye.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Yeah, Brad from Pod Culture in chat says, yeah, 10 is great. And DarkTacuya says, I'm glad I switched from 8.1 to 10 on my new laptop.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Yeah, that was, I remember now, that was my, a few of the week it was. 10 keeps fucking up my tablet drivers. And the reason, you know, or my touchpad drivers.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:20.000
So, like now whenever I'm moving around and if like I try to right click or click on anything, the cursor fucking jumps all over the place. It's way too sensitive.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:23.000
It's so interesting to me, the opinions on 10. People really love it or they hate it.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:36.000
I just don't like that it keeps updating my shit. Like I had everything perfect and then like it goes and redoes everything. Like the last time I updated it was like I reinstalled Windows and all this shit is broken or back to the way it was again.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Rama's suggesting in chat the latest 8.1 drivers. Maybe you can, I don't know.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Well, I'm on 10, so.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.000
But I think the point is 10 will still recognize the 8 drivers.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.000
No, I understand that. I just have to reinstall everything again or uninstall whatever. Because they keep putting.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
It can't be as bad as these Skype issues I had.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Because they keep installing two sets of drivers for that and it fucks it all up.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:01.000
We got another call coming in, so we got to get to this. But I do want to give you a chance for last minute stories after this. But first we have a call on the line.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Hi, you're on Orange on the Train. Who's this?

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Chugga chugga chugga choo choo!

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Train takes 2016, bitches.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Oh my gosh, I'm so happy we get to start off the new year with you, Jim Sally on the Jim Sally train. What is up, my friend?

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Not too much, man. I got really cold here in the last week.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
You don't say?

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I heard you guys had fucking snow on Christmas Day. In California, Northern California, there was snow on Christmas Day.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:32.000
I went to fucking Tilsonburg, where my wife comes from. No fucking snow.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Actually, when you hear about that, you're probably hearing about Lake Tahoe, which technically is in Northern California, but it's also on top of a mountain.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Down here in SAC, no snow.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:50.000
I think the only time it snowed that I can remember in the last ten years, it looked like Mother Nature just went achoo!

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000
And that was the snow that fell. We don't get...

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Even you see what's going on in Portland right now and all that, we don't get anything like that. That just doesn't happen here in the valley.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:04.000
But we're in a valley, we're at sea level, so it doesn't lend itself to those type of snowstorms.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:10.000
But yeah, when you see White Christmas in Northern California, I think they were showing that because of El Nino.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.000
The East Coast was having a huge heatwave, right?

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:23.000
So not a lot of areas had a White Christmas, but here in California, it actually has been, by our standards, our California standards, really fucking cold.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:31.000
It's been something like 20 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, which I know you're probably laughing at right now, but for us, we're not used to that.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:37.000
When you live here, you get used to the 105 degree Fahrenheit days of heat and all that stuff.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000
You just learn to deal with that, but you never learn to deal with 20 degree cold and all that stuff.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Fuck dude, I live in 8 hours. I live 12 hours north of Buffalo.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:57.000
And when I drove down south, I had my winter tires on, I had my fucking studs in, I was ready for winter and I didn't see a flake of snow.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:03.000
My little girl, my little four-year-old girl, she looked at me when we were halfway home and she said,

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Daddy? I said, yeah, little girl? She said, is Santa Claus mad at me? I said, honey, why would you say that?

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.000
She said, Daddy, he didn't bring any snow for me this year and I just wanted snow.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:21.000
It was fucking, it was heartbreaking, man. It was fucking heartbreaking.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Aw, well, I'm sure there will be plenty of snow. He's just a little late in bringing the snow because he's going to bring a lot of it in February.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I've only got a lot of it now. When I got home, there was a lot of it here. It was so nice to come home.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:36.000
There was a little bit of snow on the ground and the whole family's in the big gigantic Jim Sally truck.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:41.000
And I said, honey, I said, look at that grassy field. And she said, baby, you do it. I said, yes, I'm going to do it.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:45.000
And the little kids say, what's going to happen? And Daddy just starts doing donuts in the cornfield.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Oh, fucking donuts in the cornfield for Christmas.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.000
And by the way, Jim Sally actually has on his Skype icon a picture of him and his children.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:48:00.000
And you guys are just, you guys are so adorable and you look like you're teaching him something or I don't know the way you're kind of posed there.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
So it's this adorable picture.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
I can't even see my own picture.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
It's probably in your Skype setting somewhere.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.000
Oh, dude, that's me. I'm making them snacks. I like to fucking feed them vegetables and shit in the daytime. They're vegetable bowls.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
That's good. Vegetables are healthy.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Yes. By the way, I just want to point this out because SSJ in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, just keep the snow away from MAGFest weekend.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Oh, God, do I agree. I do not want to deal with fucking airport delays. Try to get in and out of Washington, D.C.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:34.000
And I do. Oh, my God. Like I bitched enough at PAX East. Like, don't do that shit to me.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:39.000
I'm kind of paranoid about that for MAGFest, but I'm not going to rent a car in D.C.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:47.000
I will just fucking Lyft or Uber or whatever they use out there to the hotel or fucking ugly bag somebody to pick me up in the snow.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
I just Uber it, man. I'll be done with it.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
You deserve it.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Well, what's on your mind tonight? What do you want to call in about?

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.000
I was going to reveal Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Please. What was Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year?

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:08.000
It's very important for me for everyone to realize that Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year doesn't mean it came out in 2015.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:13.000
It just means it's the game that I enjoyed playing the most in 2015.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.000
That's OK. We all set the rules that work for our lifestyles.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Dark Sakura picked Dragon Age, and she's allowed to do that.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Jim Salley's 2015 game of the year for 2015 is Mass Effect 2.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Mass Effect 2.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:37.000
That should be the game of the year every year. I mean, when P.T. is ineligible.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:43.000
Mass Effect 2, which I believe they gave away on PlayStation Plus a couple months ago.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:49.000
But OK, why Mass Effect 2 now? What would it be about five years after its release?

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:52.000
What made that your 2015 game of the year?

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Well, originally I started I Keep Hearing You and Dark Sakura.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Tatsuya. Talk about it all the time. You know Jamie.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Of course.

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Of course, I never played it on the 360. And sure enough, I had a bunch of Christmas money and there was the trilogy and it was fucking 20 bucks brand new for all three games.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:17.000
I said, ship that to my house. And I had a lot of shit go down this year. I had a lot of shit go down this year in my life.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:25.000
A lot of fucking lonely nights at home. Fucking sometimes I would I would kind of escape in that shepherd reality, you know, I made my little character.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:30.000
And the nice thing, too, if people don't know about the Mass Effect games, like you make one character in game one, that's your fucking character.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Like you carry that bitch through the whole all three games. And I carried her through and we got to Mass Effect 2.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:41.000
And it was mind blowing how many side characters you could have played with you.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.000
And each side character had this fucking really awesome little story.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.000
And you didn't have to do it, but I fucking did every single little side story.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Some of them I got on my side. Some of them didn't like me so much because my chick was a bit of a ruthless bitch.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.000
But hey, that's who she was. You know what I mean? She needed to save the universe.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:07.000
That is such a good point about what makes Mass Effect something that part of the reason why we obsess over it is because you do get so invested in that character.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:15.000
And you're right, that character that you make in Mass Effect 1, you transfer them and all that decisions, if you want, to Mass Effect 2 and then Mass Effect 3.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Some of the customizations of the face might weirdly change between the games.

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:25.000
But for the most part, your character is your character and the decisions you make certainly have a huge impact.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Especially, and I'm trying to keep this spoiler free for a five year old game, but especially some of the decisions you make at the end of Mass Effect 2 have huge consequences for what's going to happen in Mass Effect 3.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Holy shit, it was unbelievable. I will say, when I got to Mass Effect 3, it was a little bit, I don't know, it didn't quite have that fucking pop that Mass Effect 2 had.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Yeah, I love Mass Effect 3 for what it is, but I also, I understand to a point the disappointment where when you're carrying that character from 1, 2, and 3, that the original ending of 3 really hinged on one decision that you made at the very, very, very end.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:09.000
And that's why the extended cut DLC, which hopefully you were able to see...

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Yes, I heard all that.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Okay, good. Because that incorporates much more where you can see the effects of other decisions you made will be incorporated into the ending and that's what made it so much better is that you weren't just seeing one decision, you were seeing all decisions.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Yes, I did get all the extra content, even the online from Mass Effect 2, which is passable. I wouldn't, I don't know.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:39.000
It seems like something they slapped on because they were told that they had to have so many check marks underneath the new options for the next game.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
There wasn't anything.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:52.000
I like the multiplayer, but it's kind of died out now a few years later. There's really not a lot of people playing it anymore and the people who are playing it are uber. They're too extreme, you know, so...

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:55.000
By the time I got to it, yeah, it would have been pretty thin.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Alright, well...

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:06.000
For the year too, so now I got this awesome trilogy copy of Mass Effect 3 sitting on my desk that I'm never going to play again. It's old.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:20.000
So if anyone wants it, send me a fucking Twitter. Send a Twitter to Jim Sally on Twitter or Jim Sally on Facebook or Jim Sally's iPod at gmail.com.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:35.000
And I will put all the names in the ballot and my birthday's at the end of the month and I'll randomly pick a name on my birthday and you'll win an autographed copy of the Mass Effect trilogy for the Xbox 360. I'll autograph it. I'll write whatever you want on it.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I love it.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:42.000
And send it to you. You can enjoy Shepard for all of her goodness too that she had in here, right?

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:49.000
I love it. It's like the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants except it's the Sally Hood of the Mass Effect 3 or Mass Effect trilogy.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:55.000
I think that's great that you're passing the game forward to others who maybe haven't experienced it yet, you know?

02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:02.000
And with Andromeda, a lot more people are going to be talking about Andromeda after E3 this year. So now's a good time to check it out, I suppose.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Alright. Well, Jim Sally, my friend, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but it's always a delight to hear from you. Thanks so much.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Rob, I love you, man. You guys take care, okay? Take care, man. I miss you, buddy.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:17.000
Alright, I miss you too. Have a great 2016. We'll talk to you again.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Later, brother.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Alright, bye.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Alright, I think I am going to go ahead and close up the Skype line now over at our Skype line.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:28.000
If you didn't get through, fill up that mailbag. You heard how sad it was tonight.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Check in with Loki real quick before we wrap up for the night for any last minute news.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:37.000
No.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
I looked hard and nothing.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:46.000
I did have to really kind of scrape the barrel to throw together a show for tonight because it was still technically a holiday week.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:52.000
But as we continue into the next week, we're going to be back in full swing and I think we're going to start getting more and more news.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.000
PAX East, actually no, that's always out this year. It's going to be more like April.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:02.000
So I don't know when the first, maybe Game Developers Conference will come up in a couple months.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
That's when we start to get a little bit of an idea of what's happening.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:11.000
I mean, Game Developers Conference, again, not a trade show and not the big bells and whistles you see at those types of shows.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:16.000
But we have had minor announcements. I believe PlayStation Home was announced at GDC one year.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:21.000
So we may get something from that and I think things are going to start to wrap up as we get back into the game releases and so forth.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Oh, thank you. Everybody in chat is shouting Consumer Electronics Show. Thank you.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:32.000
That is, I often forget about that one because there isn't a huge focus on games per se.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:36.000
But we have had, like Microsoft announced Game Room at Consumer Electronics Show.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:44.000
So we may see more, I know, I know a lot. But still, we may see something, little slivers of things come out of Consumer Electronics Show.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Especially with the VR stuff. We were talking about the beginning of the show, VR and AR.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:52.000
We may get an update on the HoloLens. We may see a little more about that at CES.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:57.000
So that is really soon. I think that's next week, actually, or two weeks.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:05.000
I'd love to go to that one of these days, but I've already got a filling up calendar of expos to go to this next year.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:09.000
So it's going to be pretty crazy, but I'm excited about it.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:12.000
Thank you guys, of course, for being here, as always.

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:17.000
And we will be back in seven days to do this all over again.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:22.000
I'm hoping to book some guests, too, some more indie developers to come on and talk about their games.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:28.000
If you are or you know someone who wants to pitch a product here on Orange Launch Radio, a game that we should be checking out,

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.000
you can feel free to contact me, Rob, at vognetwork.com.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
That's Rob at vognetwork.com.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:43.000
I would prefer to spotlight things that actually have something out there that the listeners can go play and go check out.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
So hopefully your game is to that point.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:49.000
But yeah, I would love to get more developer interviews on here and so forth.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:52.000
So anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.000
Help us spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:05.000
because we can't talk about what they're saying if we aren't hearing the voices.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:10.000
So we want to continue to bring you more voices throughout 2016.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:20.000
If you really can't find anybody to tell, we also do really appreciate five-star reviews on podcasting websites such as iTunes or Stitcher Radio.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Those reviews go a very, very long way.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:28.000
I can't tell you how much, especially on iTunes, the weight of those can really affect how you display on there.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:35.000
So if you've never ranked the show on iTunes, we'd really appreciate you taking two minutes to go write a quick five-star review and say,

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.000
That brings us to the final thoughts for tonight.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Loki, good to have you back. We'll see you next week. Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Yeah, Fallout 4 for 17% off on PlayStation Network, $49.79.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Oh really? I think it's cheaper on Steam right now with Steam sale too.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:55.000
You can probably buy it cheaper, yeah. I don't know.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:02.000
I was looking to see if they sell Need for Speed on there. I was thinking about getting it, but probably not.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:05.000
It's not selling anymore, so definitely no right now.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:11.000
I don't really have a lot of final thoughts as well. I just want to get to playing some more games this week, some more new stuff.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:18.000
I still have Rise of the Tomb Raider I got to check out, Undertale sitting in my Steam library, and I still need to check that out.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Hoping to do some more live streams and play some more games in 2016. Let's make it a great year.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:31.000
Have a good one everybody. Thanks for listening to Orange Launch Radio. Have a great week. We will see you next time for 627. Bye.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:39.000
