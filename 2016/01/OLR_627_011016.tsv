0	17520	This week, 7 Days of Awesome Games Done Quick results in over 1 million dollars raised for
17520	21000	the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Congratulations to the organizers, runners, and thank you
21000	24400	to all the donors. Tonight, ready your shots with this week's VR news and join us for the
24400	27400	show where every gamer has a voice.
27400	35360	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35360	42340	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 627
42340	49640	for this January the 10th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts, coming to you live from Sacramento,
49640	56220	California in Studio N7. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and sadly not
56220	60140	joining me tonight in Studio DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. DarkSakura, if you were listening
60140	66180	to last week's show, her and the husband went to Disneyland to bid a final farewell to some
66180	70580	parts of the park where today is actually, today actually is the last day that they're
70580	74940	going to be open because the construction for Star Wars Land starts I guess tomorrow
74940	80260	or whenever Disney's ready for that. So they are doing one last goodbye to the Bucket of
80260	83580	Meat restaurant and the Petting Zoo and some of those places there. I've been looking at
83580	86900	some pictures on her Facebook and I'm sure she'll be back next week to tell us about
86900	92500	Hyperspace Mountain and any games she might have ran into there because I know they have
92500	97980	some of the old Flynn's Arcade from Electronica they have by Space Mountain now so I'm not
97980	101420	sure if any of that's changed. We'll check in with her because I'm sure her and Dan were
101420	105180	keeping an eye out for that. If there was a Tron pinball machine to be played, you can
105180	110060	guarantee they played it. So we'll be saying hi to her next week. In the meantime, we are
110060	116700	joined in studio by Techmaster Loki! Hello! Who is not sadly at Disneyland. It's not sad,
116700	120220	I don't really care for Disneyland too much. Oh that's right, you're not as big, you never
120220	126140	got into the Disney thing like the rest of us did. You don't like fun. No, I just don't
126140	130580	like roller coasters to be honest. That's right, you were never a big fan of us. I have
130580	137980	a fear of heights and I don't like, I don't like the feeling of like, dying and uh. But
137980	141020	then I could see why you wouldn't want to go to like Magic Mountain or somewhere where
141020	146620	more of the thrill rides are. Well yeah, I mean and even like I, like there was a short
146620	151500	period of time that actually was psyched up and I got myself over my whole like kind of
151500	155420	fear of roller coasters. And I don't actually fear them, like I know personally like that
155420	161820	I'm not, I'm completely safe on them and everything, so like I know that, but my body doesn't know
161820	166780	that and it's just like oh my god oh my god oh my god! And like, like even on stupid shit
166780	173380	like on um, like you have it in over California Adventure or whatever the fuck it is, it's
173380	179300	like that stupid ride that they have it like um, even just like a midway ride or whatever
179300	183180	it's like where you get in the swings or whatever and it goes up a little bit like, like it
183180	187180	spins you around. Oh yeah, it used to be a big orange, I think they changed it, the silly
187180	192300	symphony swings I think it is now. Like even that like, I just like, having like a mild
192300	196140	panic attack with. I can actually see that, so the California Adventure has more of the
196140	199940	thrill stuff, you know, they have the roller coaster that actually goes upside down. Tower
199940	203340	of Terror is not for everybody and if you're not a heights person you're not going to enjoy
203340	205940	that. But I get it, Loki, not every fear is necessarily rational. No, but like there's
205940	210780	seriously the one trip though that I got over it and it was like, you know, big, you know,
210780	214020	big mountain or thunder mountain railroad like over and over and over and over and over
214020	217340	again and then like matter over and over and over and over again and like I was completely
217340	222460	fine with it and stuff. Did you get over it with the help of our friend Xanax or what?
222460	226100	No, like I just went on it like a few times and like I was like oh this isn't that bad
226100	230260	and I had a lot of fun with it and then finally, you know, that was like when I was like a
230260	233560	teenager and stuff and then I came back later as an adult and it's like oh look I'm scared
233560	237900	of it again. It's like what the fuck happened there? So I don't... Will you do the virtual
237900	241040	reality coasters? You know we got a lot of VR news this week. Will you do the coasters
241040	245380	of virtual reality? Or is that going to... No, I'll do those just fine and yeah I still
245380	248820	get that vertigo feeling and stuff but it's not like I'm like oh my goodness I'm going
248820	253940	to die. Because I know it's just a headset I have on. Even though we do not have Dark
253940	257380	Soccer here tonight, we are expected a little later in the show. Alan's going to join us
257380	261260	here in studio. He's wrapping up some stuff for his job. He'll be joining us a little
261260	265420	later to do like a classic game of the week and some of the Jamie stuff in her absence.
265420	271200	But in the meantime we are joined every week by you guys live. We do tape live every Sunday
271200	276620	night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
276620	281140	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, our pal Bobby. You want to talk VR? We're going
281140	284620	to get into that tonight. And Bobby's really been following that VR scene for a very long
284620	288820	time so you know he had some words about the news this week. So check out his show this
288820	293380	week if you missed it live. But if you are listening live of course head on over to our
293380	298340	chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and we do read comments from chat throughout the
298340	302500	night where we can fit them in. And then of course we'll take calls later on on our Skype
302500	308020	line username Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. And actually some folks in
308020	313540	chat were talking about the thrill rides. Dungeon Buster starting us off tonight saying
313540	322060	I love coasters, those spinny rides not so much. And I can kind of see that because I
322060	325500	love coasters. I really do. And I'll even do the Magic Mountain coasters but you know
325500	331740	what I won't do which is weird because I used to do it as a kid but now that I'm an adult
331740	336980	I can't do it is the Gravitron. You know what that is? The fair? I don't know if this is
336980	340780	a national thing. I'm kind of assuming it is but if you don't know what the Gravitron
340780	346340	is it looks like a big spaceship and it spins around really fast so that in the inside basically
346340	352620	you kind of lose gravity. I don't even thinking about it is making me ill. Like the sensation
352620	357500	in that ride. Like it's just I can't do it. So I think there is a big difference between
357500	363500	the spinning and the coasters. It's weird but I can't explain it. I guess the spin of
363500	367740	a loop on the roller coaster is one time and it's not as fast as the Gravitron. So
367740	374660	let's see. Bobby Blackwolf says so Sky wouldn't do mission space at Epcot. Probably not if
374660	378140	that's what it involves is the spinning around thing which I know a lot of space training
378140	383700	is so that would make sense. Don't they have a special version though? Like they have one
383700	388500	side for people that can do it and one side that can't. I'll do the side that can't. That's
388500	393940	how we have to do and I swear it's a video game show but people, theme parks, who doesn't
393940	402700	love theme parks besides Loki? Finding Nemo, my friend that I usually go to Disneyland
402700	407060	with, Lady Victoria, she was on the show like a million years ago. She's claustrophobic
407060	411940	and will not do those subs because even though the sub is not a thrill ride it really goes
411940	415340	around. They're very claustrophobic. Very claustrophobic and you're underwater so it's
415340	420820	not for everybody. So whenever I go to the park with her I have to do that handicap accessible
420820	425580	version of the ride which is basically you go in a little room and they project what
425580	432660	you would be seeing on the wall with the same narration and everything else. I make it sound
432660	438020	really lame but Disneyland has a certain way of making, they use lights and things to really
438020	441800	give you a similar sensation. They do a decent job of it considering you're not actually
441800	445200	going underwater but I always have to do that version of the ride. If they have that
445200	450280	for Mission at Mars I would do that. I can only hope that the version of Hall of Presidents
450280	455600	that I've been seeing has been like the handicap accessible one and like the real one. Abraham
455600	459700	Lincoln comes out as a giant robot and starts attacking people with laser vision. That would
459700	466120	be awesome. Bobby Blackwell says there is a green team side that doesn't do the 2.5G's.
466120	471200	It's more like Star Tours. Star Tours is fine. Star Tours is cake. I love Star Tours. That's
471240	476560	a lot of fun. I hear they enhanced that with something from the new movie so I'm excited
476560	480240	to see that at some point. One of these days I'll get back to Disneyland. It's super expensive
480240	484400	now. Five years ago when you would hear me talk about it on the show all the time, back
484400	489000	when I had an annual pass and I was going every few weeks, it wasn't nearly as expensive
489000	495280	but because of the success of California Adventures Remodel and Cars Land, those passes are really
495280	501180	expensive. A little bit of greed too but I get it. I think in a way they want to price
501180	507340	people out because they don't want the insane crowds for special events that they usually
507340	513180	have. Or they're just saying, how high can we make this before people stop coming? Maybe.
513180	516960	It's a video game show. We could talk about Adventures in the Magic Kingdom on the Nintendo
516960	520340	Entertainment System. Did you ever play that? Adventures in the Magic Kingdom on NES? It
520340	527020	was actually kind of bad. Maybe. I don't remember. It was one of those early Capcom games and
527020	532540	it actually had a replica map of Disneyland that for an 8-bit game is pretty accurate.
532540	539340	But the whole deal is that you go around to these rides, the big rides of the park, the
539340	544140	e-ticket rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, and each one was just basically
544140	550100	mini games. Throwing out the terminology that most people are going to miss. E-ticket means
550100	556640	the big budget rides. The big stuff. The stuff I named. Pirates of the Caribbean. Not like,
556640	561080	I hate to say it because I love the teacups, but the teacups is not an e-ticket ride. That's
561080	570040	kind of a lower budget ride. Anyway. Let's see. Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
570040	573960	Let's see. DarkTetsuya is saying, we could also talk about Kingdom Hearts 3. If we were
573960	578220	talking about Kingdom Hearts 3, then that would also be, I suppose, acceptable to keeping
578220	584120	it Disney related. I guess that's a good point. I'm just sorry. Some of these rides, I can
584120	588360	understand if you're strapped into the roller coaster. Cool. Okay. That makes sense. You're
588360	592360	not going to fall out and stuff. But like, how's anybody not dying on Pirates of the
592360	599980	Caribbean? That's all I have. Alright. Let's see. BobbyBlackWolf in chat
599980	605040	reminding me, Rob made me ride Small World after making him almost puke on the teacups.
605040	610520	Me and Jason. Yeah, I think I do remember it spinning really fast, those teacups though
610520	615120	so we were all in it. Anyway. Alright. Let's get into games. Kickoff topic tonight. So,
615120	620260	I know many of you were watching this past week the awesome Games Done Quick marathon
620260	624480	that happened on Twitch is how most of us were watching it. I know it was also a live
624480	630240	event that they did, I think in DC is where they have it at a hotel out there. And you
630240	636560	know, many people throughout the speedrunning community playing games as fast as they can
636560	640840	for charity. And I don't know about you, Loki, but I find that I've been watching this
640840	645720	more and more with each marathon. And they do, part of what I really have enjoyed about
645720	653660	it is seeing them glitch games that I grew up with. Like Final Fantasy IV was the very
653660	657840	last thing they did last night. And I watched a bit of that run. And there's all these glitches
657840	663360	they did for like duping items and stuff that I just didn't even realize you could do in
663360	668560	the game when I played through it when I was 12. And yeah, I was almost like inspired
668560	672920	in a way by it. I took a game that I thought, well, if I were to speedrun any game, what
672920	676200	would I want to learn how to speedrun? And we actually talked about this a few weeks
676200	679320	on the show. And I think the game I kind of settled on that I want to try to get better
679320	685080	at is Super Mario Brothers 2. Just because that's just a platformer I just loved as a
685080	690600	kid and I still love today, even if I have to play stupid Toad to really be as fast as
690600	695120	possible because Toad can pick the grass just slightly more. But I swear, I swear some
695120	699520	of those worlds, I've seen some of the speedrunners do it. And I swear Princess is better than
699520	703040	Toad at some of the stuff they're trying to do. So we'll see. We'll see. I'm going to
703040	709200	give it a go. Try to work on it. It's hard. It is not as easy as it looks. You have to
709200	715200	really time things perfectly in order to be able to do that. So yeah. Dar Tetsuya in chat
715240	721360	says hey Toad is not stupid. I'm sorry. I can't stand playing him in Mario 2. He feels
721360	729960	so gimp to me in Mario 2. I used to like Toad. The Princess float is so OP. But maybe that's
729960	734640	just what I remember when I was a kid is I would play Luigi and the Princess because
734640	739760	they both kind of floated. Luigi did a different sort of thing but he was really effective.
739760	744480	He can jump higher than anyone and that power jump can really skip entire sections of the
744480	750320	game. Let's see Tech 2030 talking about Awesome Games Done Quick saying my favorite thing
750320	755680	I watched was the Fez speedrun. Very informative. I'm watching a lot more but not live. I've
755680	760160	been binging them as they've been adding them to YouTube all this week. A lot more convenient.
760160	764280	I love binging a bunch of them through my Apple TV so I can watch on the big screen.
764280	768320	Yeah I used the Twitch app on PlayStation 4 and I watched a lot of it on the big screen.
768320	772640	Shane was over last night. We were working on an unrelated thing on his computer and
772640	776160	watching Awesome Games Done Quick a little bit and just watching some of the dupe. I
776160	779640	don't know if you get a chance to watch a lot of that. Loki I know you with the kids
779640	782280	and everything don't always get TV time but did you see anything else?
782280	789840	I didn't really watch any. I do like watching them though. I kind of glanced over the schedule
789840	792240	and I didn't know what I wanted to watch.
792240	795480	Well there was some other stuff I watched too. A little bit of like the Velocity 2X.
795480	798020	They had a whole Indie Games block which I thought was really cool because it's kind
798020	802400	of bringing awareness to maybe games that people may not know about otherwise. I thought
802400	807360	that was pretty cool. Okay here's the crazy part. So Orange Launch Radio started as a
807360	811720	music game show which I'm sure you guys all know. We focused on things like Dance Dance
811720	815520	Revolution was the big one at the time because that's how Loki, Dar Saka and I all met was
815520	818520	at the arcade playing that game. And then we would do things like you know Parappa the
818520	823080	Rappa and all this stuff. So over the years when we were more exclusively music games
823080	828720	this program that allowed you to play DER on your computer showed up and it was called
828720	833720	StepMania was this program. And for the longest time we were kind of sitting here going when
833720	839640	StepMania going to get shut down by Konami because basically it's kind of better than
839640	846560	DDR PC actually turned out. It does more than what DDR even on the PC did. And I'm thinking
846560	851200	StepMania never really got the book thrown at it because I don't think they ever sold
851200	856500	it. But if I'm not mistaken and I'm having to go old age memory here but wasn't in the
856500	862500	groove adapted from StepMania. Yeah it's basically StepMania. And so that's when Konami
862500	867520	got him and that was when In the Groove released on PlayStation 2 is when finally Konami was
867520	871820	like throw the book at him basically. And you know we talked extensively about Kyle
871820	877180	Ward about this almost a year ago now and talked about that whole thing. So the reason
877180	880460	why I bring that up is that obviously what a lot of people were talking about from Awesome
880460	886100	Games Done Quick was this guy that was playing actually was it two of them? That was playing
886100	890580	I didn't get to see the whole thing but that was playing StepMania and was playing some
890580	896980	just really crazy stuff in StepMania that's not meant for actual dancing. Let's be real
896980	903740	it's not meant for DDR because you had stuff where it was like hitting all four arrows
903740	907940	in between mines where you're not even supposed to be standing on the pad. Like there's stuff
907940	914020	you're not going to be able to do with your feet. So it was kind of controversial. Like
914020	919460	some people were very much like what the hell is this? This is really cool because
919460	925500	this guy is you know banging on the keyboard so hard and so fast that the camera is actually
925500	929880	shaking that's you know I guess on the table or whatever like it's just it's just so much
929880	933900	it's intense right if you try to play. We always called it finger finger revolution
933900	939420	and which leads to all the jokes you can imagine. But StepMania is basically finger finger revolution.
939420	944020	And so it goes so fast that you know it's causing things to shake and other people were
944020	950180	like what the hell is this doing in awesome games done quick? It's a game like this you
950180	956140	don't really run quick there's nothing to do but play the song. And you know there's
956140	960940	that technicality that I don't believe this was actually meant to be a speed run it was
960940	965300	more of an exhibition what they were doing with Stepania. But still it was it was so
965300	973260	weird to see like holy crap topic from 10 years ago is all of a sudden new again in
973260	976860	awesome games done quick. But I suppose and there was a part of me that was like I don't
976860	981360	know how I feel about that that's so weird but then I think you know they do a lot of
981360	986160	obscure games during awesome games done quick. I watched them do this game on the Super Nintendo
986160	990980	that was like I don't even know what it was it looked really really garbage and it was
990980	997420	only like six levels long and it was really it was really not a great looking game but
997420	1001100	I was like alright I guess if they can run really obscure stuff like this is StepMania
1001100	1006820	really out of place? Probably not. So I just thought that was that was interesting to observe
1006820	1011220	that whole thing that it was more like it was trending on Facebook right StepMania is
1011220	1014500	like I don't know if you saw on Facebook it was actually in the bar it says here's what's
1014500	1018780	trending on Facebook and like it's like you know dude plays StepMania and it's crazy.
1018780	1023460	And I was just like in a way I'm kind of like I just I don't want to sound hipster
1023460	1025620	but I kind of knew about that six or seven years ago.
1025620	1028740	Well it's a good thing he wasn't playing on the pad because you know as soon as someone
1028740	1033860	starts playing on the pad there's going to be a little kid that runs across so they just
1033860	1035580	that wouldn't have been good for the live stream.
1035580	1040180	Oh my god Dark Tetsuya you you read my mind Lester the Unlikely that was the game I know
1040180	1044480	there was an awful games done quick block yeah that was it and that was the game I saw
1044480	1050400	wow I can't believe you guessed that based off what little I said. Let's see Dungeon
1050400	1055680	Buster says the Crypt of the Necrodancer Coda run was insane. The Lester run was neat it
1055680	1061560	was scheduled super late though not if you're west coast time. Let's see other comments
1061560	1068560	in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. TigerClaws say did you see the Super Metroid two players
1068560	1073520	one controller run that was amazing. I didn't see that I actually missed all the Super Metroid
1073560	1077920	stuff I just wasn't around when it was on I'm sure it'll be on YouTube later and I'll
1077920	1082320	catch it there but two players one controller I know right like you know all those jokes
1082320	1088460	write themselves about that that's pretty crazy but cool so props to Awesome Games Done
1088460	1093620	Quick they raised what like 1.2 million dollars I think for charity and I'm told that it's
1093620	1098920	not as much as they raised last year I think they did 1.5 last year but you know A it's
1098920	1103480	still money for a good cause and B you know the economy is just going to vary year after
1103480	1107720	year and what people can give and just there's so many factors that play into it I still
1107720	1111980	think you know it's only a million dollars I mean that's still an impressive amount of
1111980	1117160	money for and I'm using my quotey fingers here a bunch of gamers to be collecting for
1117160	1122880	a great charity so you know what that's that's 1.2 million dollars well spent fuck cancer
1122880	1127520	right so yeah good on you guys with Awesome Games Done Quick and everybody who donated
1127520	1133720	and all that stuff one more thing before I move on on the step mania Awesome Games
1133720	1137760	Done Quick stuff somebody else is bringing up in the Awesome Games Done Quick there was
1137760	1142920	also the Super Nintendo game Lagoon which is really funny to me that that was in the
1142920	1148760	awful games done quick statement because Lagoon I remember that game vividly from when I was
1148760	1153520	younger and the Super Nintendo was out and that was I really think Lagoon was the first
1153520	1158880	video game I ever rented and it was a game that I rented more than once I actually really
1158880	1165480	enjoyed it but again I was what 12 years old so you forgive a lot of the things that you
1165480	1170680	look back on and are really dopey now you know video games have come a long way and
1170680	1175760	bad translations were just it's something that was part of the charm in the Super Nintendo
1175760	1181680	era you know like Final Fantasy 4 and you spoonie bard you know just some of the some
1181720	1185400	of the funny little things that happen in translation I think were always you know kind
1185400	1189880	of epic and so obviously Lagoon has a lot of those issues but I got to admit as a 12
1189880	1193480	year old I didn't really notice them as much as people do now so it's kind of I don't know
1193480	1198880	it's the whole thing's funny to me for some reason so alright before we get into our gaming
1198880	1203860	week I actually had a second topic to bring up here because I just thought you know it's
1203860	1209400	the beginning of the year here we are 2016 we're past our predictions and all that stuff
1209600	1215600	but there's a lot of gaming anniversaries to be celebrated this year you know we saw
1215600	1220080	as we saw a lot of them last year right Super Mario Brothers turned 30 and we had Super
1220080	1225280	Mario Maker as a result of that right so I would like to present for you right now some
1225280	1231800	anniversaries coming up this year and I'm gonna listen carefully for the pain it's gonna
1231800	1238800	cause you when you go oh my god I'm old oh god I'm so old so let's take a moment to write

1257640	1264040	the original but the 3D one that was you know the multiplayer and all that probably still
1264040	1269280	better than Duke Nukem Forever the best game they probably ever did in that series 20 years
1269680	1276680	old this month I remember playing that game in college in the dorms I'm feeling really
1277600	1284600	old right now February 21st the Legend of Zelda turns 30 30 years old for Zelda which
1287000	1292600	makes sense cause Super Mario turned 30 last year but do you know what turns 20 in February
1292600	1299600	20 years old you ready Pokemon red and green or as it was here in the states blue Pokemon
1302040	1309040	red and blue turn 20 years old in February that broke somebody guess what else turns
1312040	1319040	20 in March Resident Evil Resident Evil came out 20 years ago this year it does feel that
1319040	1326040	old too going from the chat I think Resident Evil out of any of the game series it really
1328080	1335080	needs a tomb raider-esque reboot like something Tech 2030 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
1336080	1343080	says Rob why stop it no because this is what I have to go through every day when somebody
1343080	1348080	tells me about how old they were when something comes out and it's just for fun come on let's
1348080	1355080	see also Tiger Claw in chat says you know what turns 43 in February me well happy early
1356280	1361280	birthday Tiger Claw and the Bobby Black Wolf keeps saying oh that came out when I was 9
1361280	1367080	that came out when I was 9 because you know the 29 joke yes I understand all right let's
1367080	1374080	see oh also celebrating 30 years in May Dragon Quest turns 30 in May which again a game of
1376080	1382080	the NES era makes sense for some reason I was sick thinking Dragon Age I'm like that
1382080	1389080	isn't that old yes I'm a little slow today all right and in June Quake turns 20 20 years
1389080	1395080	old is the original Quake with the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack which made it so cool for
1395080	1402080	kids my age at the teenagers my age when that first came out let's see and then turning
1402080	1406080	25 of course talk about this last week on the show and this no surprise Sonic the Hedgehog
1406080	1413080	is 25 in June I can't wait to see what awesome game they put out to celebrate the 25th anniversary
1413080	1419080	here's one that surprised me do you know what else turns 20 in June 20 years ago the
1419080	1425080	Nintendo 64 and Super Mario 64 20 years old in June and then let's see in September 30
1428080	1434080	years of Castlevania and I don't care anymore about that in October and September
1434080	1440080	30 years of Castlevania and I don't care anymore about that in October 20 years of
1443080	1449080	Tomb Raider doesn't feel 20 years old probably because the new one it almost it feels
1449080	1452080	just like a new series like you don't even remember the old series at least I don't I'd
1452080	1458080	still vaguely I just remember topless Lara mods that's all I remember from the old games
1459080	1465080	slush colored triangles and pyramids in December civilization turns 25 that's one of my
1470080	1474080	favorite civilizations they ever did was the original and I remember going to the computer
1474080	1478080	store that's not even there I think that I think it's like a hairdressing place now not
1478080	1484080	even there that plays or that game is 25 years old all right only a couple more don't turn
1485080	1491080	the show off don't turn show off I've got three more three more here's one for Loki in
1491080	1496080	October command and conquer red alert turns 20 yeah I probably I remember picking that up
1496080	1502080	when it first came all right and two more for you in December the end of the year 20
1504080	1510080	years of Diablo Diablo gonna be 20 years old it it doesn't feel that way it doesn't feel
1514080	1518080	that old until you look at a screenshot of Diablo and then remember oh wow this game
1518080	1524080	really is super old all right one more you ready for this 35 years old 35 the oldest one
1527080	1533080	of the list 35 years of Donkey Kong this year the original oh god does that mean we're in
1533080	1539080	another Donkey Kong game maybe yeah that could be something in store for the Nintendo NX
1539080	1545080	who knows thank god it's a Frogger anniversary year well Konami is not really making games
1545080	1550080	anymore maybe a mobile thing who knows there it is there you go there's I'm sorry to make
1550080	1555080	you guys break down in tears I think tech 2030 has said he will be boycotting next year
1555080	1560080	this week this the episode this week but there you go a little trip down memory lane and
1560080	1564080	we'll probably be bringing up a little more memories of those franchises as we get closer
1564080	1569080	to those anniversaries throughout the year the stuff that gets me and I'm glad none of
1569080	1575080	it was on the list the stuff that gets me is 10 years old or and pretty soon it's gonna
1575080	1580080	be 15 years old because especially next year when we start looking back at games that are
1580080	1584080	15 years old you know what that's gonna mean those are games they're as old as this show
1587080	1593080	because 2017 will be 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio if we make it if I am not killed by
1594080	1598080	an angry mob for the segment we just did on the show so we'll we'll have to hope for that
1598080	1602080	dark tatsuyu in chat suggesting a Frogger pachinko machine for Frogger's anniversary
1602080	1609080	you never know anything anything's possible there let's see also going to a chat over
1609080	1614080	at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says so what you're saying is that everything in
1614080	1619080	the world came out in 1995 no it's uh it's uh 1996 it's 20 years from this year and yeah
1619080	1623080	actually that was a really big year for games I remember that was the year I went off to
1623080	1628080	college and those those are pretty big year for games so not surprised all a lot of this
1628080	1635080	stuff is is coming up on that anniversary so all right um let's get into how was your
1635080	1638080	gaming week every week here on the show we like to talk about the types of video games
1638080	1643080	that we have been playing this week sort of to establish our frame of reference that we
1643080	1646080	come to the show with tonight Loki would you care to start us off how was your gaming week
1646080	1651080	yeah I mainly just played Fallout 4 so that's god I don't even know how many days into
1651080	1657080	that game I am but basically played every day so you know for a few hours every day I think
1657080	1663080	last I remember because I only see that when I actually save my game and I think it's like
1663080	1670080	four or five days worth of game so somewhere in there and then let's see what else have I
1670080	1675080	been playing I played a little bit Disney 3.0 because you know my son wants me to level
1675080	1678080	up his characters and stuff and I'm trying to convince him like to actually fight something
1678080	1683080	or you know to play the game so instead of just the toy box mode I'm like dude you've got
1683080	1688080	like we bought you the spider-man set so they have the spider-man levels and we have the
1688080	1692080	Avenger levels still that you haven't played through it all we have almost all of the
1692080	1698080	characters now for those you maybe should play the levels but no no he still wants to play
1698080	1704080	in his toy box mode that he set up and that's fine that's what he wants to do it's so I
1704080	1711080	leveled up I've Sam Flynn that was like level 18 out of 20 now so it's you know pretty
1711080	1719080	much I can't be killed with him anymore and I don't know so I played that and then aside
1719080	1723080	from those two and there's one other thing I'm you know playing a little bit Ingress
1723080	1730080	today I drove out into the middle of nowhere for no reason the freaking things that game
1730080	1733080	makes you do you know I drove this finally I was like I've got like time like I don't
1733080	1736080	know what I'm going to really do right now I'm like I'll drive out there that's fine
1736080	1740080	it's kind of cool in a way that you get to see things you'd never go see otherwise and
1740080	1745080	actually I drove to I own a couple weeks ago like I was surprised I'm also not that far
1745080	1749080	away is no it's really not so who knew you know so they have a good restaurant there
1749080	1754080	too so drove out there and like it was funny this is like a drove way out there and they're
1754080	1757080	like yeah they're trying to get me to go up the street a little bit to knock out another
1757080	1764080	one I'm like but it's just like a little bit over there I'm just gonna go I drove all
1764080	1769080	this way I'm not gonna drive the show for Ingress is an excuse that wouldn't even work
1769080	1775080	with me Loki so whatever it's fine and I haven't really been playing that much lately
1775080	1778080	because I'm on my new work schedule now which means I have weekends off now thank God I
1778080	1784080	don't work Saturdays anymore that's good but that also means that I start earlier and I
1784080	1791080	get off during like I did pick up the kids after work so I don't have that few hours
1791080	1797080	before work that I used to do stuff and actually farm and all that now so like I have like
1797080	1802080	no gear at all there's something else they played this week also I'm trying to think
1802080	1809080	it was what was it I think I played a little bit more of laser life and I just I'm not
1809080	1814080	really getting into that game it's okay but there's like I don't really there's like no
1814080	1820080	story to it it seems like so I don't know it's alright I think that's it that's all
1820080	1823080	I played all right that's it for your gaming week my gaming week I actually played a couple
1823080	1830080	new games this week PlayStation 4 wise I downloaded at Shane's recommendation and the fact that
1830080	1835080	it was on sale and Shane told me that him and Flaco Jones and and mrs. Flaco Jones were
1835080	1841080	all playing this game roundabout on the PlayStation oh yes yes and we're laughing their
1841080	1846080	asses off hysterically at it and so I was like alright funny I was I it's a lot of like
1846080	1849080	cheesy and I remember talking about the game on the show and I was like oh yeah yeah I
1849080	1853080	remember that came upon OLR and I wanted to get that and I just kind of blinked and missed
1853080	1858080	its PlayStation 4 release so oh it's on sale sure I'll get it now so I I paid five bucks
1858080	1862080	and download a roundabout and I played it a little bit I have to admit I didn't get the
1862080	1868080	hilarity factor as much as no I'm kind of where it wasn't super hilarious for me either
1868080	1873080	it was just kind of like silly or I should say I shouldn't I shouldn't falsely say that
1873080	1880080	Flaco was so it was all via Shane via Shane but I can imagine if I had had a few glasses
1880080	1885080	of wine at the Jones's household then this game would probably be a lot funnier but I
1885080	1888080	still thought I mean it definitely had like that cheese factor I'm not sitting here like
1888080	1893080	completely humorous like nothing was funny pout no there were some like humorous things
1893080	1899080	in it but you know I didn't I didn't laugh out loud but the game itself it's about the
1899080	1906080	game anyway and the game itself is a really kind of silly mechanic but it's it is it is
1906080	1912080	fun it's I actually kind of think of it more like a puzzle game than an action game here's
1912080	1917080	the deal is that you're driving a limo and you're trying to get from place to place in
1917080	1923080	the city but your limo consistently spins round and round and round so why it spins
1923080	1926080	I have no fucking idea that's just the game okay that's why it's called roundabout is
1926080	1932080	that this limo just spins round and round and round so you can't hit walls and trees
1932080	1937080	and stuff because each time you do you're gonna hear this note that goes and on the
1937080	1942080	fifth note your limo explodes although I would have thought there'd be a hilarious cutscene
1942080	1948080	where the people inside explode but that never happens so it's it's trickier than it
1948080	1953080	sounds because you're trying to like navigate around walls and navigate around actual roundabouts
1953080	1957080	which is actually kind of tricky to do while your limo is consistently spinning around
1957080	1961080	so in a way I kind of think it's a puzzler because you have to think about how to get
1961080	1965080	through certain parts but of course the game rewards you if you can go faster and if you
1965080	1970080	can collect these coins in sequence so there is a more in-depth complexity to it so it's
1970080	1975080	it's one of those indie games that's like kind of really simple in concept but it has
1975080	1980080	a lot of depth to it and then they threw these really cheesy full motion videos at it for
1980080	1986080	I'm not sure the reason but it was it was humorous I'll use that word I found it to
1986080	1991080	be humorous but I didn't find it to be like oh my god it's so funny maybe I just didn't
1991080	1995080	get far enough but I played a lot with Shane last night and he said the date thing was
1995080	2002080	the funniest thing and I was like it's it's humorous but it's not it's not strangers
2002080	2006080	I want to say it's the same company that made gun stringer they did like a lot of really
2006080	2014080	cheesy motion video stuff as well so yeah so anyway that I let's see Dungeon Buster
2014080	2018080	and chat over at live.com says spinning car smashing into trees exploding sounds like
2018080	2022080	a typical day in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row for me yeah but this game is all like
2023080	2027080	it's more like a classic arcade kind of setup because it's more to those like top down maybe
2027080	2032080	classic Grand Theft Auto but that's that's what it is anyway I do think especially when
2032080	2036080	the game cost only five dollars I think that was really well worth it I got mine for like
2036080	2042080	374 or something like that really what is it normally 10 10 I don't have a price to
2042080	2048080	I would say even 15 is pretty darn good if it's 1999 that might start to be pushing it
2048080	2053080	a little bit but I still think for some people you know if you like those old arcade type
2053080	2058080	of things or if you have a box of wine and I'm going to say a box of wine it will make
2058080	2062080	for a fun little party game to play with friends if none of you have played it before I would
2062080	2066080	say that'd be good use your money then the other game I played this week which I did
2066080	2071080	spend 1999 on amplitude came out this week on PlayStation 4 and you might remember a
2071080	2076080	while ago I talked about that I wasn't going to kickstart the game but I ended up it seemed
2076080	2080080	a lot of my friends were really enjoying it and I was hearing a lot of good feedback on
2080080	2085080	it so I went ahead and bought the game and it's amplitude it's definitely the game that
2085080	2092080	I remember from you know the PlayStation 2 days especially in the way it's set up the
2092080	2099080	controls obviously very similar and so on I'm going to say something that is not going
2099080	2104080	to make me popular though it's it's not as good it's not the ship kind of sailed on the
2104080	2109080	PlayStation 2 version and the frequency and amplitude and either for me the reason why
2109080	2116080	it's not as good is the music isn't as great as it was in the PlayStation 2 version it's
2116080	2122080	not as varied I am all for supporting indie bands and I think the game is at its strongest
2122080	2127080	when it's relying on some of the guest contributors for example the freeze pop song actually
2127080	2131080	that song in a way is so fucking good it's probably the best freeze pop song they've
2131080	2136080	ever put in a game and that probably like carries the song list almost on its back that
2136080	2140080	freeze pop song is so good and then like I like the crypto the necro dancer song and
2140080	2147080	amplitude and so forth otherwise I found a lot of it to be generic and I know I'm going
2147080	2151080	I'm going to so get torn anyone by amplitude fans but this is my opinion take it or leave
2151080	2158080	it and you're welcome to leave it I think part of what made the amplitude on PlayStation
2158080	2164080	2 and frequency fun is that they were songs you kind of knew so you kind of knew the beats
2164080	2168080	to them so like when you would play things like cherry lips by garbage or what was it
2168080	2172080	by blink-182 the rock show some of the songs rented it was like you know okay I kind of
2172080	2177080	I kind of know how this goes a little bit and you know it's all cool I'm playing the
2177080	2181080	song that I've actually heard before and then I think one of the places where the formula
2181080	2187080	worked at its absolute best was rock band blitz that game was awesome and the fact that
2187080	2192080	it also used your rock band dlc I would actually have rather they ported rock band blitz to
2192080	2198080	PlayStation 4 and Xbox one sorry but that's how I kind of wish that's the game they brought
2198080	2205080	back for this era was that but you know what again taste when it comes to things like music
2205080	2210080	is kind of subjective and you may completely disagree with me and that's totally okay if
2210080	2216080	you are looking for strictly gameplay mechanics of what you remember from amplitude on PlayStation
2216080	2221080	2 and frequency then this game will deliver that absolutely and you never know what might
2221080	2225080	come through with dlc so I would not give this game like a bad rating because it's still a
2225080	2232080	good music game I just think I I would be really excited if the old PlayStation 2 game
2232080	2238080	would show up on as a PlayStation 2 classic on PlayStation 4 I realized due to licensing
2238080	2243080	etc that's not going to happen but that doesn't mean I don't think that would have been something
2243080	2248080	I'd prefer so anyway okay now I'm going to turn around and look at chat and see see if I'm
2248080	2256080	getting yelled at over at live dot vog network dot com let's see let's see our fifth dream
2256080	2262080	and chat says rock band song should carry over to amplitude or maybe dlc let's see
2262080	2267080	why why are in chat says yeah thrown together is what I think when I look at the amplitude song
2267080	2273080	list and that's geo 100 matt says I'm not surprised by this why why are in chat says it's
2273080	2279080	like they forgot that a music game lives or dies by its music I wonder if dlc is coming
2279080	2285080	wow I'm kind of surprised that there's a lot of chatters that sort of get it wow okay so I guess
2285080	2290080	I'm not alone I was fully expecting to get toward a new one by some of the music longtime music
2290080	2296080	game fans but you know again I think you just I think you just really have to weigh I mean if you
2296080	2301080	are a longtime music game fan then just think it amplitude because it is going to be enough of what
2301080	2306080	you remember of the past games I'm just saying the song list you're going to kind of go I want to
2306080	2310080	play the freeze pop song the freeze pop song is so good and then I'm going to play the freeze pop
2310080	2318080	song again because that's kind of what I did I played the freeze pop song like 20 times and
2318080	2321080	the crypt of the necrodancer song is good too and there's a there's a couple other good ones too I
2321080	2327080	don't want to I don't want to disrespect the artists but it's just a lot of it is very in house
2327080	2333080	band to do something like a spin off of that kind of like how about rock band blitz on
2333080	2338080	PlayStation cross between like amplitude and like a DJ hero type game I'll be great you know
2338080	2343080	they kind of make that and again I I just want to make sure this is clear I'm not against indie
2343080	2349080	music or discovering like new music and games because Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 2 which
2349080	2353080	was the best version best home version they ever made and I stand by that to this day and part of
2353080	2360080	the reason why was the variety of independent catchy songs that were in it and these like bands
2360080	2366080	that I had never heard of that I grew to really love like echo image that was in Ultra Mix 2 is
2366080	2370080	like one of my favorite why I only put out one album even if they only put out one fucking album
2370080	2378080	but it's a fucking great album I think it's on Spotify at this point so let's see also in
2378080	2384080	chat SJ100 Matt saying I don't think that it getting more funding during the campaign would
2384080	2389080	have helped this why we are saying actual dance music that helps yes that's part of the reason
2389080	2394080	why we should totally play skulk during break I can make that happen I think you should teach
2394080	2398080	the kids today sadly the podcast listeners don't get that that's right that's why you're here
2398080	2405080	live when we break that's what YouTube's for Spotify all that stuff we'll do that okay so that
2405080	2409080	was that was my gaming week especially in a nutshell those those are the two new games I
2409080	2413080	picked up otherwise I've been continuing on with stuff I've already played before like Final Fantasy
2413080	2419080	14 continuing to get my tomes and oddly enough minecraft this week I just sometimes you just
2419080	2425080	want to you just want minecraft and chill so would you play minecraft on ps4 thank the only
2425080	2430080	reason I ask because I have like on every platform now so it's like ridiculous yeah no and then I
2430080	2434080	started playing and I started to build my little hut because you know you kind of have to especially
2434080	2438080	if you're playing in survival mode you kind of have to build at least a rudimentary house
2438080	2444080	really quick to kind of keep you safe at night at least in the beginning I do and then so I
2444080	2449080	built the whole thing but then I didn't have enough wool for a bed I forgot I needed to kill
2449080	2455080	more sheep and so what is standing right outside my house a creeper who then sees me promptly
2455080	2459080	walks in my house blows up my house what's behind my house after he blew it up one of the
2459080	2465080	endermen and I'm like wasn't I on easy but endermen will hurt you unless you stare at them
2465080	2469080	you can walk right up to them poke well don't poke them but you can walk right up to them they
2469080	2473080	won't hurt you unless you stare at their eyes interesting yeah I just I don't know that just
2473080	2477080	irritated me that happened right away so it kind of put me in a foul mood then I then I wasn't in
2477080	2483080	such a chill mood after that but I will give it another go I still think minecraft is a very zen
2483080	2489080	game so that's that's how I feel about that I think minecraft is a very lazy game yyr in chat
2489080	2494080	says how do you kind of play a game oh wait that's not response something I said that's a response
2494080	2499080	to a fifth dream saying I'm kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 right now not putting as much effort
2499080	2506080	into it like lazily playing it yes I think when I think kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 is like
2506080	2510080	if you're really playing 14 you're logging in and you're doing your dungeon every day to get your
2510080	2515080	tomes and you're grinding you're crafting to get all your scripts and you're doing your dailies
2515080	2522080	with the vanu vanu you're doing all that stuff kind of playing is like I'm gonna log in and I'll
2522080	2527080	do like a bot I'll see if anybody from the free company's on we'll pretend this is a chat room and
2527080	2530080	I'll just chat with my friends while I run around the housing district and jump I'll check the
2530080	2536080	market boards and I'll log off that's kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 when it when it when an
2537080	2542080	MMO is just chat room with swords and spells then that's your kind of playing the MMO I think
2542080	2549080	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says that was me in Final Fantasy 14 in the end which is why I stopped
2549080	2554080	paying and playing yeah I mean if you know you're not getting enough of the game out of it I can
2554080	2559080	I can understand why if fifth dream says I've got it in the background and I go back and forth I
2559080	2563080	I definitely will have Final Fantasy in one window while I do stuff that's what two monitors are
2563080	2568080	for MMO in one window and then sometimes I listen to a podcast especially if somebody I know is
2568080	2575080	live which tangentially I just want to give a quick shout out to my buddies Captain Spike and
2575080	2580080	Slidekick over at gamebuoy.org they hit 100 episodes today and you know what they did to
2580080	2585080	celebrate 100 episodes they finally did a live show so I did a live show today I'm very nice
2585080	2591080	very proud of my base over at gamebuoy.org and the fact that they they did a live show so I
2591080	2598080	just want to make sure that shout out got there and happy 100 episodes to those guys so yeah and
2598080	2602080	I'll oftentimes there's a live show on in the evening I'll definitely do MMOs while I listen to
2602080	2611080	live shows so all right that's it for our gaming week housekeeping tonight I don't have a lot of
2611080	2616080	new information I will just remind you all I'm gonna be at magfest not in any sort of official
2616080	2620080	capacity it's not like we have a booth or anything but I'll just kind of be there maybe I'll start
2620080	2624080	a topic on the forums over at vognetwork.com get a feeling if there's going to be other people
2624080	2629080	there and maybe we can do like an unofficial official vog meetup maybe do like a dinner thing
2629080	2634080	like we did at PAX East one year even if that's just you know just getting some pizzas and
2634080	2639080	chilling in a particular room or hallway or something I don't know what the atmosphere is
2639080	2644080	like at magfest yet but I get the impression it's just one giant party so we'll do some type of
2644080	2649080	little unofficial vog meetup and that's really what we'll do for that I'm just excited to get to
2649080	2652080	the con and check it out that's gonna be a lot of fun and there is going to be quite a
2652080	2658080	representation from what I understand Bobby Blackwolf still making plans to go I don't know
2658080	2663080	if that's been a hundred percent confirmed but I have plane tickets and hotels so I'm going
2663080	2670080	absolutely and meeting up with some of my buddies who podcast on Koopa Club another show that I
2670080	2676080	enjoy and they will be out there at magfest with me so it's gonna be a lot of podcast stuff
2676080	2681080	Bobby Blackwolf confirmed I have hotel I'll be driving so there you go so there there's gonna
2681080	2685080	be at least two vog hosts there and I don't know who else I don't know if Rama might be actually
2685080	2691080	be going fifth dream in chat asking about conventions is sky going to Final Fantasy fan fest
2691080	2696080	2016 difficult to say until tickets go on sale and I make sure it's reasonable and that I can get
2696080	2702080	there but my plan is to be there if I can get to Final Fantasy fan fest the plan is to be there
2702080	2707080	just you know it's a little far out and too many factors for me to a hundred percent commit to that
2707080	2713080	I can tell you I will not be trying for BlizzCon this year I'm just there's just so many other
2713080	2719080	conventions I want to do I've decided to I cut PAX PAX East last year and this year I'm
2719080	2724080	this year I cut PAX East I'm also gonna cut BlizzCon out of the rotation just because
2724080	2730080	unfortunately you know now that Horde house is kind of sunsetted I don't really have a lot
2730080	2736080	the only Blizzard game I actively play a lot of is Diablo 3 and although I really think this is
2736080	2740080	going to be Diablo 3's big year I just don't think there's going to be a lot a lot of BlizzCon
2740080	2746080	for me if I could swing the time off of work I might do DizCon and check out some of the parties
2746080	2751080	but I just the reality is I don't think BlizzCon is going to make the rotation this year I will be
2751080	2758080	opting to do hopefully there'll be a gamer x4 this year and doing magfest as well and some other
2758080	2764080	stuff here locally in April Sac Indie Arcade is coming back and VoG Network's been asked to
2764080	2770080	participate again which surprise Loki no no that's I'm not surprised I already knew that
2770080	2777080	okay yeah I've been trying to work on my game I got I got no games gonna pressure you
2777080	2782080	that would be a good day to do it though if you're gonna do any day do that that day in April
2782080	2791080	I want to get it I really try not to like it's hard because my wife watches TV and I find TV
2791080	2797080	fascinating so I watch TV as well and it's it's very distracting I get like two lines of code done
2797080	2804080	and Bobby Blackwolf in chat reminding us VoG jam submissions were due one year ago also
2804080	2813080	so anniversary celebrating an anniversary this year the VoG jam one year old let's see why we
2813080	2819080	are saying that he's been waitlisted sadly that right now he's on the waitlist to try to get in
2819080	2824080	multitasking to show off at magfest but he's hopeful that some folks he knew that were
2824080	2828080	waitlisted last year eventually got in and he said if I do wind up with a space I will plug
2828080	2833080	OLR and or VoG appreciate that buddy I'll bring I'm gonna bring flyers I don't know what magfest
2833080	2837080	fliering policy is but if they're at your booth I don't think they can get mad at me for that so I
2837080	2843080	will bring that and Rama sadly saying I'm probably backing out that's a bummer doesn't matter but
2843080	2848080	Rama does a lot of cons so I understand he has to be picky choosy because money don't grow on
2848080	2856080	trees and you might not have the money for a convention ticket and you might not have the
2856080	2862080	money to buy an oculus riff this year right Loki I would like to have the money especially since
2862080	2868080	my wife is insisting on new claim that was it the Powerball that's gonna be up to 1.3 billion
2868080	2875080	dollars on Wednesday oh yeah oh that's the other thing you guys I had a Powerball ticket that was
2875080	2881080	a winner and not only was it a win I mean obviously I didn't win the 900 million I had two
2881080	2888080	numbers and the Powerball and I'm not type words like okay I bought the ticket and I just kind of
2888080	2892080	kept it away and then when I heard on the news nobody in California won I was just like whatever
2892080	2896080	I didn't win and you know I'll check the ticket when I get around to it so finally in the car
2896080	2900080	today I was like oh yeah I should check the ticket and see if I won anything and then I realized
2900080	2905080	holy shit we match two numbers and the Powerball on one of these now granted I'm not expecting to
2905080	2910080	win thousands of dollars but I was like that might be like like a hundred bucks to do because
2910080	2915080	you get four bucks for just matching the Powerball if you just match the Powerball which would lucky
2915080	2922080	13 a lot of people did this last drawing you won like four bucks so to get two numbers out of the
2922080	2927080	five and the Powerball I was like holy shit this tickets gonna be like $250 that's awesome like
2927080	2932080	you know it's not gonna change my life but it's gonna hey exactly it's something to buy some booze
2932080	2941080	with right okay it was $8 I got $8 that's still not bad I mean it's something but I poured it of
2941080	2947080	course I poured it right back into as what my mom calls it's a stupid tax Rob if you play the
2947080	2952080	lottery you're just paying the stupid tax well let's go there and you give them your $10 I can't
2952080	2957080	wait you can kiss it goodbye because only stupid people play well someone's gonna get a stupid tax
2957080	2965080	return and it's gonna be you know whatever you know why it's fun and it yes and you have like a
2965080	2972080	you know a very minimal chance of winning so does everybody else so who cares so I put that $8 prize
2972080	2978080	right back into the stupid tax that's like when you win on a slot machine in Vegas you win like a
2978080	2982080	small prize or in Reno for me you win a small prize like five but it just goes right back in
2982080	2988080	the machine or Dolly Parton gave me $60 and yes she did last time I was in Reno on one of her
2988080	2992080	machines there's a Dolly Parton machine and you know my gay ass played the Dolly Parton machine
2992080	2998080	so I played that and I won like 60 70 bucks off that which is like a nickel slot and I was like
2998080	3003080	woohoo and so what did I do I took the $60 to dollar slots and just watched it all piss away
3003080	3011080	but oh well it's it's just for fun set your limits before you go don't take your bank card down to
3011080	3019080	the gambling room with you and you're fine so let's see going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com
3019080	3026080	YYR in chat says so here's the thing you may have only won seven bucks excuse me eight bucks
3026080	3033080	don't short me any more than they are in the cost of the the ticket maybe the tickets are two bucks
3033080	3044080	oh that's even worse but the odds of matching two numbers plus the Powerball are one in 701.33
3044080	3050080	so you should feel awesome YYR says Powerball.com says it was seven bucks no I assure you I got
3050080	3054080	eight dollars today I wonder if the money's different in each state I wonder if maybe the state
3054080	3060080	has to pay things out certain because you know when it's under like 50 bucks you just take it to
3060080	3065080	where you bought it and they pull the money out of the register like I just everybody like all the
3065080	3070080	liquor stores and gas stations in town swarmed with people grocery store has a kiosk you can just
3070080	3074080	walk right up any time of day and buy a lottery ticket there's never a line so I just went to the
3074080	3078080	grocery store and they just here's eight bucks what would you like I don't even know like I would
3078080	3083080	have to like hand walk that winning ticket somewhere it's like oh I'm gonna trust the US Postal
3083080	3088080	Service with this no no are you kidding that's the benefit of living in Sacramento I would march
3088080	3093080	down to the lottery office it's powerful though I don't think that's California you still you still
3093080	3100080	redeem it with the California Lottery oh yeah I'd be like I with my newly obtained lawyer would go
3100080	3105080	and redeem that prize I don't know Tiger Clon chat says the sky wins the Powerball he'll quit his
3105080	3111080	job and probably retire from any everything yeah I don't know I haven't really thought about how I
3111080	3116080	would spend the money and I like the people at my job I wouldn't want to just screw them over but
3116080	3121080	yeah obviously sure I'd love to say all around the world in a yacht but you hear about so many
3121080	3126080	people dying in yacht accidents I know no that just pissed the money away they win the lottery
3126080	3132080	and then they pissed money 1.3 billion dollars you can piss a lot of that but you can fill the
3132080	3137080	ocean with piss for that kind of money I mean it doesn't really matter and that's that's what I'm
3137080	3142080	gonna do you know what if I win the Powerball first first on the agenda take care of my parents
3142080	3147080	that's number one on the agenda second on the agenda dig a pool in Loki's backyard and fill it
3147080	3152080	with pee that it's gonna be second luck there's a nice little drainage pipe going through the
3152080	3157080	backyard you're gonna get about six inches down before you hit the storm line with a billion
3157080	3165080	dollars they can rear out that fucking line damn straight all right another as a sky would you buy
3165080	3172080	a mansion let's not this is these stupid thoughts are how they get a mansion a mansion stupid
3172080	3176080	thoughts are how they get you to buy the tickets in the first place exactly it's half the fun if I
3176080	3183080	win my goal is to be responsible and a little irresponsible where appropriate that's that's
3183080	3189080	why controlling shares and Konami burn it to the ground if I win Powerball I'm fucking buying
3189080	3195080	Konami I am fucking buying Konami that's it if I win Powerball I'm buying hostile takeover hostile
3195080	3200080	takeover Rob and we're gonna change the name to Rob Roberts on to me and I'm gonna fucking own
3200080	3204080	Metal Gear wait for it that's what I'm doing with the Powerball and you know what the first thing
3204080	3212080	I'm gonna do is PT is fucking coming back and I don't care if we have to like you know get Guillermo
3212080	3218080	del Toro and Hideo Kojima hand jobs in order to make that happen I'll have 1.3 billion dollars
3218080	3226080	it'll happen anyways let's get enough Powerball wank let's get into the news and talk about
3226080	3232080	something that maybe I could afford with 1.3 billion dollars right Logan exactly so the Oculus
3232080	3237080	Rift they announced the price they announced when it's coming out so now all you have to do is go
3237080	3246080	order it it's $600 supposed to be launching in March and $600 that's quite a bit of money of
3246080	3251080	course you're also gonna need to have a PC to run that which will probably run you in about at
3251080	3259080	least another $1,200 $1,300 and what do you get with that well you also get of course a couple
3259080	3264080	games that's gonna be launching with Eve Valkyrie also Lucky's Tale and then of course you get you
3264080	3272080	know the Xbox one controller and everything so I don't know that's a little too rich for my blood
3272080	3278080	for right now just because I don't have a PC to run it and you know really it comes down to like
3278080	3283080	how much am I really going to use this because right now I don't use the DK 2 very much but then
3283080	3288080	again my PC doesn't run it very well so maybe if it ran it like it's supposed to I might use it a
3288080	3294080	little bit more a lot of people are screaming the sky is falling about the price I don't it the
3294080	3299080	problem is like the price is not a big deal if you have the marketing behind it to convince people
3299080	3304080	that they need to purchase it the problem is when you have a price like that you're gonna get people
3304080	3310080	that are already excited about it to maybe buy it but that's it it's like yeah you want you want
3310080	3315080	as many people to buy it so there's more support behind it so there's you know it just kind of a
3315080	3319080	big cycle so you get more people excited because there's more software out there for it which
3319080	3325080	means that the price is a little bit more worth it and so on but I think a factor that played into
3325080	3329080	this as well is that you know they said at one point whether it was an offhanded comment or not
3329080	3334080	people as expectation was it was going to be what 350 that was the expectation at one point
3334080	3340080	whether it was an offhanded comment or not so when it kind of was a little higher than that I think
3340080	3345080	some people were kind of irritated because they felt like wait a minute I was budgeting this amount
3345080	3351080	of money or I expected it at this and now it's this and even though you know 599 that's how much
3351080	3358080	a PlayStation 3 cost when it first came out but we also kind of hazed the shit out of that press
3358080	3367080	conference when the PlayStation 3 was first announced 599 US dollars 599 you know I don't know
3367080	3372080	I think I think I made a prediction on the show a couple weeks ago where I said Oculus is going to
3372080	3377080	do all right but it's going to be kind of limited to that I need to go back because you know maybe
3377080	3381080	I'm giving myself more credit than I deserve but I still remember saying it's still going to be a
3381080	3386080	niche thing but it'll it'll be a thing and it's not going to necessarily be just a flash in the pan
3386080	3392080	and I think this price kind of cements it as a niche thing at least for now who knows what happens
3392080	3397080	a year from now you know the great thing about the price technology it falls PlayStation 3's are now
3397080	3404080	not even what 149 for a place well yeah but the thing for me it's like it it reminds me a lot of 3D TV
3404080	3411080	like 3D TV is like this amazing technology that it was super expensive and there's people that got
3411080	3416080	on board with it but they didn't really do a great job of explaining why you needed it you know
3416080	3422080	what made it so great why you need to spend that and now it's kind of just like well it's been taken
3422080	3426080	a backseat they don't really have a lot of 3D TVs out there at least it's not something that they're
3426080	3432080	selling people on it now it's all about 4k and that type of stuff but I don't know one other thing
3432080	3439080	too is if you did back the original Kickstarter you're going to be and that's at the development kit
3439080	3445080	level so $300 or higher you'll be getting a consumer rift as well and at no additional charge
3445080	3450080	which is kind of nice it's hard to hate on that that's pretty rad that you know you don't hear about
3450080	3456080	that with a lot of kickstarters that kind of go beyond the rewards that were promised for their
3456080	3464080	investors and I have a hard time expressing anything but congratulations for those people that believed
3464080	3469080	in it enough that now they're gonna get this thing that you know for many people they felt they've
3469080	3479080	been priced out of so props to them I can't be mad at that yep and then of course you know basically
3479080	3485080	there's an AMA that can't it kind of happened right after the announcement which you know lucky
3485080	3490080	basically said you know apologize that you know the communication of the price wasn't exactly the
3490080	3497080	messaging wasn't handled well I guess a lot of people's expectation was a supposed to be a lot lower
3497080	3507080	but it is what it is so I don't know I think I hope it does well but I'm just worried with the price
3507080	3512080	if they're the market behind it to like get people hyped up about it as much as like anything else
3512080	3518080	that Apple releases that's ridiculously overpriced then I think that this has a pretty good chance
3518080	3523080	but it's just the problem is it's not just six hundred dollars out it's not like an iPhone where it's
3523080	3529080	just six hundred dollars you know out the gate and that's it you also need a computer to run it and
3529080	3535080	like for the average consumer they're not gonna have that you know your mom and pop or whatever
3535080	3543080	it's not gonna have like a gaming PC that can run this shit. Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com
3543080	3546080	Bobby Blackwell pointing out they don't need the marketing they sold out of all their first shipments
3546080	3551080	you know I don't I don't know how many that was but that you know at least I guess looks promising
3551080	3556080	but I think again you know when you consider in a niche thing that's not I'm not a niche isn't negative
3556080	3560080	either I think yeah the hardcore audience and the people that really I think there's enough people
3560080	3563080	they really kind of believe in this I want to see it happen that are going to be early adopters
3563080	3568080	it's like the early iPhones that were so expensive you know there are people that buy the early technology
3568080	3573080	how appropriate this being the week of Consumer Electronics Show which I know we didn't really bring up
3573080	3577080	in our kickoff topic because there wasn't really a lot of gaming news that came out of the show
3577080	3582080	but there's a lot of gadgets that are really high dollar there that people will pay a lot of money for
3582080	3591080	electric cars too not even just Tesla's but Prius and you know Leaf and all that stuff
3591080	3597080	those are pretty expensive cars but I really think the price of those things is I think the Prius already
3597080	3601080	was one of those things that was a lot a lot a lot of money when it first came out and it's coming down
3601080	3607080	year after year so you know and there's no reason to believe that the others won't follow suit similarly
3607080	3611080	especially you know it'll be interesting to see what happens with the whole Tesla thing as they start to expand
3611080	3617080	where those charging stations are and all of that and they can you know kind of get more of them out there
3618080	3623080	but anyway I'm getting a bit off track you know there's early tech adopters and then there's everybody else
3623080	3629080	I'm excited for it I do want to eventually get one but it's just I've got to build a new PC for that
3629080	3637080	and I do want to do that maybe that's more of a motivation for me to finish a game so that I can you know
3637080	3642080	have the money coming in to hopefully purchase a PC to be able to run this in
3642080	3650080	Now Facebook you know obviously Facebook bought Oculus a couple years ago and that was a whole other controversy
3650080	3656080	but you know speaking about marketing I kind of think Facebook is doing the right thing right now
3656080	3661080	is that Facebook doesn't need to be running commercials on TV and during the Super Bowl right now
3661080	3665080	like Bobby said they sold out of the first shipment the geek crowd is going to carry it right now
3665080	3670080	they know there's enough people interested in it based on Kickstarter etc it's going fine right now
3670080	3677080	but what's interesting about Facebook being involved is that if you look at your friends list feed right now on Facebook
3677080	3683080	which many slightly tech savvy people almost all of them have a Facebook unless you're one of those anti-Facebook people
3683080	3688080	but as you scroll through your Facebook feed you'll see that there's 3D videos already there in your Facebook feed
3688080	3692080	especially if you do it on mobile phone and you'll notice you can take your phone and move it around
3692080	3698080	and it actually shows you like a 3D video I went there like a podrace from Star Wars it was on there not that long ago
3698080	3702080	which I know there was no podrace in the new movie but they were still showing some type of like sample thing
3702080	3711080	I don't know I feel like that's something I saw but they're already starting to condition you that 3D videos are a normal thing
3711080	3718080	you see in your feed you see where this is going Facebook is planting the seeds they might not be doing heavy marketing
3718080	3723080	with commercials and everything they don't need to right now but they're starting to get you used to the idea
3723080	3732080	that 3D video is a thing that we share just like we share selfies and gifts on the internet
3732080	3736080	so I kind of think Facebook is starting to lay the seeds for that
3736080	3743080	now going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com some folks are talking about there's a little debate going on in there
3743080	3750080	about the PlayStation VR and how that's going to play a role and I guess the fact that Amazon Canada
3750080	3759080	had a posting that was quickly taken down that PlayStation said you know was nothing has been announced basically
3759080	3761080	they didn't deny the price of $800
3761080	3767080	I don't think they have to deny the price they didn't say they just didn't say they have an announcement
3767080	3771080	they never really like even if they're they have a price out there they're not gonna say that's not the price
3771080	3775080	they're just gonna say we don't have anything to announce that's how they always handle it
3775080	3780080	you know what though I still there's still a huge grain of salt I'm taking with this
3780080	3784080	and part of the reason why is that you know assuming everything was accidental
3784080	3788080	which I have no reason to believe it wasn't completely accidental and shit happens
3788080	3792080	and that maybe they had some type of placeholder in their system as Amazon often does
3792080	3798080	when I ordered Kingdom Hearts 3 for yeah Kingdom Hearts 3 for what was like 40 bucks
3798080	3802080	they had it on sale at one point you know these things happen in the system
3803080	3810080	I think it's possible that maybe Sony is totally okay with people thinking it's $800
3810080	3816080	so that way when they come in and they announce the price is $699 it doesn't seem so bad
3816080	3819080	so I don't know there's still a grain of salt they take with that
3819080	3825080	like there's still a part of me that's like well $800 means system and VR right
3825080	3827080	because that's a lot to pay for just the VR headset
3827080	3834080	I mean we do know that the Playstation VR is gonna be not just the headset but the little processor box as well
3834080	3840080	so you know the Oculus doesn't have that little processor box so I mean $800 wouldn't be unheard of
3840080	3849080	but that's gonna really I mean that's gonna be what the rich kids have at home at least this year
3849080	3854080	and there's gonna really have to be the software that substantiates it
3854080	3857080	you know what's that game that's worth $800
3857080	3863080	I hope that it just works as a second monitor so I can play Fallout 4 while my wife is watching TV
3863080	3868080	because I seriously okay so seriously like this is what I did this week as well as part of the time
3868080	3873080	I had built or bought parts to build this thing it was gonna be a second screen device
3873080	3878080	that was gonna basically be like the Wii U gamepad but gonna be used for any system
3879080	3885080	and so I have the parts for it I have a wireless HDMI extender basically for everything
3885080	3891080	and I hooked it up and didn't fucking work with the Playstation 4 it just got no image whatsoever
3891080	3897080	it worked with the 360 but I attempted to do something like that but it would be nice to have that second headset
3897080	3900080	to be able to view everything plus the VR stuff
3900080	3904080	I just think without the $800 game it's going to be sunk
3904080	3908080	as much as I love Rez and I heard Shane's enthusiasm for Rez VR and all that
3908080	3915080	I don't think that's an $800 game so you know if and it's a huge if bolded underlined italicized if
3915080	3919080	the price of that thing really is $800 then there's got to be the $800 game that goes with it
3919080	3925080	and I'm not sure anything we've seen so far is that game but we'll see we'll see what happens
3925080	3932080	I imagine at this point GDC I mean if it is kind of an expensive techie thing
3932080	3937080	I think they'll roll it out on the stage of GDC as opposed to E3
3937080	3942080	because E3 is where all your newspaper around the country and all those people are tied into
3942080	3945080	if Sony announces a huge price like that it'll be in USA Today
3945080	3949080	they announce something at GDC that's going to be a little more at the tech crowd level
3949080	3954080	so we'll see I mean GDC isn't usually the place to roll out those sorts of announcements
3954080	3957080	but it wouldn't be out of character for Sony
3957080	3960080	Sony did announce the move there I believe at GDC
3960080	3964080	I know they did Home one year so it's not out of character for them
3964080	3968080	I would like another Home especially tied in with VR would be pretty cool
3968080	3972080	That would be interesting especially if it ends up being part of the package
3972080	3978080	could help at least justify the price if it's you know better than Home as it was
3978080	3982080	anyway there's a lot of what ifs to be discovered with PlayStation VR
3982080	3985080	and hopefully we'll have the answers in the coming weeks we'll see
3985080	3989080	but I just I really don't I think $800 is just too far out there
3989080	3996080	and I really think PlayStation I just my gut says Sony knows they cannot get on a stage in a massive form
3996080	4001080	and say the word $599 again they're going to have to get it under that price
4001080	4005080	I just think I'm just kind of convinced that's what they got to do
4005080	4008080	whether that's a practical idea or not
4008080	4011080	and I've said this before and it's been a while
4011080	4017080	but man a new Ridge Racer launching a system that would be pretty badass
4017080	4024080	alright let's move on I got to move on to something that's actually kind of really sad in nature
4024080	4030080	but actually it was as far as the video games itself there was a lot a lot in this early week of the year
4030080	4033080	but we did have a real tragedy that happened in the video game world this week
4033080	4040080	and regretfully I have to report on this is that one of the voice actresses from Final Fantasy 14
4040080	4044080	unfortunately was found murdered this past week and there's no really easy way to say that
4044080	4049080	but Sian Blake who actually played Yugiri in Final Fantasy 14
4049080	4055080	now if you don't know Yugiri, Yugiri was a character that was not in the original Realm Reborn
4055080	4062080	but Yugiri showed up in one of the later patches and was revealed to be an Al-Ra which was the new race
4062080	4066080	so she was a character that tied together the two expansions
4066080	4070080	tied together Realm Reborn into Heavensward and of course she carries on into Heavensward
4070080	4078080	her part isn't, it's not a main character level part but still a very important part of the story
4078080	4085080	so Sian Blake who played Yugiri was actually found dead and I apologize this is gruesome
4085080	4091080	but her two children were also murdered and her partner Arthur Kent
4092080	4098080	Arthur Simpson Kent, excuse me, is missing and the police are looking for him in connection to the deaths
4098080	4103080	and obviously that's just very, very sick now that we're talking about children
4103080	4109080	many of you overseas probably heard about this but you didn't hear, you didn't know there necessarily was a video game connection
4109080	4116080	Sian Blake was actually one of the stars of EastEnders which people here in the States don't really know about that
4116080	4120080	but over in Britain it's, you know, a long, long running soap opera there
4120080	4125080	so a lot of the British reports are mentioning that it was an EastEnders actress that died
4125080	4128080	but that's the same person if you didn't know
4128080	4137080	of course a lot of vigils and memoriums going on inside Final Fantasy XIV in remembrance of Sian Blake
4137080	4144080	and I'm sure there's some people wondering what's going to happen to the character, what's going to happen to the voice actor
4144080	4154080	I have a feeling, A, if you're curious to show up in more patches a lot of the dialogue has probably already been recorded
4154080	4161080	I would imagine all of the 3.0 Heaven's Word storyline, all of it was already written a long time ago and it's probably already all been acted
4161080	4167080	also changing voice actors isn't completely out of character for Square Enix
4167080	4176080	In this game, Final Fantasy XIV, a lot of notable voice actors actually changed between Realm Reborn and Heaven's Word
4176080	4182080	like Gideon Emery who does Balthier in Final Fantasy XII plays Oranger in Final Fantasy XIV
4182080	4186080	and they totally changed the voice actor going into Heaven's Word
4186080	4190080	so that was a little bit, some of those voice actor changes were surprising
4190080	4196080	so unfortunately this is a tragedy but the reality is we have to talk about what's going to happen with the game
4196080	4201080	so if Ugiri continues on they'll probably change the voice actor or voice actress
4201080	4207080	I could see where maybe they would write the character out, out of respect to this actress perhaps
4207080	4213080	but one thing to also consider is that there are voice actors in other languages as well
4213080	4221080	Sian did the English voice, there's still a Japanese voice actor and I think they do voice in French and German?
4222080	4230080	but hoping that Square Enix in some sort of official capacity does do some sort of memorial for Sian Blake
4230080	4236080	I think it would be great if maybe they could sell a pet and maybe donate it to some type of children's charity
4236080	4242080	since unfortunately children were involved in this tragedy, I think it would be a very great gesture for Square Enix
4242080	4248080	maybe a memory of Sian Blake, maybe a special holiday event in the game where there might be a pet
4248080	4257080	and maybe they can raise funds and donate it to a children's shelter or a women's shelter of domestic abuse or something
4257080	4265080	something to, at least we can get some positive ending to this tragic, tragic story
4265080	4271080	and I really don't know what else to say about it, I'm sorry to be such a downer but it happened
4271080	4277080	and sometimes they're going to affect the games that we play, especially a game like Final Fantasy XIV that is still unfolding
4277080	4282080	there's not a beginning and an end for that game yet, so we'll see
4291080	4296080	anyhow, let's try to lighten the tone a little bit more and go back to Loki with some other news
4296080	4307080	so there's rumors or news about the NX, basically saying that they're going to be announcing some sort of concept version of it
4307080	4312080	kind of like what it is, letting people know about that, between March and May
4312080	4320080	and then the actual unveil of the console is going to be in June and it's going to be launching somewhere between October and November, probably during the holiday
4320080	4328080	and because of this it's probably going to eat into some of the sales of the Wii U and 3DS
4328080	4337080	this is coming from Nomura Securities, so I don't know, I guess that makes sense
4337080	4342080	would that time frame mean like a GDC type announcement?
4342080	4351080	no, I think E3 or bust, but I think there's an assumption from a lot of people that it necessarily means it's going to be winter this year
4351080	4356080	and I understand that's what a lot of analysts are saying, is that it's 2016, but what if it's still the fiscal year?
4356080	4362080	they could do a spring launch next year and that would not be out of character for Nintendo, they did the 3DS right?
4362080	4367080	and they could do it in the spring at the end of the financial quarter
4368080	4375080	I could see them doing that, but maybe, I'm assuming maybe at this point Zelda is probably going to be for the new console
4375080	4382080	I'm wondering if maybe they just don't, they're going to run out of things to release
4382080	4388080	because they've got, all we know so far is we've got Star Fox coming out this year
4389080	4397080	there's those other two concept games that were being worked on, and Zelda
4397080	4404080	Zelda could carry the holiday, if Zelda is the only thing they've got this holiday, it could carry it, it really could
4404080	4413080	I think that's a big enough game for that, but it might be very easy for them to crank out, I still think it would be very easy for them to crank out a sequel
4413080	4420080	we know Pikmin 4 is a thing, and I don't think that would be an extraordinary amount of effort to make that happen
4420080	4426080	I mean, I understand that they like Pikmin, but come on, it's like 2 in this console cycle already
4426080	4434080	or this would be the second one in the console cycle, and we haven't even seen games for Metroid or some of their other properties that they normally have something for
4434080	4440080	the cannibalization of sales though really strikes me as a non-headline, I think there's a big assumption there
4440080	4448080	or a general assumption out there amongst gamers, if rumors are to be believed anyway, that NX is going to involve handheld and console
4448080	4458080	and the 3DS and Wii U are starting to wind down their life cycles, I think Zelda will be a last hurrah for Wii U if it is not on the new console
4458080	4466080	but we'll see, I think there's so many factors right now, but when Wii U first came out it didn't really cannibalize the Wii
4466080	4472080	they were still selling the Wii for that particular first holiday, they still sold a lot of Wiis
4472080	4482080	and then the Wii was still a bargain-basement price, they took out the DVD and the Gamecube stuff and they had a bargain-basement Wii
4482080	4488080	that they were basically pitching as a Netflix device that year that was extraordinarily cheap
4488080	4495080	I don't know if I believe the whole cannibalization of sales of the old system because whatever NX is, is going to be expensive as well
4495080	4502080	and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, if it is a handheld and a console, you can expect you're going to buy those two things separately
4502080	4509080	and that's how Nintendo's going to sell you a $599 product, because they're going to split it into $299 and $299
4509080	4515080	but we'll see, we'll see, there's so many factors
4515080	4522080	yeah, I think a lot of it, people are still in pretty tight budgets, I don't know, that's a lot of money to spend on stuff
4522080	4529080	whether it be an Oculus Rift, the Sony VR, or like another console that's going to be that kind of price, that's a lot of money
4529080	4536080	in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says Nintendo needs to take their damn time with this
4536080	4542080	yeah, I've seen some counterpoints that maybe Nintendo shouldn't release it this year, because they should build up a library of games
4542080	4549080	that maybe, I don't know, Wii U, Wii U kind of had a strong launch lineup, but its biggest problem was a lot of the releases had already been done
4549080	4558080	and Wii U to me kind of feels a little bit rushed as it is, because it was just like, I kind of thought it should have been to the spec of these modern consoles
4558080	4565080	I understand that they couldn't do that for the price point, but maybe they should have, because then that way you wouldn't have had the problem with
4565080	4572080	oh, these companies not being able to develop games for your console, because their new engines won't run on it
4572080	4578080	YYR in chat says too early for who though, what other major products are coming from Nintendo besides the mobile games?
4578080	4587080	Amiibo, to be fair, let's not factor out Amiibo, those things are still selling like crazy, they will be a part of the NX experience one way or the other
4587080	4592080	this is a whole money farm for Nintendo, and it's been profitable for them
4592080	4596080	but when is going to be enough is enough with that stuff?
4596080	4601080	I mean, how many are going to be too many?
4601080	4608080	I mean, eventually Beanie Babies weren't popular, so when is it going to be enough?
4608080	4614080	When are people going to realize that maybe I'm not getting the functionality with these things that I was hoping for
4614080	4618080	yeah, they look cool on my shelf, but that's it
4618080	4627080	I have to be honest Loki, if Skylanders is still a thing now, with characters that are not as well notable as Nintendo's suite of characters
4627080	4633080	and still taking up as much shelf space, and they only work with one very specific game
4633080	4638080	if that's still a thing, I kind of see that Amiibo could last just as long
4638080	4644080	I mean, I think the bubble will burst eventually as it does with most peripheral things, but I think there's still a good couple of years left in it
4644080	4647080	and I wouldn't factor it out of the NX at all
4647080	4653080	Well, and I do give credit to Skylanders where I think there's more gameplay with their figures than there is with Amiibo
4653080	4660080	I mean, so, I don't know, if they had something cool like that, like a grindy RPG thing
4660080	4667080	hey, Nintendo RPG or something like that, where you use Amiibo figures like you do, like Disney Infinity or something like that
4667080	4669080	that could be pretty cool
4669080	4671080	Let me read one more comment then we'll move on
4671080	4674080	YYR in chat says, my opinion also differs from Rob's on what it is
4674080	4677080	I don't think it will be a console with a portable module
4677080	4681080	I think it will be a portable that can dock and become a console
4681080	4683080	Well, that could be very interesting
4683080	4692080	I think it is certainly feasible that there could be a portable now with almost as much oomph as you see in the PlayStation 4
4692080	4696080	or the Xbox One, and certainly if they sell an additional dock
4696080	4701080	which the dock could have something like a little more oomph in the chips that maybe allow it to play on a TV
4701080	4703080	as opposed to whatever the fixed resolution on the handheld is
4703080	4706080	I could definitely see where, I mean it might be an expensive dock
4706080	4710080	but they might make it worth it with some of the stuff that they pitch for you
4710080	4715080	I think that's a pretty clever way to imagine it
4715080	4719080	but we are just dreaming right now, we have no idea
4719080	4723080	But that doesn't really work as far as having multiple members of the family
4723080	4725080	or are they going to have multiple console systems
4725080	4728080	and how are they going to talk to each other, I don't know
4728080	4731080	We'll see, we'll just wait and see what they say
4731080	4736080	We'll see, I know, it's just too much to be, we get tinfoil hat all day
4736080	4739080	but we just need to wait for Nintendo to make an official announcement
4739080	4742080	Okay, so moving on to another lawsuit
4742080	4745080	but this one has to do with a company called Lumosity
4745080	4750080	and I have to admit, I had not really heard of this company until this article
4750080	4755080	but apparently they had all these brain games that were out there
4755080	4758080	and think about brain training for Nintendo
4759080	4763080	but these games actually claimed that it could make you smarter
4763080	4767080	and now Lumos Labs who created the game is being ordered to pay
4767080	4773080	the Federal Trade Commission 2 million dollars for deceptive trade practices
4773080	4779080	In the report, FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich said in a statement
4779080	4783080	Lumosity preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline
4783080	4788080	suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, dementia, and even Alzheimer's disease
4788080	4792080	but Lumosity simply did not have the science to back up its ads
4792080	4796080	If you sign up for the auto-renewal program featured by Lumosity
4796080	4800080	between January 1st of 2009 and December 31st of 2014
4800080	4805080	you will be notified about the action and given an easy way to cancel
4805080	4809080	So, yeah, and some folks in chat, Dungeon Buster, saying, wow, I remember their ads
4809080	4813080	Yeah, I remember seeing their ads too around the time that brain training was popular
4813080	4817080	but brain training on DS sold itself differently
4817080	4820080	It didn't flat out claim to make you smarter
4820080	4824080	I think they were a little more clever about it where they said
4824080	4829080	this Japanese doctor said this is good for you type of thing
4829080	4832080	where they didn't say the game makes you smarter
4832080	4835080	but this doctor said about the game it's gonna do this
4835080	4836080	which is completely different
4837080	4842080	It's all in how you phrase it because you can't be shut down
4842080	4845080	for saying this doctor said this thing
4845080	4848080	because, I mean, come on, they put quotes on movie posters all the time
4848080	4850080	That's how they sell things
4850080	4851080	So and so said this
4852080	4857080	So, Rob Roberts of Orange Launch Radio said about the new Amplitude game
4857080	4860080	The freeze-pop song is great, I played it 20 times
4860080	4861080	Put that on the box
4862080	4863080	Anyway
4864080	4870080	Let's see, and Dar Titsuye bringing up the brain training run that Tazbot did during Awesome Games Done Quick
4870080	4872080	I missed that whole segment
4872080	4875080	and I need to go back to YouTube and see it because I heard it was pretty funny
4875080	4878080	So, sadly, I didn't see any of that
4878080	4880080	I just saw some pictures and it looked really funny
4880080	4882080	so I gotta go back and look at that
4882080	4884080	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates
4884080	4887080	although I'm thinking we are looking at yet another light week
4887080	4890080	Right, Loki, or what are we looking at this week in release dates?
4890080	4892080	There's nothing
4893080	4895080	Nothing in the US this week?
4895080	4896080	No
4896080	4898080	No? When do we get back into releases?
4898080	4901080	In a couple weeks here because I know we've got
4901080	4907080	the Lego Avengers game is going to be coming out on the
4907080	4913080	21st? No, it's the 25th
4913080	4919080	So, yeah, we've got some stuff coming out I think the following week
4919080	4922080	But, yeah, unfortunately not anything until then
4922080	4928080	This is usually a pretty light month and it's been even worse so this year
4928080	4932080	Alright, well, in the UK, and yeah, I'm going a little out of order here
4932080	4934080	but with Dark Soccer Night here I'm going to do the UK next
4934080	4936080	We at least have a handful of games this week
4936080	4938080	It sounds like this is mostly digital stuff though
4938080	4944080	Assassin's Creed Chronicles India is released for the PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4 this week on the 12th
4944080	4948080	You also have Gone Home making its debut on Playstation 4 and Xbox One
4948080	4950080	I forgot they were putting that on those systems
4950080	4953080	I wonder if I'll want to check that out again
4953080	4957080	I don't know if they're doing anything new to it but I'll be curious about it
4957080	4962080	And then Tharsis comes out on Playstation 4 and PC as well
4962080	4967080	If you're more of a mobile person you can look for Pocket Mortis on Android and the iDevices
4967080	4970080	Going over to Japan and checking out the releases over there
4970080	4972080	I think we are finally getting back into some releases
4972080	4974080	Yeah, the 14th on the Playstation 4 this week
4974080	4977080	You have Evolve Ultimate Edition making its debut in Japan
4977080	4985080	As well as Odin Sphere, Leif Drasir comes out this week in a regular and a 3D Crystal Famitsu Deluxe Pack
4985080	4989080	That is a new release from Atlus on the Playstation 4 this week
4989080	4994080	On the Playstation 3 that Odin Sphere is also getting a release on Playstation 3
4994080	4999080	The Wii U has nothing to note until the end of the month when Mario Tennis comes out
4999080	5003080	But on the Vita we do have Odin Sphere also out on the Vita
5003080	5007080	There's also an accessory set I guess that comes with that as well on the Vita
5007080	5013080	And then Darius Burst Chronicle Saviors also out in Japan this week on the Playstation Vita
5013080	5018080	And lastly looking at the 3DS to see if there's any releases
5018080	5024080	Just one, Card Fight Vanguard G Stride to Victory coming out in Japan this week
5024080	5030080	Yeah, and like I was double checking the first releases of this month are actually on the 19th
5030080	5033080	So next week there will be some releases
5033080	5035080	Hooray! We get release dates again next week
5035080	5036080	Yeah, next week
5036080	5037080	Finally out of that holiday
5037080	5040080	And 26th for LEGO Marvel Avengers which I am totally picking up day one
5040080	5041080	Awesome
5041080	5043080	Alright, let's go through a few more stories here
5043080	5046080	We'll go a little quickly and then we'll get to Classic Game of the Week
5046080	5055080	Alright, so there's apparently this latest round of DRM is being more difficult or stubborn to be cracked
5055080	5061080	This includes this brand new Denovu anti-temper technology
5061080	5072080	It's being used in such games from EA like FIFA 16 and they also have I guess Just Cause 3
5072080	5074080	It's being used on as well
5074080	5079080	Apparently they're saying that it's remained, they haven't cracked it yet
5079080	5084080	And this is coming from I guess some Chinese cracking group 3DM
5084080	5088080	But then again though there's other hacking groups out there so I wouldn't necessarily take it
5088080	5094080	Are they really trying hard enough? Are you really trying hard enough or are you slacking off because it's the holidays?
5094080	5096080	No, I'm joking
5096080	5102080	Honestly with Just Cause 3, I mean it hasn't been out that long and maybe it is because it's so buggy
5102080	5106080	Maybe that I don't know if they have tried that hard, I don't know
5106080	5108080	Who knows, we'll see
5108080	5111080	Let's be real though, we're not really supposed to be rooting for the cracking teams
5111080	5113080	Well no, let's put it this way though
5113080	5115080	That's what keeps games off PC
5115080	5123080	I understand that but at the same time though the people are concerned that maybe because their thought is that in two years time
5123080	5129080	There's not going to be any pirated games because it's going to be impossible to hack through the DRM
5129080	5131080	Which I just don't buy that at all
5131080	5133080	Hackers gonna hack right?
5133080	5137080	There is no possible way that that is going to be uncrackable
5137080	5139080	All it is, is time
5139080	5144080	Especially making a comment saying that, oh it's impossible, that's just going to get more people trying
5144080	5151080	I do find it interesting that for a change instead of the company putting out the game saying it's impossible
5151080	5155080	You actually have the crackers themselves saying it's impossible
5155080	5160080	I think giving it a month's time is not saying it's impossible
5160080	5165080	It's harder than it was but I don't think it's impossible
5165080	5171080	That's still a win, a big win though for the publishers if it's going to take them a month to crack games
5171080	5173080	Because most of the game sales happen when? The first month
5173080	5174080	Yeah
5174080	5175080	So it's still a huge win
5175080	5178080	But it's a horribly fucked up buggy ass game
5178080	5183080	A lot of these games that are coming out from these publishers, EA especially
5183080	5188080	And Just Cause 3 was just as bad, they were fucking buggy as shit when they came out
5188080	5194080	And I think maybe waiting some time for all of that to be fixed is not such a bad thing
5194080	5197080	Especially when these companies are just willing to, oh well it's good enough
5197080	5202080	Batman Arkham City, yeah Batman Arkham Knight, good enough
5202080	5211080	Do you think that maybe the crackers instead of taking the time to try and get these games to be free for their people or whatever
5211080	5216080	Do you think that instead of putting the resources there they should just put the resources in to maybe help them fix the games
5216080	5219080	Fuck them, why should they have to help them fix the games
5220080	5226080	But look at it this way, we're talking two or three games out of how many games that come out all the time
5226080	5229080	There's so many indie games, there's so many other games, there's plenty of games out there
5229080	5233080	And if you don't want to spend $60 on a brand new game like Just Cause 3
5233080	5235080	Go spend $7 on a Humble Bundle
5235080	5240080	Yeah, go wait a few years or buy somewhere else or buy it on sale
5241080	5246080	I don't know, I haven't pirated PC gaming in a very long time
5246080	5250080	Like it's years, decades probably
5250080	5254080	But there was a time when it was super available and super easy to do
5254080	5257080	It was different in the 90s, it was different a long time ago
5257080	5263080	But now it's like, nah, it's just like I don't really see a reason to do it
5263080	5265080	I mean, I don't know
5265080	5268080	There's so much out there that you can play
5268080	5272080	And it's funny that the quote is about there's not going to be any free games to play
5272080	5275080	Of course there's going to be free games to play, there's lots of
5275080	5278080	Go play Clicker Heroes, that's free
5278080	5281080	But seriously, there's so much out there that you can play
5281080	5284080	There's a lot of free to play MMOs actually, now that I think about it
5284080	5285080	And here's the thing too, it's like
5285080	5288080	There's so much you can play out there, there's just no time
5288080	5290080	If it's literally going to get to the point where there's no free things out there
5290080	5293080	Well guess what, you know what, it's pretty easy to make your own shit
5293080	5296080	So make your own game that's free to play
5296080	5298080	Alright, well moving on
5298080	5300080	We mentioned earlier in the show about some anniversaries
5300080	5303080	And Sonic is turning 25 this year
5303080	5308080	And we did have the whole rumor last week because of the musical group that said something on the Facebook
5308080	5313080	Well apparently there are more details and more rumors this week in addition to that
5313080	5318080	Apparently a former Sega Quality Assurance employee leaked this
5318080	5322080	Get your salt licks, tinfoil hats, take it as rumor
5322080	5326080	But apparently Sega is working on two Sonic games for this year
5326080	5328080	One of them is Sonic Adventure 3
5328080	5331080	So Sonic Adventure 3, possibly seeing release this year
5331080	5336080	The second game is supposed to be a 2D game called Sonic Genesis
5336080	5338080	Get it? Get it?
5338080	5341080	Sonic Genesis The Origin of Chaos
5341080	5345080	And it will be the same team that made Sonic Colors and Sonic Lost World
5345080	5347080	Again, rumor?
5347080	5350080	So I see YYR in chat going, what, what?
5350080	5356080	I will buy, just don't, put the car in park because we don't have any official words yet
5356080	5362080	But yeah, that is what is rumored to come out later this year for the 25th anniversary
5362080	5366080	I'd be down with a Sonic Adventure 3, I think that would be pretty cool
5366080	5370080	And I do love the tongue in cheek name, although that could just as easily be a fanboy name
5370080	5375080	Sonic Genesis The Origin of Chaos, like I kind of think that's a hilarious name
5375080	5381080	If true, we'll see what Sega might announce in the coming months
5381080	5385080	Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, lowkey
5385080	5390080	Alright, so this is kind of funny because we actually talked about this I think last week or so
5390080	5397080	Regarding that there was a Mario Maker costume that someone had hacked into the actual data files
5397080	5401080	And found out, hey guess what, the Skypop plane is going to be a costume
5401080	5408080	And sure enough, they have this new tie in thing that's the Southwest Air Adventure
5408080	5412080	That you can unlock the plane
5412080	5416080	So, go play it and unlock that costume
5416080	5425080	So, well I actually played it and I'm a big fan of costumes
5425080	5428080	Nintendo does provide a shit ton of free content for Mario Maker
5428080	5430080	So it's hard to be upset
5430080	5434080	The tie in for the advertisement is a little weird
5434080	5437080	But at the same time, wasn't some of the old
5437080	5439080	Old at this point, it's not that old
5439080	5443080	But wasn't some of the first costumes that came out like tie in with Game Center
5443080	5446080	And some of the Japanese stuff like Famitsu had a mascot
5446080	5451080	That sounds cool, people don't really like, damn Southwest Airlines, fuck yeah that's awesome
5451080	5455080	Yeah right, it's a little weird admittedly but
5455080	5459080	Like I would take a Burger King costume, can we get the Burger King
5459080	5461080	Sneak King, the Sneak King level
5461080	5463080	Hell yes
5463080	5468080	I did not find the advertisement levels to be like in your face offensive
5468080	5473080	But that's the thing, even the Mercedes Benz one, it's almost kind of just like a silly
5473080	5478080	It's not going to get me to think Mercedes Benz, it's been like, okay
5478080	5480080	I don't know
5480080	5484080	We were talking about this a little bit last week with the whole Lightning doing the
5484080	5487080	Was it Prada, no Louis Vuitton, I can't remember
5487080	5489080	Exactly, whoa look at that, effective marketing
5489080	5493080	You can't even fucker remember which fucking clothing line
5493080	5496080	We have an email on that, I think we have an email on this, we'll get to that later
5496080	5500080	That's so amazing, so effective, great job spending that advertising money
5500080	5502080	It was one of those, was it Coach?
5502080	5504080	I don't know, it was one of those
5504080	5507080	Alright anyhow, the memes that came out of it are priceless
5507080	5510080	Anyhow, one more for you guys then we'll get to the classic game of the week
5510080	5513080	And that has to do with the term Let's Play
5513080	5517080	You know Let's Play is a term you usually hear on YouTube like
5517080	5521080	Let's play such and such game for, let's play Minecraft for an hour
5521080	5523080	Let's play whatever
5523080	5527080	Well at one point apparently Sony Computer Entertainment America
5527080	5531080	Tried to trademark Let's Play and that happened in October
5531080	5534080	That Sony actually applied for a trademark on the phrase
5534080	5539080	Saying quote, electronic transmission and streaming of video games via global and local computer networks
5539080	5544080	Streaming of audio, visual and audio-visual material via global and local computer networks
5544080	5550080	Now interesting because Let's Play, that term wasn't really invented by Sony at all
5550080	5553080	That's been around on YouTube for a very long time
5553080	5559080	So I'm not sure what Sony's trying to do with this except maybe keep it away from Microsoft
5559080	5563080	You know I thought when I first heard this I was like
5563080	5569080	Oh, well okay, usually video game consoles have their little slogans that come with it
5569080	5573080	Like there's, I don't know, there was get in or get out
5573080	5577080	Or you know Genesis does what Nintendon't
5577080	5579080	I'm trying to think what some of the new ones are
5579080	5581080	Is it jump in for Xbox?
5581080	5583080	When Playstation had
5583080	5587080	It just does everything
5587080	5590080	Oh yeah that's their thing, it just does everything right?
5590080	5595080	So I thought okay well if Let's Play is like their little slogan, Playstation, Let's Play
5595080	5599080	Like I was like oh okay, I get that, that doesn't seem seedy at all
5599080	5604080	Well then if that was the case then yeah they should trademark Playstation Let's Play
5604080	5606080	That makes sense
5606080	5612080	But when you hear that the definition says electronic transmission and streaming of video games
5612080	5614080	That's not what they were going for
5614080	5616080	No that's just them being fucking assholes is what it is
5616080	5620080	Or maybe they wanted to brand their Twitch area Let's Play
5620080	5624080	I don't know, I kind of think part of it was to keep the term away from Microsoft maybe
5624080	5626080	Especially as a lot of it's open
5626080	5628080	Where is it their fucking right to keep that term away from
5628080	5630080	It's not theirs to fucking keep away from anybody
5630080	5632080	You know what Loki, here's the good news
5632080	5634080	It was denied
5634080	5638080	The United States Patent and Trademark Office refused Sony's application
5638080	5640080	But not for the reason you think
5640080	5648080	Because of the likelihood of confusion with LP Let's Play
5648080	5652080	Which I have never fucking heard of this I don't know what it is
5652080	5654080	I don't think it has anything to do with video games
5654080	5660080	But for whatever reason the patent office said it was a conflict
5660080	5664080	And now Sony has six months to make a case for itself and argue against the decision
5664080	5668080	But now that this is out there you're probably going to see people file briefs
5668080	5674080	Probably YouTube or Google is going to get involved saying nope
5674080	5678080	I don't understand how you can trademark something that's not your fucking
5678080	5682080	Trademarks are really stupid especially when you work in that sense
5682080	5684080	What are they using this for is what I want to know
5684080	5688080	If it's a tagline for their brand then fine
5688080	5692080	Then allow them to trademark PlayStation Let's Play or something like that
5692080	5694080	But not just Let's Play
5694080	5696080	It's too vague
5696080	5700080	I mean it's even like the whole candy and crush shit
5700080	5704080	Or saga or all that is too vague
5704080	5708080	I don't understand especially when the general community
5708080	5714080	Knows that this has been used before they even had streaming on that console
5714080	5716080	I don't even understand how
5716080	5720080	But of course the trademark office being fucking retarded doesn't know any better
5720080	5722080	So they were just like okay sure
5722080	5726080	Dungeon Buster says in chat the trademark office is so broken
5726080	5729080	I get the feeling some companies think they can get away with anything
5729080	5732080	You know what's funny I googled the LP Let's Play thing
5732080	5736080	Trying to see what it was and all that I get are results that are with this story
5736080	5738080	About the Sony trademark
5738080	5742080	But I did get I guess the actual trademark website has it
5742080	5746080	And it's some company Let's Play of America out of
5747080	5749080	I'm probably mispronouncing this horribly
5749080	5751080	It's in Georgia
5751080	5753080	It's Smirna, Georgia
5753080	5756080	And it's entertainment services
5756080	5759080	Namely to provide online and offline opportunities for video game enthusiasts
5759080	5762080	To meet and participate in live video game tournaments
5762080	5765080	And on demand console gaming
5765080	5768080	So I wonder if it's some type of store
5768080	5770080	It might be a video game store
5770080	5773080	And do we have these people fucking harassing you
5773080	5775080	Harassing YouTubers or anything like that
5775080	5777080	No because they're decent
5777080	5779080	I mean I assume it's a decent company
5779080	5781080	But then you have like these big
5781080	5785080	Well plus LP Let's Play is like way different
5785080	5788080	You're not going to confuse that with a YouTuber
5788080	5792080	Especially if this is what I think it is and it's some type of store
5792080	5794080	Anyway
5794080	5796080	I'm sure there is someone
5796080	5799080	We should be thanking them right now because it's because of them
5799080	5802080	That little company in Smirna that Sony got denied
5803080	5805080	No I don't think it's because of them at all
5805080	5808080	It's because the trademark office is just kind of stupid
5808080	5811080	And so they're like people are going to confuse that
5811080	5814080	No one even knows what that fucking company is
5814080	5816080	No one's going to confuse that at all
5816080	5818080	I mean like let's see here
5818080	5821080	I'm just curious I'm going to type in Let's Play into Google
5821080	5825080	Let's see if we get a nice Wikipedia article or something like that
5825080	5829080	Oh hey look here's a Wikipedia article about Let's Play
5829080	5832080	And let's see if we have like the history
5832080	5835080	If like it figured out where that came from
5835080	5839080	I'm sure that they know who
5839080	5841080	Let's see here
5841080	5844080	I was just wondering if they had an idea of who coined the phrase
5844080	5847080	I have this weird feeling
5847080	5851080	Sony is going to very like out of left field
5851080	5854080	And very like discreetly just kind of say
5854080	5856080	We were only getting it to protect the term
5856080	5858080	Oh fuck them
5858080	5859080	I think that's what's going to happen
5859080	5860080	They're going to come out and say
5860080	5862080	We were only getting it so that nobody else could have it
5862080	5865080	Into which I say oh fuck you
5865080	5868080	No one asks you to fucking do this
5868080	5870080	I don't fucking believe you for a second
5870080	5872080	Alright
5872080	5874080	There's many people in the chat tonight that are saying
5874080	5875080	I've missed Loki rants
5875080	5878080	I killed your dog so no one else could kill your dog
5878080	5880080	Stop it
5880080	5881080	I protected him
5881080	5882080	He won't die anymore
5882080	5883080	He's already dead
5883080	5884080	You're awful
5884080	5887080	Alright we have got to go back to a simpler time
5887080	5888080	Let's go back to a simpler time
5888080	5891080	When you couldn't look up trademarks online
5891080	5893080	We're going to get to the classic game of the week
5893080	5896080	But before I get to the cutesy little music that goes with that
5896080	5898080	I have to introduce a special guest to the show tonight
5898080	5900080	Filling in for the one and only Dark Soccer tonight
5900080	5903080	Say hello everybody in studio again is Alan
5903080	5904080	Hi
5904080	5905080	Hi Alan how you doing?
5905080	5906080	Good
5906080	5907080	Thanks for being on the show
5907080	5908080	I'm sorry you couldn't be here from the beginning tonight
5908080	5910080	But I know you had work and you got to pay the bills and all that
5910080	5911080	So it's important
5911080	5912080	Yeah
5912080	5913080	But you're here now
5913080	5914080	Yes
5914080	5915080	Thanks for being here
5915080	5916080	You're welcome
5917080	5918080	Ingress and Skyrim
5918080	5919080	Yeah
5919080	5921080	And I logged into 14 a couple nights ago for like 10 minutes
5921080	5922080	You didn't see
5922080	5925080	I did it behind your back because you would have lost your mind
5925080	5927080	Run a dungeon with me
5927080	5930080	You've been playing a lot of Skyrim and I kind of tease you about it
5930080	5934080	What's your MO for playing so much Skyrim these days?
5934080	5937080	Well I hadn't touched it in two years
5937080	5941080	And I sort of looked up the mods for it
5941080	5944080	Because you know Fallout 4 came out
5944080	5947080	And basically all of the Bethesda mod community is now modding for that
5947080	5951080	Even though the creator dev kit hasn't been released for it yet
5951080	5953080	There's still like dozens and hundreds of mods
5953080	5958080	So I was like what has been put out for Skyrim
5958080	5963080	In the two plus years that I have literally been on media blackout for it
5963080	5966080	And there's like hundreds of stuff
5966080	5973080	Like there's campaigns, quests, NPCs, armory skins, texture reskins, lighting
5974080	5977080	And this is much more than just the Steam workshop right?
5977080	5979080	Oh yeah no no no this is
5979080	5980080	Oh that's child's play
5980080	5981080	Select all
5981080	5982080	Add
5982080	5983080	Yeah
5983080	5986080	He has this whole little thing and I always confuse it for his work
5986080	5987080	Because it looks so similar
5987080	5991080	I use a mod manager because I run so many mods that you really
5991080	5996080	Like if you just unzip stuff and dump it into the Skyrim install directory by the 30th mod
5996080	5998080	It's like oh I don't like this or it crashes my game
5998080	6000080	You're not removing that shit by yourself
6000080	6007080	By picking out random ass texture files you need an application to sort of figure out what you're overriding
6007080	6011080	But this Skyrim train has been holding you for a good long while now
6011080	6015080	Like I feel like you got back into Skyrim like all the way back in October or November and you're still going
6015080	6020080	Yeah I think yeah it was around November
6020080	6022080	Before Thanksgiving
6022080	6024080	So do you think you'll ever get on the Fallout 4 bandwagon?
6024080	6033080	I'm waiting for some of the official Bethesda patches to come out just because the physics engine is amazing
6033080	6039080	It's an incredible open world and it's broken as shit and there's like quest breaking bugs everywhere and some people never see them
6039080	6043080	It's just Bethesda though that's how their games are
6043080	6045080	Like there's this unofficial
6045080	6051080	Maybe Bethesda should try to get the trademark for let's break or let's patch
6051080	6052080	What are you guys thinking?
6052080	6059080	There's this unofficial Skyrim patch that was done by the modding community that doesn't need like a script extender
6059080	6062080	Or any of the weird stuff that you have to get the more advanced mods to run
6062080	6068080	And it fixes like hundreds of legitimate Bethesda bugs that they never got to
6068080	6070080	Like if you accidentally
6070080	6075080	Like if you forget to take an optional treasure item from a thief's quest thing and you finish the quest
6075080	6081080	Then you go back in and it'll disappear the unofficial Skyrim patch puts it there so that oh yeah I forgot to steal this
6081080	6087080	Just weird stuff that would break or disappear that Bethesda themselves never got to
6087080	6097080	So even if you have no interest in modding and you're playing on PC just getting that unofficial Skyrim patch fixes like hundreds of tiny little issues
6097080	6100080	I would still love them to bring Skyrim to Playstation 4 and Xbox One
6100080	6106080	I was so disappointed was it like the last E3 when they had like you know their show the screenshots and everything
6106080	6109080	And then one of it was Skyrim like fuck yes Skyrim HD
6110080	6112080	And then nope
6112080	6116080	Alright well before we get to the classic game which you're here to fill in for Dark Soccer tonight
6116080	6117080	Yes
6117080	6120080	Quickly like 30 second opinions on some of the stories we talked about already
6120080	6127080	Oculus Rift for $599 will you let your boyfriend Rob Roberts buy that
6127080	6128080	Yes $600
6128080	6129080	You can have one
6129080	6130080	Really?
6130080	6131080	Yeah with the Powerball Bunny you're gonna win
6134080	6136080	Would you get one for $600?
6136080	6138080	I'd share yours I wouldn't get one
6138080	6142080	You'd push me to buy it and then reap the benefits of that I get it
6142080	6143080	Yes
6143080	6144080	That's fine
6144080	6152080	Since you do a lot of PC gaming I'm sure you are experienced with the crack I mean not that you pirate games but the cracking community
6152080	6155080	I mean you know I'm sure you've been into it a lot of them
6155080	6161080	Saying now that games are too hard to crack do you think that finally pirates may be beaten
6161080	6171080	Well I mean I know that companies have caught shit for it in the past but Ubisoft and Sony and some other PC things would do the whole weird rootkit
6171080	6179080	Stuff where you have to go into your hosts file and redirect the IP address that sniffs if you have a license or not and point it to you know a dead IP
6179080	6183080	All this weird or just like unplug the internet and play this game without the internet
6183080	6197080	Which is funny that people will do that like they're willing to forego their entire internet connection to play a game but then when Diablo 3 for PC says you need an internet connection to play this people lose their mind
6197080	6204080	But you'll turn it off to pirate it but you don't want it on when you pay for it like okay
6204080	6209080	Alright and lastly on a scale of 1 to 10 how excited would you be for a Sonic Adventure 3
6210080	6214080	I don't care about Sonic
6214080	6216080	So 1
6216080	6224080	Yeah I mean if it's good great but even what's the Sonic one that came out in the last 3 or 4 years that actually was really good
6224080	6226080	Generations
6226080	6229080	What's the one that came out last year that was kind of bad colors or no
6229080	6235080	I think that was the Wii U one last year there was Sonic 4 episode 1 and 2 was kind of crap
6235080	6237080	Yeah
6237080	6243080	The Sonic game that was really good was the Sonic Transformed Racing was a good Sonic game
6243080	6245080	You actually played that
6245080	6247080	It was a kart racer but
6247080	6249080	Sonic Lost World as well
6249080	6251080	Was it Sonic Boom?
6251080	6255080	What was the one that has the cartoon that goes with it?
6255080	6257080	Isn't that it?
6257080	6259080	That's Sonic Boom
6259080	6261080	Rise of Lyric
6261080	6263080	More shitty friends
6263080	6267080	Let's go back to a more classic time when Sonic didn't have any friends
6269080	6271080	In fact I don't think Sonic was even out yet
6271080	6273080	I think this game predates Sonic or it's around the same time
6273080	6275080	Around the same time
6275080	6283080	This time Alan is going to step into not the gaming vault but his deep PC gaming archive
6283080	6287080	And find a game that he thinks hey you guys should check this game out
6287080	6290080	And I believe you can because it's on a lot of different modern platforms
6290080	6292080	It's the classic game of the week
6292080	6296080	Alan what is tonight's classic game of the week?
6296080	6300080	In the states in its initial release it was called Out of This World
6300080	6303080	But most of us now know it as Another World
6303080	6307080	And this game has a lot of ambient sound to it
6307080	6310080	So there's a little bit of intro music here in the beginning
6310080	6312080	But that's about all you're going to get that's just going to be ambient music
6312080	6314080	So take it away Alan
6314080	6318080	So this game came out I believe the first systems
6318080	6323080	The systems that were actually made for originally were the Amiga and Atari ST
6323080	6325080	Which came out in 1991
6325080	6328080	Since then this game has been released on
6328080	6335080	Amiga, Android, Apple IIGS, Atari Jaguar, Atari ST, Blackberry 10, Game Boy Advance
6335080	6343080	iOS, Linux, MacOS, Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS, Nintendo 3DS, OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4
6343080	6347080	Whoa sorry those beeps were really loud I apologize
6347080	6350080	It was very loud in contrast to the music I'll turn that down a little bit sorry guys
6350080	6357080	PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Sega CD, Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo, Symbian, Tapwave Zodiac
6357080	6360080	We're getting into platforms I've never even heard of these before
6360080	6365080	The Wii U, Windows Mobile, Xbox One, and the 3DO
6365080	6369080	So much like Myst and Half Life
6369080	6372080	This game is both iconic and prolific
6372080	6374080	It was released everywhere
6374080	6380080	It was developed and released by Delphine Software
6380080	6386080	Did the development and Interplay Entertainment did the console ports
6386080	6394080	Publishers were Delphine Software, US Gold, Interplay Entertainment, and Virgin Interactive did the bulk of them
6394080	6397080	This game was considered revolutionary
6397080	6403080	Because in 1991 games were entirely sprite based
6403080	6405080	3D wasn't really a tangible thing yet
6405080	6410080	We still had a few years to go before we got to Star Fox and the FX chip and all that
6410080	6417080	And this was also before the big adventure and RPG craze of the mid and late 90s
6417080	6421080	Of the full motion video with the live actor
6421080	6427080	But they interacted with sprites, but there were real people like Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest, all that stuff
6427080	6435080	So the thing that was really ahead of its time about Another World was the developer
6435080	6439080	Last name is French, I think it's Chihai
6439080	6450080	Eric Chihai, what he did is he used motion capture and the cool 3D polygons that were possible on the Amiga system
6450080	6456080	And he did 2D cell sprites over it, so he did a rotoscoping effect
6456080	6465080	So the motion capture, even though it's flat 2D and looks very crude, it looks life like
6465080	6470080	For anyone that remembers the Lord of the Ring movies that came out
6470080	6474080	I think the Baskin one that came out in the 80s that had rotoscoping
6474080	6479080	It's very much that effect where you can see that it's something that's drawn over a 3D model
6479080	6487080	Very cinematic, the game is about a physicist or whatever working on his particle accelerator
6487080	6491080	It gets struck by lightning and he is teleported to another world
6491080	6497080	This game is very frantic, when you are teleported to the alien world
6497080	6499080	You are underwater and you are actively drowning
6499080	6503080	So if you do not press up on the D-pad first thing, you will die straight up
6503080	6506080	Just the game, good luck and then you die
6506080	6512080	As soon as you climb out of the pool, a monster chases you, you get captured by an alien race
6512080	6518080	It's kind of the adventure game equivalent of that movie Run Lola Run which takes place in real time
6518080	6520080	That movie is so badass
6520080	6528080	Yeah, so Run Lola Run, the first five minutes is her basically finding out that a drug dealer is going to kill her boyfriend unless she goes and gets money
6528080	6533080	So the movie takes place in real time where she's just running and this game is kind of like that
6533080	6538080	If you stand still, you're probably going to die and you will die a lot
6542080	6549080	One of the great things about Another World is that you're transported to this alien planet
6549080	6554080	No one speaks English, you have no idea what's happening to you, why these guards are after you
6554080	6558080	Aside from the fact that you're a weird pink human looking dude
6558080	6563080	There's really no story aside from just run, run, run and live
6563080	6568080	And the resolution or the ending is actually very bittersweet, it's not even clear
6568080	6577080	This is a bit of a spoiler, you're not dead but you get injured very badly and the game ends on that note
6577080	6579080	So it's kind of a downer
6582080	6586080	It has lots of platforming and timing elements
6586080	6590080	The controls are a bit weird, they're hard to get used to at first
6592080	6601080	And then there's a ray gun that you get where you press hold to, press second level charge is to do a shield which is very important
6601080	6604080	And then third level is to break through walls
6604080	6610080	And there's a sequence where you have to like break a dam where all this water flows through and you have to make sure you don't drown
6610080	6613080	And it'll take you like 20 or 30 attempts to get through that part
6614080	6622080	For people who have it completely memorized and can one shot the entire game from start to finish
6622080	6627080	It's about 15 minutes long, maybe upwards of 20
6627080	6631080	So the full experience is learning how to get through everything
6631080	6635080	If you can just blitz through the game easily 30 minutes or less
6635080	6644080	It's going to be an intense 30 minutes or 20 minutes where you're convinced at any moment you're going to die and have to start over from the start of that action sequence
6644080	6648080	But yeah, very short game once you learn the ins and outs of it
6650080	6654080	Kind of an appropriate game to follow up a week of awesome games done quick
6654080	6657080	Because that was kind of part of the charm of it was learning how to speed run it basically
6657080	6660080	Some comments from our chat, also Alan if I could
6660080	6662080	I don't have access to chat right now so thank you
6662080	6667080	Dungeon Buster in Chat says if people thought the new Tomb Raider had gruesome death scenes another world beat them to it
6667080	6668080	Yes
6668080	6673080	Tigerclaw says there was a sequel out of this world that came out on the Sega CD and you played as the alien
6673080	6676080	Yes, the developer
6676080	6683080	Because one of the things when you get captured is you have this alien friend who is in the cell with you
6683080	6687080	And you break out and you sort of help him in the background and he helps you
6687080	6692080	You don't really know what his deal is because again there's no explanation
6692080	6694080	You just have to run to survive
6694080	6701080	So there's this alien dude who ultimately carries you away from this horrible city that you've been trying not to get shot up in
6701080	6707080	He puts you on a pterodactyl and flies you away and you're like critically possibly mortally injured
6707080	6713080	His name according to Interplay who I think developed the sequel called Heart of the Alien
6714080	6720080	Is unofficially or officially named Buddy but my friend Rob and I used to call him Marchubo
6720080	6727080	Because when you wake up in the cell and you break out of the cell and you kill the guard he puts his hand on his shoulder
6727080	6733080	And this very weird sort of highly compressed audio of him goes Marchubo
6733080	6738080	That's his like greeting to you so that was what we called him
6739080	6741080	The sequel
6742080	6752080	Originally Eric the developer Chihai said that the same exact scenario of the first game just from Buddy's point of view
6752080	6759080	Is what he wanted the sequel to be but ultimately it takes place right after Another World ends
6759080	6766080	Where you take the scientist guy and you lay him down and then you start going through like your tribe or your village or whatever
6766080	6770080	And then it's the same basically more of the same lots of running to live and survive
6770080	6777080	Way more rotoscoped motion capture in the sequel as well some of it is done very well and looks great
6777080	6779080	A lot of it is kind of bad
6779080	6789080	Only released for the Sega CD but if you Google Heart of the Alien Sourceforge it's been ported to PC I think for free
6789080	6795080	Like it's not even on good old games I think you can just download and play it and I didn't know that until I looked up the information for this
6795080	6802080	So yeah if you want to check out the sequel just to see how good or bad it was and you have a PC you can just get it
6802080	6805080	And Tiger class saying the sequel explains what happens to the human so
6805080	6808080	Yes and there is a big spoiler there which I will not say
6808080	6810080	Alright
6810080	6816080	So this is one of those things where I've only been able to pick the classic game of the week four or five times
6816080	6824080	I know I did the Oracle of Ages and Seasons for the Gameboy Advance the Zelda thing that I think Capcom or a branch of Capcom developed those
6824080	6834080	And lots of King's Quest games but when I saw that a game that was this ahead of its time and really kind of showed you know as far as
6834080	6842080	Cinematic like you know visual narratives without expository you know there is no speech really no text
6842080	6848080	But you are definitely invested in these characters because you want dude to live
6849080	6855080	It was really ahead of its time and when I saw on the wiki that that was not represented yet on classic game of the week so I figured it was a no brainer
6855080	6860080	No I think that's a great choice so there it is your classic game of the week another world
6860080	6873080	You can get it on Steam I think they did a 20 or 25 year no it was 2008 so I think it would have been a 15 year remake where they did like HD backgrounds
6873080	6882080	And they you know better higher sampling of audio so you can get it on Steam I think it's one of those games that goes on sale for like a buck 97
6882080	6887080	So if you've never played this and you have a controller I would not play this with a keyboard definitely check out another world
6887080	6896080	Alright thank you Alan great choice and again very landmark because it was in that era of sprite games but really started
6896080	6901080	It really showed what 3D was going to look like and polygons
6901080	6907080	Excellent you're being commended by the chat room there for your choice there tonight even if you didn't pick Halo
6907080	6913080	But we'll just have to do that another time when Jamie's not here and then nobody can tell her about it because we will all die
6913080	6919080	Alright anyway all kidding aside let's take a quick break we have plenty more show to come
6919080	6924080	Alan are you going to join us for the second half of the show since you're all done now are you going to answer emails take calls with us or
6924080	6928080	No I can do that I just wanted to do something work related really quickly during the break
6928080	6933080	Okay sounds good so Alan will be back for part B Loki and myself here with you to talk some more news
6933080	6942080	We're going to talk about potentially a Watch Dogs 2 next year and then we're going to talk about you know what it's a Half Life 3 story
6942080	6953080	But Half Life 3 not confirmed in fact it's a very interesting story you'll just have to stay tuned we'll talk about it when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio
6959080	6969080	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 627th episode for this January the 10th of 2016
6969080	6976080	Myself and Loki here in studio with special guest Alan who I think he ran out to respond to some chat room comments from his own computer
6976080	6985080	He'll be back in studio here in a moment not with us tonight Dark Sakura but you know you can't feel too bad for her because she's at Disneyland right now
6985080	6992080	Having a blast probably riding Hyperspace Mountain over and over again she'll be back next week I'm sure to tell us all about it
6992080	6999080	Although actually she's probably doing her bucket of meat dinner right now because I'm sure they made reservations and Victoria she goes to Disneyland so much
6999080	7005080	Yeah she knows all the employees there it's the restaurant's last hurrah today because they're bulldozing it to make
7005080	7006080	Which one?
7006080	7012080	It's called Bucket I don't it's the Big Thunder Ranch I think is what it's called but everybody calls it Bucket of Meat because you know what you order there?
7012080	7021080	Buckets full of meat I know right Loki see and you didn't want to go to Disneyland oh if all I had to do is be like well yeah Loki there's teacups but there's also endless buckets of meat
7021080	7025080	But now they have been bulldozed or will be bulldozed to make room for charger
7025080	7030080	It's so hard to find like food there because like all the other places serve the same crap it's just like garbage
7030080	7036080	Disney has some pretty awesome dining but you do have to be willing to pay the higher dollar for it but I'm telling you that
7037080	7047080	Karthay Circle that's a California adventure seriously one of the best restaurants I've eaten at period and Alan and I will splurge once in a while and eat at fine dining restaurants
7047080	7055080	You know especially for events like anniversary and so forth and that Karthay Circle is one of the very very best we've ever been to and it was worth it
7055080	7061080	In fact funny enough I guess transition Alan and I actually celebrated our six year anniversary this week
7061080	7062080	Congratulations
7062080	7063080	Thank you very much
7063080	7076080	And you know not to be too embarrassing on my little podcast but Alan has been a huge supporter of this show and like not a lot of partners would understand the commitment something like this takes
7076080	7080080	But Alan not only understands that but here he is participating in that
7080080	7081080	He can't shut me up
7081080	7088080	That's part of it but I'm just he loves to come on here and point out when I'm wrong that's really the flip of it
7088080	7094080	But no I'm extremely lucky to have a support like that so I'm not going to get too gushy but a little bit and so there you go
7094080	7098080	But this week we went to for the very first time you want to tell the listeners about this real quick?
7098080	7104080	We went to a restaurant that does at your table fondue for every course
7105080	7119080	It's kind of scary because the main like they give you meat that's seasoned and marinated and prepared and you have like the big kettle or fondue pot as it will that's on a heat thing
7119080	7131080	And it's boiling oil basically so you put the meat there's like dipping batter like tempura so you take your skewer and you take your piece of like what you had duck and you swirl it in the thing and you have to
7132080	7140080	We had our phones out for stopwatch because you want to cook it for like two minutes but you don't want to overdo it and burn it but you don't want to eat raw meat and get sick
7140080	7153080	So there's like a spatter risk element to it so it's kind of low key stressful maybe more stressful but the food once you put it like you can't eat it off the skewer because you'll burn your mouth and look like you have herpes
7153080	7165080	But you take it off the skewer and then you pop the filet mignon or the sirloin or the whatever and it is so good it's one of the best meals I've ever had it's just weird
7165080	7168080	I was dealing with like a pot of scalding disfiguring oil
7168080	7179080	That dinner was Friday night and I'm still full like I had we went to another restaurant today with my just honest aside with my parents my sister my sister was just coincidentally in town today so we all went out for like brunch today
7179080	7186080	And I ordered a soup and salad how often does that happen where Rob gets a soup and salad but I was still I'm like still full for
7186080	7187080	I was like Benihana's
7187080	7191080	That's like you have to prepare for that but like not eating for a day
7191080	7202080	Anyway so the melting pot was funny but yes boiling oil and in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com YYR says weren't there Disney villains or cartoon villains who threatened to boil someone in oil
7202080	7210080	Yes I think that's a common threat and that's of serious business like they have all these contraptions to take the boiling oil away safety's huge over there obviously
7210080	7216080	Eventually you know you've got bits of batter and spice and food grease and the oil so it gets dirty
7216080	7220080	It's like a deep fryer anyone who's worked in fast food knows the deep fryer gets nasty
7220080	7230080	And then also the oil itself will scald past a certain point it starts to stink and smoke but you can't have a waiter with like you know oven mitt
7230080	7241080	Take it off your table and tra la la back to the kitchen because all I have to do is roll their ankle and oh my god just like death everywhere so they have this
7241080	7255080	Vice that goes under the pot and then there's a thing that they then has a big crank or a handle that like goes kachunk and it like screws into the opening of the pot and like secures it and they take this whole apparatus away
7255080	7262080	So it's like hot grease containment control like in Monsters Inc. It's this big ritual
7262080	7268080	Alright we gotta get back to games we can talk about food all night believe me we could we gotta get back to games what
7268080	7269080	That dessert right
7269080	7276080	Oh my god chocolate fondue yeah oh my god marshmallow and broken oreos oh my god I'm gonna I'm gonna shit just thinking about it alright
7276080	7281080	No seriously though we gotta get back to some gaming news rapid fire news time Loki
7281080	7292080	Alright so Shovel Knight is gonna be getting the amiibo soon and also they're saying though that what's kind of unique about this is you can actually read it through the packaging
7292080	7300080	So if you don't want to take that out you can just leave it in its box and play the game based on that
7300080	7306080	They really should do that with all the amiibos I guess they're worried that people are gonna like copy them or something I don't know
7306080	7312080	I had no idea about that but I guess and Shane was telling me about this I did get my Shovel Knight amiibo because I know you all care
7312080	7320080	But I guess another company made those that particular amiibo was made by the people that did the infinity figures it was not the usual amiibo makers
7320080	7328080	So that's why some things are a little different and even the figure itself looks a little different from the other amiibo so just interesting
7328080	7331080	Does it unlock a character in Mario Maker?
7331080	7340080	I don't know about Mario Maker I don't think so I just know about the co-op mode in actual Shovel Knight itself although I haven't used it yet
7340080	7344080	Because Alan won't play those games with me because he's too busy in Skyrim
7344080	7356080	Speaking of Skyrim one of the I think more popular mods or funny mods that I've seen was the mod that turned all the dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage
7356080	7358080	Oh yeah!
7358080	7360080	Oh yeah!
7360080	7376080	So now that we have Fallout 4 it is only fit that we have a sequel to that said mod now with the mod that will turn or they call it the Macho Claws mod it will turn the death claws into Macho Man Randy Savage
7376080	7378080	Oh yeah!
7378080	7384080	And it's as hilarious as the previous mod so you can check that out
7384080	7386080	Do you run on Skyrim?
7386080	7388080	I do have a dragon mod but no I don't there are some
7388080	7390080	Yours just makes the dragon naked or something right?
7390080	7392080	No
7392080	7396080	It does reskin them so they're all purpley and look different but it also adds a new
7396080	7398080	So they look like Spyro?
7398080	7402080	No well there is a My Little Pony dragon mod where it looks like
7402080	7404080	Or Thomas the Tank Engine that's like
7404080	7406080	Yeah Thomas the Tank Engine is yeah
7406080	7408080	That's the kind of stuff I would play Skyrim with
7408080	7416080	That's what I wanted like I wanted to have like a play through of Skyrim that was just random mods like just like you take a bunch of mods and how somehow randomize everything into it
7416080	7424080	The swearing crabs that have the cigar and the top hat and they say fuck you when you get close to them
7424080	7436080	That's the kind of shit I want in Skyrim can we maybe for like a future like let's play before Sony trademarks that term maybe you could help me load up Skyrim with a bunch of like dipshit mods and then I could play that as a let's play
7436080	7440080	Oh like the rainbow gun or something that makes people blow up
7440080	7442080	The dubstep gun from Saints Row that's always awesome
7442080	7444080	Alright back to news
7444080	7458080	Alright anyways speaking of mods there is yet another mod coming out this time for Grand Theft Auto 5 and what's kind of cool about this one is it's basically kind of creating it's almost like Watch Dogs
7458080	7462080	So they have the Watch Dogs hacking system and they put it into Grand Theft Auto 4
7462080	7470080	So you can use your cell phone to you know mess with the different like stop lights they had cars you can make cars like accelerate uncontrollably
7470080	7478080	You can explode fire hydrants a bunch of different hacking features and it looks pretty awesome from like the screenshots I've seen in the video
7478080	7486080	So definitely something worth checking out if you have Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC it's the Watch Dogs hack script they call it
7486080	7496080	But definitely something I would love to check out if it would run on my PC and if I had Grand Theft Auto 5 on my PC which I don't
7496080	7502080	Alright well for those of you that were really hoping and praying that maybe there would be more coming to Smash Brothers on 3DS and Wii U
7502080	7510080	Nope Bayonetta really is going to be the end of it and we know this because Masahiro Sakurai has confirmed he's moving on to another project
7510080	7516080	That was confirmed in the latest edition of Weekly Famitsu and of course he's not going to tell you what that project is
7516080	7523080	He just says I want to enjoy every day like it's Sunday however that doesn't mean the next job hasn't been decided
7523080	7531080	So that was what the in response to a question about 2016 ambitions and plans so who knows that could be Super Smash Brothers NX
7531080	7536080	But also keep in mind he has done more than that there was the Kid Icarus reboot so you never know
7536080	7543080	I think when you're Masahiro Sakurai and you're responsible for a huge franchise like that you get to make other games you want to make
7543080	7549080	I think he gets to do other stuff and SHO 100 Matt in chat over at live.vlognetwork.com says let the man do something else
7549080	7557080	And I agree I think you could safely turn over Smash Brothers to maybe another team that's maybe worked under Sakurai and let him go do something else
7558080	7564080	Alright if you would like to experience some classic Virtual Console games on the Wii U
7564080	7569080	It's pretty cool a little twist on the usual Wii U Virtual Console fare
7569080	7577080	These are all Zapper games that came out now we already had Duck Hunt available on the Virtual Console
7577080	7585080	But this last week gave us a better light gun game in the form of Hogan's Alley is now available for the Wii U Virtual Console
7585080	7591080	So are these like using the Wii Zapper still or are they using just like you tap the screen or something like that?
7591080	7593080	You just use the regular Wiimote
7593080	7596080	That's what I meant like you use the Wii Remote
7596080	7598080	Yep that's how you do it you use the Wii Remote to do it
7598080	7604080	And I thought there was a way you can actually use the Wii Remote with the gamepad because I've seen that happen on Metroid Prime
7604080	7607080	And that gamepad actually has a little infrared sensor built into it
7607080	7610080	And you don't look totally stupid doing that
7610080	7612080	Yeah so you can do that
7612080	7619080	Let's see also yeah and it says that they have off TV play so I would think you'd just be able to use the stylus
7619080	7621080	But maybe that makes it too easy I don't know
7621080	7627080	But anyway also available Wild Gunman which is kind of super basic that's just a quick draw game there's really nothing to that game
7627080	7633080	But then also you might remember the Adventures of Bayou Billy this was a game that was pretty difficult that was like half platformer
7633080	7637080	Then half like light gun game it had certain light gun stages in it
7637080	7642080	And if you didn't have the light gun you had to use the good old moving the cursor around the screen and hitting the trigger
7642080	7646080	And it was pretty much impossible if you didn't have the light gun in order to beat Bayou Billy
7646080	7649080	So you can try for yourself on Virtual Console
7649080	7653080	Last week we talked a bit about Final Fantasy 9 coming out for the PC
7653080	7660080	And now the game's official Steam page is available and there are some bells and whistles that you can expect in the Final Fantasy 9 remake
7660080	7664080	And that is you'll be able to turn off random encounters
7664080	7670080	That's pretty cool you could actually just turn off the random encounters and you could just play through the game for the story
7670080	7678080	And then I suppose you could take on the bosses you might have to get really creative to beat them without the experience from the trash mobs
7678080	7683080	But I know there are some people that are playing through Final Fantasy 7 with the whole no encounter thing in place
7683080	7688080	And then using the other cheats to come with the game to push through it just to experience the story
7688080	7695080	And I'm sure some people will be doing that as well with Final Fantasy 9 which is currently imminent basically on Steam
7695080	7697080	You see the page there for it
7697080	7702080	Alright let's take a chance on FOOGLE
7702080	7707080	We're gonna take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together you get FOOGLE
7707080	7722080	And every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we do like to ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio
7722080	7730080	And then also on Google Plus which is still around for you non-facebook people that's google.com slash plus orange lounge radio
7730080	7736080	And the question we asked tonight has to do with the story that we had earlier about the Mario Maker DLC
7736080	7744080	Because remember we talked about that Southwest had actually sponsored that so we wanted to ask our listeners this week
7744080	7752080	What costume would you put in Super Mario Maker and for fun who do you think should sponsor the costume?
7752080	7755080	Alan I'd be very curious to hear your answer in a minute
7755080	7758080	But in the meantime let's get to some of the chatters answers over on Facebook
7758080	7764080	Andy R says I don't know what costume but clearly Red Bull has to sponsor something right?
7764080	7768080	That's all they do these days yet somehow they still sell that disgusting drink
7768080	7769080	Hey
7769080	7771080	That Loki lives on
7771080	7778080	Degenerate Johnny says for obvious reasons I would want to see Mario in N7 armor from Mass Effect
7779080	7786080	As for sponsors as much as I would love to see the N7 armor sponsored by Jagermeister it'll most likely be sponsored by EA
7786080	7793080	Not to be a buzzkill Degenerate Johnny because I love that idea but EA and Wii U they don't really get along anymore
7793080	7795080	That was a bad breakup
7795080	7802080	How about Redertainment is up next on Facebook saying a red star power up brought to you by Heineken
7802080	7804080	Because there's a red star in the Heineken logo
7804080	7808080	Okay, maybe not how about wood Mario brought to you by Viagra
7808080	7811080	Because never mind I won't explain it
7811080	7816080	As Joe and Hunter Matt says I'm gonna rehash that ridiculous Apple is buying Nintendo rumor and say Apple
7816080	7821080	Mario's costume would feature a black turtleneck and jeans to resemble Steve Jobs
7821080	7823080	Luigi would also have a Tim Cook costume
7823080	7828080	Hopefully the costume pack won't bend the game or brick when you update the OS
7828080	7831080	And that's what the little sassy colon P face so
7832080	7840080	Dark Tetsuya last on Facebook saying spam Hormel foods the level would just be a bunch of enemy stars and items spam
7840080	7845080	Because obviously and the costume of course would be a little blue spam can
7849080	7851080	These ideas are so silly I love it
7851080	7858080	Let's try going over to Google Plus and check out some of the answers on Google Plus if I can actually make
7858080	7863080	The only problem is man after I start to install some of these new things I got to do on the computer
7863080	7865080	Some of my stuff is running slower
7865080	7870080	Alan need you to scrub down this computer for me do your fix it magic
7870080	7875080	Because that's what you do you fix computers right and install shoutcast and install one amp
7875080	7884080	No all right a couple answers on Google Plus tonight tech 2030 saying a power up that turns you into baby Mario
7884080	7886080	Brought to you by Pampers
7886080	7889080	That's funny I like that one that's a good one
7889080	7896080	And then lastly from Prince Peach Fuzz presenting Ron Jeremy Mario from the guys at Pornhub
7896080	7899080	There it is Google question of the week
7899080	7903080	Alan did you think one what's a costume you'd like to see and who would it be sponsored by
7903080	7904080	I have two
7904080	7912080	Captain Falcon spin sponsored by Kleenex to wipe your tears because there's never going to be an F-Zero game again
7912080	7914080	Ass
7914080	7926080	And then the slime drop from Dragon's Quest the iconic little slime and that would be brought to you by Sudafed to stop post nasal drip
7926080	7932080	Those are some good answers see you're funny he's funny you guys he's really funny all right
7932080	7938080	SSG100 Matt in chat says low blow Alan on the F-Zero reference low blow
7938080	7944080	I think they should have Kool-Aid man sponsored by Kool-Aid because you can just bash right through walls
7944080	7948080	Just run straight through the walls there's nothing
7948080	7953080	You guys are far more creative than I would be that's for sure thank you guys for answering the Fugu question of the week
7953080	7957080	Be sure to follow us on Facebook and Google Plus so you can answer the question next week
7957080	7963080	I usually post it the day of the show just because the way those algorithms work I'm likely to keep that post
7964080	7970080	I'm just disappointed that any of the costumes that they have don't change the gameplay like the you know that Super Mario crossover thing did
7970080	7972080	You know that was a little bit more interesting
7972080	7974080	I might be asking a lot of Nintendo
7974080	7977080	Oh god forbid you put some fucking effort into your game
7977080	7983080	Now hold up hold up Super Mario maker in my opinion was the best game they released last year so they took a lot of effort Logan
7983080	7991080	Well and okay it's the best game that they released last year that's not saying much they could have put more effort into it
7991080	7995080	PC people put more effort into it I just don't understand why they couldn't do that
7995080	7997080	That PC thing is a little embarrassing
7997080	8002080	Alright anyhow did that get shut down yet we didn't follow up on that
8002080	8005080	Actually no you got to do the next story Logie
8005080	8008080	It's on the internet so it's you know it's probably not going anywhere
8008080	8010080	Alan did you want to throw something out there before we move on
8010080	8016080	I did have a question so I know that you make sure that you scan all of your amiibos into Mario maker
8016080	8022080	But don't you have like 30 now at this point that still need to be scanned into a Yoshi yarn party or whatever
8022080	8026080	Yeah I probably need to catch up on Yoshi yarn but I did scan them all into Mario maker
8026080	8029080	The only one I haven't even tried is Shovel Knight but I really don't think he's there
8029080	8030080	Yeah
8030080	8034080	But I'm caught up like when I got Dedede and all those other newer ones that I got
8034080	8037080	Actually I don't know if I did Palutena
8037080	8039080	Cuz I just got that
8039080	8043080	Cuz you get through your four a week and then you'll be like okay I'm all caught up and then I'll be like did you scan in these four
8043080	8045080	Shut up
8045080	8047080	Until now
8047080	8052080	I really am in it for the figures more than I am the scanning in the games
8052080	8055080	Cuz I mean when was the last time I made a Mario level it's been a while
8055080	8059080	I actually started working on one but I kinda I don't know I didn't make it
8059080	8062080	My Mario levels still get played though I'm really impressed
8062080	8069080	I'm gonna work with Dark Tetsuya and find the episode of you originally hearing about the amiibo and shitting all over him and I'm gonna make it my ringtone
8071080	8072080	Please do
8072080	8074080	Please that's how it's lasted six years
8074080	8077080	You also get him to start his vog jam game as well
8077080	8079080	Oh fuck off read the next story
8080080	8082080	So anyways
8082080	8086080	Let's talk a little bit about how there's not gonna be Assassin's Creed game next year
8086080	8088080	Well geez
8088080	8091080	That's disappointing I suppose
8091080	8095080	Apparently though the next game they're gonna be doing is gonna be set in Egypt
8095080	8097080	But it's not gonna be coming out next year
8097080	8103080	Because they're taking some time to make the game better since I think the last one that came out was fucking a mess
8103080	8108080	Maybe they decided that the yearly release wasn't really in their best interest
8108080	8110080	Actually the last one was supposedly pretty decent
8110080	8114080	It was the one to, Assassin's Creed Unity was the one that was a hot mess
8114080	8118080	I thought syndicate was bad too but maybe not maybe it wasn't as bad but
8118080	8120080	Unity was a mess
8120080	8124080	So but taking more time to make your game better not a bad thing at all
8124080	8126080	Not a bad thing at all
8126080	8132080	Take the time to make it right put it in the oven a little while longer let it cook in the boiling oil a little while longer
8133080	8137080	Watch Dogs 2 apparently a real thing and apparently coming this year
8137080	8140080	This time though it will be set in San Francisco
8140080	8143080	Which good that'll be a city I know the layout of a lot better than Chicago
8143080	8145080	So maybe I'll get to find
8145080	8148080	Maybe I will play Watch Dogs 1 before that time
8148080	8154080	Because I still have that from when I bought my Playstation 4 last year and I still have not played that game
8154080	8160080	Well when the sequel is about to come out the original will be like bargain basement prices if you still haven't caught up
8160080	8166080	So who knows what platforms it will be out on because you know Watch Dogs came out for Wii U
8166080	8172080	But kind of didn't do so hot I mean the fact that it took so long after the other platforms
8172080	8177080	Probably had something to do with that so we don't know if it'll be on the NX or if it'll be a PS4, Xbox One thing
8177080	8184080	We will see and that might there might they're saying that could be what they do instead of Assassin's Creed
8185080	8187080	That makes sense
8187080	8191080	Yeah that could be their big push this year in lieu of no Assassin's Creed
8191080	8195080	Hopefully it won't be as delayed as Watch Dogs 1 was
8195080	8201080	We thought while we are joined by Alan tonight we'd let him do a story so Alan what do you have for us?
8201080	8210080	I see you giving me this one story to report on hearts which I didn't even hear about because I don't go on Twitter
8211080	8222080	So Half-Life is a game that I'm a huge fan of and we've been waiting nine eight or nine years for an announcement of Half-Life 3
8222080	8230080	Since Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was released and of course it does exist in some form in a binder of you know proof of concept art
8230080	8235080	And little post-it notes of scripty bits in under Gabe Newell's bed
8235080	8237080	It exists only in Gabe's dreams
8237080	8249080	Yes so the main writer for that is a he had I think at least two or three novels published before he teamed up with Gabe Newell to do Half-Life way back in like 1996
8249080	8260080	Mark Laidlaw and there is a guy who works for BioWare under Dragon Age who I believe is Mike Laidlaw and I get them confused constantly
8260080	8266080	They're not allowed to have such similar names but Mark Laidlaw was the co-creator and sole writer of Half-Life
8266080	8274080	He knows who the G-Man is in relation to Gordon he knows who G-Man's employers are he knows what the combines are allegedly
8274080	8277080	He knows where the fuck Half-Life 3 is
8277080	8286080	Yeah he's probably written and rewritten a script five times over in the last ten years for that game and they haven't touched it
8286080	8298080	So someone from Reddit emailed him or reached out to him in some way basically saying like oh my god can you tell us anything about Half-Life 3 since you're the writer
8298080	8309080	And he announced that actually quite recently he had parted ways with Valve amicably as I understand ending an 18 year relationship with the company
8310080	8318080	There's a really great quote here Laidlaw says that he quit for personal reasons mostly so that he can focus on self-directed writing projects
8318080	8326080	As in I have content that I wish to release can I release it please? No? Okay
8326080	8332080	I want to be able to say here's this thing that I made
8332080	8336080	I have this trilogy I'm working on and I know that's not really part of your business model
8336080	8338080	Yeah right
8338080	8344080	It's called Game of Thrones a song of what's the actual book called for that?
8344080	8347080	That's what he's been working on this whole time
8347080	8359080	So that's interesting I mean obviously I'm sure he's been well compensated for the storyboarding and stuff that he's done on Half-Life 3 in whatever form it exists in
8359080	8370080	But anything after that or any revisions that they want to make if Gabe wants to scrap the script for the 15th time or whatever the fuck his damage is
8370080	8373080	Mark Laidlaw will no longer be a part of that
8373080	8377080	I look forward to Half-Life 3 a song of crowbars and headcrabs
8377080	8381080	There's the show title for tonight
8381080	8385080	Maybe this will be the year guys
8386080	8389080	I don't care anymore I've got my own little headcanon about what goes on
8389080	8394080	It's not even about Half-Life 3 at this point it's about the announcement of Half-Life 3
8394080	8396080	More about the announcement than the game
8396080	8400080	I'm not even really giving a shit about Half-Life 3 I would just like something new from them
8400080	8407080	Like if that's Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, Half-Life 3 something completely different from all of that
8407080	8409080	They've been so hardware focused the last 5 years
8409080	8414080	I really really you guys want Gabe to come out on stage at E3
8414080	8421080	Look at the audience, look in the mic and go Half-Life 3 sluts and then drop the mic and walk away
8421080	8426080	It'll just have to be a crowbar with a 3 behind it behind it doesn't have to say anything and then he'll just like
8426080	8429080	He could just drop trow and pee on the audience and wouldn't even
8429080	8432080	He'll go up against a wall and just pop his pussy in a handstand
8440080	8444080	I broke Rob is so great when I do that
8445080	8448080	Explicit tag of the night goes to
8450080	8454080	For a big guy that's hard to do you gotta put your legs up and you're on your hands
8454080	8456080	Alright next story Loki Loki
8457080	8468080	Anyways so there's a lot of stuff coming out this year and from Sony they've got about 20 exclusives or so
8468080	8473080	So these are going to be the list of titles that are going to be touring I guess with the
8473080	8478080	I don't know if they have like what they call it the Playstation 4 tour
8478080	8481080	Not really sure what they're calling it this time but they've got
8481080	8486080	Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted 4, Street Fighter 5, The Last Guardian
8486080	8487080	Yeah I'll believe that when I see it
8487080	8495080	Gran Turismo Sport, Firewatch which I don't believe is exclusive but it is something that's coming to the Playstation as an indie title
8495080	8506080	What Remains of Edith Finch, Shadow of the Beast, Boundless Near Automata, Gravity Rush 2, Alienation, Hellblade, Paragon, The Witness
8506080	8512080	Ratchet and Clank, The Tomorrow Children, Drawn to Death, Dreams, and No Man's Sky
8512080	8514080	God No Man's Sky is going to be awesome
8514080	8516080	What's It Finally Comes Out
8517080	8524080	So that's going to be the full list of titles touring hopefully within the next 12 months
8525080	8530080	And hopefully we'll see like a tour date close to us at some point
8530080	8540080	Well I'm excited that Sony is kind of especially after coming last year where you know at the holidays they didn't really have a lot of big first person stuff
8540080	8542080	They're really making an effort to be this year
8542080	8546080	Okay guys this year it's going to be different it's going to be very different
8546080	8550080	And that's not even counting things that are unannounced that may be a surprise until holiday
8550080	8553080	Although I kind of I don't know if we have that from Sony this year
8553080	8555080	I kind of think like we already know
8555080	8558080	So it'll be like PlayStation VR and that's about it
8558080	8562080	Yeah but VR you know this came up on our call with Bobby tonight
8562080	8567080	VR supposedly still confirmed for the first half of the year so E3 would be too late to announce it
8567080	8575080	Unless they're going to do that whole available today thing which I just I don't know that doesn't that doesn't seem like it would work in 2016
8575080	8581080	Not with something like that I mean if you think about the consumers or like those stores that have to stock that crap
8581080	8586080	That's too risky of like something that's that high price and oh hey here's no announcement whatsoever
8586080	8587080	I mean they
8587080	8589080	People got to save up money for that
8589080	8594080	Available today at sonyentertainment.com
8594080	8601080	Order online or Amazon exclusive or something I don't know I'm just making shit up now you guys that's what happens on Video Game Podcast
8601080	8608080	I was also going to say you know along with that you know apparently the Cas Horizon said that there's going to be over a hundred titles
8608080	8617080	And they're in development right now for PlayStation VR so hopefully they say that we have more 200 developers signed up for the PlayStation VR program
8617080	8622080	Who are working on probably a hundred or more titles that will play on PlayStation VR
8622080	8625080	I hope that's the case
8625080	8628080	I guess that's showing a real commitment to it I hope that plays out too
8628080	8631080	But working on and when they're released is a whole different thing too so
8631080	8632080	True
8632080	8633080	We'll see
8633080	8638080	I mean still it's good to know it's not just something they're going to support for a year and then drop off the face of the earth like
8638080	8647080	I really do hope as a whole the whole thing works it I hope it does end up being the next big thing because I honestly would love to have like something like the HoloLens
8647080	8653080	That actually works like they're showing it now and not actually how it actually works you know what I mean
8653080	8661080	You know I would love to have that like oh you know virtual computer space and stuff where I'm doing like crazy shit you know applications on the walls and stuff like that
8661080	8669080	I've already decided I'm waiting on HoloLens until Xbox 2 or whatever obviously that's not what they're going to call it but I'm going to wait on HoloLens until the next Xbox
8669080	8678080	I've already made that decision unless there is that must have game I just have to leave the door open to crack because we all know I go back on the big claims I make
8678080	8679080	Hello amiibo right Alan?
8679080	8680080	Yes
8680080	8688080	If there is that must have game on HoloLens then we'll see but I don't think some of these things that I'm hearing about so far must have
8688080	8691080	But was it E3? E3 could be the time we'll see
8691080	8702080	Anyhow you guys remember we talked about a Kickstarter it was a little while ago in fact it would have been last year talking about Descent Underground
8702080	8711080	And Descent Underground was a game that had its Kickstarter up and then it's supposed to be launching this year and you had to pledge $25
8712080	8720080	Well apparently the game is now available on Early Access through IndieGala.com's Monday Bundle for $2
8720080	8731080	That's right so even though people Kickstarted this for $25 you could still buy it on Early Access for $2 as well as 5 other titles
8731080	8737080	So some people who backed the game for $25 not too happy about that
8737080	8741080	I'd buy that for $2 actually it's $2.49 if we want to
8741080	8748080	Let's see if chat can guess this movie reference $2 you owe me $2
8748080	8750080	I know that
8750080	8757080	Well anyhow the developer closed the thread and responded for saying the bundle was for charity
8758080	8763080	And apparently though I guess the developer posted a snippet from the Wikipedia page that says
8763080	8769080	Just like in Humble Bundle buyers can set the revenue split between the developers, charities, and organizers
8769080	8775080	And some folks pointing out that if you actually bought it you didn't get any type of slider that said
8775080	8777080	Do you want to give this to charity or what do you want to do?
8777080	8779080	Descendants Studios?
8779080	8785080	No that's bull- well I don't know let's see here I'm purchasing it right now
8785080	8788080	You're like I can get it for $2 hell yeah
8788080	8797080	Descendants Studios standing by that they believe the bundle would go to support charity and did not know that the bundle would be this cheap
8797080	8805080	By the way it should be pointed out that back in November Descent Underground was selling 70% off on Steam's Black Friday sales event
8805080	8808080	While still an Early Access game
8808080	8816080	Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says I paid $40 for Amplitude and Sky bought it for $20 should I get a refund?
8818080	8820080	Probably
8820080	8829080	No but my serious answer is you know that when you get in on Kickstarter and you're putting in that kind of money you're helping to fund the game
8829080	8830080	Terrorism
8830080	8832080	Shut up
8833080	8841080	I put in $60 I think on the Shadowgate remake which is like dirt fucking cheap now I'm not pissed
8841080	8850080	I knew that Shadowgate needed X amount of money to come back and I wanted to see it really come back so I put in money that got my name in the credits
8850080	8857080	Which not a lot of games are now at standard fare but at the time there wasn't a lot of games offering to do that and yeah I'm happy with the decision I made
8857080	8863080	I'm fine with it I'm glad that game happened it was good the soundtrack was fun so yeah
8863080	8870080	And Bobby Blackwolf says I'm not pissed either because I actually like Amplitude unlike people who are wrong
8870080	8877080	You know what though that's good I'm glad you can stand by the purchase you made that's fine
8877080	8886080	We talked about handbags last week and it still blows my mind how people spend $1000 on a fucking bag
8886080	8897080	Yet I know plenty of ladies and some dudes who are all about that type of price and why it's worth it and how it's worth it and all that stuff
8897080	8903080	And I'm like okay that's not something I'll understand but hey it's your money spend it how you like
8903080	8915080	Anyway moving on to the mailbag I think it's time to open up the mailbag because every week we invite your emails to participate at orangeloungeradio.com
8915080	8924080	If you want to participate with the program we're going to open up that mailbag right now and dive in
8924080	8930080	Except for the fact that I don't actually have it open on the screen because I'm not used to having to do this myself usually I have Dark Sakura
8931080	8938080	I should have made Alan do this tonight while he's here but you've been spared email duty tonight Alan
8938080	8939080	Yay
8939080	8941080	Plus your phone probably wouldn't be very good for doing that
8941080	8947080	We have some emails from some of our regular emails tonight we have two emails tonight and the first one is from Ray Genator
8947080	8955080	And you guys if you think oh they keep reading emails from the same people maybe you should email us tell us your perspective
8955080	8960080	Tell us why you paid 40 bucks for amplitude or you know anything on tonight's topics
8960080	8962080	First one comes to us from Ray Genator
8962080	8968080	Hi people it's Ray Genator I hope all is well as I type this I'm well on my way to getting a new gaming desktop
8968080	8971080	I have roughly half the money saved up good job on saving
8971080	8977080	I'm still on track for getting the computer in mid April I've been looking at Newegg's site off and on while at the local library
8977080	8983080	And I'm leaning towards getting an AMD 6th gen desktop provided there's nothing better that I can afford coming out in the meantime
8983080	8988080	Nor are there any awesome sales on any of the Nvidia PCs when I go to place my order
8988080	8996080	Now I should mention that despite the aforementioned info there may be the possibility that I may take an extra month wait and having my home internet and whatnot restored
8996080	9005080	I haven't made a concrete decision regarding this yet the reasoning behind the possibility is this should I go forward with this it'll net me an extra 250 or so to put towards computer accessories
9005080	9013080	While I haven't picked out and bought a specific PC just yet more than likely and unlike my old laptop it won't come with a built in microphone and webcam
9013080	9019080	While webcams from what I've seen are fairly cheap a good headset can be kind of pricey upwards of $200 or so
9019080	9026080	I'm going to hold off on buying those especially the headset until I actually have my PC but those are on my radar nonetheless
9027080	9037080	On a closing note did you three see the one sale on GOG or Good Old Games roughly a week ago from the time I'm typing this where their Duke Nukem games were 75-90% off
9037080	9047080	The reason behind the sale was due to the games were to be delisted immediately after the sale and wanted to get in some last minute sales revenue
9048080	9056080	I did not hear about that sale which is funny because I have Duke Nukem on Good Old Games because they gave it away for free some time ago
9056080	9063080	I don't think I ever actually paid for that I think I got it for free that might have been like I spent $10 on something else and I got that thrown in I don't know
9063080	9071080	But I had no idea that it was being delisted interesting I wonder if something's cooking for the anniversary I wonder why the delisting happened now I don't know
9072080	9076080	Dr Tutsi in chat saying I remember that giveaway that's how I got Duke Nukem as well
9076080	9086080	YYR giving some comments in chat saying nobody needs a $200 headset you can get a decent headset for under $100 William Ritterface saying you get a decent headset for under $50
9086080	9095080	S200 Matt says don't get a webcam unless you plan on using it often you can get a webcam for $20 seriously webcams are super cheap and some webcams have built in microphones
9096080	9104080	YYR in chat says use the rock band microphone if I had nothing else again I don't know if Rage Nator has rock band but it's an idea
9104080	9111080	So yeah you don't necessarily need to drop a lot of money on that stuff especially right away
9111080	9124080	Hitstun in chat says I just bought a new desktop PC just waiting on the case to arrive so I can build it I took your advice and speced it out on PC part picker and he actually shared the link
9124080	9133080	for his PC build that he did on PC part picker so I think that was something I don't know if that was Loki I feel like you brought that to the show Alan because you did that on my PC
9133080	9143080	Yeah Alan did that on my PC that he built for me well I guess god that's two in 2014 now it was a while ago time to update the video card I got more games to play this year
9144080	9158080	One more email tonight from YYR who says hello LR don't know if this is the first mailbag entry of 2016 it's tied with Rage Nators I suppose because we didn't have any last week right so it's tied
9158080	9169080	But at the least it's my very first long winded email of 2016 to LR anyway and thanks to Kaijuto the game I played most in 2015 was a mobile game of all things King of Thieves
9169080	9179080	I now play it on three different devices and have thrown at least $30 at it thanks Kaijuto I think yeah he got me playing that game too I remember that on a phone call a while ago
9179080	9187080	Regarding the show computer Windows Update still works for Windows XP no new updates are being released but you can still download and install everything that's there
9187080	9194080	I will say however that I'm a fan of the if it ain't broke don't fix it advice and if I were in your shoes I'd hang on to what you've got for the moment
9194080	9204080	If you do want to go to Windows 7 or newer the most important thing is RAM 2 gig is the absolute minimum I'd say but if you're doing live streaming I won't try I wouldn't try less than 4
9204080	9213080	I'm going to do a quick side tangent because it's interesting the computer thing got some comments last week and I actually received a communication on Facebook so I won't say who it was
9213080	9225080	It was a friend of mine who said dude you shouldn't have talked about that on the show and you should probably think about updating Windows 7 because Windows XP is vulnerable and so somebody could just get right in your computer
9226080	9234080	Now I pointed out that we do use a third party to relay the show I'm not broadcasting directly from the computer but that certainly did have me thinking
9234080	9244080	Anytime you're putting out media on the internet you take a little bit of a risk like that I suppose you know our website has been defaced before it's nothing you know it just comes with the territory being on the internet
9244080	9256080	There's going to be little troll kids who want to you know put pictures of tub girl and stuff just to get a ruffle your feathers but that was the best argument I've heard yet for breaking my if it ain't broke don't fix it rule
9256080	9270080	Honestly because after reading that I was like okay I may have the whole third party thing in place and I may be a little safer because of it but he makes a good point is that you know Windows XP does still have vulnerabilities
9270080	9276080	And I got to make sure being on the internet we were minimized to that type of stuff right
9276080	9286080	Even if there are like if you could go right now into XP and go Windows update and pull down whatever security like they're not supporting it anymore and that they're not coming out with new stuff
9286080	9300080	Given what you went through with Skype right even if there is stuff that you could use to bring your XP more up to date would you even want to run it knowing what you'd be at what would be at risk as far as the computer working right
9301080	9313080	Now let me say this as a side story that's also scared me off from upgrading I have a friend who's interested in starting a podcast so since it's not something announced yet I'm not going to tell you what it is
9313080	9325080	But a friend of mine is working on potentially launching a podcast soon and wanted to get a sound card for their computer like mine and the question was how do you do OLR I kind of want to be able to mirror that sort of thing
9325080	9334080	So I told him what type of sound card I had and we put it in his computer he's running Windows 10 and I can't get that fucking sound card to work
9334080	9338080	And this person's computer is top of the line
9339080	9355080	And I can't figure out for the life of me and maybe I'm going to crowd source this so the sound card is an Audigy 5RX and the deal is is that to tape from Sound Blaster the way I'm able to run music on like let's say Winamp like let's say hey it's time for the mailbag
9355080	9366080	And I can do all that live instead of having to patch it in later the reason I can do that is because Sound Blasters have a thing built into it called what you the letter U here
9366080	9378080	And that's a source that you can use to record just like you can microphone and line in but the reason why this all works is that we have our mixing board that goes to the line in and then that goes through what you hear
9378080	9390080	Here's the problem I'm having with my friend's computer for some reason in Windows 10 I can have the microphone or the line in or the what you hear but I can't have them all
9390080	9403080	I enable one the others get disabled and I can't figure out what the fuck is going on because and we tried receiving the sound card that was I went on the internet googled it that's what somebody said they did was that they moved the sound card and it fixed the problem
9403080	9409080	Try doing that and it didn't fix the problem so I don't know what it is
9409080	9426080	And it's using the mic jack in the front right in the front of the case that's hooked up for anyone who has a fairly recent PC case there's like the headphone and microphone jack up in the front where the power button is you don't have to climb behind your computer every time you want to like take off your headset
9426080	9430080	We was using the mic from up front there right
9430080	9452080	Yeah. Now, Tigerclaw by the way pointing out another solution is to use a program called virtual audio cable. Now, what I ended up doing, I set this person up with the Skype recorder and Skype so that they could podcast and they're enabled to do that and they can see if that's what they want to do. So, at least there's a workaround, but I feel really bad and kind of guilty
9452080	9472080	Because they bought a sound card specifically for this. Exactly. I told them to buy the sound card because that's what OLR does and now it won't freaking work and I can see where this person is probably really frustrated with having spent the money on the sound card they can't get to work but it's like okay in my system it just works and I don't know if it's an XP versus 10 thing which is maybe possible. I don't know.
9472080	9477080	Don't they make external USB sound cards now that have like a mic jack in it that's like the what you hear stuff?
9477080	9484080	Yeah, they do, but I'm not going to tell this person to buy something else now. Yeah, I know. So, I don't know. So anyway, I don't know.
9484080	9504080	Just so many motherboards now come with, especially if they're a gaming rig, come with on built-in audio stuff that isn't terrible that the idea of buying a Creative Labs sound card separately and using a PCI slot is super like 90s early 2000s to me. Like I have one of course, but it's so unnecessary now.
9504080	9513080	The sound card in this computer is the oldest thing about it. This sound card is as old as OLR, if not older. I'm rocking a sound card from 2001.
9513080	9522080	Make sure that there are drivers for it if you decide to upgrade from XP to 7 or 10. Right? Because you might lose it by way of software.
9522080	9535080	Alright, let's see. Mr. Blackwolf in our chat room pointing out my Realtek and C-Audio sound devices have stereo mix, which is the same as Creative's what you hear. Yeah, I've heard that stereo mix is pretty much the equivalent of that on other sound cards.
9535080	9539080	Realtek is what this person's onboard audio is, but we disabled it first.
9539080	9551080	Yes. So, I don't, I don't know. And Tiger Class says I have a Sound Blaster Rec on 3D. A dedicated sound card is better than the onboard due to the audio quality being better.
9551080	9561080	So, and then Bobby Blackwolf pointing out I bought a laptop that has stereo mix card in it. It was Realtek, but unfortunately it delays the audio half a second, so it's really hard to use live.
9561080	9576080	So yeah, I'm hoping, praying somebody out there might have the answer to this question because I'm stumped and I feel so bad that I told this person to buy a card, but I said this is what we do at OLR and I expected it would work just as easy, but it doesn't, so I'm frustrated.
9576080	9587080	So, I don't know. We'll see. Alright. I almost closed the email. I wasn't even close to being done. Sorry YYR. Tangent there, but it was relevant to what we were talking about.
9587080	9601080	So, back to YYR's email. On the subject of Konami, you've talked about how a change at the top might be a good idea and about the possibility of their entertainment division getting sold, but have you considered the possibility that nobody in Japan thinks that there's a problem with what they're doing?
9601080	9611080	That's my belief and I don't think it'll change unless and until they try releasing a Metal Gear Solid 6 in North America and find a big old American middle finger waiting for them.
9611080	9616080	Then they'll be thoroughly perplexed as to what happened. Culture shock. Those are my guesses. What do you think?
9616080	9640080	Yes, I think you're actually, you feel the same way I do, but just phrased a different way. I think Japan, I shouldn't phrase it that way, sorry. I think the Japanese end of Konami is so like in a bubble that I think they are completely clueless, but I think part of that is caused by stubbornness, which I said is the downfall of the company is that stubbornness and it's doing them in.
9640080	9646080	But I think you're absolutely right. They'll finally realize it when they try to release shit here and we're not having it anymore.
9646080	9652080	Unless they are having it and they're going to buy it anyways, even after they complained all this time.
9652080	9663080	Let's hope not. Here's something that hasn't appeared on many news sites. Do you remember the Ask Me Anything that Kevin Bacchus, a senior VP at Dave & Buster's did on Reddit some months ago?
9663080	9679080	At that time, he mentioned that he was interested in testing DDR 2014. Well, the test happened and as a direct result, approximately half of Dave & Buster's 73 nationwide locations will be getting DDR 2014 machines with full e-amusement support later this year.
9679080	9690080	The exact locations are not yet known, but this information comes straight from Bacchus himself. I don't know about you guys, but I'm super excited about the official return of DDR to American arcades.
9691080	9693080	Is Konami still involved, though?
9693080	9696080	Aren't those stages not very good, though? I don't remember if they are or not.
9696080	9703080	You know what? I will give it a shot and hey, if it did well in the test locations, that must lend itself well.
9703080	9708080	Actually, I have seen the DDR 2014 machines. The new cabinets are pretty sweet looking, so we'll see.
9708080	9714080	And YYR saying, I do hope that the Konami negativity does not affect the DDR 2014 rollout.
9714080	9719080	They could put somebody else's logo on it. I'm just being a bitch at this point.
9719080	9723080	I have an idea. How about they put just a Hideo Kojima game or something like that.
9723080	9732080	And lastly, YYR saying, I'll leave it at that for now. Time to review the first draft of my provisional patent application that the lawyer just sent me an hour ago.
9732080	9741080	Legalese is super fun, except that it isn't really fun at all. Have a fun week, everyone. Hugs and kisses, Aaron or YYR. Are you trademarking bungee ferret tossing? I just want to know.
9742080	9745080	He said patent application, so that would be patenting something.
9745080	9754080	Oh, I'm curious to see what this is. The plot thickens. Good luck, YYR. Looking forward to seeing you at MAGFest.
9754080	9761080	And good luck with the patent and all that. I hope you talk to Kyle about that, because after that episode, we know that guy has been through a lot with that.
9761080	9763080	So hopefully he had some insight for that.
9763080	9770080	It is that time to get into the FUs of the week. A point to rant on the show, because we can.
9771080	9787080	How about Loki?
9787080	9797080	Loki. I guess I'm just a nephew to my new schedule. I mean, it's cool that I have Saturdays off, but I don't like not having the extra time in the morning.
9797080	9808080	It makes it hard for me to get lunch for the week and stuff like that that I used to do in that free time that I had, and now I don't. It's just very constricting, I guess.
9808080	9819080	And the fact that I'm unable to be motivated enough to work on my game. I really want to, but I'm just brain dead sometimes to do that. But I really just need to try harder.
9819080	9830080	I can't really think of a lot of angst right now. FU to the sloppy Ingress battle I've been doing for the past two days. That's been a waste of gas, but kind of fun, so whatever.
9830080	9843080	Otherwise, things are going pretty well. I really can't find anything serious to give an FU to. I guess FU to the weekend going by so fast. This weekend flew by. Flew by! Alan?
9844080	9855080	FU, I guess, to like, this is the longest I've worn my hair in years and years and years, and I need a haircut. It's higher maintenance than I'm used to, and I somehow have motivation to go to my barber.
9855080	9864080	Which is totally like a vain and really superficial FU, but hair in my face.
9865080	9875080	At least you have hair. True. Alright. Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit. We're running kind of long tonight again.
9875080	9881080	But we'll try opening it up for a little bit, see what calls get through just after a couple more stories here. So, Loki.
9881080	9891080	Alright, so we're just a little bit away from the Game Development Choice Awards and the Game Developers Conference, but along with that, they're seeing some of the nominees that are kind of leading the pack.
9891080	9906080	The Witcher 3 and Metal Gear Solid 5. So, that's pretty awesome. Also, Bloodborne, Fallout 4, and Splatoon. So, I guess we'll find out who's going to win that on March 16th.
9907080	9916080	Kind of seeing a very common theme amongst a lot of the nominees seem to be, you know, you see here Witcher, I've heard Splatoon a lot, but they're all good games.
9916080	9920080	I do need to check out the Witcher 3, I think. That might be cool.
9920080	9927080	Yeah, I really need to spend more time with that, and what a good time this part of the year where there's really nothing else coming out right now.
9927080	9939080	And lastly, speaking of award shows, I think this is great. Voting is now open for the second annual CW, as in the television network, the CW, World Dog Awards.
9939080	9951080	And guess what? Video games are included. You can actually go to the CW's website, CWTV.com, and you can actually vote for your favorite, I guess, dog from a video game.
9951080	9959080	Dogmeat from Fallout 4, D-Dog from Metal Gear Solid 5, and Chop from Grand Theft Auto 5. Top video game dog.
9959080	9966080	There's also TV and movie dogs, best celebrity selfie with their dog, best rescue story, and more.
9966080	9972080	So, I thought what better note to end the show on than puppies. So, there you go.
9972080	9979080	And I just think it's funny that best video game dog now being included, but hey, it has been a big year for video game dogs.
9979080	9984080	So, would you vote for Chop, the Grand Theft Auto dog? Loki?
9984080	9987080	He's alright. I don't know. Probably not.
9987080	9995080	Alright, the Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call.
9995080	10001080	You can give your feedback on any topic we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we missed, or maybe some type of game you've been playing. Who knows?
10001080	10005080	Ooh, it's lighting up, so let's get to it. Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10005080	10007080	Hey, what's going on? It's Ron.
10007080	10008080	Hey, buddy. How you doing?
10008080	10011080	I'm pretty good. I'm kind of stuffed from dinner, though.
10011080	10016080	I'm still stuffed from dinner I ate on Friday, so I feel your pain.
10016080	10021080	But, like Jamie, I'm also having barbecue, so yeah.
10021080	10024080	Yeah, rub it in, rub it in. Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10024080	10031080	Well, I call to give advice on the whole podcasting situation that you discussed earlier.
10031080	10032080	Oh, really?
10032080	10039080	Alright, because what I did is something along the lines of what I got from Travis Donovan.
10039080	10046080	I run my entire podcast through a mix board, but what I do is I use a USB mixer.
10046080	10055080	That way, I have the line in open, and no matter what I throw through there, it picks up without any issues.
10058080	10059080	Huh.
10059080	10066080	I think that would be the best way to go, because I do have a Sound Blaster card, but I use it more for audio,
10066080	10071080	and I have a 5.1 speaker system that is amazing, but that's neither here nor there.
10071080	10077080	But when I'm doing my podcast, I have my little Behringer USB mixer here.
10077080	10085080	It handles my Skype calls when we're live, and when I set up my second computer for the Skype line,
10085080	10089080	I have a line in for that, and it handles that as well.
10089080	10095080	Yeah, but if his sound card won't do the line in and what you hear at the same time, I don't...
10095080	10099080	Oh, I see what you're talking about, though. You run the Skype through another application.
10099080	10104080	Yeah, because what was happening... I used to use a whole Skype recorder thing,
10104080	10110080	but then when you gave the option and the opportunity to go live, I'm like, I have to figure out a better way to do this.
10111080	10117080	So, a little bit of research. With this mixer, I can set the Skype for line in,
10117080	10125080	so whoever calls in is picked up on any issues, and I actually have a secondary external sound device.
10125080	10127080	You've heard of Astro, right?
10127080	10128080	Yeah.
10128080	10135080	I have their mixer to use to hook up to the television or surround sound for gaming.
10135080	10139080	I use it as an external sound device, which controls the music in the background.
10139080	10143080	You know, it's a process that sounds like it would work. I just would hate to tell them,
10143080	10147080	oh, you've got to buy this other thing now, because what I told you wasn't enough.
10147080	10152080	So, I'm being stubborn, and I feel like it should work what we've got.
10152080	10160080	Yeah, and one thing about Sound Blaster, when I jumped to Windows 7 64-bit,
10160080	10167080	I ran into some issues with their drivers, and I had to go dig in for third-party alternatives just to get them to work.
10167080	10172080	Ooh, I wonder if it has to do with 64-bit, because he's got a top-of-the-line computer.
10172080	10173080	Yeah, that's it, yes.
10173080	10176080	Huh, I didn't think about that. You hearing that, Alan?
10176080	10181080	Could do with the fact that it's 64-bit, and the OLR computer definitely isn't that.
10181080	10184080	Interesting. We'll have to look into that. That's a darn good suggestion.
10184080	10187080	I like the idea of third-party drivers who might have to do it.
10187080	10190080	Hey, send me an email with some suggestions on where to get third-party drivers,
10190080	10192080	because I have no idea where to go looking.
10192080	10200080	Will do, and when you guys redo the computer for OLR, I would just recommend picking up a simple USB mixer.
10200080	10206080	Then you can use your original Mix port in, but this thing handles everything coming in and out.
10206080	10208080	Good suggestion. I appreciate it.
10208080	10209080	Yeah, no problem, dude.
10209080	10212080	All right, take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go to try and grab some more calls.
10212080	10213080	You got it.
10213080	10215080	All right, and by the way, Anime Jam Session, back this week, right?
10215080	10222080	Yes, we're doing our best of 2015, because we feel, why do our best in 2015 at the end of the year?
10222080	10224080	Let's just wait until 2016, then look back.
10224080	10226080	All right, fair enough. Do it your way.
10226080	10227080	You got it, bro.
10227080	10228080	All right, take care.
10228080	10229080	You got it. Bye.
10229080	10230080	Bye.
10230080	10232080	All right, we have another call coming in. Let's get to our next call.
10232080	10234080	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10234080	10237080	Hello, it's YYR.
10237080	10238080	Hey, buddy, how you doing?
10239080	10246080	Not too bad, not too bad. I mean, I'm still a little disappointed about the whole being wait-listed for MAGFest thing, but you know what?
10246080	10253080	The last time I didn't make it into the showcase, I walked around the indie area, and there were a lot of really impressed games there.
10253080	10260080	So I'm sure I won't be disappointed this year if multitasking was wait-listed, so there's that.
10260080	10263080	Fingers crossed for you, for what it's worth.
10263080	10266080	Yeah. Well, I'll be crossing my fingers, my toes, and my eyes.
10269080	10271080	So what's on your mind?
10272080	10283080	Oh, well, I figured I'd let you in on a little more information. I know you guys know about 2DX Infinitas, the new home version released in Japan.
10283080	10297080	It actually came out last month. It is, of course, Japan only. In fact, the only way you can pay for it is using Aselli, which is their Konami funny money used mostly for their arcade games.
10298080	10299080	Right.
10299080	10309080	In fact, now here's the pricing scheme. Now, I guarantee you, your reaction to this is going to be, ah, Konami.
10309080	10310080	Lay it on me.
10310080	10326080	You ready for this? So you don't buy it outright, of course. What you pay for is a basic subscription, which lasts one month, and this costs 15.98 Aselli, which is really the same as Yen, so you're talking about 13.5 bucks. All right?
10326080	10327080	Okay.
10327080	10342080	And what do you get for this? You get to play the game as it is right now. It is just standard mode, there's no free mode, there's no courses, there's no class mode, no beginner mode, nothing.
10342080	10346080	It's about 40 songs. Oh, can you hear me?
10346080	10347080	Yeah.
10347080	10348080	Hello?
10348080	10349080	Yep, we hear you.
10349080	10351080	Skype just came up and said there's a problem.
10351080	10355080	There's a little bit of a delay, but it's not the end of the world, but go ahead.
10355080	10363080	All right, cool. So most of the songs are from Sirius, 2DX17, because that's the first home version that didn't come out.
10363080	10364080	Makes sense.
10364080	10374080	But not all of it. Most of it, but not all of it. So it's just 40 songs, just standard mode, and that's all you get for me. Now, here's the rub.
10375080	10385080	I think this combines the worst of two worlds, an MMO and PlayStation Plus. They have added 10 songs to the game for January, right?
10385080	10394080	But you don't actually get the songs added to your game permanently unless you are subscribing during January.
10394080	10403080	If you're one of these people who's like, I'm going to wait until more songs are in the game, that doesn't work, because every month you are not subscribing, you don't get those songs.
10404080	10415080	Yeah, I'm not having it. I'm not a fan of that. I mean, maybe they'll come back to some songs at some point, but that seems a little... I think that'll kind of backfire on them.
10415080	10419080	I mean, I don't know, but the Japanese culture might forgive that more than we would over here.
10419080	10429080	They did announce that they may come back to some songs in the future, but if you think about it, it's like, well, every song they repeat is a new song I'm not getting, so it works both ways.
10429080	10443080	Now, there's also a championship mode that they added to the game, right, that has a chorus of four songs that will be added to the standard mode if you complete that course while it's being offered.
10443080	10452080	But in order to play that, you have to buy an Infinitas ticket, which is sold for 108 yen for one use.
10453080	10455080	Oh my god, no.
10456080	10462080	They're selling these one-use tickets, and there will be more modes added to the game that require them.
10462080	10468080	So they're trying to make your PC an arcade machine that they directly take the money from. That's what it is.
10468080	10469080	Essentially...
10470080	10472080	Nah, I don't think so.
10475080	10480080	Hence the whole discussion earlier on Konami being stubborn and this is going to blow up on them eventually.
10481080	10486080	And you don't own anything, of course. You stop paying, that's it. You're done. You get nothing.
10487080	10498080	Now, in fairness, before somebody else points it out that I'm not being fair, Guitar Hero has that whole thing where, you know, you can use a credit to play a song one time and all that.
10498080	10507080	But my understanding as well with Guitar Hero is that there's a 24-7 feed of, you know, random songs, and you're not paying a monthly fee on top of it either with Guitar Hero.
10507080	10509080	It's not there, so there's a big difference.
10509080	10523080	You can put those songs in the feed for free, and, not to mention, you also, I mean, you paid $60 for it or, you know, $100 with the controller or whatever you paid when it was on sale, but you do still have an offline game that you own. So, there's that.
10524080	10538080	Why do I have this weird feeling that, we were talking about crackers and hackers earlier, why do I have this weird feeling someone's going to reverse engineer Infinitoss and just kind of cut out Konami and put out whatever songs they want? I really feel like that's going to be a thing.
10538080	10554080	You know what, I'm not so sure, only because you've already got the arcade rip of, you know, version 22 out there if you know where to go, and, well, that's got like 700 plus songs in it, so why would you waste your time with Infinitoss?
10554080	10557080	Because I can.
10558080	10571080	Now, here's the thing, too. Let's say you're not sure Infinitoss will run on your computer. The fuckery continues, it's amazing. Konami posted a trial version on their website that you can download. Sounds good, right?
10571080	10585080	So, the trial version is, you start it and there's two buttons, start and exit. Start goes straight into a one song, it gives you 5-1-1 on normal, and it auto-plays it.
10586080	10590080	So it's like a benchmark software, it's not really a demo, it's a benchmark.
10590080	10601080	Exactly, and you can't even test the sync with your controller because you can't do anything. And then it's over, and it kicks you back to that menu. Start or exit.
10601080	10609080	Yeah, I think there's a good reason why that game's not coming out outside Japan, and we'll see how well it does in Japan.
10609080	10611080	I guess we will.
10611080	10613080	Yeah, I hope we have a good week.
10613080	10620080	Thank you. I don't know who's driving a Konami right now, but they're about to drive right into a wall, and it's so painful to watch. So painful.
10620080	10622080	They're driving the desert bus.
10622080	10625080	They are. They're driving the desert bus right off the road.
10625080	10630080	YYR, I'm gonna let you go, we've got a delay going on here, but I'll see you at MagFest in about six weeks.
10630080	10633080	I look very much forward to seeing you there.
10633080	10635080	Alright, take care my friend.
10635080	10636080	Take care, have a good one.
10636080	10637080	You too.
10637080	10643080	Alright, I think that's gonna do it for calls tonight, because we're well after nine o'clock, which is midnight on the East Coast.
10643080	10645080	So we're gonna go ahead and move to wrap up tonight.
10645080	10650080	But if you didn't get through, and you want to email the show, again, participate at orangeontrader.com, you can also tweet us.
10650080	10654080	I do read all the tweets, even if I don't always get to them on air.
10654080	10659080	I'm still waiting for a week where we're only at like two hours long, and we're like desperate for more information.
10659080	10666080	But I do read all the tweets, and I do read all the stuff on Facebook and all that stuff, so thank you guys who continue to put that out there.
10666080	10671080	Checking in with Loki real quick to see if there's any last minute stories. I kind of doubt it, but I'll check in.
10671080	10674080	Not really, no.
10674080	10678080	I think we hit most of it. It was relatively a slow news week.
10678080	10682080	I can't believe we filled all that time, but that's what happens sometimes.
10682080	10687080	So we managed to have enough rants to fill up an entire hour of show.
10687080	10690080	So anyway, that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange On Radio.
10690080	10696080	Hey, I want to thank Alan real quick for being on the show tonight and doing the classic game and filling in with some stories there.
10696080	10698080	I appreciate having him on.
10698080	10701080	Alan, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10701080	10703080	No, not really.
10703080	10705080	No? I'm sure we'll see you again soon.
10705080	10706080	Yes.
10706080	10707080	Alright, sounds good.
10707080	10712080	And hey, I do want to remind you guys, if you enjoyed Orange On Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10712080	10715080	Help spread word of mouth about the show.
10715080	10721080	You know, we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't participating, then we can't share them.
10721080	10723080	So help us grow our family.
10723080	10726080	You know, we don't ask for your money. We just ask for your recommendation.
10726080	10736080	And if you can't really think of anyone to tell online, or even if you can, we still do appreciate five star reviews on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever it is that you found this show.
10736080	10742080	Because those reviews, they really do go a long way, and I really deeply appreciate each one of them where you take the 15 seconds to leave that review.
10742080	10743080	I would appreciate it.
10743080	10749080	I'm charging you less than 2DX Difinitas, okay? It could be a lot worse, people. It could be a lot worse.
10749080	10754080	Alright, that's it. We'll be back in seven days. Star Soccer will be back.
10754080	10758080	We'll talk about her trip to Disney now. We'll talk about what's coming up in gaming news.
10758080	10761080	But of course, I have to close out with everybody's final thought.
10761080	10768080	My final thought tonight is I think I'm finally, after all these weeks, gonna finally get around to playing Undertale this week.
10768080	10769080	See what all the hype is about.
10769080	10776080	You also need to play... it's like some pony game. Happy Pony?
10776080	10779080	I don't know that one.
10779080	10781080	It's similar to Undertale.
10781080	10782080	Alright, I'll check that out.
10782080	10783080	It's weird.
10783080	10785080	Alright, and last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10785080	10791080	My final thought is hopefully I'm gonna work some more on my game this week, but probably will end up just playing Fallout 4.
10791080	10797080	Alright, that's fair then. That's gonna do it. Have a good night everybody. Thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
10797080	10800080	We'll see you again next week. Happy gaming. We'll see ya.
10827080	10832080	See you next week.
10857080	10862080	Thanks for watching!
