Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Another Zelda HD revival is coming our way, and some new content and functionality are also in store. Amiibo is still a highly debated subject, but it can't be denied that the utility is growing. We'll explain more on this along with the rest of the week's gaming news, and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 628 for this January the 17th of 2016.

00:46.000 --> 01:00.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California. You can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me by my side, as always, are my co-hosts. Welcome back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Is your mic on over there? There we go.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Actually I think that my thing on here is kind of broken.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Uh oh, well that's the joy of live radio.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Can you hear me now?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah, we can hear you fine now.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Okay, well I wrote the teacups for you.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Thank you.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I filmed it.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yay!

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
I didn't put it online yet, but I filmed it just for you, which is really just a lot of blurring.

01:22.000 --> 01:33.000
I appreciate that. I like to film when I go on the, what's the one in Cars Land? Not the big one, not the e-ticket there, the little baby one.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh man, this is a horrible live radio.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
I don't remember, I have never seen it, but I know which one you're talking about. It's the tractors.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Yes, the tractors that spin around around.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
By the way everybody, TechMasterLoki over there.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And I've never actually been to Cars Land.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I didn't do any of that California Adventure crap.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, last time I was there that wasn't even there.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Disney only, huh?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I found the new entrance to Club 33 though.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh, I didn't know they moved it.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
It's around the corner a little bit, and the only way to identify a marker is a little doorbell with 33 over it.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Right.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, it is a podcast about video games, but with DarkSakura being gone last week at Disneyland.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Disneyland is better.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
You know, I...

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hey, now watch it.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Did you play any games at Disneyland? Let's get meta.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Because they do have...

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I didn't play Astro Blasters.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
Do they still have like the half, it's like half Flynn's Arcade, half Wreck-It Ralph thing at Space Mountain?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
No.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
StarCade's gone.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Oh, no.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
It's all closed off.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
What?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It just has like an ATM in there.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
What?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
That's awful.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I took a picture at how sad it was.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Aw.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
StarCade's ATM is the greatest game ever.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, you win real money.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, I know you get money.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
But, I mean, I did like the usual.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
We went to, we did Hyperspace Mountain, which was okay.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
What is, what is hyper?

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Is that just, they put the Star Wars, like, like the first time in my modern era because,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
you know, I went to Disneyland as a kid and then I went back in my twenties.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
And the first time I went back to Disneyland was with DarkSakura and the official OLR lesbians

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
who haven't been on the show in a long time because they moved.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
They moved to Wisconsin.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Right.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
They're like way out there now.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
And, but they, we all went and when we went on Space Mountain, it was a rocking Space Mountain.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It was playing Red Hot Chili Peppers.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
It was like people were dancing on holograms.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Is it just that whole thing, but with Star Wars?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Kinda.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
But as you go through where they would, would have like the little hologram, not the holograms,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
but little things up on the wall.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Instead it was projections of like dogfights in space.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It was okay.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Did Kylo Ren talk to us with his sexy voice?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I didn't.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
I was just like, I was too busy going, ah!

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
That's what you're supposed to do on Space Mountain.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
That is what you do on Space Mountain.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
But I still have my Fastpass for Hyperspace Mountain because we rode the special entrance

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
to most of the rides because we had a certain friend with us.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
So we got to do the ride within a ride and the back doors and everything and find the

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
other ways around.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
And it was cool.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
That's fun.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
And I've now got to see kind of backstage on Haunted Mansion.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
And I did the cat hunting game.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I found two cats.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
So the whole reason you were there at Disneyland was because part of it's closing.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
It's gone.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
It's leaving.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
So you were there the last minute.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You were there right up to closing, right?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I actually have two videos up on my YouTube channel.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
It's just DarkSakuraOLR.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
Is it just you and Lady Victoria and that whole clique that are big fans of that restaurant?

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
I came into the party late, but I had only been once before, but I fell in love immediately.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
But were there other, does Bucket of Meat have a cult of fans?

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
There were people who were not wanting to vacate the tables.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
And the staff had to tell them to leave because of the reservations.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Right.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
We left with like five pots.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
We left with five buckets.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
They really should just tear out Rainforest Cafe because it was super overrated.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
It was, but it's not even adjacent to the park.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I don't care.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
I have to go to our chat because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
vog.network.com

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
See, the fact that we're the Voice of Geeks Network gives us a little freedom to talk about more than just games.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
And Disney addiction, that's a little geeky.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
But anyway, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show, also a Disney fan.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
In fact, the last time I went to Disneyland was with Bobby Black Wolf Show.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
But we are live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, of course, right after Bobby.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
And Tiger Claw on our chat room, I knew he was going to ask about this because Tiger Claw is always the one that's like,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
did you see this or did you know about this?

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Tiger Claw asking, did you see Saturday Night Live last night with the Kylo Ren sketch?

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
And I'm assuming he's talking about the Undercover Boss thing where they parodied that show, which I didn't even know Undercover Boss was still a thing.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I thought that show was off the air, like, for a long time.

06:01.000 --> 06:10.000
But yes, I did see the sketch and it was hilarious because, I don't know, like, again, I'm going to not go into spoiler territory, don't worry.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
But we all know Kylo Ren is the villain in the movie, we all know that, okay?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
He's got the red lightsaber in the trailer, you all know that.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
And even though he's kind of an asshole, like, there's a part of me that's like, I kind of like, really like Kylo Ren.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Like, I just, it's the voice. The voice is so hot.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I don't know what it is. Only when the mask is on, though. I don't, cause, anyway.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah, the mask on, it's good. He's like, oh man, he sounds so badass, like Darth Vader, and then he takes it off.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm so whiny! It's like, no, no, it's not working.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
He's like the emo Kylo Ren account.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I love that Twitter, by the way.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
No, it's a great Twitter.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
No, no, no, put the mask back on!

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
So anyway, the fact that they actually incorporated that a little bit into the sketch, that slayed me. I love that.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
So, yeah. That guy has a good, what was his name, Adam Driver? He has a good sense of humor.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
He did, like, a porn sketch last night, too, cause they have, like, a reoccurring thing where this girl keeps interrupting porns that are being shot, so they did something to that, yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I haven't watched that in a long time.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
I know, I know, there's not a lot of reason to, but it's a little more up than it was a couple years ago.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
I was just excited, cause yesterday I was browsing through everything, cause, you know, my kids always hog Netflix.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
And so I was like, dude, there's, like, so many awesome movies on here now that I like to watch.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
And then I noticed that the new season of It's Always Sunny is on there now, and I was like, yes.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Hilarious show.

07:28.000 --> 07:37.000
Alright, we gotta get to games a little bit tonight, cause, you know, it is a video game show, and we're gonna talk about the types of games we've been playing this week.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
We're also gonna get into the news this week.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
But we always like to start each week with a kickoff topic.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
But, you know, I have to admit, I was struggling a little bit this week to come up with a kickoff topic.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So I thought, you know what, let's go to the listeners.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Maybe the listeners have a kickoff topic for us tonight.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
So we're actually gonna go to the mailbag.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Every week you guys email us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I ain't readin' all this.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and finds an email, or five, that she deems are worthy to read.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And actually we've picked one of them tonight.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
We'll do all the emails later, but we're gonna do one here at the top of the show cause it asks a good question I thought would be a good kickoff topic tonight.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So DarkSakura, please, to the email.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Anyway, it came with two games, Sonic CD and Road Avenger.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Sonic CD blew my mind from the first second.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
I'll never forget the video intro and the catchy Toot Toot Sonic Warriors song.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
The music quality was a different world.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
Sonic had never had more speed and the 3D stages to get the emeralds were unseen at the time.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
But yeah, the European OSD was a lot better than the American one.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
That's a matter of opinion.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Road Avenger was a full motion video game drawn like a cartoon.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Again, the music and sound effects were amazing.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
The onscreen action was over the top.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The video was even more fantastic.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The rest, I guess, isn't to be read out loud.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I'll just read it.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Secondly, can you email me an address or P.O. Box for me to send some Belgian stuff to?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You know, chocolates, beer, candy.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I will take chocolates, beer, candy.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
That's a very sweet gesture and we can reach out to him off air.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
You guys have done this show forever now.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
You were there when I was going through a very rough time.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
I listened to this show when I climbed Mount Vento and it brightened up my day.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
It's the least I can do.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
As always, thanks a million for doing this show, Fabrice from Belgium.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, thank you Fabrice for the email.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
If I knew you were going to listen to this show while you were climbing a mountain,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I would have actually sung my best Mother Superior.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Climb every mountain.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Anyone? Anyone? All right, forget it.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
No.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
The only good part of Sound of Music Live on NBC,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
because it was the one song that Carrie Underwood didn't sing,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
but anyway, back to the email.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Now I'm thinking of the Little Shepherd.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Now that everybody shut the show off,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I can't handle it.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Let's go back to the question that was asked at the top of the email.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
What console had the biggest impact on you?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Dark Sakura, why not?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
You've played them all.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
You have them all in your house.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
You've got a ton of them in the vault.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Which one had the biggest impact on you?

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't know.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Just because.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
I mean, I've got different memories attached to each one of them.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So, um.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Go ahead.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Let me ask this.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
If the house were on fire, and you had enough time to take one thing out of the vault,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
what are you getting out of the vault?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Turbo graphics.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
So there you go. I think that's the answer.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
But the thing is, though, is that it wouldn't do me any good without the game.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So, kind of why.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I would just plug in the turbo graphics and stay in the house.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Or maybe even the Neo Geo, because then I could sell it and buy a new house.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Um, with all the cartridges.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Um, I got.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I'm gonna do, like, my three.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
For a reason.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
When I was a little kid, my neighbors had a Magnavox Odyssey 2.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
We played a shitload of that.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And that's what started video game addiction for me.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
That machine right there.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
And I had played, like, you know, Atari 2600s.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I'd played all the other things.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
But that was the thing I played the most of as a kid.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Do you remember the game?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Quest for the Rings?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I had a feeling. Because when you did that, you did that as a classic game.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But it wasn't, like, the first.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Well, we said, fuck the board game. We just played the game.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
But I remember you talking about that game.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And, like, Cryptologic or Crypt Equip.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
And MC Crazy Chase and MC Munchkin.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
And, um, the other racing game that was on the Crypt Equip 1.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
And that was, you know, my afternoons after school.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Was playing the Magnavox Odyssey 2.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And I have one now.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I can't even hook it up to anything.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
But I'm not getting rid of it for anything.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
The next big one for me would be the ColecoVision.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
And I think the ColecoVision is, like, the real big game changer.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Because it was the first video game system my family owned.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
And my mom would play the shit out of it.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
And her asshole husband would play the shit out of it.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
My brothers were little babies.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I mean, Phillip was toddling around.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And Matt was an infant, you know.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't even know that Matt was born.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah, Matt was born by that house.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Because I was thinking. Because I lived on the same street years later as a teenager.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
When my grandma bought a house down the street.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
But it was... I have a lot of memories, especially for that era.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
And that was the real big thing that really got me started.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I mean, the Magnavox had been great.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
And I had been playing it as a gamer.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
But I could just, you know, sneak up at 3 a.m.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
And play rounds of Space Fury until, you know, it was cross-eyed.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
And so, as much as I love, you know, the NES.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Which I really super loved my NES.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And I played the crap ton out of that too.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
And my mom would play it.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And I loved my Super Nintendo.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Which I didn't leave the house for, you know, ages.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
But the ColecoVision was the one that was like the big game changer for me and my family.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Because it was something that all of us played together.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Which I think was the intention for it.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
It wasn't just a kids thing here or a kids thing there.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
It was a family thing for us.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
And I really think that those were some of the best years for our family at that time.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
You know, even though I, you know, got older and started realizing, you know, other things behind the scenes.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
But it was a really good time.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
We also watched Thriller and then went and played Space Fury.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
That's about-

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
You're so 80s right now.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I can't help it.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Was it totally radical?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Gag me with a spoon.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Did you trade Garbage Pail Kids after?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
No, I didn't. Those things gave me nightmares.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Really?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I'm serious. When those came out-

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Did you see the movie?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
No. No.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But my friends at school all had them.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And I went home and had like nightmares for a solid month.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I couldn't sleep outside of my covers.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Did you have an arm full of jelly bracelets?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yes, I did.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
That was my big thing was jelly bracelets.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I had jelly bracelets and I had the charm necklaces.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
You know what I'm talking about, right?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
I do. I do.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
That was like when I was like super young, like second grade.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
We're dating ourselves on this show.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh my god. Stop it.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
I want to get to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com and some of the answers there.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
DarkTatsuya says, I have to go with the NES.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
DungeonBuster says, Atari VCS was neat, but the NES was like having an arcade experience at home.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Well, yeah, because the PayChoice 10 or whatever, that was an arcade thing.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
sj100matt says, Super Nintendo would probably be for me, but it's so hard to choose just one.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's like Sophie's choice to choose just one.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
It is hard, but that's okay.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
If you have one or two answers or like Jamie and have three, that's fine too.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
No, technically I had two.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
I had ones that were important, but none of them were as significant as the thing.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
As a Coleco.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
As a ColecoVision.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Which I still have that.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I still have my ColecoVision.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh yeah?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I bought another one and my mom found it and gave it to me.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
They used to build them indestructible.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Those Atari 2600s?

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
You can launch them into orbit. They would, you know, land in the ocean.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
They threw them in a landfill in New Mexico.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
That wasn't the ColecoVision.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
You could kill a man with those.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
But Atari, those things are pricks.

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
Well, my friend accidentally dropped Kick to Super Nintendo off the second story balcony onto concrete.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And guess what? It still freaking worked.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Try that with your PS4, yo.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Alright.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Loki, how about you? The most important console for you.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't know. I mean, it depends.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
There's a lot of different consoles that I've played.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I mean, I don't know.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Obviously, I would be more inclined to go with the earlier ones that I played.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I mean, I started off with the ColecoVision as well.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
But I would actually have to say the PlayStation 1.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
And the reason for that is because I played a lot of really great games on it.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
And it was a system that I had Dance Dance Revolution on.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
So, of course, that is pretty important.

16:46.000 --> 16:53.000
But, yeah, I think PlayStation 1, because that kind of got me into the whole, I don't know,

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
even just playing import games and kind of stuff like that.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Just really getting involved with that portion of it.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
You know, it was because of this community, the DDR community.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
And when I say this community, I mean all of us that met up playing DDR in Sacramento.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
That this show was born of.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
It was really because of that community that I even realized import gaming was a thing.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Like, you know, I always read the stories in Electronic Gaming Monthly or whatever.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Did you know Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan was totally different than what we had?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You know, I remember things like that.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
But I never really got to play that stuff until Jamie was like,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm going to bring a plug over and you can play import games with it.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
And we're going to play a real version of DDR and not USA Mix.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Did I bring over a third mix?

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
It was either you or the cast of Melrose Place that I used to live with back in the day.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
No, I think I brought over a third mix because I had the burn at the time before I got my legit copy.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Yeah, I feel like it was either you or...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Because I got it from George.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Gotcha.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
I do remember playing second mix on the Dreamcast at your house

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
with the dance pads that had the protective sheet for some reason.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And that were more like the slip and die?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, God.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Sorry, Loki, not to derail you.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah, I'd say that's probably why.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Because there was a lot of great games that played on that.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
You know, Ridge Race R4 was amazing.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
You know, Final Fantasy VII.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Just a lot of great gaming experiences.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Sure, I mean, you have that with every console.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
And I don't know, I'd say maybe up to like the newest ones now, like PlayStation 4.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
And maybe not so much the Xbox 360.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But like a lot of the newer ones, it's just kind of...

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
There's not really that big like, whoa factor from that.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
You know, going from like Super Nintendo.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Nintendo 64 is pretty cool.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
But I think like the PlayStation 1, there's a lot of really great games on there.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Some folks in chat talking about what bricks...

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
I mean, meaning not actual bricks, but like indestructible forces their consoles are.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Kaijuto in chat saying, Intellivisions should be around.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
I spilled orange juice in my Atari 2600 and it still worked.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
If I let a drop of water in any of the new consoles, it would fry, I bet.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
And then Bobby Blackwell was saying, I wish the Intellivisions were indestructible, frown.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
I finally have one that works. All others overheated.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Do you realize that they had that issue?

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
You know, sort of the problem about the Atari 7800 was not...

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Or 7800, whatever number.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
No, 7800.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, is that sometimes their power supplies would stop functioning properly.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And they're hard to find some of those power supplies.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
The other problems back with the 5200 weren't the consoles themselves, but their controllers.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Those things are bitches.

19:36.000 --> 19:43.000
Maybe all those reasons are why the Intellivisions games always seem to be the first in line when all the retro stuff comes up.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Like, Intellivisions always got something they're putting out.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Like when those flashback consoles...

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
I saw the Cliccovision flashback when they had that over at the Target over here.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
And it...

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I have the Intellivisions one, actually.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
It was marked down, but it was marked down, like, $40. I'm like, ehhh.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I don't need that.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
The 5200s, though, the problem with theirs is that a lot of the buttons would go out on the controller.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah, and actually bmuls in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
But Intellivisions had the shittiest control ever besides the 5200.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
The Cliccovision had a pretty awful controller, too.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I want, like, the flashback Dreamcast, or, like, flashback...

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
You know, we're, like, our more modern...

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Give it time. Give it time. Sega?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Sega will milk that nostalgia for all it's worth. Give it a few more years.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
Here's another bad one, and Dan, I think, had one of these as a kid with a Fairchild Channel F.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Mmm.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Those sucked.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Or a flashback TurboGrafx-16. I mean, where's that?

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Alright, my turn. I have two answers for this, and I really can't decide between the two.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
My first for my...

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
And you gave me a hard time.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
I know, I know. My first would be the Commodore 64, which, I guess, technically...

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
It's technically not a console, but I would argue it is, because...

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
And it totally counts, because you could hook up a Commodore 64 to your television,

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
which is part of the reason why I would think in the 80s it was as successful as it was,

21:07.000 --> 21:15.000
because, my God, people, if you think it's crazy today that we have to choose between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Wii U,

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
like, go back to a gaming magazine in the 80s and look at an ad for, like, Donkey Kong or something where it's shown.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Here it is on the ColecoVision, on the Atari, on the Commodore 20...

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
On the Commodore... I can't say the name right now.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
On the Commodore 64, on the TI-99 4A, on the Apple IIe, on the...

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I mean, like, you would literally see...

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
And I remember distinctly one of these ads was, like, 12 different monitors that would show one screenshot from the game on each console.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Somebody's gotta know where one of those retro ads are on the web and can link to it in chat.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
But, yeah, it was just fascinating, like, all the stuff that was out there.

21:53.000 --> 22:00.000
So Commodore 64 was always one of them, and my understanding is that Commodore 64s were really huge in Europe.

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
Like, they were a pretty big deal here in the States, but my understanding is that, usually when I bring up the Commodore 64 retro love here on OLR,

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
I'm hearing from somebody overseas that's, like, right there with me, because it was an even bigger deal.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
It was an even bigger deal over there, and I think probably lasted a lot longer.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
And I think the successor, the Amiga, well, one of many successors, I think that one did even better over there than it did over here.

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
But anyway, my reason is just probably simply because it is one of the first consoles I remember getting my hands on,

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
even more so than the Atari 2600, because I was always a fan of, and I think why I was always drawn to gaming in the first place,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
was that I kind of had control over what was on the television.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
Like, it's like, it's this interactive thing that I am doing. I am the actor that's on the screen,

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
although when I say actor, meaning I am the dot, or the big beady eyes in Haunted House in the 2600 or something.

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
But the Commodore 64, I think, took that even one step further, because you could write your own programs in Commodore 64 Basic,

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
which was a huge deal, right? And you used to be able to type in the programs from the back of magazines and all this stuff.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
So, that was part of the reason why I loved the 64. And my dad was really into it, too,

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
and he loved the fact that I was really into Commodore 64, and I probably shouldn't be admitting this on my radio show,

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
but it's been, what, 30 years? The statute of limitations has long since passed.

23:24.000 --> 23:34.000
He would bring back, like, discs that were from his railroad buddies of, like, all these games that he would get from his pals or whatever,

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
and, you know, I would just go to town with that and have so much fun playing all that different stuff.

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
And, you know, we certainly bought a lot ourselves, too. And, yeah, just really great memories with all that.

23:46.000 --> 23:54.000
But then the other answer, honestly, is what is easily the greatest console they ever made anyway, which is the Super Nintendo.

23:54.000 --> 24:02.000
And I just have such fond memories of the Super Nintendo, and I think really being blown away by Mode 7,

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
which was, like, the big new thing, right, that did, like, the kind of pseudo-3D effects and all that.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
You know, if you've played Super Mario World, you've seen a little bit of Mode 7 in that,

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
but the game that I really remember falling in love with on Super Nintendo was Actraiser.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
And, you know how you would, like, you play the little platforming level and go through that whole thing,

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
and then you have to go into the strategy type of level, the SimCity-esque.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
I mean, it's really a bad comparison, but it's the best thing I can think of in the moment.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
The SimCity-esque type of level, and when you would, like, go down to the action level,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
it did this little thing with the Mode 7, and it went doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
and it's like you're falling to the earth, because the whole thing is about, like,

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
you are basically God going down to save your people, essentially, and then everybody worships you.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
So who wouldn't love a game where everybody worships you?

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
So I think the Super Nintendo just, and plus the library on the Super Nintendo, my God,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
I mean, some of the best stuff they ever did put out.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
I really think that was just, oh my God, some of the best gaming we've ever had,

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
and I don't even know if we'll ever be in that state of gaming ever again, I don't know.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Bobby Blackwolf, our pal at VOG Network, says,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
I learned how to program on the Commodore 64, and it led to my career.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
My dad was a raging pirate, the first video game I ever played was pirated by my dad.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
He would get the pirated game from the local software store because his friend was the owner.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
Hey, Kuratika just came out, won it, gets a copy disk of it, and leaves.

25:36.000 --> 25:43.000
Bmole says, I had a TI-99-4A, I'm still jealous of the Commodore 64.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
Let's see, Kaijuto says, Super Nintendo was okay to me.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
I think I had like three of them at one point.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Those are some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
So there you go, there's some answers for you on what the most important consoles were,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
not just from us, but from our listeners.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
That was a great question, so worthy of starting off our show tonight.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
And I have to say something about this at some point.

26:09.000 --> 26:19.000
It was a pretty crazy week out there as far as celebrities and sad news coming again and again.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
In fact, right after OLR last week was when the news came out about David Bowie and that he had passed.

26:25.000 --> 26:34.000
And yeah, just a lot of sadness out there, understandably, with so much talent being lost just in the past week

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
between Bowie and Alan Rickman and just so many great talents that were lost in the past week.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
So I'm glad we could start tonight with something a little bit more positive.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
I was going to also say happy birthday to Betty White, who turns 94 today.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
And you all know we love Betty White here at Orange Lounge Radio.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
I just hope she's in a protective plastic bubble somewhere.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
That is my hope, and that she's doing very well wherever she's at.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
She has to kill other celebrities in order to suck their life force and stay alive.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
As long as those other celebrities are like Kardashians or something, I'd be okay with that.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming week.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
So we've talked a lot about retro stuff, but we're going to get into our gaming week

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
and the type of games that we've been playing this week.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
But I do want to say something here before we get into our gaming weeks.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It is a three-day weekend here in the States.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
For me, it's a three-day weekend. If you are in certain industries, it's a three-day weekend.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
But low cap makes us work.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
Let's not forget, though, the achievements of Martin Luther King

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
and the reason why some of us have Monday off.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
But anyhow, we do have a three-day weekend this weekend,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
so I thought that was a good excuse to break out some alcohol.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
The sludge that I made.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
And we're going to do some responsible drinking. Yeah, this is really old.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
It's still okay because I've still got some in my fridge.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah, this is like the candy corn stuff you made at Halloween.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
This is the candy corn vodka.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
All right, so I'm going to apologize now, but I'm going to get a little drunker as tonight's show goes on.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
This is going to wear off in 30 minutes.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Not for me. Here we go.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Yay, toast.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Oh, it's still strong. Oh, boy.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Oh, my glass is empty.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Oh, boy.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Oh, I feel that in my nose.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
All right. Let's get into our-

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It's so good.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
Let's get into our games, the type of stuff we've been playing this week.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Darsaga, how was your gaming week?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I make delicious shit there.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
Okay, so I've been playing a crap load of Heroes of Dragon Age on iOS.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I actually like it.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm playing Ingress more because I met people.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
I got recruited, I think.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
One of us, one of us.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Oh, is the alcohol burning?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
No, I have a bubble in my throat.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Ew.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Okay, now I feel better.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
That was a very Ladylike birth that luckily she was a microphone away.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Well, I've let him rip on the thing.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I'm not a lady.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm whatever.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
All right, so Dragon Age, Ingress, what else?

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
We had, I forgot.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
Oh, yeah, I picked up Omnicron, of course.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
But I'm really not going to play it.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I couldn't bring myself to play it, so I didn't.

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
And, oh, shoot, I got another game, Hexes, something like that.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But I haven't really played it either.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
I just really haven't played much of anything because I'm working on a new graphic design project.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
So most of it's just been iOS gaming.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Oh, yeah, and I finally started Super Hexagon, but I suck at it and quit.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
So I'm done.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
Which, by the way, before Loki gets into his week, I just want to point out in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com, thank you.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
Fifth Dream found one of those old images that I was talking about.

29:58.000 --> 30:10.000
It's a Qbert ad where you can see it on the Atari 5200, the TI-99, the Atari 800, the Intellivision, the Commodore VIC-20, the Atari 2600, the 64, and the ColecoVision.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So that's eight different screenshots.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
The ColecoVision version was great.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, I mean, they were all pretty good except maybe, I don't know, I don't remember the 2600 version being that great.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
But anyway.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
The 5200 version was really good.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Anyhow, Loki, how was your gaming week?

30:24.000 --> 30:31.000
So mainly I played Fallout 4, so I'm, I don't know, I'm like pretty far into it now.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
And still not doing the storyline quest because, of course, who does the storyline quest?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
We know the ending's going to be shit.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
And so I just haven't figured out which faction I'm going to, I mean, because I stupidly joined the Minutemen in the beginning of the game.

30:44.000 --> 30:53.000
But then I don't know, like, which quests are going to stick me to be on the Brotherhood of Steel or with the Railroad.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
And, I mean, honestly, I don't mind either one.

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
I kind of was deciding maybe on the Railroad, not necessarily because of the views of the characters and everything,

31:03.000 --> 31:10.000
but because I wanted to destroy the Brotherhood of Steel because they seem to be more of a challenge than the other people.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
I don't know, though, yet, so still playing through all the side quests and that.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
And then, what else?

31:17.000 --> 31:26.000
Oh, I played, yes, I did back on Kickstarter a while back, that Dragon Cancer, so finally that made its way out.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
And I knew kind of what I was getting into, just playing it, and it's an incredibly depressing game.

31:31.000 --> 31:39.000
As, you know, the subject of, you know, parents dealing with a child that has cancer and, you know, spoiler, ends up dying.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
Is not exactly, you know, flowers and puppies.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
I mean, it's just, it is a very depressing game.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
And so, yes, that's what it was.

31:49.000 --> 31:59.000
I bought that game day one just to support it and this whole, you know, we've been very fortunate that we've had a lot of very artistic games coming out in the past couple years

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
and things that really push the envelope of what is a game.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
And so I just wanted to support this game and I do want to play it, but I also know it's going to be an ugly cry.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
So I have to be in the right, it's got to be the right night.

32:12.000 --> 32:23.000
It's just hard hearing the recordings of, like, this child and hearing, like, his parents talking and the other, you know, the other brother or whatever.

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
You know, just hearing them and talking about, you know, going through all that, it's just, like, horrible.

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
Because, you know, you know what the outcome is going to be, or even if you don't, I mean, it's just, it's just horrible.

32:37.000 --> 32:49.000
The only, if I were to nitpick about it, the only thing I don't like about it, and I understand what their point was, they were trying to make it something for, like, so everybody had a part of it.

32:49.000 --> 32:57.000
It was, like, kind of like a game so that, you know, they could, I don't know, I guess be a part of the game.

32:57.000 --> 33:06.000
So they had, like, people submitting, like, you know, cards and stuff, you know, for their family members that may have died from cancer or, like, other things or pictures and artwork and that kind of stuff.

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
And so, like, there's a part in the game where you're, like, able to, like, go through the hospital and, like, read some of these cards to their son.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
And a lot of them end up being just, like, random cards to, like, other people, like, complete strangers that may have backed it on Kickstarter.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
And it just kind of, like, pulled you out of the whole thing.

33:22.000 --> 33:30.000
Interesting, because I've heard, on the other hand, that that scene is very impactful because of the volume and the fact that there are all these other stories about it.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Just another perspective.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
I don't know, I just thought, like...

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
I've heard that that is actually one of the more powerful scenes in the game.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
I just thought it was supposed to be, you know, it's more, like, should have been focused on the actual kid, you know, and everything and their family.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
And just, like, you know, I can understand, like, if in their room it was all, like, stuff for, like, that kid and everything.

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
But, like, it was just random cards for, like, people that aren't necessarily a part of their family or anything.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
It's just, like, what?

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
The chat is asking, what game is this again?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
This is That Dragon Cancer.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
That's the name of the game.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Yes, or you're going to be crying when you play the game.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Basically.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Ugly cries the game?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Ugly cries the game, yes.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Ugly cry.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Ugly cry.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, it's very depressing, so...

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
So, yeah.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
I'm going to stick with that a lot to me.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, I got...

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I only made it through partway through the game.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
It was, like, it was late at night and I was just, like, okay, listen, I'm not going to, like, spend my entire night playing this.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
So, I got up to the point where the doctor basically says, oh, there's...

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
The treatment's not working, so there's more we can do, type of thing.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
I was, like, okay, that's what we're stopping for now.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
But, yeah, it's pretty bad.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
I mean, as far as, like, you know, the feels or whatever.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
So, I'll probably finish it.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
It's not a very long game, so I'll go through that later on.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
And that's pretty much all I played this week.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Okay.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
My gaming week.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
A lot of similar things to what I've played before.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
A little more Minecraft on PlayStation 4 just because, I don't know, just was feeling it.

34:58.000 --> 35:04.000
I even played Just Dance 2016 today a little bit because I bought that, like, weeks ago and I had yet to play it.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
So, I finally played that a little bit today.

35:06.000 --> 35:13.000
I don't know if I like the whole unlimited subscription thing online because they really try to kind of force that with...

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
Like, they show those songs on the song select, but it's, like, oh, but you have to be a member of unlimited to play these songs.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
It's kind of...

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
I mean, you can do a sort that's just the disc songs or whatever, but I don't know, it's just a little...

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
It's a weird direction for me.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
But the game itself is pretty much just like all the other Just Dance games.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
So, you already know if you're going to like this game or not, I think.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
It's a good workout for me in the privacy of my own home with no one else watching.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
That's why I enjoy these type of games.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
And I'm happy they do have, like, a workout mode type thing in them.

35:45.000 --> 35:53.000
Another game that is one I've talked about on the show before that I've been playing a lot of this weekend is Diablo III.

35:53.000 --> 36:01.000
Which, you know, that game is years old at this point, but Blizzard's been keeping Diablo pretty fresh with patches every now and then.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
They just did a pretty big one that launched Season 5 this weekend.

36:06.000 --> 36:13.000
So, the whole deal is that everybody starts a new character at the same time, essentially, and tries to go for different goals.

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
And as you go through the season, you can unlock transmog gear, like, you know, just cosmetic-only things.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
You can unlock, like, a little pet. Like, there's a little tree pet this season you can get.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Little banners, things like that.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
So, I get into the season thing, and it's something Alan and I do together.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
So, we actually rolled some new characters.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
Or, actually, one of the things they did with this patch is that because, like, everybody's running out of character slots,

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
what you can do now is you convert one of your existing non-seasonal characters into a seasonal character.

36:43.000 --> 36:50.000
And it resets that character to level 1, and then moves all your gear back into your general character pool.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
Because they're meant to be different. You're not supposed to just play a character you've played for years and years in the season.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
But they don't want seasons to be a waste, either.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
So, at the end of the season, all of your experience dumps into your general pool.

37:01.000 --> 37:07.000
So, I know after the last season, I got, like, easily 200 Paragon points plus in my general pool,

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
because I had so much that I had accrued on this last season, Season 4.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
So, I'm excited to do that again with Season 5, and I'm rolling a Witch Doctor.

37:16.000 --> 37:22.000
I want to do the, funny enough, the Harvester build, which they now give you sets as you play the game.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
So, take out a little bit of the randomness of it, but I think it's a good thing.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
So, yeah, I'm really enjoying the Diablo patch.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
One other thing I had to say about the PC version, because this whole seasons thing I just talked about is not on consoles.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
And it's because the fact that the consoles are not online,

37:38.000 --> 37:50.000
and my understanding is there's already cheater players that play online that are, like, Paragon level 11y billion that are just, you know, leveling people to obscene levels.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
So, it's already been tainted, basically.

37:52.000 --> 37:57.000
So, the console ones don't get seasons because they're not always online, which I know that was a whole other controversy,

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
but, you know, here's where we are, and this is part of the perk, I guess, of being always online,

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
is that they can keep the integrity for the most part of the game.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
So, I've been playing a lot of that this weekend.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
One other game I played a little bit of today, I just downloaded it today,

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
and it was based off a recommendation from some Twitter pals of mine that said I should play this.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
It's a game called Oxenfree, which just came out.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I've seen the ad for it.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah, it just came out on Xbox One, and it's on PC as well.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
And that game, it kind of reminds me of an old PC point and click game,

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
except that you're controlling the character, and you're participating in these conversations,

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
and the dialogue flows very different than, like, say, Mass Effect.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
You know, I love Mass Effect, but in Mass Effect, the game comes to a halt,

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
and you choose what your answer's going to be, and then it proceeds.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
In this game, you have to kind of choose your answer as the conversation's going.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
So, it gives it a lot more of a natural flow to it,

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
and I think also might cause you to say things that you might not actually say

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
if you had time to think about it.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
So, I think that brings an interesting perspective to it,

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
and I haven't played an awful lot of the game, but I'm liking what I see so far.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
So, I'm going to talk to you more about this game hopefully next week,

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
but, you know, just about 45 minutes into the game or whatever,

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
I think it's very interesting, so I'm having a good time with that.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
Let's see, over at live.vognetwork.com, looking at some of the comments in chat,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
let's see, Kaijuto says,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Diablo 3, is that still a thing?

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
Notice how the other two hosts get very quiet when Rob talks Diablo 3, lol.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Well, but...

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I always play Nickelodeon to me.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I don't have Diablo 3, nor have I played it, so...

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
I get quiet when, you know, she talks about stuff that I haven't played, or he does, you know, so I realize...

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
It's respectful silence, but I always play Nickelodeon to me.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
You were looking at cat butts in Nickelodeon to me.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
They have cute little buttholes!

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I just think that's so funny.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
No, okay, there's a thing about this.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Things I didn't expect Dark Soccer to say on the show for $200.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
There's a thing about this, is that Dan has this shirt,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
and it's one of those big dog shirts, right?

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
And it says, if you're not the leader, this is the view you see, or something,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
and it's the big dog's butt, but he has no butthole.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
And it always bothered me that the big dog had no butthole.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
So, like, what, is he full of shit?

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
So, I don't know what it is, but seeing the little cat buttholes are...

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
No, you're not the first person to make that observation about that game, I'm just saying.

40:29.000 --> 40:34.000
I had a friend that had, like, 20 cats, and purposely waited for them to be all turned around

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
before they took a screenshot, and then posted a status to Facebook that was like,

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
look at all those buttholes, lol.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The cat buttholes are the best buttholes.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
Oh my god, alright, if they didn't unsubscribe when I was singing,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
they probably unsubscribed during cat butts, I'm just saying.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
No, they agreed with me. We got more subscribers for that, Rob.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Fair enough.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Let's see, also from our chatroom over at live.voguenetwork.com,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Brad from Pot Culture agreeing with you.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
That game is crack.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And Alan Alchemy in chat says,

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
seeing a cat's butthole unintentionally and far more than you'd like

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
is a universal experience for any cat owner.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Yes.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Especially with Midna.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I think that's true with any cat.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Oh, I have woken up in the morning to see

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
Alpha feel f-f- across my nose,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
and I look up and the first thing I see is Midna's butt.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
And I look over and Dan's just laughing in the corner,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I'm like, you did this on purpose.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
He'll be like, I did nothing, I just let her in the room.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
He's just standing there going better her than me.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
He's been cat butted before.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Alright, this is going to a weird place.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
We need to, uh, we need to get into some gaming news tonight,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
but first some quick housekeeping.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
And we will not be here live next month

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
for the weekend of February 21st.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
We will not be here.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Due to me being at MAGFest,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
which is getting closer and closer,

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
I booked my plane ticket, I got the hotel, I'm really excited.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
So, uh, looking forward to MAGFest.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
And thank you SHA100Matt,

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
started a topic on our forums over at vognetwork.com

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
to do a little planning.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And of course my first question was,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
what if there's a snowmageddon,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
like there was in Boston,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
just before PAX?

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Is there a way I can get around and get to where I need to go?

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
So, some good tips there from our forums over at vognetwork.com.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for the week.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Starting off with Loki.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Alright, so there's going to be a fan-made Fallout game,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
or not Fallout game, a Half-Life game,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
that's going to be coming to Steam soon.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
It's actually going to be kind of like an unofficial sequel

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
to Half-Life Opposing Force.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And they're actually going to be selling it on Steam.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
And I guess they've gotten their, um,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
basically the approval from Valve.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
And I guess it's, you take the role of Adrian Shephard.

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
And I guess the, this is during the events of Half-Life 2.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
And they're going to be selling the game for,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
it looks like, $9.99 on Steam.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
So, interesting that that's happening.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
So maybe that's what it's going to take is, you know,

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Half-Life 3 won't be done by, you know, Valve.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
It's going to be some other company that's putting it out, I guess.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
So this is it, this is Half-Life 3,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
or at least the closest you're going to get to it, right?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Well, I don't think this is Half-Life 3,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
but it is, like, kind of a neat side story.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
This reminds me of, like, that portal stories, Mel,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
but at least that game didn't cost anything.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
And that was just kind of like a free expansion

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
that someone made that you can kind of play.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
So this thing is going to be something different.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
It's a 13-level game that takes place during, like, Half-Life 2.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
So that's kind of cool.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
All right. By the way, the chatters were telling me

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
that my audio was cutting out, so I switched microphones.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
So if I sound a little different, it's because I'm on a new microphone

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
and hopefully that sounds a little better.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Anyhow, going to another story about,

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
remember the Xbox 360 and how broken it was in some places?

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
Remember when the console came out and it would break itself

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
and all that hilarity that ensued?

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
All right, well, anyway, it wasn't just the fact

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
that the consoles were red-ringing that was an issue,

44:24.000 --> 44:30.000
but there was the case about the disks being scratched way too easy.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
There was actually a class-action lawsuit

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
that was brought by Xbox 360 owners

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
over the fact that the console would scratch disks.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Yeah, it's because they didn't include, like, padding

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
at the top of the CD-ROM drive or whatever

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
to help prevent it from rocking back and forth.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
And I also always thought if you ran your Xbox vertical,

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
it was more prone to this. Is that true?

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Well, I mean, I guess it's prone to it if it's vertical

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
because it can be knocked over, so that's a possibility.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
But any time that it would jiggle the disk in there,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
because normally a lot of the CD-ROM drives

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
will have some sort of padding to help keep the disk level

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
or have some sort of thing to keep the disk in place.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
But because it was missing this,

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
if it got jostled, it would basically push the disk up against the actual laser,

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
and that would just carve a nice little circle into your disk.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Well, LOL, our legal system, and this thing's been tied up.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I mean, because we're talking about the 360, right?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
So you already know this is kind of older news,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
but here's how long this has been going on.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
So in 2012, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
saying there wasn't enough actual complaints,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
basically, to have a class action.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
But then in March 2015, that was overturned.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Well, now guess who's getting involved?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
The Supreme Court. That's right.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
The big ones, the nine that make a lot of big decisions here in this country.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So here's the deal, though.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
The Supreme Court is not hearing necessarily the case.

45:53.000 --> 46:00.000
They are just hearing whether or not it can even be heard as a class action lawsuit.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
So that is what's happened.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
I mean, still, the fact that the Supreme Court is now getting involved in this issue

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
is kind of fascinating.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
So, yeah, these lawsuits go all the way back to 2007.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
Then in 2008, there were leaked documents saying that Microsoft knew the 360 had a problem.

46:19.000 --> 46:25.000
And now the Supreme Court is going to basically see if a class action lawsuit is even possible in this case,

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
which, I mean, if they even come back and say, yes, they can proceed with a class action lawsuit,

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
there's going to be another two or three years before we hear anything.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
And then that's when everybody will get a little postcard in the mail,

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
did you buy an Xbox 360 between this date and this date?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
How many?

46:41.000 --> 46:50.000
Send in a postcard and get your $5 or Microsoft has agreed to give you a free copy of Halo 3 for, you know.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
How many copies can I redeem? Because I had like 12 systems at one time.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
That's right. You had a ton of Xbox 360s.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
I did. I bought a ton of them.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
You did.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I think I only have two now.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
So we'll see what happens with the Supreme Court.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
But that, I mean, don't expect that ruling till, what, summer?

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
It's going to be a while.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
All right. Anyhow, moving on.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Dark Sakura.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
Well, I kind of made a mention of this before since it's one of the games I picked up.

47:15.000 --> 47:27.000
But you can get a free game thanks to Square in honor of David Bowie's passing is Omikron is there for free.

47:28.000 --> 47:37.000
They had put a link up on the Square Enix Twitter for the US or the European editions of the game.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
You have to sign up for an account on Square, which I already had one.

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
But, yeah, you just put in Omikron as the code and you get Omikron the Nomad Zill for free.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I think that's a nice gesture.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
That's a very nice gesture.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
I don't think-

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
And it's got original music in it.

47:54.000 --> 48:00.000
To be fair, I don't think that game really was huge, you know, but that was the thing about Bowie.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
Bowie was very experimental and he was on a lot of the tech waves really early.

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
Do you remember Bowie Net? He had his own Internet service provider for a while.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
You could. Yeah. I mean, that was he was really ahead of the curve with a lot of technology things.

48:16.000 --> 48:24.000
And he called the Internet destroying the music industry like way before the music industry was going to admit to it.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
You know what I mean? When I say destroying, just the whole shifting with the streaming and everything.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
Bowie was really tuned into that. So, you know.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
But at any rate, though, it does have I mean, he's in the game.

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
And instead of just using his old music, he made new music for the game.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
That's awesome.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
So, yeah, worth the free purchase.

48:45.000 --> 48:51.000
Also, it gives you a Steam key so it's not through any of Square's proprietary delivery systems.

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
Cool. I will have to check that out. I've not taken advantage of that yet, but I would like to. I'll check that out.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I believe you have until the 22nd.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
OK, so I have a little more time just to hear the new songs, if nothing else.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
OK, I know it's not directly related to gaming, but since the man was an artist and so well-respected by many, I have to ask everybody.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Favorite Bowie song?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Dar Sakra. Favorite David Bowie song?

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Moonage Daydream.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Why?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Just.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
It's just I don't really know. It's just one of my favorites.

49:22.000 --> 49:29.000
You know, it's got that sort of, you know, the 70s space rock era, you know, like what?

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Well, I mean, if you want to look at other people who've done like that space rock thing,

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
Lemmy did it with his band before Motorhead, which I can't now remember the name of the group to save my life.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
But it was just one of those. It's driving yet.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.000
It's kind of mellow. It's both at the same time.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
And it's seriously. And I about squealed when I heard it in Guardians of the Galaxy.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
I was like, oh, my God, it's Moonage Daydream.

49:55.000 --> 50:01.000
And I honestly, in fact, I honestly think it's a better song than Space Oddity, but it's on the same album.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
Sure. But yeah, it's it's seriously one of my favorites.

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
If I was going to have to pick a second.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
I would probably pick As the World Falls Down.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
My favorite would be and this is going to sound a little strange.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm picking something that goes, I think, against the grain a little bit.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
But my favorite is I'm Afraid of Americans.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
Well, because I really like learn to appreciate.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
I mean, I liked Bowie's, you know, gender fuck of the 70s phase and all that stuff.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
But I really grew to appreciate him during the industrial music phase and Earthling.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
And that whole album was really, I think, underrated.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
And let's not forget that I'm Afraid of Americans was originally on the Showgirls soundtrack.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Truth as a true story. So it's it's in the movie.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
And but anyway, actually, my love of that song really didn't have to do with that.

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
It's just another plus. But fun fact, you know, I've been doing Internet radio even before Orange Lawns Radio.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
I was co-hosting with Travis Donovan on Understation Live.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
And before that, I was doing stuff at the university and we were online on Real Audio back in the day.

51:07.000 --> 51:13.000
And I remember when Earthling came out, I would play a track from that album every other week.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
Easy. And it was, you know, my favorite ones were that and Little Wonder, you know.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
So, yeah, I that was probably my favorite Bowie song.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
But I mean, certainly there's a lot that I love.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Loki? Favorite Bowie song?

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
I don't know. Probably their heroes or Let's Dance.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
I don't know.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Let's Dance is a good one. That's a classic.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
And that's the DDR one. Let's Dance is in DDR.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
One of the newer ones. So there you go.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
All right. Anyhow, good memories. Good memories.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Let's move on, though, with more gaming.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
I have to say, AkumaJP also did nail Under Pressure.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
Just makes me think that he's he and Freddie Mercury are pulling off a big Galaxy concert.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
I and I think that's a fantastic point.

51:57.000 --> 52:05.000
I would have said that song. However, I do consider that at its core a Queen song because it was Queen featuring David Bowie.

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
But I mean, not to diminish that song by any means, because that is a one of the all time greatest.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
One thing to point out. Last thing, if you don't mind.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Yeah, sure.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
Is that David Bowie also was kind of genre bending as well.

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
I mean, if you want to look back, you know, years, he did Little Drummer Boy with Bing Crosby.

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
Why do you think Madonna was so affected? Because Madonna said a lot about David Bowie's passing.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
And why do you think she was so affected? He was doing it before she was.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Yeah.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
Which I know she gets a lot of credit for always, you know, shape shifting and changing things.

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
Bowie was doing it before she did. Not to not to diminish Madonna's accomplishments, of which there are many.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
But, you know, Bowie did it first.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
And he stayed looking amazing without, well, it probably did have some surgery.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
He probably had a little surgery, but.

52:51.000 --> 53:00.000
But I would almost say you run into almost any artist and they would say that he probably was a shaping factor in their life.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I know he was for mine. So.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
Oh, wow. Excellent point by Alan Alchemy in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
Let's Dance was in Elite Beat Agents.

53:10.000 --> 53:16.000
And so that was definitely a way a lot of us music game fans got exposed to that song was Elite Beat Agents.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
God, that game was so good. Why? Why couldn't there have been another one?

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
I mean, I know there were two in Japan, but it's not it's just different.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
Man, now I'm really in a bad mood.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
All right. Let's see if our next news story can perk me back up.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Loki.

53:32.000 --> 53:42.000
So this, you know, I'd say 2015 is probably, you know, you know, big year for remakes and announcements like of that sort.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Well, here's one I never thought I'd see a remake on.

53:45.000 --> 53:55.000
You may remember this as a mini game part of Penn and Teller Smoke and Mirrors, but the probably the one that most people remember is Desert Bus.

53:55.000 --> 54:01.000
You know, the real life simulation of driving a bus across the desert.

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
Well, it also comes back into gaming culture every year with the Desert Bus Marathon.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Yeah, they do different marathons and stuff like that.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
So apparently they are going to be remaking Desert Bus into a VR game.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
Yes, that's right. So why?

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
Penn Gillette basically said, you know, during like one of his podcasts that he's working on the game.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
He's working with Randy Pitchford and we're going to do and this is a big, big deal.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
We're going to do a new Desert Bus. It's going to be just for charities.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
So charities can use it to raise money and it's going to be in VR.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
I OK. I'm going to ask a challenging question and I don't mean to sound like a dick.

54:42.000 --> 54:49.000
However, is that really I mean, if you do something to kind of force like it's for charity,

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
like the Desert Bus thing was something that happened really naturally.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
And you know what I mean? So to kind of like, oh, we're going to make this VR thing.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
And it's it's just for that. Like it's kind of like trying to force lightning to strike a second time.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
Does that make sense? That makes sense. Like I just I don't want.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
I don't really understand what would be the point. I mean, so it's in VR.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
It'd still be boring. I mean, it's just like what? And I can look around.

55:09.000 --> 55:16.000
Well, I think I think for the hilarity of it and the novelty of that, I'm it's not going to.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I'm kind of surprised no one's done it already.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
It's not going to be that difficult of a game to make in VR. I'm sure it depends.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
It depends how nice they choose to make it. I mean, they could put more scenery in it.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
I don't know what they're going to actually do with it. So it kind of depends how far they go with that.

55:31.000 --> 55:37.000
But I just then when I hear like we're doing it just for the charity and do all these charity events and stuff,

55:37.000 --> 55:43.000
it's like I don't I don't want to hate on charities because, of course, anything that is for charities is a good thing.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
But I just feel like don't don't force it. Let it let these things kind of become a meme or whatever naturally.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
You know, I mean, I don't know. That's just kind of my my thoughts on it.

55:55.000 --> 56:00.000
No one asked you to do this. Yeah, sort of. I know. But then I'm like, OK, well, if they're just going to remake it for the lols,

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
and I'm sure it's not going to take a tremendous amount of effort in this day and age, then do it.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
It'll be funny. And then maybe, yeah, maybe Desert Bus will do one of the trips in VR or something,

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
or they'll incorporate it into their charity drive. But, you know,

56:13.000 --> 56:19.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sometimes when a game is that good, one is all you need.

56:19.000 --> 56:25.000
SG100Matt says, I'm sure he was thinking about remaking the game because of the charity marathons,

56:25.000 --> 56:30.000
but VR came along, so he's making it for that. Well, if that's if I'm misinterpreting the quote, then that's fine.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
I mean, if the charity thing inspired him to remake the game, then OK, cool.

56:33.000 --> 56:39.000
That's great that, you know, a good cause could bring that game as awful as it is back into the limelight.

56:39.000 --> 56:46.000
So anyway. All right, let's move on to another story that has a lot of people talking this week,

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
and it has to do with Twilight Princess. That's right.

56:50.000 --> 56:57.000
The big, big game from the GameCube and the Wii launch title coming back for the Wii U.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
And some more information came out in Famitsu on The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
However, there wasn't a lot of new information in the Famitsu article, just some pretty pictures.

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
But some sharp-eyed folks notice a few changes from the original game.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
Some notice that there are 12 spaces in the tiers of light gauge.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
But in the GameCube and Wii versions, there were 16 tiers of light.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
So maybe they've changed some of those collection sort of quests.

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
And then also, rupees. You can only carry 1,000 in the original,

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
but based on a screenshot, it looks like you can carry up to 2,000.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
So you won't get any more of the message that says,

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
It won't fit in your wallet, so let's put it back.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
Now, something else, though, that has a little more controversy attached to it

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
is the fact that there is, of course, the amiibo that we knew was coming with Twilight Princess HD.

57:49.000 --> 57:57.000
But based on an Amazon France product listing, apparently there is an amiibo-specific dungeon.

57:57.000 --> 58:03.000
So, they say other amiibo can regenerate your life or allow you to gain arrows.

58:03.000 --> 58:09.000
But apparently, this official amiibo with the Twilight Princess, Wolf Link, and Midna,

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
that is something that is going to actually have a dungeon locked behind it.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
And the dungeon, I guess, has been translated to the Twilight Cave.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
Of course, Amazon France has pulled the listing down since then.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
But, what do you guys think?

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
There could be an entire dungeon locked behind amiibo.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
A new dungeon, but locked behind amiibo, nonetheless.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
You know, I still don't like this practice.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I mean, I understand.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
To me, it feels like they're not sure what to do yet with these amiibos as far as integrating them in games.

58:38.000 --> 58:44.000
I think good examples of how they integrated them, like Mario Maker, even unlocking the skins is kind of cool.

58:44.000 --> 58:51.000
Even Smash Brothers, Super Mario Kart 8, that type of thing.

58:51.000 --> 59:02.000
But, what they did with Shovel Knight and with this, where they're locking a big portion of the game behind DLC, it's ridiculous.

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
I mean, especially, let's just say, okay, I decide that I want to purchase this digitally.

59:07.000 --> 59:13.000
I'm fucked because I didn't go buy your stupid amiibo pack that you put out at launch or something like that.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I mean, what's the point?

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Like, these enhancements, you know, it's basically DLC.

59:18.000 --> 59:24.000
And the fact that they're announcing it with the game launch, it's like, oh hey, by the way, there's this extra DLC in there.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
You don't do that.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
Okay, not to totally disagree with you, because I don't.

59:30.000 --> 59:38.000
But, to be Devil's Advocate, I seem to remember last week on the show, you were saying that amiibo don't do enough.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
So now, here's an example where, well, the amiibo's going to give you an entire extra dungeon in the game.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
So isn't that amiibo doing more?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
No, it's not amiibo giving you an entire extra dungeon.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
It's an extra dungeon that they made and locked behind a wall that you have to purchase something to unlock it, is what it is.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
It's not extra content.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
It's stuff that they built for this, so you have to buy the figure to unlock it.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Is this back to the, what game was it? Was it Street Fighter X Tekken or whatever?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Where all the characters were on the disc already, but they were just locked behind the Xbox 360?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Well, yeah, it's a lot of those different types of Capcom games that did that.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And also, that was, yeah, I think it was Street Fighter X Tekken, or was it maybe Marvel versus Capcom 3 or something like that?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I don't remember, but a bunch of those have done that.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And it's just that stuff that you would think that if the amiibos haven't been around, they would have just had that out available anyways.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And now they're just making, they're almost making an excuse for this amiibo to basically exist.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Like, I understand the fact that you get power-ups and stuff from using the other amiibos, that's kind of cool, I guess.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:48.000
But it's not like, you know, unlocking, like I think for example, Splatoon, I think that those amiibos should unlock costumes or something for your characters.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Something that seems a little bit more meaningful, not just, oh, we're creating a specific part of the game that we're going to lock behind something.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
See? Amiibos do stuff now! That's not an excuse. That's just crap.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I think the blow would be softened a lot if they had like five new dungeons and one of them was behind this amiibo or what have you.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Or, you know, the dungeon that it unlocks is not that big a deal type of thing, like it's just like a little room.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Well yeah, exactly, and even not necessarily the doggone Twilight Princess, but like, Shovel Knight.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
You locked, you locked co-op behind the fucking amiibo. Come on!

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That's ridiculous. That's just a feature of the game.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And you're just like, oh, fuck it, we're going to lock it behind that.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Uh, yeah, I don't know. I, you know, I guess it might be a reason for them to charge.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
It's kind of like a way to force you to get the amiibo, whether you want it or not.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Let's just look at it this way. I understand that the amiibo is something, but let's just pretend that the amiibo is completely out of the play and stuff like that and it's a dungeon.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So basically, if Twilight Princess HD was to come out and then they had DLC for one additional dungeon for $12.99, wouldn't that seem fucking ridiculous?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I would think that's fucking ridiculous. That I'm paying $13 for a fucking dungeon? One dungeon? That's better be fucking amazing.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Are you paying it for the dungeon, or are you paying it for the figure?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Whatever.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Because for me, I like the figures.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yeah, I understand you like the figures, but that kind of excuse allows them to do this kind of crap.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000
True. I sort of feel like this is also how they're going to justify a $60 price tag for a years old game.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And I don't know if that's the price, I mean, is that what they're charging for at 60 bucks?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
If they're not.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
With the amiibo?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Probably with the amiibo.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Because that's how they would say, oh, here's a years old game, but you get the amiibo so we can pay the, or make you pay the full retail price.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Basically, I just have a weird feeling that might be how they're justifying it during what is otherwise somewhat of a slow release period.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I just don't think that they've really used those meterfully yet.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
When Star Fox again?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I don't know. But like, the amiibos, I mean, they're cool as figures, and that's fine if they wanted to sell those figures, but as far as interacting with the different games, I'm just not feeling it.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I'm not feeling like that they do.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's why I haven't purchased any, aside from the one I got, you know, from Akuma JP, and the one that I got from, you know, having Mario Maker.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I haven't felt the need to purchase any, and it's because they don't do anything.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
They don't seem, like, there's no incentive for me to purchase this.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Alright, well speaking of Akuma JP, he presents another perspective in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, saying,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
How about a thank you present for those who bought the amiibo?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Mmm, I get that angle, but it's sort of ruined a little bit when the game is being bundled with the amiibo, and that's probably going to be the primary way most people buy it.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure how I feel about this.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I think it might be a bit much, but at the same time, we don't know the extent of the dungeon, we don't know what other bonus content might be in the game.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I still feel like there's other factors to weigh before I'm totally willing to say Nintendo's being really mean with this, but what I'm hearing so far isn't incredibly encouraging.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
But I'll still get the amiibo because I like the figures, and that one in particular looks awesome.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:10.000
There's some cool integration of amiibo figures, like imagine the Twilight Princess amiibo unlocks a character in the new Legend of Zelda game.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:19.000
That is a cool integration with the amiibos, not unlocking a dungeon behind something.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It's basically something that you don't necessarily need, and we can argue that the extra dungeon is not necessarily something you don't need, it's not taking away from the original game experience.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I think unlocking an optional character to play as is-

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Cosmetic, yes. Content, no. That's basically what you're saying.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Exactly.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I don't know, I would think another character is a pretty big deal, but if the character is just a reskin of Link, then I guess that's just cosmetic, if nothing else.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Ooh, give me an amiibo where I can play as Linkle.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I was just thinking that.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I would totally buy that if you let me play Linkle in Twilight Princess, although something tells me that would just completely fuck up the core game.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But still, I can dream. Damn it, I can dream.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Alright, let's move on though. We have more gaming news, we want to get to release dates as well, but first, Dark Sakura.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Activision got sued again, this time over another real-life depiction in Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Basically, Manuel Noriega, who was the former dictator of Panama, sued Activision for using his image in Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000
The quote is, for blatant misuse, unlawful exploitation, and misappropriation for economic gain.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:48.000
They previously did this with the Angolan rebel chief, Jonas Savimbi, and his family, suing them over the way he appeared in the game.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That basically, they're trying to sue for, I guess, misrepresentation overall. But yeah, Activision is getting nailed.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I don't think, it's just a money grab. I mean, honestly, the guy wasn't depicted that badly. He was on the good side of everything, and you just kind of partner up with him.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Whereas the other guy, the other lawsuit that they had was, he was just like this dictator warlord guy who killed a bunch of people, and they didn't like the fact that they depicted him as-

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
This is who was portrayed as a barbarian.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:32.000
He killed people, but I mean, everybody was killing people in that scene in the game. I mean, I don't think it was necessarily- I think they're just trying to grab at money, to be honest.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But the other one was even more ridiculous, because the guy was a dictator who killed people, and that's how they depicted him.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:49.000
But his family is not going to see him that way. But still, whatever. Either way, Activision is going to be back in court over it.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Well, somebody's always in court over something. There's always a lawsuit story on this show every week.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Alright, let's get to some release dates. Travel around the world and check out what's coming out in a gaming store near you. Are we getting back into releases again, Loki?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Yeah, a little bit. There's not a whole tonk about it this week, though. So this week we've got the Resident Evil Origins Collection. That's going to be out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Also, Life is Strange. They're going to be doing a disc version of that for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, including a limited edition. And that's it.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Alright, traveling to Japan. We're getting back into some releases again on the 21st. The Biohazard Origins Collection, obviously, that's the same thing as Resident Evil over here.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:39.000
That comes out in Japan on January 21st on the PlayStation 4. Ryu Ga Gotoku Kiwami comes out as well on the PlayStation 4.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And Zombie gets its Japanese release. A little retail release there on the PlayStation 4 on the 21st as well.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Of course, that being the PlayStation version of Zombie Yu. Speaking of the Yu over on the Wii U, nothing this week, sorry.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
But Mario Tennis Ultra Smash is the next release you have to look forward to on the 28th, so next week.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:10.000
The Vita's still trucking, though, and I always love the title of this series. Muv Luv comes out on the PlayStation Vita this week.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Muv Luv is out in also an alternative and a double pack, whatever that means. So if you want your alternative Muv Luvin, you can do that on the PlayStation Vita this week.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:34.000
You just would have to import that. And lastly on the 3DS this week, Zelda Musou Hyrule All-Stars. That's right, Hyrule Warriors on the 3DS in Japan this week.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:42.000
There is also a special 3DS LL, which is their version of the XL, a special Hyrule edition that's out this week in Japan.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So some people, I think, with Japanese 3DSs might be importing that one. I'm not sure. How about the UK? Sorry, Sakura.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.000
A boy is Bob. That is really it. Oh, no. Hardware Shitbreakers for PC.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
What? There's a game with the word shit in it?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Ship!

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Oh, ship? I thought you said hardware shitbreakers. I was like, break shit.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Oh, Rob.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
The sounds of broken glass.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Special precious.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Am I the only one that thought she said shit?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Summer child.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Maybe it's because I've been drinking.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Maybe I'm saying shit because I was actually reading a live tweet of a Trump rally.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Talk about bullshit.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I really was. It's actually kind of hilarious and sad.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Alright, is that it for the UK?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yeah, that's it for the UK.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Alright, so this is kind of disappointing, but Rockstar is kind of a big guy behind the Grand Theft Auto series.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Leslie Benzies has actually departed the studio after an extended sabbatical.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.000
He's been with the company for 17 years. He joined Rockstar North in 1999, back when it was DMA Designs.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And he went on to produce Grand Theft Auto 3, and of course, just recently, Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
He also had a little bit to do with the Red Dead Redemption and Manhunt games.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:22.000
So, it'd be interesting to see kind of how the series goes from here, but definitely something that was more influential behind it.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000
You know, we had a pretty big departure from Valve last week, too. There's a lot of moving and shaking going on, isn't there?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Crazy.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Alright, well, last week we were talking about anniversaries and gaming a little bit.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Some of you were very mad at me for some of those anniversaries I was reading.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
But I do have an update on Pokémon and the 20th anniversary of Pokémon that's happening this year.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So there was some more updates from Nintendo this week on some of the ways they plan to celebrate.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.000
For example, there's going to be a new ad during Super Bowl 50, which is coming up.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I guess a Pokémon-based ad, that's kind of cool, where they want people to share Pokémon memories on Twitter and all that good stuff.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And I guess there is a Pokémon Day, which will be February 27th, and there will be special events at retail locations around the country.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:19.000
There's more information at Pokémon.com slash 20, and some of this is going to include monthly mythical Pokémon distributions.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I guess there's a Pokémon Photo Booth app that's going to be happening, so lots of interesting stuff.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Also, of course, Pokken Tournament coming out for the Wii U, that I know that was dated for March this week.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And then there's also, I want to say, there should be the new 3DS, right? There's a new 3DS bundle that will have Pokémon Red and Blue pre-installed on it.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And that's coming out also on February 27th, so that's kind of cool.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
But there's also a 2DS, I think, that's coming out to celebrate the anniversary as well.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So lots of ways to celebrate the Pokémon. I bet there will be a new game this winter.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Although, with Pokémon Go, maybe that's kind of what they're using to keep Pokémon going right now.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000
But I would, if we haven't gotten an update on Pokémon Go by February 27th, or whatever that day is, something's wrong.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Because I would think that would be a great day for the beta of Pokémon Go to begin. Just saying. Just saying.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Alright, well let's travel to a much simpler time in gaming.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
We weren't celebrating 20 year anniversaries of anything, except maybe Pong.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Because they're just, gaming was still a new industry, it was still a baby.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys need to play and respect this game this week.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
We can find someone that'll run it.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Alright, well Dark Sakura, here it is, the classic game of the week. What did you choose for our listeners tonight?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I picked the first adventure game that Lucasfilm ever did. Labyrinth, the computer game.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Ah, I'm assuming a little bit of a tribute to Bowie.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Indeed.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Now the music in this is very minimal, just so you guys know.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000
It came out in 1986. It was developed by Lucasfilm Games and published by Activision.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It was indeed based on the movie. You basically have to navigate a maze while solving puzzles and evading antagonists in danger.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You have to find and defeat Jareth within 13 real time hours.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:38.000
It doesn't have any command line interface, instead you have a scrolling word wheel that you use to do your sentences.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:48.000
So this one, that whole design of the scroll wheel was invented by the designer David Fox.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Who wanted to avoid text parsers and syntax guessing that was a problem in text based adventure games.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So he actually worked with Douglas Adams, as in Hitchhiker's Guide.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And this is sort of the design that came out of it.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And it influenced, actually this game itself was an influence for Maniac Mansion down the line.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:24.000
So basically you've got, when you enter in your name, your gender, and your favorite color.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The last two fields determine what your character looks like.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And then you play through the game. So it really is like that.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000
It was, for its time, pretty ahead of the curve.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And on top of that, it was very, very well received when it came out.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And they felt, they weren't really pressured to reuse certain things from the movie.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
But they felt obligated to use the source material.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And were able though to adapt the source to an adventure.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So it really was just a big innovation in development.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
It came out for Commodore 64, Apple II, and the MSX.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:27.000
It was pretty successful. In fact it was more successful than the film was at the time.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
It was actually even called a superb game by Commodore User Magazine.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And Computer Gaming World said that it was a very well done game and an excellent user interface.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
So it did leave a pretty decent legacy.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I mean, it influenced the mechanics for Maniac Mansion.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And the SCUMM engine that was made for Maniac Mansion, that of course has been used for so many other games.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000
The word wheels were sort of a predecessor of the whole point and click interface.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And the designer, the artist for the game, Labyrinth, did the production for Maniac Mansion.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So, if not really for this game, we might not have had Maniac Mansion.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
So, probably...

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Yeah, you can see a lot of similarities just in the graphical style to Maniac Mansion just in this game.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Which I have to admit, I never played when it was first out.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
But I'm surprised I never did. This game looks pretty awesome for its time.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Yeah, and now people are saying that it wasn't a real classic.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But honestly enough, you sort of have to look at the precursors and appreciate it as the classic that it is.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Sure.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
That's really all I have to say about it.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Awesome. Well, some of our chatters over at... Oh, look at that. It's like she's in a mosh pit right now.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
She's being carried by all the hands.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Yeah, the wall of hands.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Yeah.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Yeah.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Anyway, over at live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
One cool thing it did was it started off as a text adventure.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
And then when Jareth pulled you into the world, it blew up with color graphics.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Yeah, there is that too.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
It's kind of a Wizard of Oz thing to it.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:15.000
DungeonBuster says, as a side note, the Maniac Mansion guys are working on a new Maniac Mansion-like game called Thimbleweed Park.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Which had a successful Kickstarter.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And Dark Tetsuya pointing out, I was just watching video of the MSX version. It looked neat.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
So yeah, this is out on a variety of consoles, as we were talking about earlier in the show.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Games in the 80s came out everywhere.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
So.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Labyrinth.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Influenced by the film starring the late, great David Bowie.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Alright, that is going to do it for the first half of our show.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But don't go anywhere, guys. We have plenty more show to come.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
We're going to take a quick break first, though.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And when we come back, we're going to do the rapid-

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Excuse me. Yeah, rapid fire news.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
We're also going to get into the foogle question of the week.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
We'll also get into what other news is going on.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
We're going to have an update on Awesome Games Done Quick.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
We talked a little bit about that last week.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
We have some other information this week about how that all went down.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000
We're also going to talk a little bit about a game on the Wii U that will use all of your amiibo.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Live tonight with episode number 628, January the 17th of 2016.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
You know, I didn't say anything about this at the top of the show.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But it's raining a lot in Sacramento right now, which we need it.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
We need it. We really, you know, you've heard all the stories about the drought.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
But, I mean, I think that what we're getting right now is supposed to be a pretty big storm.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
At least for California measures, a pretty big storm.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
So, I forgot to get that disclaimer at the top of the show.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Knock on wood, everything's holding up so far.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But, like, my cable was out.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It was Friday night because that was the night the Diablo season got started.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
We couldn't play, so I was mad because we got a late start.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
But whatever, timing isn't that important.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
But it's nice to have a roof over your head in running water.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It is nice to have a roof over my head in running water.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.000
But when I check in on the Comcast app and it says, the internet will be up by 10pm.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And then it's 10pm. I check it again.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
What day was it again?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
1am. It was Friday night.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Eh, their internet service has been real shit.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And so, like, I can never tell if it's my stuff or their stuff that's messed up.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And, like, sometimes I'll do a speed test and it just won't do anything.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Or sometimes it'll be just fine.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I'm like, it's super slow. Like, it's not loading an image on this page.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I also consider myself somewhat reasonable.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Like, I understand during a storm there's probably going to be some type of outages.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Why? It's all underground.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Well, it seems like it doesn't, somehow the water leaks in or something, I don't know.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Because it seems like every time there's a storm, that's when something goes wrong.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
But anyway, so far, so good tonight, knock on wood.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000
But live listeners, if we suddenly disappear and don't come back, you can blame that storm.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I, of course, I always have, like, Bobby or...

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It's not windy, though.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Somebody on the vog side, I can text if something really bad happens.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Usually it's the wind that would cause anything to be interrupted.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
But it's not windy outside right now.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Not yet. I thought it was supposed to be.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
The other day it was.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I think it's supposed to be worse up the hill a little bit.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Where we are in the valley, it's not so bad. But anyway.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Apparently power's out in the Thomas right now.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Is it really?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Oh, sorry, that was two hours ago. Not bad.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Well, knock on wood, because that's not that far away.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Well, yeah. But...

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
All right. Well, anyhow, we're gonna do our best and try to get back into some more.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
AkumaJP in chat says, wow, snowstorm here, too.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Again, I heard it's snowing back on the East Coast, too.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
You know, and again, I'm just saying, it's a big storm by California measures.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And our infrastructure's only built to hold so much.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
If we had the type of snowstorm that happened back East, shit, the city would be...

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
The city would be shut down for a week.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
State of emergency.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Yeah. Remember that storm of the century we were supposed to get last year?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It's crazy.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
When?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Anyway. Yeah, right? It, like, never happened.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
They kept saying, it's gonna be the biggest storm that's ever hit Sacramento. Oh, my God.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
It really didn't happen.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Anyway, you guys don't care about the weather. You do care about video game news.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Let's get back into some rapid-fire news. Loki.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.000
All right, so John Romero decided to slum it a little bit and create a new level for Doom.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And so he has a brand-new level that you can actually check out.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
They even have a link on Dropbox for it.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Just look, I'm sorry, if you do a Google search, you'll be able to find it.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It's, I guess, an interpretation of the level from Episode 1, Map 8, Phobos Anomaly.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000
And so, I don't know, he created something new. Cool.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I guess check it out. Free.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Also, Earth Defense Force 4.1, the game that I bought accidentally because I thought someone was gonna play with me.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But that didn't end up happening.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Oh, come on. It's Earth Defense Force.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It's okay. I'm not as into it as I was 2017 or Instant Garmageddon, but it's all right.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.000
But I can download this level pack that's got 26 new levels for $10.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And they also have a second pack that's gonna be coming out later on.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Their DLC is really expensive and it's not that great, but let me check out the level pack.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
New levels are kinda cool.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
So that'll be coming out next week.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And in Fallout 4 is gonna be getting some updates soon.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
1.3, which is now in beta on Steam.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And some of the fixes for that, one of the things is it fixes MacCready's killshot perk, which calculates headshot percentages properly.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Before, it was supposed to add 20% to, I think, the amount that it calculates for headshots.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So 20% better than what you normally get.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I think currently what the game is set at is it's 2000%.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
So you pretty much always get a headshot.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
He's my next companion and I'm gonna max out so I can get that ridiculous perk.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Also, they are fixing some issues with the workshop, being able to snap pieces together a little bit better.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
There's an issue where you could become dismembered while still alive.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And also, they're gonna be doing some fixes for ambient inclusion settings, some new debris effects if you have an Nvidia card, and general memory and stability improvements.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And you were telling me before the show tonight, I have to get Fallout 4.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
You do, it's fun. It's very Skyrim-ish.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Well, and that's honestly more than, I mean, don't get me wrong, I do need to play Fallout 4 at some point, you know, because I usually am into those types of games, at least for a little bit.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
But Alan is really the one that really gets into it.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Yeah, does he have it yet?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:56.000
He doesn't because he's, I think he, like this is the first week in a while where I don't think I've seen him playing much Skyrim.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I don't know if he finally beat every piece of content or what happened.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Oh, no he's not. It's impossible to do that.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Well, you know, besides the randomly generated stuff or whatever.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Well, then I'm talking about like with all the mods and stuff.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah, it's true.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah, it's impossible.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Or I don't know if it's because maybe Diablo 3 kind of brought him back or whatever, but he was going to wait on Fallout 4 until some of that mod stuff was really up to speed.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
So I think he's going to wait a little longer.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I think he was, his thing was he was waiting for like the actual official mod tools to come out and that type of thing.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
That'll help too, for sure.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on. I've got some stories as well.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Let's talk about a new Mario Maker costume.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
They're still coming and this one's pretty cool. It's a Daisy costume.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
A Daisy costume was released in Super Mario Maker this week.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I actually did pick it up and yeah, I love that this game is still pumping out all these different costumes.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
It's pretty cool.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
So yeah, you can check out Daisy and she is available now in the game.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Of course, you have to play one of these special stage levels in order to unlock her.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
She's not, you don't have to pay 99 cents or anything like that.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Just go into the courses and look at the event courses and she's there, along with a lot of other stuff we've talked about in recent weeks.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Are you a fan of Yokai Watch?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Well, guess what? A new game on the Nintendo 3DS for Yokai Watch is coming out on April 2nd in Japan.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Yokai Watch Three Kingdoms is coming out in Japan on April 2nd.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
This game is a collaboration with Koei Tecmo.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.000
If you purchase the game in Japan, you will get a Commander Legendary Medal for Komasan.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
The first print run of the game also has a figure strap for Komasan.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And if you get the digital version instead, you get a Bucinyan that joins you in the game as a partner.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000
So I'm sure, actually it seems like Yokai Watch is doing pretty decent over here.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I see a lot of the stuff at Toys R Us for it.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I know some kids that are kind of getting into it, so it seems like Yokai Watch is doing pretty well over here.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
But my understanding in Japan, it's really big.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
So I know they're very excited, I'm sure, about this game, Yokai Watch Three Kingdoms.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Also, a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Remember we talked last week on the show about the trademark that Sony was trying to get for Let's Play?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Well, there was a lawyer who runs this website. It's Ryan Morris on Law.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Oh yeah, the game lawyer guy.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yeah, the game lawyer guy. He actually wrote this whole thing about how this is a lot worse than people were making it sound last week.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And basically saying that the application has only been blocked.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
It wasn't denied, it was just blocked because it was similar to a registered trademark.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
But they have not refused or denied the application.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And so what will happen here, he goes on to say,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000
If SCEA tries to circumvent the current office action holding it up, many attorneys, including myself, will oppose it.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I'm not worried about SCEA ever being granted this mark.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
What I am worried about is the application itself.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
It shows someone at SCEA in charge of filing trademarks does not understand the gaming industry at all.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000
And this was a sketchy, in my opinion, attempt to control a hugely popular genre of entertainment.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000
You can read more on this guy's website. That's all an excerpt from his website, ryanmorrisonlaw.com.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Let's go to a few more. DarkSakura.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I was just absolutely transfixed by this one GTA mod.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It's the Lemmy mod. The Lemmy Tribute GTA 5 mod.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Where you can play as Lemmy from Motorhead.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Basically, what he can do in there is that he can smoke.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
He can drink. He can spawn hookers.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
He has his motorcycle. He has a guitar. He can play.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Yeah, it's just pretty awesome.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
That might make me play GTA 5 if I can play as Lemmy.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Also, and I watched this when it came out because I'm a big fan of Man at Arms and Man at Arms Reforged.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000
In fact, I got into their little fan community group that is run by one of the guys there on Facebook.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Really, really cool people.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
But they made Pyramid Head's Great Knife.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Except they didn't do the Silent Hill 2 Great Knife.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
They did the Boogeyman Blade from Silent Hill Homecoming.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
That basically looks like a ginormous combat knife.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Which I would have preferred the Silent Hill 2 one.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
But this one, I can see, they explained why they went with it.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
They showed some of the different models.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:40.000
They have a functioning ginormous great knife that was tearing shit apart.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
It was pretty cool.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Actually, my favorite thing is that they've done a lot of video game blades.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
They've done Link's Shield. They've done the Master Sword.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000
They've done the key blades.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
They've done both the first key blade and the Oathbreaker.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
They've also done, my favorite one that they did is the Scissor Sword from Kill la Kill.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Where they melted scissors to make the blade.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
That was pretty cool.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Wow.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yeah, some of these, this one was done out of, I believe it was done on a train track.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Just slag train track and forged.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
They've done Sephiroth's Katana.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
They've done Katana's blades.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Instead of Katana, yeah anyway.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
But they did her fans.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Her fan blades?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Yeah.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So they've done a lot of really cool stuff.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And the more that you request something, the better chance there is.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I wanna say a functioning gun blade.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
They've done a gun blade.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
It doesn't shoot, however, it will...

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
However it would be questioned at airport security.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:54.000
But they've actually done, in fact, they worked with, there's another one, the fan builds people.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000
They worked to make a wedding gift that was an ultra head knife block.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And all of the knives are, there was Auron's Katana.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
There was Sephiroth's Katana.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
There's the gun blade.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And, fuck, one more I can't remember.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
You know what though?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
If that Katana fan blade can't actually lift people into the air, then it's worthless.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Let's be real.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Well, I'm forgetting what the fourth one is, but then they went back and they made all of those swords like for real.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Wow.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I'm really impressed with them.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And the guys that are doing the current iteration of it, they're the nicest guys.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I've actually gotten a little bit of advice because I was kind of interested in learning how to forge scissors.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
But anyway, so not meaning to go off on that, but they're just really cool people.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
No, you totally gave them a free ad on the show.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
It's cool.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I would love to have them on the show.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It would be even better if Man of Arms from He-Man was a part of that team as well.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You just want them to make you a weapon is what you really want, Dark Soccer.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
You want a complimentary weapon.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Giant red bat.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:07.000
By the way, in Fallout 4, you can get what they call a swatter, which is basically a giant red bat, and you can put nails in it and stuff like that.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I'll go back in there and get on the super fan builds. I found the video.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
What is your dream weapon, Dark Soccer?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
If you could have them make any weapon in the world, what would you want?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Honestly, I don't know.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
There is one that I would like for them to make on their show.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Not for me, but I'd like to see it made.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Just because every time they do the katana, they have this one guy named Elia who is really good at traditional Japanese sword making techniques.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And so he will go into detail explaining things on katana building and everything.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And I would love to see how they do a cutting edge on a reverse-bladed sword.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I would really like to see how that's managed.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But anyway, that's just me fangirling.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Alright, enough about weapons.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I'm going to find out what that other blade is. I can't remember, by the way.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
But anyway, so John St. John, we know him, right?

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Duke Nukem, the voice actor anyway.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:16.000
He got approached to be the voice of the ad campaign for a, quote, leading GOP candidate for president, end quote.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
And he said, no.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And this is what he said why.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I don't like to turn down jobs, especially when it's a national ad campaign that pays pretty well.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:34.000
But I have a conscience and could not accept a gig to be the advertising voice of the Republican Party's leading candidate for president.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Thanks for the kind offer, but I will sleep just fine at night knowing I made a choice I can live with.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Really, the only candidate that he would have been perfect for is like Arnold Schwarzenegger running for something.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Actually, Arnold Schwarzenegger would just do his own voice.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Which is ironic because Arnold Schwarzenegger, I don't know if you guys know this, you know that guy who's leading in the Republican stuff right now.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
You know he used to have a TV show on NBC. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the new head of that show.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Thank you for reminding me. I do need to watch. Has that started yet?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
No.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
By the way, the other blade was the Buster Sword.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I don't even think it's filmed yet.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
It was Cloud Sword.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
But they announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger is the new.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Yes, and I totally need to watch it now because of that.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Because you know instead of you're fired, it's going to be you're terminated.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I don't care. I fully expect that level of cheesiness. And that's why I come to watch that show.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
It's not because it's quality TV, let's be honest. Any of those like reality shows, no.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Hot garbage.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It's all garbage and it's just, I can't wait to see that.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Sometimes you eat fast food even though you damn well know it's bad for you.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I do that almost every day.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Don't eat Taco Bell because you're clearly Mexican.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
So I did decide though which of the blades they've made that I would actually want to keep.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I'm still thinking about it and I've decided the one I would want to keep for myself would be they remade the Hattori Hanzo Sword from Kill Bill.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I would want that one for the collection.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, terminated, but keep up your work ethic and you'll be back.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:10.000
No seriously though, it's like, don't get me wrong, I like Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he has some pretty awesome catch phrases and stuff.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:17.000
But he really tries hard to work that shit into every single quote or interview or whatever.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
It's like dude, come up with something new.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Do something new. He doesn't have to be always like, I'll be back and all that shit.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
It's just something different.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I like Arnold as an actor.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Dot, dot, dot.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Alright, let's get into the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we call it FUGL.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000
That is the place to be if you want to participate with the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Such as our question this week.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And this week we wanted to ask you guys about the Pokemons.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Because this year there are many ways to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Pokemon.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
How do you feel about Pokemon 20 years after its debut?

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Are you a fan or have you never cared for the franchise?

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Tell us why.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
So, act deaf starting us off on Google Plus tonight saying, old.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
That's how I feel.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
In all seriousness, I'm still a very big fan.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I've played every single generation in lots of the spinoffs.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And I'm totally looking forward to playing Pokken and Pokemon Go this year.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Prince Peach Fuzz says, 20 years? Really?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I love the original red, green and blue.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I remember being hella excited attempting the missing no hack.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Can't wait for Pokemon Go.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Over on Facebook we have some answers as well.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Including Bryce H starting us off saying, I'm a 23 year old.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Who is not afraid to admit he's a fan of Pokemon.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Played every game and I'm having trouble believing that Pokemon is 20.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I remember starting Pokemon Red for the first time.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And that feeling of beating the elite for the first time is one I will never forget.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I'm certainly glad Pokemon has lasted as long as it has.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Because now my 3 year old son gets to enjoy it just like I have.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Degenerate Johnny who's requesting I read this in an old man voice if possible.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I don't know. Should I subject everybody to that?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Wouldn't that just be my normal voice? Ha ha ha.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
That's what grandpa would say.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
No, Rob.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Gosh darn gee willikers you young whippersnappers.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I remember the day Pokemon came out like it was yesterday.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
It was before the days of hashtag.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
And it was called the pound sign. Used mostly for operators and 900 numbers.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I was always more southern than old.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Just roll with me here.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I was always a fan of those cuddly companions as if they were my own children.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Except for Ditto.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000
That sex craving lunatics family portrait looks like a Pokemon diversity assistance brochure.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.000
To this day I'm still catching them all and will continue to do so even after this old crippled body has failed me.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
My ghost will want to be the very best like no.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Okay I'll stop. You're never too old to catch them all.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Wink wink. Nudge nudge.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I just have one word for you.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Lick tongue.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Fabrice A. replies to us on Facebook saying,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I've never played Pokemon back in the day because like most I had to choose what console to get.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
After I got a DS I wanted to try it but I have no idea on what Pokemon game to start with.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Andy R. says, I still have nostalgia for the older games and I've played one of the main games of each gen.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But honestly I felt like the last few have been bad.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Why it was terrible and why is only slightly better.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I've only got four or five badges in each before I stop caring.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I will say though I've been enjoying Pokemon P-Cross even if it has gigantic paywalls which really invalidate the claim that the game is free to play.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Fifth Dream says, I've been a fan of Pokemon since day one.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I watched the anime for a long time and have been playing since Blue came out.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I've played every generation of the games and love them.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I even have a bunch of toys and plushies which I probably shouldn't admit since I'm 41 years old but it shows what a fan I am.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Okay, Fifth Dream, I'm gonna help you rest easy.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Own it.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I'm 37 so I remember when Pokemon first came out very very well.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And I more got into the anime than I did the games.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And I even dressed up as Ash one year for Halloween.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And I remember going to see the movie in the theaters and me and my friend were the only ones in the entire theater.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
So we were imitating the Pokemon at the top of our lungs and we were having a great time.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So I agree with our saga. Just own it.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
It is what it is.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And yeah, good memories.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Anyway, Silent Tom says, I still think the franchise is great.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I haven't played them much past the original Red, Blue, and Yellow but have fond memories.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:58.000
My hometown changed the name of the city for a day back in 1998 from Topika to Topikachu.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I'm laughing at how stupid that is.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I'm sorry.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
That's so stupid. I love it.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I had a plane drop a bunch of Pokemon swag.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
It was a good time to say the least.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Oh my god, that's amazing.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Redtertainment replies and says, 20 years? Fuck, now I feel old.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Thanks, Pikachu.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Jordan T, finally, someone responding saying no.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Saying, I've never played a Pokemon game.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I figured I've gone this long without it.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Okay, I'll stop trying to justify it and go sit in the corner.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Hey, that's okay.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
You know what, sometimes we don't have time to play everything.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Last but not least, Veronica Isabelle over on Facebook says,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I saw a commercial for the original US Blue version.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It was instantly hooked and I've been playing it ever since.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Excuse me.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Even though I haven't finished White 2 or X, I bought a copy of Alpha Sapphire

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
and I plan on buying Yellow on the Virtual Console for a news-lock challenge.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I watched the anime back in the day and still remember the first episode I ever watched,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Island of the Giant Pokemon.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I played the trading card game and even had it on Game Boy and Virtual Console

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
and was mildly disappointed you couldn't play two-player on Virtual Console.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I remember getting excited and downloading the demo for Pokemon Rumble.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
As soon as I found out about it and have played every game in the series,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I hated Pokemon Rumble U.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I have all of the third version games except for Emerald

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
because I thought Sapphire was boring when it was over.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I had to force myself to pay attention to the Pokemon Advance series

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
when it was on Saturday morning cartoons on Kids WB.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Well, even though it sounds like there's a few games here and there she didn't care for,

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Veronica Isabelle definitely a long-time fan of Pokemon.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Great answers, you guys. Thanks so much.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Checking in studio real quick, your thoughts on Pokemon 20 years later.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Dark Sakura, you were always more a Digimon girl.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I was a Digimon girl.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Did you resent Pokemon for that or?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
No, why would I?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I don't know. Just checking.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I really hated, because keep in mind it was one again that I started watching in Japanese with the anime

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and I couldn't stand really watching it in English.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
It kind of made me bristle a little bit.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
As it happens with anything that I start off watching in Japanese first.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I'm the same way with Digimon.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:22.000
So, I remembered having the Japanese theme song memorized

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
and I had all those copies of the movies, remember?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Oh, yeah.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
And I didn't really get, though, too much into the game so much.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I mean, I tried to play them and it was kind of boring.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Bonds006 in chat says, I would rename my Pokemon to Digimon names.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
You could do that.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Loki, thoughts on Pokemon 20 years later?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I never played any of them.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
So, you're like that guy on Facebook. He's not alone.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I mean, it's honestly, I just never got into it.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And I'm sure I've seen at least one episode of the anime, but I just couldn't really get interested in it.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
And I don't know. It's just not a game I've played, unfortunately.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Fifth Dream in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000
First I heard a Pokemon is when the kids were having seizures from the anime.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Oh, yeah. Pokemon was a bit infamous for that.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
They never aired that episode in the U.S.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
That one or the one where James has the boobs.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
They never aired that episode either.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
They really should.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000
On top of that, they weren't really, the beach episode was freaking hilarious with the beauty contest.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I'm sorry. That was a funny freaking episode.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I have Pokemon Blue.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Got it when it came out because it sounded like a neat RPG concept.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And then babies started getting them on their blankets and I left forever.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
All right. That's it for the Fugu question of the week.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Let's get back into some other news. Loki.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:51.000
All right. So, it's not Pokemon, but we talked last week about VR and how there was going to be,

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
they're announcing the price and release dates for the Oculus Rift.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Well, now we've got some information about the HTC Vive.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Pre-order it and begin on February 29th.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And that's all we know about it so far.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
No price point has been announced yet, but hey, we'll figure that out before or on the 29th of February.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
So, they are also going to keep it a surprise right up until the last minute.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Surprise.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Surprise. It's $600.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Well, I think a little bit less, you know, the HTC Vive, that was always supposed to be more expensive anyways.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
So, we'll see. I mean, if it's around the same price point as the Rift, it won't be as shocking.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I don't know. I guess we'll have to find out soon enough.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:38.000
All right. Well, let's go to another story, except I closed my window.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Awkward. Dark Soccer, can you do whatever you had up on the mailbox?

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Is the mailbox next?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Yeah.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Ah. No, you had a – never mind. I found my place. Live Radio, super awkward.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Oh, yeah, I did have one of the awesome games done quick.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Go ahead.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
All right. Well, it took me a moment because whatever.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:03.000
So, awesome games done quick raised $1.2 million over that for the Prevent Cancer Foundation,

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:09.000
which, as we've learned after it was done, cancer's a fucker. So.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Well, to be fair, I think a lot of us understood that to be true beforehand.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Well, yeah, but it's been really, really chill.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Cancer is good at killing people because it's cancer, not can't-cer.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Okay, that was really bad.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
They also – yeah, some of the speedruns they did was, of course, Super Mario 64, Diablo Fest,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Belunky, Hudson Hawk, Super Mario Maker. They also did Rocky and Bully.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
How would you speedrun Super Mario Maker?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I don't know.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I think it was certain pre-selected levels.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Yeah.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Remember, because we did talk about – we talked about this a lot last week a little bit as well.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
They were not pre-selected. They were selected.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
But we mentioned StepMania was one of the things they did. Remember we talked about that last week?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Yeah.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And that was more an exhibition.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Yeah, and that was like people who could do like so many keystrokes per second and be accurate.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
It was pretty cool.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yeah.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:08.000
So the next Awesome Games Done Quick is Summer Games Done Quick, which is June 3rd through 9th in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
So there you go.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
One thing I wanted to point out with that piece of information you had,

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
because we did already talk a little bit about Awesome Games Done Quick last week,

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:24.000
but that particular article had a link to more stats about like what games got what donations when.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
And I thought that was really fascinating to kind of see like, you know, what people were really into.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Of course, more donations seem to come in at the end because everybody's a procrastinator.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
So I don't know if you can really say like, oh, this game was better than this game or whatever.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000
But I thought it was very interesting to see that and like the Twitch viewership and all that.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
For a stats nerd, there's a lot to chew on with that.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Always the Super Metroid races are pretty good.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Well, yeah, and those are the ones that are like really highly watched, too.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
And people vote for kill the animals or save the animals.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Oh, yeah, that's a huge deal, obviously.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
They did a lot of voting this year. It wasn't just that.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
You could vote on what are you going to name the character in Final Fantasy IV and all this other crazy stuff.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.000
They had this big one where they were, yeah, where they were either naming him Arby's or Biff.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.000
And like people in France started flooding it because they wanted him to be named Biff.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
It was like naming Edge Biff.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
It was a thing.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And then like they like went to Arby's or something. It was weird.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Did Arby's Twitter actually comment on that? I thought I heard something about that.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Like anyone follows the Arby's Twitter.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Maybe if their food was good.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Arby's and Biff? That sounds like the next Splatfest.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Oh, yeah, they did a Splatoon.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
They did. There was a Past vs. Future was this week. You know who won? Past.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And yet again, it was because Future was more popular, so Past did better.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
That's what happens every Splatfest.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Yeah.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.000
You have to choose the team that is going to be less popular. It's reverse psychology to win those things.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
This is sort of neat, though. If you go over the thing, they were saying what, like there's the secret to Mana run

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
and how many viewers at that time and their total they were at at that time.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And it's a pretty neat kind of interactive thing, their little chart here.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Did you know, by the way, I'm going to I'm going to use this little tangent to give a shout out.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Our very own here at Orange Lawn Radio and VOG Network, Flaco Jones, who's been on the show before.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
He is now getting into speedrunning PT.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Oh, how does that happen?

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000
He did it in 13 minutes, which I guess was good enough to be the number three score on speedruns or whatever.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
So I believe this is now a thing for the Flaco household is that he is going.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
He is now a PT speedrunner, but I think that's kind of rad.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
So I just there's so many random elements that.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
But sometimes it's about perfecting the randomness, I guess there's randomness in other games that they do.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So I've been working on my Mario two.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
I don't think I'll ever get as fast as those guys in the video.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000
But do you do the glitches and everything?

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I'm still perfecting how to get through world one one in one fell swoop without stopping.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
So it's something I'm working on. And then I'm starting on one, too.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:15.000
But the hard thing about one, too, is that if you really want to beat it fast, you have to be able to, like, jump on the little flying guys.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
You have to say, you know, how there's that flying carpet in the beginning.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Yeah, you have to be to be like Yolo and jump on the flying guys instead.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I have a hard time doing it, but what I can do is.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I thought that's how people normally.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
No.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Unless you're thinking of something different because you have to, like, use an arrow.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Where you ride the bees, right?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
No.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Or not the bees, but the flappy.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
You skip the carpet and you jump on the guys that are attacking the carpet.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Yeah.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
No, that's not.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
You can do that with the princess.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Yeah.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I guess with Luigi, though, you can get the air you need to totally skip the cave in one, too.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Anyway.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
There we go.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Let's see.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Let's move on.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I finally got my shit together and found that story I was going to talk about, and this

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
is a big one.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
It has to do with Hitman and Hitman.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.000
You may have heard this week that the pre-orders disappeared from the PlayStation Store, and

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
now we know why.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Because there was an announcement that Hitman is going to be a truly episodic AAA game experience.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:21.000
So, on March 11th, the prologue mission and Paris will be released, and then there will

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
be an Italy version in April and Morocco in May.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
From that point onward, you'll get monthly content, including three additional locations.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Thailand, the US, and Japan, until the season ends with the Japanese episode in 2016.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Note, that's not like countries where this is releasing.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
That is countries as part of the story.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
So, why did they do this?

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Studio head Hans Seifert said,

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
We decided to take the full leap and publish Hitman as a truly episodic game experience.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Part of that decision is for a little bit of extra time to ensure every location we

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
release is at the quality level fitting for a Hitman game.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
No.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
But the main driving reason is that this will allow us to create a living game that will

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
expand and evolve over time and will establish a foundation for the future.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000
This is the first game in a storyline which will continue and expand with future Hitman

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
games.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Here's the price.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
The intro pack with prologue in Paris, $15.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Each extra location, $10.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:27.000
But, if you buy the intro pack, you can get the full game with the $50 upgrade pack.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
So, that's $65 altogether.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Loki, you're dying to say something.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Their excuse of like, well, give us extra time to make sure the rest of those levels

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
are polished.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
No, you don't just fucking release your game until all that shit is done.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
That's how you do it.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
You don't just like, oh, well, shit, we can't release this, we have to release this as episodic

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
because parts of the game aren't done.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
That means your game is not done.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
You don't release it.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
But, Loki, the fiscal year ends in April.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Who gives a fuck?

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
You finish your shit.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
This is the problem with the games industry.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
It's just, they don't finish their shit and they release it as is, as episodic or something,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:04.000
so that you can play little bits of the game and then pay more than fucking retail on that

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
shit.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Or, as this game, if it were released all at once, it would be just $60.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
But, no, it's $65 now.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
You know, and I think that's what I'll do.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I'm gonna wait until every piece is out, and then I'll see how people enjoy it.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I'll wait for the Game of the Year edition to come out.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Yeah, the inevitable $40 Game of the Year.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Oh, no, Steam sale, $7.43 to get everything.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Or, hell, you know, with the case with a lot of these Square Enix games, they'll just be free

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
as part of, like, PlayStation Plus or something.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
God, can you imagine if a game like Super Mario Brothers did that, where it's like,

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:45.000
here's worlds one through three, and that's it, until next month, when you're gonna get

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
worlds four through six.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Like, it's just, what?

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Yeah, here's worlds one through three.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Better buy a Mario amiibo to unlock four through six.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Buy Luigi the, you know, seven through nine.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Yeah, you laugh at that now, but, I mean, seriously, that's what they're fucking doing.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000
They're testing the fucking waters with this stupid one dungeon thing, and you people are

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
fucking buying into this shit because, ooh, the little pretty figurines!

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And then, and then, this shit is gonna be fucking accepted going into the whole NX and

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
stuff, with their fucking cartridge-less system that everything's unlocked with fucking toys.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I hope you, I hope you're proud of yourself, because you are the problem.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
You are the one causing this game industry to go to shit.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Well, I'm glad that they're pretty, and you can't avoid possibly spending money on them.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
I'll buy all the amiibo in the world, but fuck this Hitman shit.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Seriously, fuck the Hitman shit, I'm completely with you on that.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
At least we can agree on something, Luigi.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
If you wanna give me the first episode for free, fucking make this shit shareware, is

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
how it should be fucking...

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Shareware.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Seriously, that's what this fucking is, this is fucking shareware.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
This is where, in the world we are right now, where it's episodic.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
No, it's fucking shareware, you pay a little bit of money for the first episode to see

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
if you like it, and if you do, cool, you buy the full game.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
If you don't, well, you've only, you're out a few bucks.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
So it's Commander, it's Commander Keen all over again.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Except it's fucking $15 instead of five, or free.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
That's the problem.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Or the long-distance fees on the BBS you're connected to.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I don't know, I don't know why I'm getting so upset about it, I don't give a shit about

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Hitman because, like, it's just, it, people keep buying into this stuff, and that's why

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000
our industry is like it is now with season passes and bullshit like this.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Alright, well speaking of season passes, what do you have next for us, Loki?

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:38.000
So anyways, what I have here is Mortal Kombat.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.000
They're gonna be getting this new online match experience, I guess they're doing an overhaul

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.000
on the online for Mortal Kombat X, and with that, they're gonna be putting out a beta

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.000
test for it, so you can, anyone that's spent at least an hour of online play in Mortal

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Kombat X as of January 19th can sign up for the beta, and only four characters will be

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:08.000
included at the start, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Briggs, and Cage, and more will be added as

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:14.000
the test goes on, so what they're doing with this is, I guess, improving the online play

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
experience, I'm not really sure, it's very vague, something that has to do with redoing

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000
the network code and maybe improving lag.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I'm surprised that they're doing this now, since this has been out for a while already,

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000
and now they've decided that, oh hey fuck, we need to retool everything?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Is it because you finished your DLC, is that why?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
It's because you've already, you put all your DLC characters out there, and you sold all

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.000
that, and now you're like, oh well I guess we have time to fix the fucking game that

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
you guys are buying all this DLC for.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
They have to rework things for the inevitable game of the year edition.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Yeah, they're taking a page out of fucking Capcom's book, they released the arcade edition

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000
or some shit like that where they recharge you for the game for balancing shit.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Alright, well let's talk about, hey, since Loki is a huge fan of Amiibo support, let's

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000
talk about a game on the Wii U that supports every single Amiibo, every single one of them

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
is supported in this game.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.000
It's a game that's been developed by Lightwood Games, it's for the Wii U and the 3DS, it's

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
called Word Puzzles.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.000
That's right, Word Puzzles by Paoji, I guess is the full name of the game, it's going

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.000
to allow you to actually use your Amiibo in the game.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Every single Amiibo is supported, even ones that haven't been announced yet.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:40.000
It uses the nickname that you set when you register the Amiibo to generate a unique puzzle

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000
so that whatever Amiibo you tap is unique to you.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:49.000
So essentially, whatever word is stored on your Amiibo, you'll get a whole word search

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
puzzle with just that word.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000
And it's like playing like a Where's Waldo thing, the word only appears there once, but

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000
all the letters or whatever all throughout the word puzzle itself.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:07.000
So, yeah, I mean, but then this makes me think, well, okay, so if I name my Amiibo Fuck Boy,

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I can get an entire puzzle that's just Fuck Boy?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Yeah.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I can see all sorts of dirty puzzles coming out of this thing.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Well, you have all those possibilities, just rename all your Amiibos different things.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Can I name my Amiibo dirty things, or does the Nintendo Police shut me down?

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Oh, I'm sure they'll come and shut you down.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
If I try to put ass in one of those, does it shut me down?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
You get flagged by the police.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Maybe.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I get moderated.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Who knows?

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
All right.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Well, I'll get like a sad Reggie icon appear on the screen.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Here's the thing, though, with all due respect, because, you know, it is an indie developer

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
and so forth.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I don't know, the word puzzle thing, it just doesn't strike me as like the kind of game

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I need to have.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000
If it was something I could play like online with friends to make it a little more exciting,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
maybe I'd be down with that.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I'm pleased that they decided to actually add support for the Amiibos and stuff.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Granted, that it's very limited, but I mean, their game is quite limited as it is.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
So, but props to them for actually doing that.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000
It's nice to know that other indie games can support that.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.000
So, I'm surprised we don't see more indie games supporting that.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000
If I could play online with friends, we can hunt for Fuckboy together.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Like Minecraft.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Minecraft would be awesome.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Like if you get like a skin for your Minecraft character based off of whatever Amiibo that

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
you had scanned in or something like that.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Like if I want to dress up like Mario, I just put Mario on there and away we go.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I mean, that would be cool.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
That would be something that's kind of neat.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Bonce006 over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.000
The Nintendo Police will kick your door in and make you use PC safe words.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Reggie Fils-Aime personally is going to come to my house and punch me in the face.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
That is what's going to happen.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Well, that's almost worth it for that.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
We already visited it earlier in the show, but now it's officially that time where we

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000
open up the mailbag.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Dark Soccer is going to dive in and read the rest of the emails waiting for us this week.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Just chiming in to say Rob's a hater and I love amplitude.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I was waiting for this.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I see where he's coming from, but I don't have any problems with music games introducing

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
me to new music.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Sure, it's nice that there are games like Rock Band that let me play songs I know, but

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I feel like I've more enjoyed finding new music to like from rhythm games.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Not having played the PS2 amplitude though, I guess I don't have a point of comparison,

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
but I really have been enjoying the new one.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.000
I found a few songs I like and I've been trying to get good enough to unlock the super difficulty.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Also, Freak Mode is great.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000
TLDR, thanks Konami, but I'll play rhythm games even without bad covers of Britney Spears'

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
songs and ER.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
PS, at least he's right about Nino Cooney being good.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Thank you.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
At least you cited me on something.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I'm sorry, I tried to play amplitude again and I played this song and it was so bad.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
I'm sorry.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I'm all for new music when the music is really good, but I just think some of the stuff,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000
especially in the amplitude story mode, I think is really unexciting.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I'm sorry.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Some of it I love though, like I like the Crypt of the Necrodancer song and you all

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:35.000
know I love the Freeze Pop song, but I feel like there's a lot of filler.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:41.000
So, I'm sorry, but I love the old amplitude and the old frequency.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Those games are great.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:48.000
We've got a two part email, I think, from Robert M. Actually two emails, I should say.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Starting off in chronological order.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Just a note on last week's show, if you haven't already discussed it, according to sources

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I've seen, Slow Beef, currently half of the satirical channel Retsupre with diabetes,

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.000
is considered one of the fathers of the Let's Play format on YouTube.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Beats me, of course, how the guys from Rooster Teeth get to have a Let's Play as a channel

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
game.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Also, of the games I picked up last Steam sale, I never store my payment info, more

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000
for putting a barrier between myself and the impulse buys rather than for security.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000
The one I've been putting off the most time into a script of the Necrodancer.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Significantly more if you count listening to the soundtrack.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Has anyone there tried the game with an actual dance pad yet?

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Oh god no.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
I'm 37.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000
My DDR days have long passed.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I don't know.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000
That might be too much.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
So here's the next part.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.000
I apologize for not asking Bobby directly again, but from what you currently know, what

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:54.000
is the likelihood that the HTC Vive, or is it Viva or Vive, I guess.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Vive, I think.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:01.000
In addition to using one Steam library on PC, would use or have a SKU that would use

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
the HTC phone, much like the Samsung Gear VR.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Hmm.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Wait, I'm not trying to under-

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I don't think so, no.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I don't think they're going to do like a Gear VR version of HTC Vive.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I don't know why they need to do that when the Gear VR is already a thing that exists,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000
but with all these VR competitors, it's going to be very interesting to see what kind of

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
floats to the top.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
And I sort of think it's going to be the PlayStation VR and the Oculus, and I'm not

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
sure there's a lot of room in the pool for everybody, but we'll see.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I mean, even as those words are leaving my mouth, but then I go, oh, but the Gear VR

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
is a really affordable option, and if Apple made a version of it, that would sell like

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000
crazy too, so maybe there is room in the pool for more.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000
You know what I say, all you kids with your VR shit?

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
I'm going to read a book.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
I'm going to read the newspaper.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
What if you could read a book in VR?

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
No.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I want to read.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000
What if you could read a book on weed?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Bobby Black Wolf, who knows a little more about VR than we do, says HTC is abandoning

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
phones, and if the Vive was going to be cheaper than the Rift, they would have announced it

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000
already.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Try to get that good publicity ahead of schedule.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Last one.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.000
And it's labeled DJ is married to a hockey player.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Okay.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Hello, peoples.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.000
With the upcoming debut of Fuller House on Netflix, the prospect of other somehow beloved

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000
series being updated becomes more and more of a possibility.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000
My question for you is this.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
What video game series would you least like to see updated?

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000
My answer is missed.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
As we saw in the last couple of attempts to release a game in the series, updating this

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
game will lead to the charm of the original being diminished.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Stay black, redertainment, trainer.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I don't know.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Ooh, this is a really good question.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
What series don't you want them to touch?

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I'm assuming because they'll fuck it up is the answer.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Well, we've already seen them do that with Knight Rider a few times.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
I kind of feel like that's all.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
I said game series.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I kind of game series game series.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I feel like that's already happened with blaster master.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Like the original on the NES is so good.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
And then the Genesis one was garbage.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.000
The remake should have been better as much as I would love a guardian legend update.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And there's a fan one in the works, but like an official one.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
They'd have to really make it perfect.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Oh, I have a good answer for this.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Metal Gear Solid.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.000
That is a game that they, or that is a series they should not try to start over

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000
or reboot because a certain person is not affiliated with a certain company anymore.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.000
And for that matter, they probably shouldn't make, they shouldn't do a

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Castlevania remake either while we're at it.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Let's just be real.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Those games are never going to be as good as they were on the PlayStation or on

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
the Super Nintendo or even the NES.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I think, I think those are my answers right there.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.000

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
All right. That was it for emails.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
That was it.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
All right. If you want to send emails next week, participate at orange

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
lounge radio.com is the place to send those emails.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
All this is bad.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Here is justice.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Here is punishment.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Here.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
This is fucked up.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Garsakra?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:47.000
FU goes to the governor of Michigan for the fuckery with the water and for

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
the state of the schools there.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:58.000
You don't have this opulent center for, uh, I'm trying to remember what

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.000
the place was, but it was like this really gorgeous building while your

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.000
schools have mushrooms growing out of the walls and black mold and moldy

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.000
food being served to children.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I'm sorry.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Fuck you.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
You need to get fired and also the same to the lady who's running the, um,

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
democratic national convention.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Cause you're also stupid.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I'm done.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Loki, um, just after you did my new schedule, because it makes it difficult

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
for me to eat or purchase food that normally would eat during the week.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Like I used to do like sandwiches and stuff, and now I've been having to be

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000
forced to go to McDonald's because it's the closest fast food place to my

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
work.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
And I really don't like eating that shit.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000
And I would think about going across the street, the subway, but we had

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
subway catered at our work the other day and it was fucking nasty.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000
So it's like, uh, I don't know.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Um, my FU of the week, uh, I don't know.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Things have been going relatively well.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I would say FU for the power outage.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
That was shitty.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Um, even though dark soccer is, you know, FU, this kind of pales in

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
comparison to that.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
It was awfully inconvenient, uh, where I work this week.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000
We couldn't drink the water for two days because there was a whole, uh,

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
scare about whatever bacteria causes E. coli or whatever.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
So that was very inconvenient.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Oh God.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
My fucking wife seriously did this shit.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Like she does these things every now and then where like,

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
and I have to indulge her and I really even live in the affected area.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Exactly.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Exactly.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
And I had to go out in the fucking night to go purchase a fucking case

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
of water for no fucking reason.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.000
And, and did she fucking use the water that we purchased?

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
No, she's still getting shit out of the fucking tap.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
It's like a fucking waste of my time.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Except they did get some Ingress time in there.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
So that's fine because I was out to do that.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
But no, seriously though, I had to go to the store for that shit.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I'm like, dude, that's like in the pocket area.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
That's nowhere fucking near our house.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
We're in a completely separate water district from this shit.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
And she's like, well, I just want to be safe.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Don't you want to take precautions?

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I'm like, oh my fucking God.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000
But I got Ingress time in, so that's all right.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
This is supposed to be my FU.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Sorry.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
FU to Loki for stealing my thunder.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
FU to cancer.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Oh yeah, I have FU to cancer after this week.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
That's every week.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
That goes without saying every single week, I think.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
All right.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Um, let's get...

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Well, I should go ahead and say my goodbyes to...

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Oh yes, it is that time.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Because I have to be at work on a holiday.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I'm sorry.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
But it's money.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Well, who for money?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Well, uh, DarkStalker, before you leave us tonight,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Um, no. Bye.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Bye.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Bye.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
All right, let's get into a couple more stories,

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
If you want to take DarkStalker's place here on the show tonight,

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.000
as if anyone could, you can give us a call, 1-877-GAMO-LR,

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
All one word.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
We will be opening up those numbers in a minute,

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
but we have a couple more stories first.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Loki.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000
So, we talked a while back about Vivendi selling off chairs

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000
of Activision, or Activision purchasing that type of thing.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Well, now they have finally sold the remaining chairs

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
of Activision Blizzard for 1.1 billion

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
to some undisclosed financial institute.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000
And basically saying that it was the perfect time

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.000
to unload 5.7% of the chairs they retain

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000
as a soccer call of duty in World of Warcraft.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.000
The company had risen by 90% in the last year.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.000
So, yay, we don't have to hear about Vivendi games.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
What do you think this might mean for the future,

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
especially when Activision and Blizzard have all these...

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
That sold to Jugglords.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Have all these products.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I don't think it means much of anything, to be honest,

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
other than just changing hands.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
They're not owned by Vivendi anymore.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
They're not owned by the man.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Or a portion of them is not owned by them.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I don't think it's going to make any sort of difference.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000
All right. Well, last but not least,

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
another anniversary note to close on.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
But this one's about Dragon Quest.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:13.000
And this year is the 30th anniversary of Dragon Quest in Japan.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000
And Square Enix is going to be going all out for a celebration.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
And there was a live press event that happened this week

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
where series creator Yuji Horii and producer Ryutaro Ichimura

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.000
talked about how Square Enix will be celebrating Dragon Quest.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
First off will be Dragon Quest Builders

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.000
for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita on January 28th.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And then Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 3 on the 3DS follows in March.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And then Dragon Quest Heroes 2 in May

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
But again, remember, these are all Japanese information,

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.000
so we don't know about what's going to happen in the U.S.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
There was no date announced for Dragon Quest XI,

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
no trailer screenshots or any of that

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
for this anticipated 3DS or PlayStation 4 title.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
But that is what they got in Japan this week.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Nothing about the U.S. or if we will ever get that Dragon Quest Theatrhythm game.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
But the answer, unfortunately, is probably not fucking likely,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000
which is really sad because I really want that game.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
But I guess I'd have to get a Japanese 3DS and import it

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
if I really want it that bad.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
All right, that's it. Skypline is open for your calls.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
All one word. The Skypline is open.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000
While we wait for some calls to come in, let me check in with Loki

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
and see if there's any last-minute stories tonight.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
No, not really.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Not really?

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000
No. I did notice that the new Humble Bundle, though,

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
that's out now is the Full Motion Video Humble Bundle.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Did you see that?

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Oh, yeah, I saw something like that with roundabouts in that, right?

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Roundabouts in it, yeah, I don't really give a shit about that

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
because I already have it on PlayStation 4,

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
but I do want 7th Guest in 11th Hour, so I may have to purchase...

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
That's in there? I love those games.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
That's in the dollar tier as well.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Yeah, and there's Steam versions of the game,

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
so I will be purchasing that just for that.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
That's pretty awesome.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Although, I have a bad feeling those are games that were way better.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Yes, they were.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
You try to play them now, it's like, okay, this is really hard to play.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Is Phantasmagoria in the bundle?

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
It is not. It is...

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I want to say there was...

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Let me see here. I'm going to bring it back up here.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
There was the, I think, a Tex Murphy game.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
And what else was it?

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000
That fucking shootout game that they always...

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Like Mad Dog McCree or whatever, because that was on the Wii, right?

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I don't think Mad Dog McCree was...

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
They had Tex Murphy, the Complete Pack,

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Tesla Effect, Tex Murphy Adventure,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
7th Guest in 11th Hour Pack,

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Missing and Interactive Thriller Episode 1.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
That's all part of the dollar tier.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
$5 or more to get roundabout and Her Story, which apparently is pretty good.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Oh yeah, I've heard Her Story is pretty good.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Yeah, but it's not really a full motion video game,

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
but I understand why they did that.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Huh, that's interesting.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
And the weekly bundles, I don't think they add other stuff to that later on.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
So, yeah.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
I do want 7th Guest. I'll buy that for it all.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
That isn't the official bundle of the now,

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
but it's the Humble Weekly Bundle, because they do different bundles.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
It's confusing.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says it's missing the Christopher Walken

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
full motion video game.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Ripper, no sale.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Another shout out for our skype line.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on skype.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000
You know what other important full motion video game it's missing?

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.000
SimCity on CD-ROM.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Oh my god, that'd be awesome.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
The amazing cutaways with the weather reports.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
You know, aren't they supposed to be doing that thing now

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
with EA's Origin or whatever,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
where they're supposed to be having a monthly service

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
that you can play all these games

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
like any game that they have?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
I thought that was the thing on Xbox One.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
No, they're doing something now that's actually going to be

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
on PC as part of Origin.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
You pay like 15 bucks a month

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
and you get unlimited games, basically.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I wonder if they would bring SimCity back.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
You know, the old SimCity.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
If they would bring the SimCity on CD-ROM back,

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I would so be there. Is anyone from EA or Origin listening?

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
That's the one thing I want.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Do they have an abandonware yet?

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Like where you can download the...

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
You know, I haven't really tried looking.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
I'm not willing to pay for it.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I'm not willing to pay a lot for it,

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
but I wouldn't pay for it if it would go up.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Tigerclaw is pointing out it's called Origin Access,

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
is the name of that program.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Yeah, we didn't even talk about that.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
But that's something that they're doing as well.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Origin Access, where you can pay 15 bucks a month

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
and you get...

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I don't know if it's all the games

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
or if they're going to do it like the EA Access thing

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
where you can basically have access

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
to different games in their library.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
No, I hadn't heard about that.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
All right, I'm going to put only one more

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
request for calls out there.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
I get the sense we have a little bit less

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
of a live audience than we usually do tonight.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
The three-day weekend probably coming into play,

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
I think. You've got some people that are probably out of town.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Oh, I'm sorry. It wasn't 15 a month.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
It's $5 a month.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Oh, wow. That's really not bad.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
You get access to a growing collection of PC games

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
plus 10% off of Origin purchases.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
So it's really like

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
all the crap that's five years old or more

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
is in the $5 bundle.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
I think it's all the crap that they gave away for free

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
like Dragon Age. Well, they have

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Dragon Age Inquisition, Battlefield,

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Hardline. Dragon Age Inquisition

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
is kind of a good game.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Well, no, I'm not saying that they're crap.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
I think a lot of the games are the ones

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
they were giving away for free already, like Battlefield 3,

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Hardline they haven't done yet.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
All right.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
One more shout-out. 1-877-GAMEO-LR

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Otherwise, I guess

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
we're going to end up wrapping up early, but

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
for a three-day weekend again.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
More Ingress time, I guess. Yeah, I saw you over there

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
plotting your road home and what damage

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
you're going to cause on the way.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I already have.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
I'm trying to, obviously, I'm not going to

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
shout everything out on the air where you're going, but okay.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Oh, looking for some fields to close.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Yep.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Awesome. All right. Well, the Skype line

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
isn't lighting up, so I guess

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
If for whatever reason you were just feeling

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
shy tonight, you can always email us.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
is the place to do that. Especially, we'd love to hear

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
from more of you that only participate with the podcast.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
You know, I love the live audience, but

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
I know there's many of you out there who

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
have been listening for a while, who've never reached out and said

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
hello. Please feel free to say hello.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
This is the time to do that.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
or you can also give us a shout on Twitter.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I do read everything that goes to

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
the O-L-R Twitter, even if

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I don't always. I usually, I'll write a

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
response if it necessitates one, even if

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
I don't always read them on air. Sorry about that.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Alright, that's going to do it

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
appreciate all those reviews. Those go

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
a really long way for support.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Trust me on that.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Well, before we wrap it up, we have to get everybody's

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
final thought for the night. So,

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
my final thought for the night will be that

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I did pretty much

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
finish, I have just one little drop of that liquor

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
left at Dark Sakura and

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
it actually did hold up really well for

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
however long that was in the fridge, like three months.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
So, kudos to Dark Sakura's

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
brewing factory for that.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Even if I didn't really feel the effects

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
of that too much tonight, but if I

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
seem to ramble excessively, more so

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
than usual tonight, you can blame that.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Loki, how about your final thought tonight?

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
My final thought is I tried working on the game

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
this week. I did get a

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
little bit of programming done, but it's just not

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
as much as I'd like.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I'm just trying to figure out what I need to cut

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
feature-wise to get what

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
I want done. I was trying to do the high score

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
thing, but that's been taking forever.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
I haven't get enough

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
free time to where I'm actually conscious enough

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
to work on the game, especially after I get

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
home and have to deal with the kids. It's just

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
at night, not working, and during the day,

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
not working out. Note to self,

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I need to get Gabe and

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Bree from the SAC IGDA

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
back here to yell at you about that whole

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
game situation, because I know they have

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
another event. They're going to a bigger venue

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
this year. But what? Doesn't he do that as

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
his day job? I mean, if I was fucking doing

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
this as my day job, I would be...

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I don't think that is his day job.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
I think it's a labor of love, I think.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Kind of like how this podcast is.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I don't know. I could go back to my old game

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I was working on, but I want to get this done at least.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Something done on this.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
You can do it. We believe in you.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
of Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again everybody

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
seven days to do it all

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
over again. Good night.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
But you know they were all

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
still true.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
See you next week.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Thank you.
